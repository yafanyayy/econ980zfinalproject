Today, I'm pleased to share The Coca-Cola Company continues to operate from a position of real strength. Our brands continue to get stronger.

Today, I'm pleased to share The Coca-Cola Company continues to operate from a position of real strength. Our brands continue to get stronger. Our strategies continue to be sound, and our execution continues to be focused and effective. Our business continues to drive sustainable growth and continues to bring us closer to achieving our 2020 Vision. One day, one week, one month and one quarter at a time. Thanks to the extraordinary determination and resolve of our 146,000 company associates around the world, we delivered volume and revenue growth this quarter in every one of our 5 geographic operating groups. And we achieved financial results for both the quarter and the full year in line with or ahead of our long-term growth targets, making this the seventh consecutive quarter we have either met or exceeded our long-term growth targets. 
Our Global Sparkling Beverage portfolio kept growing, up 2% for the quarter and a solid 4% for the full year. Our Global Still Beverage portfolio is also performing well, up 6% for the quarter and a strong 8% for the full year. And we gained global volume and value share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages, while also gaining global share in both sparkling and still beverage categories. We achieved these results for both the quarter and the full year against the backdrop of a volatile global economic landscape. Even as we believe that the unease in the global markets will continue in the near term, the breadth of our global footprint and the strength of our brands create a business that was built for times like these, resilient and resolute to grow. 
Our solid performance in 2011 reflects the consistent investments we have made over time to strengthen the health of our brands starting with brand Coca-Cola, the very oxygen of our business up 3% in both the quarter and the full year. In fact, brand Coca-Cola grew by at least 24 million servings in 24 different countries in this past quarter. Our brand health and brand value have been created over the long-term through strong and consistent investments in our business rather than through short-term incremental actions. And this is why we remain so committed to our long-term brand investment strategies. Our 2011 performance results underscore how our company, together with our global bottling partners, is well aligned and positioned to lead in this difficult environment. 
As we enter into the third year of our 2020 Vision, our roadmap for winning together remains clear to us and our committed bottling partners. The assumptions that shape our vision have not changed. Our expectations for strong performance have not wavered. The key to our calculus for growth and achieving our 2020 Vision will be to ensure that we keep creating balanced growth across both emerging and developed markets as well as sparkling and still categories. 
We successfully achieved this balance in 2011. For the full year, we delivered almost 1 billion unit cases of incremental organic volume growth or the equivalent of adding another Japan to our business. And importantly, we delivered positive full year growth in key developed markets like North America, Japan and Germany, while also generating double-digit full year growth in key emerging markets like India and China. And we will continue to make significant investments in our future all across the world. In fact, in order to achieve our 2020 Vision, we anticipate our global system will add about 100,000 jobs in this decade as we invest to support the tremendous opportunity we see in nonalcoholic beverages, one of the fastest-growing industries in consumer packaged goods. 
So let's review our fourth quarter and full year results. Worldwide, we grew volume 3% this quarter, in line with our long-term growth target. For the full year, we grew worldwide volume by 5% including the benefit of cross-licensed brands primarily Dr. Pepper in North America. Excluding these brands, we delivered strong full year volume growth of 4%, also in line with our long-term target. As for our profit results, we grew comparable earnings per share by 10% for both the quarter and the full year, ahead of our long-term target. As we close the second year of our 2020 Vision, this also marks the second consecutive year we've delivered double-digit comparable earnings per share growth. 
Now let's briefly review performance results across our operating groups, beginning first with North America where our team remains focused on driving profitable and sustainable growth. North America volume was up 1% in the quarter, making this North America's seventh consecutive quarter of growth. And for the full year, North America's organic volume growth was also up 1%. The North America business gained total market volume and value share in sparkling, still and nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages in both the quarter and the full year, and we delivered these strong results, while in the process of successfully integrating the largest acquisition in our company's history. Our sparkling beverage results in North America were even for the quarter with brand Coca-Cola volume up 1%. We achieved these results while also earning an increase in retail pricing of 4% in sparkling beverages through the effective execution of our occasion-based brand package, price and channel strategies. As for Coke Zero, it was up high single digits in North America this past quarter and up double digits for the full year, making this the fifth consecutive year of double-digit growth. We also drove positive growth for Fanta, which was up 3% in 2011, its second consecutive year of positive growth. Our still beverages in North America delivered 3% growth in the quarter and 4% growth for the full year, while gaining share for the seventh consecutive quarter. POWERADE continues to be a leading driver of the solid growth, up 11% in the quarter and 12% for the full year, and POWERADE, once again captured both volume and value share in the sports drink category, both for the quarter and for the full year. Our key brands delivered double-digit growth in the quarter led by Gold Peak, which grew double digits for the 19th consecutive quarter. As we've always said, there's no other Western developed markets in the world that boast dynamic demographics as those present in North America between now and 2020. Young, vibrant, diverse, educated and entrepreneurial. We like these attributes, and the very reason to remain excited about the long-term outlook of our flagship market. 
Turning now to our Pacific Group where in 2011, our business again delivered consistent growth across a diverse set of markets. Overall, our Pacific Group volume was up 5% in both the quarter and the full year and these results were led by China up double digits in the quarter, and for the full year making this 9 out of the last 10 years that our business in China has delivered double-digit growth. Our efforts to enhance the consumer experience with our sparkling beverage brands keep paying dividends, with sparkling beverages up double digits in China for both the quarter and the full year. Importantly, we are seeing strong growth across our entire Sparkling portfolio with Coca-Cola, Sprite and Fanta all delivering double-digit growth in both the fourth quarter as well as in the full year 2011. At the same time, our Still Beverage portfolio brands are sustaining their solid momentum, also delivering double-digit growth for the full year. These results confirm that we are executing the right strategies and have the right capabilities in place in China to deliver sustainable double-digit growth over the long-term. Japan's fourth quarter results were up 5%, resulting in slightly positive full year growth rounding to even. This is a better-than-anticipated full year results in light of the tragic national disaster that occurred last March. The social underscores the strength and resilience of our people and brands across the entire Japanese bottling system. Notably, we realized greater momentum across several key channels in Japan this quarter, including convenience stores and vending as we further increase our focus on singleserve beverages. 
Moving now to Latin America where in 2011 we once again expanded our volume and value share leadership position. Volume in this total region was up 4% in the quarter and 6% for the full year. This strong performance was once again led by Mexico up 4% for the quarter and 9% for the full year. Our business in Mexico gained volume and value share in both sparkling and still beverages for both the quarter and the full year. In fact, our Still Beverage portfolio in Mexico reached nearly 1 billion unit cases in 2011, short 4 years after the successful integration of the Jugos Del Valle into our winning portfolio. The rapid evolution of our brands in Mexico is a great testament to our team's ability to execute clear occasion-based channel strategies across all beverage categories in this key market. We're also advancing our momentum in Argentina, which delivered double-digit full year growth, while capturing volume and value share in both sparkling and still beverages for the 12th consecutive quarter. And finally, Brazil, volume was up 1% for the full year despite a general slowdown in the economy and unfavorable weather, our business in Brazil keeps outperforming the industry, gaining share across both sparkling and still beverages in both for the quarter as well as for the full year. 
Let's now turn to the Eurasia and Africa Group. In 2011, we made sound progress against our goal to strategically invest for tomorrow, while gaining share today. Volume in this region grew 4% in the quarter and a solid 6% for the full year. Importantly our growth in Eurasia and Africa was driven by the continued strong momentum of brand Coca-Cola up 5% for the quarter and 7% for the full year 2011. Our overall performance in this key region was once again led by India, which delivered 20% growth from the quarter resulting in double-digit growth for the full year. 2011 was the fifth consecutive year that India achieved double-digit growth, and has been the case throughout 2011, growth in India was well-balanced across our entire portfolio. Sparkling beverages in India were up over 20% this quarter while brand Coca-Cola was up a strong 15%. And still beverages in India were up 16% this quarter, benefiting from a healthy growth across our juice portfolio including Maaza, up 19%. Russia was down low single digits in the quarter, fourth quarter, cycling last year's very strong 31% growth. On a full year basis, our business in Russia was up mid single digits. Our business in Russia is being led by the strong growth of brand Coca-Cola, which delivered double-digit growth in 2011. Brand Coca-Cola is now more than twice the size of our primary competitor's cola brand in Russia. Notably, our overall business in Russia keeps outperforming the rest of the industry, gaining both sparkling and still beverage volume and value share. Turning to Turkey. We gained volume and value share this quarter in both sparkling and still beverages. For 2011, Turkey again delivered double-digit growth as it did the previous year in 2010. And despite geopolitical challenges in the region, our Middle East and North Africa business unit delivered a solid 7% in the quarter and 8% for the full year. A clear example of our commitment to investing tomorrow in this exciting Middle East region is our recently announced agreement to acquire approximately 1/2 of the equity of industries. holds the #1 position in the still beverage business across the entire Middle East. Their brands hold a top 3 position in every market where they compete. This strong partnership with Luzon, coupled with the strength of our bottling partners, will make the Coca-Cola system a leader in the fast-growing still beverage category in the Middle East. 
Let's now turn to Europe, a region of the world that is still facing a very uncertain economic environment. Yet for The Coca-Cola Company, it is also a region that serves as a testament to how well our system is positioned to face these serious economic challenges. Our business in Europe grew 1% in the quarter, making this Europe's sixth consecutive quarter of volume growth, resulting in a full year growth rate of 2%. We achieved these results by strategically tailoring our price and package offerings to meet the needs of each market and their varying economic conditions. Our growth in Europe was widespread with positive fourth quarter and full year growth across several key markets in Northwest Europe and Spain, and we saw the continued growth of Innocent, supported by the successful launch of concentrate juice in Great Britain. Our growth in Europe was once again led by Germany, up a very strong 9% for the quarter and up 6% for the full year, representing our best full year growth results in Germany since 1992. While some of this growth should be attributed to favorable weather and consumer sentiment, there's no doubt that our bottling restructuring efforts as well as effective marketing campaigns have played a key role in this improvement. We are confident that our business in Germany is in a sound position to continue delivering long-term sustainable growth. 
Looking ahead to 2012 and 2013, despite the lingering debt crisis coupled with economic and political insurgency, we are confident that we have the right brands, the right structure, the right strategies and right capabilities in place to continue delivering profitable growth in Europe over the longer term. 
Now let's turn to an overview of how we are building our brands. As we have said before, we always place our brands first in all that we do across more than 200 countries all around the world. This is how we've built the world's most valuable beverage brand portfolio with $15 billion brands more than any other beverage company. Our top 4 brands Coca-Cola, Sprite, Fanta and Diet Coke all once again exceeded $10 billion in global retail sales in 2011. A key component of how we strengthen our global brand portfolio is through innovative consumer engagement. We continuously strive to engage with our consumers in an integrated manner across all social media platforms. The recent example of our efforts in this front was this past weekend, very successful Super Bowl campaign, where we engaged fans like never before through a unique. Online viewing experience fans got to chat with our animated polar bears and see their gained reactions, and they watch the bears move from the digital realm of the TV as they starred in 3 new well received and highly rated TV commercials, and an estimated 300,000-plus fans going to polar bird by exceeding expectations. And by the second quarter, the Coca-Cola Facebook feeds was receiving 3,400 hits per second. This is just one of the marketing achievements for our company. 
Recently we were humbled by the advertising naming The Coca-Cola Company as its 2011 Marketer of the Year, and it's gratifying to see our global marketing efforts recognized by this industry leading publication as we strive to develop and deploy the world's most innovative and effective marketing. 
Let me update you now on our progress around winning at the point of sale. Our system continues to develop critical capabilities to better support over 20 million customers we partner with each and every week to deliver these servings. We measure our progress against this effort by tracking our results across several high impact pragmatic and locally actionable metrics. One metric we have referenced several times this past year is our immediate consumption volume growth. And this metric is meaningful as it drives trial, drives recruitment and system profitability. In 2011, our immediate consumption beverages were up 4% globally, driven by focused in-store activation efforts and cold drink equipment expansion. In fact, as a global system, we placed over 1.2 million new pieces of cold drink equipment in 2011 and have placed over 2.2 million since 2010, the first year of our 2020 Vision. 
Another key metric we monitor closely is the expansion of our right execution daily or RED program in short. Some of you may remember RED as our world-class commercial process designed to improve execution at the outlet level. Today, operations, representing over 1/3 of our global volumes utilize RED. And for comparison when we initiated our 2020 Vision just 3 years ago, less than 15% of our global volume was distributed through operations using RED. So as we move into 2012, our RED program will remain an area of increasing emphasis, focus and growth for our system. 
Before concluding our operating results review, I'd like to update you on our productivity goals. A leading priority of our company is to design and implement an effective and efficient business system with productivity as one of our core pillars of our 2020 Vision. As such, in 2012, we're implementing a new 4-year productivity and reinvestment program that we will -- we expect will achieve between $550 million and $650 million of total incremental annualized savings by the end of 2015. I'm pleased and excited to announce this program from a position of continued growth and momentum towards realizing our 2020 Vision as we consistently deliver results in line with or ahead of our long-term targets. This program will further enable our efforts to strengthen our brands and reinvest our resources to drive long-term profitable growth. We remain relentless in our efforts to become more efficient, leaner and adaptive to changing market conditions, while at the same time building a continuous improvement and cost management culture in keeping with our 2020 Vision. Gary is going to share further details about this new 4-year program in a few moments. Finally, I also want to highlight some of important progress we're making in the area of sustainable packaging, water stewardship and climate protection. By the end of 2011, we've shipped nearly 10 billion PlantBottle packages, helping reduce our annual emissions of carbon dioxide, while also decreasing our dependency on oil-based resins. 
As noted in our latest Sustainability Report, we improved our water use efficiency for the eighth consecutive year, reducing the average amount of water required to produce each beverage serving. We estimate that we replenished 35% of the water used in our finished products due to some 380-plus community water partnerships in a different countries as we work towards our goal of water neutrality by 2020. And we increased our production volumes, while reducing our systemwide global carbon emissions by 2%, putting us a step closer to our goal of growing our business but not our carbon. 
These are just a few examples of how we're building our business and responsibly by making a positive difference in the communities that we serve -- we proudly serve. These efforts are helping us engage with consumers, reduce our cost of doing business and improve our bottom line. 
We are keenly aware of how uncertain the global economic landscape remains today. That said, as we look ahead, we see a world looking for hope, for optimism and for renewal. The Coca-Cola Company and the Coca-Cola system is uniquely positioned to refresh this thirsty world. We're refreshening the thirst of our investors consistently by delivering high-quality returns to shareholders owners, while also generating steady cash flows and paying a steady healthy dividend. We're freshening the needs of thirsty global consumers through our diverse brand portfolio and the world's most innovative and effective marketing. We're refreshing the needs of a thirsty system by increasing our levels of global investment along with our dedicated operating partners. We're refreshing our operations through a culture of continuous improvement, and central to this as extending and driving productivity efforts to design and implement a more effective and efficient business system. And we are refreshing the needs of our communities through global and industry sustainability leadership. 
The nonalcoholic ready-to-drink industry grew by $35 billion in total retail value in 2011. We're pleased to say that our Coca-Cola system represented more than 40% of this total industry growth, underscoring that our 2020 Vision is working well. And while 2011 was another strong year of performance for The Coca-Cola Company, we believe we are just getting started and that our best and brightest days lie ahead. We have a lot to be thankful for and confident about healthy and beloved brand, a clear roadmap for continued growth, a well aligned global bottling system, dedicated and passionate associates and strong financial results and discipline. Taking into account all of these assets to our business, we remain resolute in our desire and confidence in our ability to achieve our long-term growth targets and further enhance the value of your investment in The Coca-Cola Company. With that, let me now turn the call over to Gary."
26642,145599866,216379,"The Coca-Cola Company, Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 07, 2012",2012-02-07,"Earnings Calls","The Coca-Cola Company","Executives","Thanks, Muhtar, and good morning, everyone. We once again delivered quality results this quarter and for the full year, in line with or ahead of our long-term growth targets. In fact, our full year volume and profit results were in line with or exceeded o",1942,"Thanks, Muhtar, and good morning, everyone. We once again delivered quality results this quarter and for the full year, in line with or ahead of our long-term growth targets. In fact, our full year volume and profit results were in line with or exceeded our long-term growth targets for the sixth consecutive year. We continue to achieve these consistent high-quality results during our period of still mixed economic recovery, which is a real testament to our global system's ability to execute our strategic plans in alignment with our 2020 Vision. 
So let's review our earnings results in more detail. We reported comparable earnings per share of $0.79 this quarter, up 10% versus the prior year. Our full year comparable earnings per share growth also was up 10%, ahead of our long-term growth targets. For the quarter, comparable currency-neutral operating income was up 14%, bringing our full year comparable currency-neutral operating income growth to 12%, also ahead of our long-term growth target. For clarity, the impact of currency on our comparable operating income results was a 3% headwind for the quarter and a 3% benefit for the full year, right in line with the quarterly and full year outlook range we provided during our last earnings call in October. Our business delivered comparable currency-neutral net revenue growth of 6% this quarter, in line with our long-term growth target, including a 5% increase in concentrate sales and positive price mix. 
On a full year basis, our comparable currency-neutral net revenue growth came in at 29%, including a 5% increase in concentrate sales, positive price mix and the impact of the CCE transaction. And again for clarity, the impact of currency on our comparable net revenue results was a 1% headwind for the quarter and a 3% benefit for the full year. Our combined international and bottling investments group price product mix was positive 3% for the quarter. In our North American price product mix came in at a positive 2% in the quarter, driven by a 4% increase in our pricing to retailers for our sparkling beverages in North America. 
Our consolidated geographic mix was down 1%, which resulted in a consolidated price mix at the midpoint of our long-term target range of 1% to 2%. For 2012, we anticipate our consolidated price mix results will remain in this target range of 1% to 2%. 
Turning to the rest of our P&L. We expected our consolidated comparable gross revenues to decrease slightly in 2011, which they did due to increased commodity costs as well as the impact of our acquisition of CCE's North American bottling operations. Importantly, we expect our 2012 consolidated comparable gross margins will remain in line with 2011 even after taking into consideration further commodity cost inflation which I'll discuss in a few minutes. 
Our comparable currency-neutral SG&A expenses were even in the quarter and up 30% for the full year. As explained in prior quarterly calls, this full year increase reflects the impact of acquiring CCE's former North American business, which we did not fully cycle until the fourth quarter of 2011. The increase in SG&A also reflects our continued investments around the world on this front. For the full year 2011, we grew our direct marketing expenses ahead of unit case growth, sustaining our commitment to invest in the health and the strength of our brands. As for operating expense leverage, they came in positive this quarter for both North America and the Bottling Investments Group. As expected, operating expense leverage for international operations came in slightly negative in the fourth quarter due to the timing of expenses and operating expense leverage for international came in at even for the full year as planned. 
For 2012, we expect to capture low single-digit operating expense leverage as we keep strategically investing in brand-building activities around the world and efficiently managing our operating expenses. Our net interest income came in at a positive $66 million, slightly above the full year forecast we provided in our last earnings call. For 2012, our best estimate is that net interest income will come in between $20 million and $40 million, primarily due to lower interest rates in some international locations. We expect this income to be spread relatively evenly across the quarters in 2012 and we'll update you each quarter as appropriate. 
Finally, we closed 2011 with an underlying effective tax rate of 23.9% and expect our 2012 underlying effective tax rate to fall between 24% and 25%. Moving to our cash flow from operations, year-to-date this came in at $9.5 billion. As a reminder, this cash flow result includes $769 million contribution made to our pension plans in the first quarter of 2011. 
Net of these additional pension plan contributions, we grew our net cash flow from operations, a positive 7% for the full year. With regards to our share repurchase program, our net share repurchases totaled $2.9 billion in 2011, at the high end of the $2.5 billion to $3 billion range communicated through our last earnings call. And in 2012, we again expect to repurchase a net share amount within the same $2.5 billion to $3 billion range. 
Now let me take a moment to update our outlook on several additional items that may help you model our business in 2012 starting with a quick reminder about this year's calendar. Even though 2012 is a leap year, our first quarter of 2012 will have one last day when compared to the first quarter of 2011, and the fourth quarter 2012 will have 2 more days when compared to the fourth quarter of 2011. Now let me come back with our outlook on commodities. As we indicated in our last earnings call, our incremental commodity costs for 2011 came in at approximately $800 million. As a reminder, these costs were related to the raw material and conversion costs associated with sweeteners, metals, juices and PET plastic. 
As we look ahead to 2012, we anticipate the underlying commodities related to these inputs will remain somewhat pressured, driven primarily by increases in the cost of juices and sweeteners. As a result, we expect the full year 2012 incremental impact of commodity costs on our results to range between $350 million and $450 million. Having said that, we believe we have the right strategic plans in place to mitigate the impact of these incremental commodity costs and to remain confident in our ability to achieve our long-term growth targets. 
Turning now to currency. These have continued to fluctuate with the dollar strengthening, although more moderately against many key currencies. We are mostly hedged for 2012 on the euro and yen with good coverage on several other currencies. After considering these hedged positions, we currently expect currencies to have a low single digit negative impact on operating income for the first quarter of this year and a mid single-digit negative impact for the full year. As for our normal practice, we'll update you both on our commodity and currency forecast on a quarterly basis as we go through the year. 
Now let me update you on our productivity goals. As we closed 2011, we've now successfully completed our 2008 to 2011 Full Year Global Productivity program. We completed this program on plan and with actual NOI savings over $500 million, exceeding our initial savings target of $400 million to $500 million. As Muhtar mentioned earlier, we're now launching a new 4-year productivity and reinvestment programs. In light of this, I'd like to take a moment and walk you through the components of the new program. First, a new 4-year global productivity initiatives starting this year. This initiative will target between $350 million and $400 million in annualized savings, focused around 4 primary areas: one, global supply chain optimization; two, global marketing and innovation effectiveness; three, OpEx leverage and operational excellence; and four, data and IT system standardization. When initial stages of defining the onetime cost associated with capturing savings and we'll provide an update of these calls in our earned next earnings call. 
Second, as we move through 2011, we accelerated our CCR integration efforts to support brand-building initiatives, reinvest in marketing and sales capabilities as well as to partially offset some of last year's increasing commodity costs. As a result, we effectively realized nearly all of the $350 million in annualized savings in 2011, almost 3 years ahead of schedule. This is a testament to the great work of our CCR team and their ability to effectively realize and capture synergies while simultaneously delivering profitable growth. Further, we have successfully identified incremental CCR integration synergies in North America, primarily in the area of our North American product supply which will better enable us to service our customers and consumers. As such, we now believe our CCR integration efforts will capture an incremental $200 million to $250 million above our initial $350 million target, and we expect to capture these incremental annualized synergies starting this year in 2012 and fully realized them by the end of 2015. Correspondingly, we're also increasing our estimate of total onetime cost associated with the capture of CCR synergies from $425 million to $800 million as we implement new initiatives to capture these higher synergies. Therefore, combining both our new global productivity initiatives and our newly expanded CCR integration efforts represents a total incremental annualized savings of $550 million to $650 million. We expect to phase in the capture of these total incremental savings over 4 years, starting in 2012 through the end of 2015. 
Going forward, we will report our progress in capturing these total incremental savings under 1 joint productivity and reinvestment program. As for how we intend to invest the savings generated by this new program, first, and in line with our 2020 Vision, these funds will enhance ongoing systemwide brand-building initiatives. And second as these savings are realized, they may also help mitigate and potential incremental near-term commodity costs. 
As we look back on 2011, we are greatly encouraged by our business achieving yet another solid year of quality results. There is no better proof that our 2020 Vision is working that our company is to continued ability to consistently deliver results that meet or exceed our long-term growth targets even while facing volatile market conditions. And as you consider how to model our business going forward, I want to be very clear that our system remains fully committed to continuing our relative historic price premium for our brands in the marketplace. For us we have the mitigated several times in the past, we strongly believe and have consistently proven that the best way to drive long-term sustainable value is by earning price with our consumers, in concert with a robust occasion-based brand package and channel strategy that drives profitable sustainable growth.

And we are pleased with our volume growth of 3%, which is in line with our long-term growth targets. And I think it's important to note the following. We're cycling an organic volume growth of 5% in the prior year, and full year volume as 4% organically high end of our long-term growth targets for the year. I'm really particularly pleased that all operating groups grew in the quarter. So a cornerstone of our vision is a balanced growth across all geographies and balanced growth across our portfolio. We achieved that both for the quarter and for the year. And I don't think you can draw any conclusions. And also we achieved this kind of growth in the year with -- not only just a very volatile economic environment but volatile commodity environment, but also one-offs like issue in the Japan, the flooding in Thailand, rightsizing in a huge used market like China where now our transactions are significantly ahead of our volume, which is a testament to the health of the business. And so yes, we've had some -- there has been some dislocations is the Middle East markets because of the volatility there because of what's happened like Egypt and like other parts in North Africa. We believe that we see that improving. There's been -- South East Europe has been under tremendous pressure. Again those markets under per capita because of all the volatility that's going on in Europe and around Greece. But I think we shouldn't draw any conclusions. As we look into 2012, we see healthy trends continuing in Latin America, healthy trends continuing in Eurasia and African continent and also Middle East and Eurasia. We see healthy trends in most of the Pacific Rim and area. And we see healthy trends right here in North America. Right now, we see better trends in terms of the consumer mobility, eating out more and just less confusion of the consumer here in North America than we did 12 months ago, and we see that manifesting itself in our foodservice business. So and Europe finally, I think is going to be more volatile. And I think we will probably see first half of the year being more challenged in Europe than the second half of the year. That's the sort of the way I would sum it. But I do -- in Europe, we have some great markets continuing to grow like Germany, like Scandinavia, like Northwest Europe, and then we still have challenging markets in the Southern Rim, although again we had moderate growth in Spain also in the fourth quarter. So I believe that we will achieve our long-term growth targets over time in terms of volume as well as also in terms of our ability to generate price mix across the world."

And that's what I would say, because I think there is never a room in the business for irrationality over the long-term. And that's how I would project, and I think we have -- you're going to this from a point of spend. Our brands are stronger. Our system is much stronger. Our metrics, our customer service are much, much better. And I see us continuing with our momentum, and I think pricing actions should continue into 2012 in terms of rationality. And we anticipate taking additional pricing on key segments of the business through this year in accordance with our normal commercial practices. And we manage a very broad portfolio of our business. That's how I would represent. In terms of international, I think you heard Gary talked about it, 3% price mix in international, and I believe that, that's a testament again to the strength of our international business, which continues to be able to generate good price mix on top of good volume and still growing our market share.

And I would characterize it this way. That is a very good thing for the long-term, and that made sound unusual for me to say. But what it means is that we are continuing to invest and grow all of the emerging markets around the world. Most of those do have margins below the U.S. or Europe, for example, the more developed markets. But we're not milking the business. We're continuing to grow the business at the same time get very healthy margins in the business, and you can see those coming through to the bottom line. So we continue the strength in the whole business globally as well as we're doing the right thing. I think you're going to see and negative geographic mix for a very long time, because what you want to see is healthy growth in emerging markets. You want to see very good growth in India. You want to see very good growth in China, et cetera. And at the same time, as Muhtar said, and critically important, then growth actually across every geographic region in which we operate. But when you put all that together, you will get negative geographic growth, and I think that's a great thing. But in total, as long as it's coming out in our 1% to 2% range, in the quarter came out right in the middle of that, we're exactly where we want to be."

And we have reason to believe that we can grow across Western markets, and we can grow across certainly across certainly across our emerging markets and you'll see that continuing. And as we continue to gain scale in emerging markets, you will continue to see our margins improving in those markets as they have been doing in the last 3, 4 years. So I will just say that yes, definitely balanced across geographies, North America, Japan, Europe. And then certainly again broad-based in the portfolio both in sparkling and still beverages. And still beverages growth that I mentioned in Latin America, for example, and the fact that it's an almost got to 1 billion cases in Mexico 4 short years after Jugos Del Valle jarred business and now in many, many markets, flourishing in many markets across Latin America is just another testament of still how much growth Latin America still to offer.

The Olympics and the Euro Cup are both this year, and we happen to be the sponsor of both of those. And so I think it's one of those things that will help us in that market as well. Relative to gross margins, I'd tell you what you should expect to see is you should have seen increasing margins, but what's happening is with that $350 million to $450 million of commodity pressure, what we're doing is we believe we can offset that and hold our margins with the pricing actions of that we're taking in the market as well as the productivity efforts that we are taking as well.

Judy, very insightful question let me see if I could give an insightful answer. Here's what I will tell you relative to the fourth quarter performance on North America, you do see very healthy increase. A lot of that is actually what we're cycling, because a lot of the marketing in the fourth quarter in legacy CCE when we acquired it, there was a lot of marketing that was bent in the fourth quarter of 2010 that CCE had already planned and then we executed against in the fourth quarter. This year, actually got spread through the year. So it was a timing of marketing and so there are a few of those type anomalies. If you remember, you go back I think I said in the third quarter call that the fourth quarter of this year will be the first quarter that's actually comparable, but we are still some unusual things in the fourth quarter of 2010 that you need to go back and make sure you look at. So I just, I'd say everyone on the call if you're interested in that, go back and look at some of those things and what you'll see it will actually bring that profit increase down. It's still a nice increase in profitable, but it will bring it down some in the fourth quarter of 2011. Relative to 2012, let me just say I hear you, and we are very enthusiastic about our business in North America. It is operating well. They were able to do one of the largest vertical integrations in the history of business and do it flawlessly, get basically 4 years of synergies in the first year, increase those synergies and at the same time continue to execute and take share in the market in a very profitable way.

But if you look at Brazil, which is one of the big ones, it's been a pretty big movement. Brazil strengthened significantly during last year, then weakened significantly and now it's coming back some. But it's a lot of these smaller emergent currencies that are giving that impact. Now with that said, if you -- let me just tell you, give you some idea of the volatility. The swing of currencies on our earnings in 2012 in the last month is over $100 million in the last 30 days. And that's an improvement, by the way, because we're seeing those kind of volatilities. We're seeing a lot of those emerging market currency starting to come back. And they're coming back as the world is starting to accept a little risk where there were several risk aversion among 6 weeks ago. So is there some upside? I hope so, but I don't know today. Because of the volatility we just don't know. But I think as we move through the year, we'll continue -- but the volatility is going to continue as well."

And I think that we ended up slightly positive despite all the dislocations in Japan. And that's again basically bodes well going forward as to the strength of our business there. I think in terms of your question of how that relates to the Pacific, you need to look at I think the full year results of the Pacific, and it was from an income perspective, overall positive. And it's about the timing and it's about the marketing expenses also, how they're sort of distributed over the year. In terms of Brazil, I would say that Brazil, I could just summarize by saying volume was up 1% for the full year. General slowdown of the economy and unfavorable weather did impact our business, but we are outperforming the industry, gaining share across all categories for the quarter and the full year. And I think you should expect sequential improvement in Brazil as we move through 2012. As far as Philippines is concerned, we've had essentially a difficult year as we continued to transform that business as it needs to be transformed into healthy situation for the long-term. And think about our German business, it took us a while to get it going again. We believe that certainly the worst is past us in the Philippines, and we should have in terms of also the tough macroeconomic environment post the elections has lingered on, but we believe that 2012 will be a better year in the Philippines than -- 2012 will be a better year than 2011, and I think Gary just a..."

Today, I'm pleased to share The Coca-Cola Company continues to operate from a position of real strength. Our brands continue to get stronger. Our strategies continue to be sound, and our execution continues to be focused and effective. All of this continues to drive sustainable growth and continues to bring us closer to achieving our 2020 Vision. One day, one week, one month and one quarter at a time. Thanks to the extraordinary determination and resolve of our 146,000 company associates around the world, we delivered volume and revenue growth this quarter in every one of our 5 geographic operating groups. And we achieved financial results for both the quarter and the full year in line with or ahead of our long-term growth targets, making this the seventh consecutive quarter we have either met or exceeded our long-term growth targets.
Our global sparkling beverage portfolio kept growing, up 2% for the quarter and a solid 4% for the full year. Our global still beverage portfolio is also performing well, up 6% for the quarter and a strong 8% for the full year. And we gained global volume and value share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages, while also gaining global share in both sparkling and still beverage categories. We achieved these results for both the quarter and the full year against the backdrop of a volatile global economic landscape. Even as we believe that the unease in the global markets will continue in the near term, the breadth of our global footprint and the strength of our brands create a business that was built for times like these, resilient and resolute to grow.
Our solid performance in 2011 reflects the consistent investments we have made over time to strengthen the health of our brands, starting with brand Coca-Cola, the very oxygen of our business, up 3% in both the quarter and the full year. In fact, brand Coca-Cola grew by at least 24 million servings in 24 different countries this past quarter. Our brand health and brand value have been created over the long-term through strong and consistent investments in our business, rather than through short-term incremental actions. And this is why we remain so committed to our long-term brand investment strategies. Our 2011 performance results underscore how our company, together with our global bottling partners, is well aligned and positioned to lead in this difficult environment.
As we enter into the third year of our 2020 Vision, our roadmap for winning together remains clear to us and our committed bottling partners. The assumptions that shaped our vision have not changed. Our expectations for strong performance have not wavered. The key to our calculus for growth and achieving our 2020 Vision will be to ensure that we keep creating balanced growth across both emerging and developed markets, as well as sparkling and still categories.
We successfully achieved this balance in 2011. For the full year, we delivered almost 1 billion unit cases of incremental organic volume growth, or the equivalent of adding another Japan to our business. And importantly, we delivered positive full year growth in key developed markets like North America, Japan and Germany, while also generating double-digit full year growth in key emerging markets like India and China. And we will continue to make significant investments in our future, all across the world.
In fact, in order to achieve our 2020 Vision, we anticipate our global system will add about 100,000 jobs in this decade as we invest to support the tremendous opportunity we see in nonalcoholic beverages, one of the fastest-growing industries in consumer packaged goods.
So let's review our fourth quarter and full year results. Worldwide, we grew volume 3% this quarter, in line with our long-term growth target. For the full year, we grew worldwide volume by 5%, including the benefit of cross-licensed brands, primarily Dr. Pepper in North America. Excluding these brands, we delivered strong full year volume growth of 4%, also in line with our long-term target.
As for our profit results, we grew comparable earnings per share by 10% for both the quarter and the full year, ahead of our long-term target. As we close the second year of our 2020 Vision, this also marks the second consecutive year we've delivered double-digit comparable earnings per share growth. 
Now let's briefly review performance results across our operating groups, beginning first with North America where our team remains focused on driving profitable and sustainable growth. North America volume was up 1% in the quarter, making this North America's seventh consecutive quarter of growth. And for the full year, North America's organic volume growth was also up 1%.
The North America business gained total market volume and value share in sparkling, still and nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages in both the quarter and the full year. And we delivered these strong results while in the process of successfully integrating the largest acquisition in our company's history. Our sparkling beverage results in North America were even for the quarter, with brand Coca-Cola volume up 1%. We achieved these results while also earning an increase in retail pricing of 4% in sparkling beverages through the effective execution of our occasion-based brand package/price and channel strategies.
As for Coke Zero, it was up high-single digits in North America this past quarter and up double digits for the full year, making this the fifth consecutive year of double-digit growth. We also drove positive growth for Fanta, which was up 3% in 2011, its second consecutive year of positive growth.
Our still beverages in North America delivered 3% growth in the quarter and 4% growth for the full year while gaining share for the seventh consecutive quarter. POWERADE continues to be a leading driver of this solid growth, up 11% in the quarter and 12% for the full year. And POWERADE once again captured both volume and value share in the sports drink category, both for the quarter and for the full year. Our key brands delivered double-digit growth in the quarter led by Gold Peak, which grew double digits for the 19th consecutive quarter.
As we've always said, there's no other western developed market in the world that boasts as dynamic the demographics as those present in North America between now and 2020. Young, vibrant, diverse, educated and entrepreneurial. We like these attributes and have every reason to remain excited about the long-term outlook of our flagship market.
Turning now to our Pacific Group where in 2011, our business again delivered consistent growth across a diverse set of markets. Overall, our Pacific Group volume was up 5% in both the quarter and the full year, and these results were led by China, up double digits in the quarter and for the full year, making this 9 out of the last 10 years that our business in China has delivered double-digit growth.
Our efforts to enhance the consumer experience with our sparkling beverage brands keep paying dividends, with sparkling beverages up double digits in China for both the quarter and the full year. Importantly, we're seeing strong growth across our entire sparkling portfolio, with Coca-Cola, Sprite and Fanta all delivering double-digit growth in both the fourth quarter as well as in the full year 2011.
At the same time, our still beverage portfolio brands are sustaining their solid momentum, also delivering double-digit growth for the full year. These results confirm that we are executing the right strategies and have the right capabilities in place in China to deliver sustainable double-digit growth over the long-term.
Japan's fourth quarter results were up 5%, resulting in slightly positive full year growth, rounding to even. This is a better-than-anticipated full year result in light of the tragic national disaster that occurred last March. This also underscores the strength and resilience of our people and brands across the entire Japanese bottling system. Notably, we realized greater momentum across several key channels in Japan this quarter, including convenience stores and vending as we further increase our focus on single-serve beverages.
Moving now to Latin America where in 2011 we once again expanded our volume and value share leadership position. Volume in this total region was up 4% in the quarter and 6% for the full year. This strong performance was once again led by Mexico, up 4% for the quarter and 9% for the full year. Our business in Mexico gained volume and value share in both sparkling and still beverages for both the quarter and the full year. In fact, our still beverage portfolio in Mexico reached nearly 1 billion unit cases in 2011, a short 4 years after the successful integration of Jugos Del Valle into our winning portfolio.
The rapid evolution of our brands in Mexico is a great testament to our team's ability to execute clear, occasion-based channel strategies across all beverage categories in this key market. We're also advancing our momentum in Argentina, which delivered double-digit full year growth while capturing volume and value share in both sparkling and still beverages for the 12th consecutive quarter.
And finally, Brazil, volume was up 1% for the full year. Despite a general slowdown in the economy and unfavorable weather, our business in Brazil keeps outperforming the industry, gaining share across both sparkling and still beverages in both the quarter as well as for the full year.
Let's now turn to the Eurasia and Africa Group. In 2011, we made sound progress against our goal to strategically invest for tomorrow while gaining share today. Volume in this region grew 4% in the quarter and a solid 6% for the full year. Importantly, our growth in Eurasia and Africa was driven by the continued strong momentum of brand Coca-Cola, up 5% in the quarter and 7% for the full year 2011.
Our overall performance in this key region was once again led by India, which delivered 20% growth for the quarter, resulting in double-digit growth for the full year. 2011 was the fifth consecutive year that India achieved double-digit growth. And as been the case throughout 2011, growth in India was well balanced across our entire portfolio. Sparkling beverages in India were up over 20% this quarter while brand Coca-Cola was up a strong 15%. And still beverages in India were up 16% this quarter, benefiting from a healthy growth across our juice portfolio, including Maaza, up 19%.
Russia was down low-single digits in the quarter, fourth quarter, cycling last year's very strong 31% growth. On a full year basis, our business in Russia was up mid-single digits. Our business in Russia is being led by the strong growth of brand Coca-Cola, which delivered double-digit growth in 2011. Brand Coca-Cola is now more than 2x the size of our primary competitor's cola brand in Russia. Notably, our overall business in Russia keeps outperforming the rest of the industry, gaining both sparkling and still beverage volume and value share.
Turning to Turkey. We gained volume and value share this quarter in both sparkling and still beverages. For 2011, Turkey again delivered double-digit growth as it did the previous year in 2010. And despite geopolitical challenges in the region, our Middle East and North Africa business unit delivered a solid 7% in the quarter and 8% for the full year.
A clear example of our commitment to invest in tomorrow in this exciting Middle East region is our recently announced agreement to acquire approximately 1/2 of the equity of Aujan Industries. Aujan holds the #1 position in the still beverage business across the entire Middle East. Their brands hold a top 3 position in every market where they compete. This strong partnership with Aujan, coupled with the strength of our bottling partners, will make the Coca-Cola system a leader in the fast-growing still beverage category in the Middle East.
Let's now turn to Europe, a region of the world that is still facing a very uncertain economic environment. Yet, for The Coca-Cola Company, it is also a region that serves as a testament to how well our system is positioned to face these serious economic challenges. Our business in Europe grew 1% in the quarter, making this Europe's sixth consecutive quarter of volume growth, resulting in a full year growth rate of 2%. We achieved these results by strategically tailoring our price and package offerings to meet the needs of each market and their varying economic conditions. Our growth in Europe was widespread, with positive fourth quarter and full year growth across several key markets in Northwest Europe and Spain. And we saw the continued growth of Innocent, supported by the successful launch of not-from-concentrate juice in Great Britain. Our growth in Europe was once again led by Germany, up a very strong 9% for the quarter and up 6% for the full year, representing our best full year growth result in Germany since 1992.
While some of this growth should be attributed to favorable weather and consumer sentiment, there's no doubt that our bottling restructuring efforts as well as effective marketing campaigns have played a key role in this improvement. We're confident that our business in Germany is in a sound position to continue delivering long-term sustainable growth.
Looking ahead to 2012 and 2013. Despite the lingering debt crisis coupled with economic and political uncertainty, we are confident that we have the right brands, the right structure, the right strategies and right capabilities in place to continue delivering profitable growth in Europe over the longer term.
Now let's turn to an overview of how we are building our brands. As we've said before, we always place our brands first in all that we do, across more than 200 countries all around the world. This is how we've built the world's most valuable beverage brand portfolio, with $15 billion brands more than any other beverage company. Our top 4 brands: Coca-Cola, Sprite, Fanta and Diet Coke, all once again exceeded $10 billion in global retail sales in 2011. A key component of how we strengthen our global brand portfolio is through innovative consumer engagement. We continuously strive to engage with our consumers in an integrated manner across all social media platforms. A recent example of our efforts in this front was this past weekend's very successful Super Bowl campaign where we engaged fans like never before. Through a unique online viewing experience, fans got to chat with our animated polar bears and see their game reactions. And they watched the bears move from the digital realm of the TV as they starred in 3 new well-received and highly rated TV commercials. And an estimated 300,000-plus fans joined the polar bears live, far exceeding expectations. And by the second quarter, the Coca-Cola Facebook feed was receiving 3,400 hits per second. This is just one of the -- a string of marketing achievements for our company.
Recently, we were humbled by the Advertising Age naming The Coca-Cola Company as its 2011 Marketer of the Year. And it's gratifying to see our global marketing efforts recognized by this industry-leading publication as we strive to develop and deploy the world's most innovative and effective marketing.
Let me update you now on our progress around winning at the point of sale. Our system continues to develop critical capabilities to better support over 20 million customers we partner with each and every week to deliver these servings. We measure our progress against this effort by tracking our results across several high-impact, pragmatic and locally actionable metrics. One metric we have referenced several times this past year is our immediate consumption volume growth. And this metric is meaningful as it drives trial, drives recruitment and system profitability. In 2011, our immediate consumption beverages were up 4% globally, driven by focused in-store activation efforts and cold drink equipment expansion. In fact, as a global system, we've placed over 1.2 million new pieces of cold drink equipment in 2011 and have placed over 2.2 million since 2010, the first year of our 2020 Vision.
Another key metric we monitor closely is the expansion of our right execution daily, or RED program in short. Some of you may remember RED as our world-class commercial process designed to improve execution at the outlet level. Today, operations representing over 1/3 of our global volume utilize RED. And for comparison, when we initiated our 2020 Vision just 3 years ago, less than 15% of our global volume was distributed through operations using RED. So as we move into 2012, our RED program will remain an area of increasing emphasis, focus and growth for our system.
Before concluding our operating results review, I'd like to update you on our productivity goals. A leading priority of our company is to design and implement an effective and efficient business system, with productivity as one of our core pillars of our 2020 Vision. As such, in 2012, we're implementing a new 4-year productivity and reinvestment program that we will -- we expect will achieve between $550 million and $650 million of total incremental annualized savings by the end of 2015. I'm pleased and excited to announce this program from a position of continued growth and momentum towards realizing our 2020 Vision as we consistently deliver results in line with or ahead of our long-term targets. This program will further enable our efforts to strengthen our brands and reinvest our resources to drive long-term profitable growth.
We remain relentless in our efforts to become more efficient, leaner and adaptive to changing market conditions, while at the same time building a continuous improvement in cost management culture in keeping with our 2020 Vision. Gary is going to share further details about this new 4-year program in a few moments.
Finally, I also want to highlight some of the important progress we're making in the area of sustainable packaging, water stewardship and climate protection. By the end of 2011, we've shipped nearly 10 billion PlantBottle packages, helping reduce our annual emissions of carbon dioxide, while also decreasing our dependency on oil-based resin. As noted in our latest Sustainability Report, we improved our water use efficiency for the eighth consecutive year, reducing the average amount of water required to produce each beverage serving. We estimate that we replenished 35% of the water used in our finished products due to some 380-plus community water partnerships in 94 countries as we work toward our goal of water neutrality by 2020. And we increased our production volume while reducing our system-wide global carbon emissions by 2%, putting us a step closer to our goal of growing our business but not our carbon.
These are just a few examples of how we're building our business responsibly by making a positive difference in the communities that we serve -- we proudly serve. These efforts are helping us engage with consumers, reduce our cost of doing business and improve our bottom line.
We are keenly aware of how uncertain the global economic landscape remains today. That said, as we look ahead, we see a world looking for hope, for optimism and for renewal. The Coca-Cola Company and the Coca-Cola system is uniquely positioned to refresh this thirsty world. We're refreshening the thirst of our investors consistently by delivering high-quality returns to shareowners, while also generating steady cash flows and paying a steady healthy dividend. We're freshening the needs of thirsty global consumers through our diverse brand portfolio and the world's most innovative and effective marketing. We're refreshing the needs of a thirsty system by increasing our levels of global investment along with our dedicated bottling partners. We're refreshing our operations through a culture of continuous improvement. And central to this is extending and driving productivity efforts to design and implement a more effective and efficient business system. And we are refreshing the needs of our communities through global and industry sustainability leadership.
The nonalcoholic ready-to-drink industry grew by $35 billion in total retail value in 2011. We're pleased to say that our Coca-Cola system represented more than 40% of this total industry growth, underscoring that our 2020 Vision is working well. And while 2011 was another strong year of performance for The Coca-Cola Company, we believe we are just getting started and that our best and brightest days lie ahead.
We have a lot to be thankful for, and confident about a healthy and beloved brand, a clear roadmap for continued growth, a well-aligned global bottling system, dedicated and passionate associates and strong financial results and discipline. Taking into account all of these assets to our business, we remain resolute in our desire and confident in our ability to achieve our long-term growth targets and further enhance the value of your investment in The Coca-Cola Company.
With that, let me now turn the call over to Gary."
26642,145599866,216523,"The Coca-Cola Company, Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 07, 2012",2012-02-07,"Earnings Calls","The Coca-Cola Company","Executives","Thanks, Muhtar, and good morning, everyone. We once again delivered quality results this quarter and for the full year, in line with or ahead of our long-term growth targets. In fact, our full year volume and profit results were in line with or exceeded o",1945,"Thanks, Muhtar, and good morning, everyone. We once again delivered quality results this quarter and for the full year, in line with or ahead of our long-term growth targets. In fact, our full year volume and profit results were in line with or exceeded our long-term growth targets for the sixth consecutive year. We continue to achieve these consistent high-quality results during a period of still mixed economic recovery, which is a real testament to our global system's ability to execute our strategic plans in alignment with our 2020 Vision.
So let's review our earnings results in more detail. We reported comparable earnings per share of $0.79 this quarter, up 10% versus the prior year. Our full year comparable earnings per share growth also was up 10%, ahead of our long-term growth targets. For the quarter, comparable currency neutral operating income was up 14%, bringing our full year comparable currency neutral operating income growth to 12%, also ahead of our long-term growth target. For clarity, the impact of currency on our comparable operating income results was a 3% headwind for the quarter and a 3% benefit for the full year, right in line with the quarterly and full year outlook range we've provided during our last earnings call in October. Our business delivered comparable currency neutral net revenue growth of 6% this quarter, in line with our long-term growth target, including a 5% increase in concentrate sales and positive price mix.
On a full year basis, our comparable currency neutral net revenue growth came in at 29%, including a 5% increase in concentrate sales, positive price mix and the impact of the CCE transaction. And again, for clarity, the impact of currency on our comparable net revenue results was a 1% headwind for the quarter and a 3% benefit for the full year.
Our combined international and bottling investments group price product mix was a positive 3% for the quarter. And our North American price product mix came in at a positive 2% in the quarter, driven by a 4% increase in our pricing to retailers for our sparkling beverages in North America.
Our consolidated geographic mix was down 1%, which resulted in a consolidated price mix at the midpoint of our long-term target range of 1% to 2%. For 2012, we anticipate our consolidated price mix results will remain in this target range of 1% to 2%.
Turning to the rest of our P&L. We expected our consolidated comparable gross revenues to decrease slightly in 2011, which they did due to increased commodity cost, as well as the impact of our acquisition of CCE's North American bottling operations. Importantly, we expect our 2012 consolidated comparable gross margins will remain in line with 2011, even after taking into consideration further commodity cost inflation, which I'll discuss in a few minutes.
Our comparable currency neutral SG&A expenses were even in the quarter and up 30% for the full year. As explained in prior quarterly calls, this full year increase reflects the impact of acquiring CCE's former North American business, which we did not fully cycle until the fourth quarter of 2011. The increase in SG&A also reflects our continued investments around the world. On this front, for the full year 2011, we grew our direct marketing expenses ahead of unit case growth, sustaining our commitment to invest in the health and the strength of our brands.
As for operating expense leverage, it came in positive this quarter for both North America and the Bottling Investments Group. As expected, operating expense leverage for our international operations came in slightly negative in the fourth quarter due to the timing of expenses. And operating expense leverage for international came in at even for the full year as planned.
For 2012, we expect to capture low-single digit operating expense leverage as we keep strategically investing in brand-building activities around the world and efficiently managing our operating expenses.
Our net interest income came in at a positive $66 million, slightly above the full year forecast we provided in our last earnings call. For 2012, our best estimate is that net interest income will come in between $20 million and $40 million, primarily due to lower interest rates in some international locations. We expect this income to be spread relatively evenly across the quarters in 2012, and we'll update you each quarter as appropriate.  Finally, we closed 2011 with an underlying effective tax rate of 23.9% and expect our 2012 underlying effective tax rate to fall between 24% and 25%. 
Moving to our cash flow from operations. Year-to-date, this came in at $9.5 billion. As a reminder, this cash flow result includes $769 million contribution made to our pension plans in the first quarter of 2011. Net of these additional pension plan contributions, we grew our net cash flow from operations a positive 7% for the full year.
With regards to our share repurchase program, our net share repurchases totaled $2.9 billion in 2011, at the high end of the $2.5 billion to $3 billion range communicated during our last earnings call. And in 2012, we again expect to repurchase a net share amount within the same $2.5 billion to $3 billion range.
Now let me take a moment to update our outlook on several additional items that may help you model our business in 2012, starting with a quick reminder about this year's calendar. Even though 2012 is a leap year, our first quarter of 2012 will have one last day when compared to the first quarter of 2011. And the fourth quarter of 2012 will have 2 more days when compared to the fourth quarter of 2011.
Now let me come back with our outlook on commodities. As we indicated in our last earnings call, our incremental commodity costs for 2011 came in at approximately $800 million. As a reminder, these costs were related to the raw material and conversion costs associated with sweeteners, metals, juices and PET plastic.
As we look ahead to 2012, we anticipate the underlying commodities related to these inputs will remain somewhat pressured, driven primarily by increases in the cost of juices and sweeteners. As a result, we expect the full year 2012 incremental impact of commodity costs on our results to range between $350 million and $450 million. Having said that, we believe we have the right strategic plans in place to mitigate the impact of these incremental commodity costs and remain confident in our ability to achieve our long-term growth targets.
Turning now to currency. These have continued to fluctuate with the dollar strengthening, although more moderately against many key currencies. We're mostly hedged for 2012 on the euro and yen, with good coverage on several other currencies. After considering these hedged positions, we currently expect currencies to have a low single-digit negative impact on operating income for the first quarter of this year and a mid-single digit negative impact for the full year. As per our normal practice, we'll update you both on our commodity and currency forecast on a quarterly basis as we go through the year.
Now let me update you on our productivity goals. As we closed 2011, we've now successfully completed our 2008 to 2011 4-year global productivity program. We completed this program on plan and with actual annualized savings of over $500 million, exceeding our initial savings target of $400 million to $500 million. As Muhtar mentioned earlier, we're now launching a new 4-year productivity and reinvestment program. In light of this, I want to take a moment and walk you through the components of the new program.
First, a new 4-year global productivity initiative starting this year. This initiative will target between $350 million and $400 million in annualized savings focused around 4 primary areas: one, global supply chain optimization; two, global marketing and innovation effectiveness; three, OpEx leverage and operational excellence; and four, data and IT system standardization. We're in the initial stages of defining the one-time costs associated with capturing these savings, and we'll provide an update on these costs in our next earnings call.
Second, as we move through 2011, we accelerated our CCR integration efforts to support brand-building initiatives, reinvest in marketing and sales capabilities, as well as to partially offset some of last year's increasing commodity costs. As a result, we effectively realized nearly all of the $350 million in annualized savings in 2011, almost 3 years ahead of schedule. This is a testament to the great work of our CCR team and their ability to effectively realize and capture synergies while simultaneously delivering profitable growth.
Further, we have successfully identified incremental CCR integration synergies in North America, primarily in the area of our North American product supply, which will better enable us to service our customers and consumers. As such, we now believe our CCR integration efforts will capture an incremental $200 million to $250 million above our original $350 million target. And we expect to capture these incremental annualized synergies starting this year in 2012 and fully realize them by the end of 2015.
Correspondingly, we're also increasing our estimate of total one-time cost associated with the capture of CCR synergies from $425 million to $800 million as we implement new initiatives to capture these higher synergies. Therefore, combining both our new global productivity initiative and our newly expanded CCR integration efforts represents a total incremental annualized savings of $550 million to $650 million. We expect to phase in the capture of these total incremental savings over 4 years, starting in 2012 through the end of 2015.
Going forward, we'll report our progress in capturing these total incremental savings under one joint productivity and reinvestment program.
As for how we intend to invest the savings generated by this new program, first, and in line with our 2020 Vision, these funds will enhance ongoing system-wide brand-building initiatives. And second, as these savings are realized, they may also help mitigate potential incremental near-term commodity costs.
As we look back on 2011, we are greatly encouraged by our business achieving yet another solid year of quality results. There is no better proof that our 2020 Vision is working than our company's continued ability to consistently deliver results that meet or exceed our long-term growth targets even while facing volatile market conditions. And as you consider how to model our business going forward, I want to be very clear that our system remains fully committed to continuing our relative historic price premium for our brands in the marketplace. For as we have communicated several times in the past, we strongly believe and have consistently proven that the best way to drive long-term sustainable value is by earning price with our consumers in concert with a robust occasion-based brand package and channel strategy that drives profitable sustainable growth.  That is why we remain confident we can keep delivering results in line with our long-term growth targets. Our system is healthy and financially strong. We continue to generate cash, invest in our brands, execute our 2020 Vision and growth strategies and pay a healthy dividend. Our seasoned management team, over 146,000 motivated company associates and highly capable global bottling partners are making the right actions and executing the right strategies to build on our strengths, to refresh a thirsty world and to drive our 2020 Vision.
Before concluding our prepared remarks, I want to remind you that I'm looking forward to presenting at CAGNY in Boca Raton on Wednesday, February 22; as well as at the CAGE Conference in London on Wednesday, March 21. I hope to see many of you there at these great investor and analyst events.

And we're pleased with our volume growth of 3%, which is in line with our long-term growth targets. And I think it's important to note the following. We're cycling an organic volume growth of 5% in the prior year, and full year volume is 4%, organically high end of our long-term growth target for the year. And I'm really particularly pleased that all operating groups grew in the quarter. So a cornerstone of our vision is balanced growth across all geographies and balanced growth across our portfolio. We achieved that both for the quarter and for the year. And I don't think you can draw any conclusions. And also, we achieved this kind of growth in the year with not only just a very volatile economic environment, volatile commodity environment, but also one-offs like the issue in the Japan, the flooding in Thailand, rightsizing in a huge market like China where now our transactions are significantly ahead of our volume, which is a testament to the health of the business. And so yes, we've had some -- there has been some dislocations in some Middle East markets because of the volatility there, because of what's happened like Egypt and like other parts in North Africa. We believe that we see that improving. There's been -- South East Europe has been under tremendous pressure. Again, those markets are under 150 per capita because of all the volatility that's going on in Europe and around Greece. But I think we shouldn't draw any conclusions. As we look into 2012, we see healthy trends continuing in Latin America, healthy trends continuing in Eurasia and Africa -- African continent and also Middle East and Eurasia. We see healthy trends in most of the Pacific Rim and area, and we see healthy trends right here in North America. Right now, we see better trends in terms of the consumer mobility, eating out more and just less confusion of the consumer here in North America than we did 12 months ago. And we see that manifesting itself in our Foodservice business. And Europe, finally, I think, is going to be more volatile. And I think we will probably see first half of the year being more challenged in Europe than the second half of the year. That's sort of the way I would sum it. But I do -- in Europe, we have some great markets continuing to grow like Germany, like Scandinavia, like Northwest Europe. And then we still have challenging markets in the Southern Rim. Although again we had moderate growth in Spain also in the fourth quarter. So I believe that we will achieve our long-term growth targets over time in terms of volume, as well as also in terms of our ability to generate price mix across the world."

And our brand strength continues, with brand Coca-Cola up 1% in the same quarter. And I believe -- I think it would be right to assume that this kind of rational pricing would continue in terms of rate for 2012. And that's what I would say because I think there is never a room in business for irrationality over the long term. And that's how I would project. And I think we have -- we're going into this from a point of spend. Our brands are stronger. Our system is much stronger. Our metrics for customer service are much, much better, and I see us continuing with our momentum. And I think pricing actions should continue into 2012 in terms of rationality. And we anticipate taking additional pricing on key segments of the business through this year in accordance with our normal commercial practices. And we manage a very broad portfolio of our business. That's how I would reference it. In terms of international, I think you heard Gary talk about a 3% price mix in international, and I believe that, that's a testament again to the strength of our international business, which continues to be able to generate good price mix on top of good volume and still growing our market share.

And I would characterize it this way: that is a very good thing for the long-term. And that may sound unusual for me to say. But what it means is that we are continuing to invest and grow all of the emerging markets around the world. Most of those do have margins below the U.S. or Europe, for example, the more developed markets. But we're not milking the business. We're continuing to grow the business. At the same time, get very healthy margins in the business, and you can see those coming through the bottom line. So we continue to strengthen the whole business globally. As long as we're doing the right thing, I think you're going to see a negative geographic mix for a very long time, because what you want to see is healthy growth in emerging markets. You want to see very good growth in India. You want to see very good growth in China, et cetera. And at the same time, as Muhtar said, and critically important, then growth actually across every geographic region in which we operate.

And as we continue to gain scale in emerging markets, you will continue to see our margins improving in those markets as they have been doing in the last 3, 4 years. So I will just say that yes, definitely balanced across geographies, North America, Japan, Europe. And then certainly, again, broad-based in the portfolio, both in sparkling and in still beverages. And still beverages growth that I mentioned in Latin America, for example, and the fact that it's an almost -- it's got to 1 billion cases in Mexico after 4 short years after Jugos Del Valle got integrated successfully into our business and now it's in many, many markets, flourishing in many markets across Latin America, is just another testament of still how much growth Latin America has still to offer.

But what's happening is with that $350 million to $450 million of commodity pressure, what we're doing is we believe we can offset that and hold our margins with the pricing actions that we're taking in the market, as well as the productivity efforts that we're taking as well. So it's really those commodity pressures that again granted -- or half of what they were in '11, but still substantial in 2012."

That is a critical element that has higher margins, higher prices, and it improves the mix of our business. And that is continuing at a very healthy rate, particularly also in Western markets like North America, as well as Europe. And that is again a key testament to the strength of our system, which requires very disciplined execution in the marketplace on a day-to-day basis. And I was recently in Western Europe and the marketplace with John Brock, our partner in CCE, and we saw great examples of how both the activation has already started around the Olympics, but also great execution in the marketplace from an immediate consumption perspective, as well as the brand, price, pack, occasion, channel architecture really working in our favor."

In fourth quarter, first clean quarter in lapping CCE acquisition, your profit was up 25%. I think the benefit that you called out in Q1, the timing shift on marketing, was about 7 points. So even excluding that, it looks like the profit was up pretty nicely in the fourth quarter. So maybe a little bit of color as to what drove that profit improvement in Q4. And then as you think about 2012, you've got moderating inflation, you've got pricing that went into the marketplace, you've got cost synergies and cost savings coming through, why wouldn't we expect to see a pretty healthy profit growth in North America in 2012?"

Relative to the fourth quarter performance on North America, you do see very healthy increase. A lot of that is actually what we're cycling. Because a lot of the marketing in the fourth quarter in legacy CCE, when we acquired it, there was a lot of marketing that was spent in the fourth quarter of 2010 that CCE had already planned and then we executed against in that fourth quarter. This year actually got spread through the year. So it was a timing of marketing, and so there are a few of those type anomalies. If you remember, if you go back I think I said in the third quarter call, that the fourth quarter of this year will be the first quarter that's actually comparable, but there are still some unusual things in the fourth quarter of 2010 that you need to go back and make sure you look at. So I just -- I'd say, everyone on the call, if you're interested in that, go back and look at some of those things. And what you'll see, it'll actually bring that profit increase down. It's still a nice increase and profitable, but it'll bring it down some in the fourth quarter of 2011. Relative to 2012, let me just say I hear you, and we are very enthusiastic about our business in North America. It is operating well. They were able to do one of the largest vertical integrations in the history of business and do it flawlessly, get basically 4 years of synergies in the first year, increased those synergies and at the same time continue to execute and take share in the market in a very profitable way. So I feel very good about North America, I'm bullish on North America. And we've got a very capable team over there executing every day."

So on the euros particularly, we're in the money on that. So better than current spot. But where the drag is coming from and what you're not seeing is that it's really all those emerging market countries. And you'd be surprised at a lot of little countries that actually can start having, you add them all up and they can have a pretty large impact, which is moving you from -- I think you're probably seeing low-single digits, and I'm seeing mid-single digits full year, even though it's low-single digits first quarter. But if you look at Brazil, which is one of the big ones, it's been a pretty big move. Brazil strengthened significantly during last year then weakened significantly, and now it's coming back some. But it's a lot of these smaller emerging market currencies that are giving that impact. Now with that said, if you -- let me just tell you, give you some idea of the volatility. The swing of currencies on our earnings in 2012 in the last month is over $100 million in the last 30 days. And that's an improvement, by the way. Because we're seeing those kind of volatilities, we're seeing a lot of those emerging market currencies starting to come back, and they're coming back as the world is starting to accept a little risk where there was total risk aversion a month -- 6 weeks ago. So is there some upside? I hope so, but I don't know today. Because of the volatility, we just don't know. But I think as we move through the year, we'll continue -- but the volatility is going to continue as well."

And I think that we ended up slightly positive despite all the dislocations in Japan. And that again basically bodes well going forward as to the strength of our business there. I think in terms of your question, how that relates to the Pacific, you need to look at I think the full year results of the Pacific. It was, from an income perspective, overall positive. And it's about the timing, and it's about marketing. Expenses also. How they're sort of distributed over the year. In terms of Brazil, I would say that Brazil -- I could just summarize by saying volume was up 1% for the full year. General slowdown of the economy and unfavorable weather did impact our business, but we are outperforming the industry, gaining share across all categories for the quarter and the full year. And I think you should expect sequential improvement in Brazil as we move through 2012. As far as Philippines is concerned, we've had essentially a difficult year as we continue to transform that business as it needs to be transformed into a healthy situation for the long term. And think about our German business, it took us a while to get it going again. We believe that certainly, the worst has passed us in the Philippines and that we should have -- in terms of also the tough macroeconomic environment post the elections has lingered on. But we believe that 2012 will be a better year in the Philippines than -- 2012 will be a better year than 2011. And I think Gary just wants to add something."

Today, I'm pleased to share The Coca-Cola Company continues to operate from a position of real strength. Our brands continue to get stronger. Our strategies continue to be sound, and our execution continues to be focused and effective. All of this continues to drive sustainable growth and continues to bring us closer to achieving our 2020 Vision. One day, one week, one month and one quarter at a time. Thanks to the extraordinary determination and resolve of our 146,000 company associates around the world, we delivered volume and revenue growth this quarter in every one of our 5 geographic operating groups. And we achieved financial results for both the quarter and the full year in line with or ahead of our long-term growth targets, making this the seventh consecutive quarter we have either met or exceeded our long-term growth targets.
Our global sparkling beverage portfolio kept growing, up 2% for the quarter and a solid 4% for the full year. Our global still beverage portfolio is also performing well, up 6% for the quarter and a strong 8% for the full year. And we gained global volume and value share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages, while also gaining global share in both sparkling and still beverage categories. We achieved these results for both the quarter and the full year against the backdrop of a volatile global economic landscape. Even as we believe that the unease in the global markets will continue in the near term, the breadth of our global footprint and the strength of our brands create a business that was built for times like these, resilient and resolute to grow.
Our solid performance in 2011 reflects the consistent investments we have made over time to strengthen the health of our brands, starting with brand Coca-Cola, the very oxygen of our business, up 3% in both the quarter and the full year. In fact, brand Coca-Cola grew by at least 24 million servings in 24 different countries this past quarter. Our brand health and brand value have been created over the long-term through strong and consistent investments in our business, rather than through short-term incremental actions. And this is why we remain so committed to our long-term brand investment strategies. Our 2011 performance results underscore how our company, together with our global bottling partners, is well aligned and positioned to lead in this difficult environment.
As we enter into the third year of our 2020 Vision, our roadmap for winning together remains clear to us and our committed bottling partners. The assumptions that shaped our vision have not changed. Our expectations for strong performance have not wavered. The key to our calculus for growth and achieving our 2020 Vision will be to ensure that we keep creating balanced growth across both emerging and developed markets, as well as sparkling and still categories.
We successfully achieved this balance in 2011. For the full year, we delivered almost 1 billion unit cases of incremental organic volume growth, or the equivalent of adding another Japan to our business. And importantly, we delivered positive full year growth in key developed markets like North America, Japan and Germany, while also generating double-digit full year growth in key emerging markets like India and China. And we will continue to make significant investments in our future, all across the world.
In fact, in order to achieve our 2020 Vision, we anticipate our global system will add about 100,000 jobs in this decade as we invest to support the tremendous opportunity we see in nonalcoholic beverages, one of the fastest-growing industries in consumer packaged goods.
So let's review our fourth quarter and full year results. Worldwide, we grew volume 3% this quarter, in line with our long-term growth target. For the full year, we grew worldwide volume by 5%, including the benefit of cross-licensed brands, primarily Dr. Pepper in North America. Excluding these brands, we delivered strong full year volume growth of 4%, also in line with our long-term target.
As for our profit results, we grew comparable earnings per share by 10% for both the quarter and the full year, ahead of our long-term target. As we close the second year of our 2020 Vision, this also marks the second consecutive year we've delivered double-digit comparable earnings per share growth. 
Now let's briefly review performance results across our operating groups, beginning first with North America where our team remains focused on driving profitable and sustainable growth. North America volume was up 1% in the quarter, making this North America's seventh consecutive quarter of growth. And for the full year, North America's organic volume growth was also up 1%.
The North America business gained total market volume and value share in sparkling, still and nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages in both the quarter and the full year. And we delivered these strong results while in the process of successfully integrating the largest acquisition in our company's history. Our sparkling beverage results in North America were even for the quarter, with brand Coca-Cola volume up 1%. We achieved these results while also earning an increase in retail pricing of 4% in sparkling beverages through the effective execution of our occasion-based brand, package, price and channel strategies.
As for Coke Zero, it was up high-single digits in North America this past quarter and up double digits for the full year, making this the fifth consecutive year of double-digit growth. We also drove positive growth for Fanta, which was up 3% in 2011, its second consecutive year of positive growth.
Our still beverages in North America delivered 3% growth in the quarter and 4% growth for the full year while gaining share for the seventh consecutive quarter. POWERADE continues to be a leading driver of this solid growth, up 11% in the quarter and 12% for the full year. And POWERADE once again captured both volume and value share in the sports drinks category, both for the quarter and for the full year. Our key brands delivered double-digit growth in the quarter led by Gold Peak, which grew double digits for the 19th consecutive quarter.
As we've always said, there's no other western developed market in the world that boasts as dynamic the demographics as those present in North America between now and 2020. Young, vibrant, diverse, educated and entrepreneurial. We like these attributes and have every reason to remain excited about the long-term outlook of our flagship market.
Turning now to our Pacific Group where in 2011, our business again delivered consistent growth across a diverse set of markets. Overall, our Pacific Group volume was up 5% in both the quarter and the full year, and these results were led by China, up double digits in the quarter and for the full year, making this 9 out of the last 10 years that our business in China has delivered double-digit growth.
Our efforts to enhance the consumer experience with our sparkling beverage brands keep paying dividends, with sparkling beverages up double digits in China for both the quarter and the full year. Importantly, we're seeing strong growth across our entire sparkling portfolio, with Coca-Cola, Sprite and Fanta all delivering double-digit growth in both the fourth quarter as well as in the full year 2011.
At the same time, our still beverage portfolio brands are sustaining their solid momentum, also delivering double-digit growth for the full year. These results confirm that we are executing the right strategies and have the right capabilities in place in China to deliver sustainable double-digit growth over the long-term.
Japan's fourth quarter results were up 5%, resulting in slightly positive full year growth, rounding to even. This is a better-than-anticipated full year result in light of the tragic national disasters that occurred last March. This also underscores the strength and resilience of our people and brands across the entire Japanese bottling system. Notably, we realized greater momentum across several key channels in Japan this quarter, including convenience stores and vending as we further increase our focus on single-serve beverages.
Moving now to Latin America where in 2011 we once again expanded our volume and value share leadership position. Volume in this total region was up 4% in the quarter and 6% for the full year. This strong performance was once again led by Mexico, up 4% for the quarter and 9% for the full year. Our business in Mexico gained volume and value share in both sparkling and still beverages for both the quarter and the full year. In fact, our still beverage portfolio in Mexico reached nearly 1 billion unit cases in 2011, a short 4 years after the successful integration of Jugos Del Valle into our winning portfolio.
The rapid evolution of our brands in Mexico is a great testament to our team's ability to execute clear, occasion-based channel strategies across all beverage categories in this key market. We're also advancing our momentum in Argentina, which delivered double-digit full year growth while capturing volume and value share in both sparkling and still beverages for the 12th consecutive quarter.
And finally, Brazil, volume was up 1% for the full year. Despite a general slowdown in the economy and unfavorable weather, our business in Brazil keeps outperforming the industry, gaining share across both sparkling and still beverages in both for the quarter as well as the full year.
Let's now turn to the Eurasia and Africa Group. In 2011, we made sound progress against our goal to strategically invest for tomorrow while gaining share today. Volume in this region grew 4% in the quarter and a solid 6% for the full year. Importantly, our growth in Eurasia and Africa was driven by the continued strong momentum of brand Coca-Cola, up 5% in the quarter and 7% for the full year 2011.
Our overall performance in this key region was once again led by India, which delivered 20% growth for the quarter, resulting in double-digit growth for the full year. 2011 was the fifth consecutive year that India achieved double-digit growth. And that’s been the case throughout 2011, growth in India was well balanced across our entire portfolio. Sparkling beverages in India were up over 20% this quarter while brand Coca-Cola was up a strong 15%. And still beverages in India were up 16% this quarter, benefiting from a healthy growth across our juice portfolio, including Maaza, up 19%.
Russia was down low-single digits in the quarter, fourth quarter, cycling last year's very strong 31% growth. On a full year basis, our business in Russia was up mid-single digits. Our business in Russia is being led by the strong growth of brand Coca-Cola, which delivered double-digit growth in 2011. Brand Coca-Cola is now more than twice the size of our primary competitor's cola brand in Russia. Notably, our overall business in Russia keeps outperforming the rest of the industry, gaining both sparkling and still beverage volume and value share.
Turning to Turkey. We gained volume and value share this quarter in both sparkling and still beverages. For 2011, Turkey again delivered double-digit growth as it did the previous year in 2010. And despite geopolitical challenges in the region, our Middle East and North Africa business unit delivered a solid 7% in the quarter and 8% for the full year.
A clear example of our commitment to invest in tomorrow in this exciting Middle East region is our recently announced agreement to acquire approximately half of the equity of Aujan Industries. Aujan holds the #1 position in the still beverage business across the entire Middle East. Their brands hold a top 3 position in every market where they compete. This strong partnership with Aujan, coupled with the strength of our bottling partners, will make the Coca-Cola system a leader in the fast-growing still beverage category in the Middle East.
Let's now turn to Europe, a region of the world that is still facing a very uncertain economic environment. Yet, for The Coca-Cola Company, it is also a region that serves as a testament to how well our system is positioned to face these serious economic challenges. Our business in Europe grew 1% in the quarter, making this Europe's sixth consecutive quarter of volume growth, resulting in a full year growth rate of 2%. We achieved these results by strategically tailoring our price and package offerings to meet the needs of each market and their varying economic conditions. Our growth in Europe was widespread, with positive fourth quarter and full year growth across several key markets in Northwest Europe and Spain. And we saw the continued growth of Innocent, supported by the successful launch of not-from-concentrate juice in Great Britain. Our growth in Europe was once again led by Germany, up a very strong 9% for the quarter and up 6% for the full year, representing our best full year growth result in Germany since 1992.
While some of this growth should be attributed to favorable weather and consumer sentiment, there's no doubt that our bottling restructuring efforts as well as effective marketing campaigns have played a key role in this improvement. We're confident that our business in Germany is in a sound position to continue delivering long-term sustainable growth.
Looking ahead to 2012 and 2013. Despite the lingering debt crisis coupled with economic and political uncertainty, we are confident that we have the right brands, the right structure, the right strategies and right capabilities in place to continue delivering profitable growth in Europe over the longer term.
Now let's turn to an overview of how we are building our brands. As we've said before, we always place our brands first in all that we do, across more than 200 countries all around the world. This is how we've built the world's most valuable beverage brand portfolio, with 15 $1 billion brands, more than any other beverage company. Our top 4 brands: Coca-Cola, Sprite, Fanta and Diet Coke, all once again exceeded $10 billion in global retail sales in 2011. A key component of how we strengthen our global brand portfolio is through innovative consumer engagement. We continuously strive to engage with our consumers in an integrated manner across all social media platforms. A recent example of our efforts in this front was this past weekend's very successful Super Bowl campaign where we engaged fans like never before. Through a unique online viewing experience, fans got to chat with our animated polar bears and see their game reactions. And they watched the bears move from the digital realm of the TV as they starred in 3 new well-received and highly rated TV commercials. And an estimated 300,000-plus fans joined the polar bears live, far exceeding expectations. And by the second quarter, the Coca-Cola Facebook feed was receiving 3,400 hits per second. This is just one of the -- a string of marketing achievements for our company.
Recently, we were humbled by the Advertising Age naming The Coca-Cola Company as its 2011 Marketer of the Year. And it's gratifying to see our global marketing efforts recognized by this industry-leading publication as we strive to develop and deploy the world's most innovative and effective marketing.
Let me update you now on our progress around winning at the point of sale. Our system continues to develop critical capabilities to better support over 20 million customers we partner with each and every week to deliver these servings. We measure our progress against this effort by tracking our results across several high-impact, pragmatic and locally actionable metrics. One metric we have referenced several times this past year is our immediate consumption volume growth. And this metric is meaningful as it drives trial, drives recruitment and system profitability. In 2011, our immediate consumption beverages were up 4% globally, driven by focused in-store activation efforts and cold drink equipment expansion. In fact, as a global system, we've placed over 1.2 million new pieces of cold drink equipment in 2011 and have placed over 2.2 million since 2010, the first year of our 2020 Vision.
Another key metric we monitor closely is the expansion of our right execution daily, or RED program in short. Some of you may remember RED as our world-class commercial process designed to improve execution at the outlet level. Today, operations representing over 1/3 of our global volume utilize RED. And for comparison, when we initiated our 2020 Vision just 3 years ago, less than 15% of our global volume was distributed through operations using RED. So as we move into 2012, our RED program will remain an area of increasing emphasis, focus and growth for our system.
Before concluding our operating results review, I'd like to update you on our productivity goals. A leading priority of our company is to design and implement an effective and efficient business system, with productivity as one of our core pillars of our 2020 Vision. As such, in 2012, we're implementing a new 4-year productivity and reinvestment program that we will -- we expect will achieve between $550 million and $650 million of total incremental annualized savings by the end of 2015. I'm pleased and excited to announce this program from a position of continued growth and momentum towards realizing our 2020 Vision as we consistently deliver results in line with or ahead of our long-term targets. This program will further enable our efforts to strengthen our brands and reinvest our resources to drive long-term profitable growth.
We remain relentless in our efforts to become more efficient, leaner and adaptive to changing market conditions, while at the same time building a continuous improvement in cost management culture in keeping with our 2020 Vision. Gary is going to share further details about this new 4-year program in a few moments.
Finally, I also want to highlight some of the important progress we're making in the area of sustainable packaging, water stewardship and climate protection. By the end of 2011, we've shipped nearly 10 billion PlantBottle packages, helping reduce our annual emissions of carbon dioxide, while also decreasing our dependency on oil-based resin. As noted in our latest Sustainability Report, we improved our water use efficiency for the eighth consecutive year, reducing the average amount of water required to produce each beverage serving. We estimate that we replenished 35% of the water used in our finished products due to some 380-plus community water partnerships in 94 countries as we work toward our goal of water neutrality by 2020. And we increased our production volume while reducing our system-wide global carbon emissions by 2%, putting us a step closer to our goal of growing our business but not our carbon.
These are just a few examples of how we're building our business responsibly by making a positive difference in the communities that we serve -- we proudly serve. These efforts are helping us engage with consumers, reduce our cost of doing business and improve our bottom line.
We are keenly aware of how uncertain the global economic landscape remains today. That said, as we look ahead, we see a world looking for hope, for optimism and for renewal. The Coca-Cola Company and the Coca-Cola system is uniquely positioned to refresh this thirsty world. We're refreshing the thirst of our investors consistently by delivering high-quality returns to shareowners, while also generating steady cash flows and paying a steady healthy dividend. We're refreshing the needs of thirsty global consumers through our diverse brand portfolio and the world's most innovative and effective marketing. We're refreshing the needs of a thirsty system by increasing our levels of global investment along with our dedicated bottling partners. We're refreshing our operations through a culture of continuous improvement. And central to this is extending and driving productivity efforts to design and implement a more effective and efficient business system. And we are refreshing the needs of our communities through global and industry sustainability leadership.
The nonalcoholic ready-to-drink industry grew by $35 billion in total retail value in 2011. We're pleased to say that our Coca-Cola system represented more than 40% of this total industry growth, underscoring that our 2020 Vision is working well. And while 2011 was another strong year of performance for The Coca-Cola Company, we believe we are just getting started and that our best and brightest days lie ahead.
We have a lot to be thankful for, and confident about healthy and beloved brand, a clear roadmap for continued growth, a well-aligned global bottling system, dedicated and passionate associates and strong financial results and discipline. Taking into account all of these assets to our business, we remain resolute in our desire and confident in our ability to achieve our long-term growth targets and further enhance the value of your investment in The Coca-Cola Company.
With that, let me now turn the call over to Gary."
26642,145599866,216847,"The Coca-Cola Company, Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 07, 2012",2012-02-07,"Earnings Calls","The Coca-Cola Company","Executives","Thanks, Muhtar, and good morning, everyone. We once again delivered quality results this quarter and for the full year, in line with or ahead of our long-term growth targets. In fact, our full year volume and profit results were in line with or exceeded o",1945,"Thanks, Muhtar, and good morning, everyone. We once again delivered quality results this quarter and for the full year, in line with or ahead of our long-term growth targets. In fact, our full year volume and profit results were in line with or exceeded our long-term growth targets for the sixth consecutive year. We continue to achieve these consistent high-quality results during a period of still mixed economic recovery, which is a real testament to our global system's ability to execute our strategic plans in alignment with our 2020 Vision.
So let's review our earnings results in more detail. We reported comparable earnings per share of $0.79 this quarter, up 10% versus the prior year. Our full year comparable earnings per share growth also was up 10%, ahead of our long-term growth targets. For the quarter, comparable currency neutral operating income was up 14%, bringing our full year comparable currency neutral operating income growth to 12%, also ahead of our long-term growth target. For clarity, the impact of currency on our comparable operating income results was a 3% headwind for the quarter and a 3% benefit for the full year, right in line with the quarterly and full year outlook range we've provided during our last earnings call in October. Our business delivered comparable currency neutral net revenue growth of 6% this quarter, in line with our long-term growth target, including a 5% increase in concentrate sales and positive price mix.
On a full year basis, our comparable currency neutral net revenue growth came in at 29%, including a 5% increase in concentrate sales, positive price mix and the impact of the CCE transaction. And again, for clarity, the impact of currency on our comparable net revenue results was a 1% headwind for the quarter and a 3% benefit for the full year.
Our combined international and bottling investments group price product mix was a positive 3% for the quarter. And our North American price product mix came in at a positive 2% in the quarter, driven by a 4% increase in our pricing to retailers for our sparkling beverages in North America.
Our consolidated geographic mix was down 1%, which resulted in a consolidated price mix at the midpoint of our long-term target range of 1% to 2%. For 2012, we anticipate our consolidated price mix results will remain in this target range of 1% to 2%.
Turning to the rest of our P&L. We expected our consolidated comparable gross revenues to decrease slightly in 2011, which they did due to increased commodity cost, as well as the impact of our acquisition of CCE's North American bottling operations. Importantly, we expect our 2012 consolidated comparable gross margins will remain in line with 2011, even after taking into consideration further commodity cost inflation, which I'll discuss in a few minutes.
Our comparable currency neutral SG&A expenses were even in the quarter and up 30% for the full year. As explained in prior quarterly calls, this full year increase reflects the impact of acquiring CCE's former North American business, which we did not fully cycle until the fourth quarter of 2011. The increase in SG&A also reflects our continued investments around the world. On this front, for the full year 2011, we grew our direct marketing expenses ahead of unit case growth, sustaining our commitment to invest in the health and the strength of our brands.
As for operating expense leverage, it came in positive this quarter for both North America and the Bottling Investments Group. As expected, operating expense leverage for our international operations came in slightly negative in the fourth quarter due to the timing of expenses. And operating expense leverage for international came in at even for the full year as planned.
For 2012, we expect to capture low-single digit operating expense leverage as we keep strategically investing in brand-building activities around the world and efficiently managing our operating expenses.
Our net interest income came in at a positive $66 million, slightly above the full year forecast we provided in our last earnings call. For 2012, our best estimate is that net interest income will come in between $20 million and $40 million, primarily due to lower interest rates in some international locations. We expect this income to be spread relatively evenly across the quarters in 2012, and we'll update you each quarter as appropriate. Finally, we closed 2011 with an underlying effective tax rate of 23.9% and expect our 2012 underlying effective tax rate to fall between 24% and 25%. 
Moving to our cash flow from operations. Year-to-date, this came in at $9.5 billion. As a reminder, this cash flow result includes $769 million contribution made to our pension plans in the first quarter of 2011. Net of these additional pension plan contributions, we grew our net cash flow from operations a positive 7% for the full year.
With regards to our share repurchase program, our net share repurchases totaled $2.9 billion in 2011, at the high end of the $2.5 billion to $3 billion range communicated during our last earnings call. And in 2012, we again expect to repurchase a net share amount within the same $2.5 billion to $3 billion range.
Now let me take a moment to update our outlook on several additional items that may help you model our business in 2012, starting with a quick reminder about this year's calendar. Even though 2012 is a leap year, our first quarter of 2012 will have one less day when compared to the first quarter of 2011. And the fourth quarter of 2012 will have 2 more days when compared to the fourth quarter of 2011.
Now let me come back with our outlook on commodities. As we indicated in our last earnings call, our incremental commodity costs for 2011 came in at approximately $800 million. As a reminder, these costs were related to the raw material and conversion costs associated with sweeteners, metals, juices and PET plastic.
As we look ahead to 2012, we anticipate the underlying commodities related to these inputs will remain somewhat pressured, driven primarily by increases in the cost of juices and sweeteners. As a result, we expect the full year 2012 incremental impact of commodity costs on our results to range between $350 million and $450 million. Having said that, we believe we have the right strategic plans in place to mitigate the impact of these incremental commodity costs and remain confident in our ability to achieve our long-term growth targets.
Turning now to currency. These have continued to fluctuate with the dollar strengthening, although more moderately against many key currencies. We're mostly hedged for 2012 on the euro and yen, with good coverage on several other currencies. After considering these hedged positions, we currently expect currencies to have a low single-digit negative impact on operating income for the first quarter of this year and a mid-single digit negative impact for the full year. As per our normal practice, we'll update you both on our commodity and currency forecast on a quarterly basis as we go through the year.
Now let me update you on our productivity goals. As we closed 2011, we've now successfully completed our 2008 to 2011 4-year global productivity program. We completed this program on plan and with actual annualized savings of over $500 million, exceeding our initial savings target of $400 million to $500 million. As Muhtar mentioned earlier, we're now launching a new 4-year productivity and reinvestment program. In light of this, I want to take a moment and walk you through the components of the new program.
First, a new 4-year global productivity initiative starting this year. This initiative will target between $350 million and $400 million in annualized savings focused around 4 primary areas: one, global supply chain optimization; two, global marketing and innovation effectiveness; three, OpEx leverage and operational excellence; and four, data and IT systems standardization. We're in the initial stages of defining the one-time costs associated with capturing these savings, and we'll provide an update on these costs in our next earnings call.
Second, as we move through 2011, we accelerated our CCR integration efforts to support brand-building initiatives, reinvest in marketing and sales capabilities, as well as to partially offset some of last year's increasing commodity costs. As a result, we effectively realized nearly all of the $350 million in annualized savings in 2011, almost 3 years ahead of schedule. This is a testament to the great work of our CCR team and their ability to effectively realize and capture synergies while simultaneously delivering profitable growth.
Further, we have successfully identified incremental CCR integration synergies in North America, primarily in the area of our North American product supply, which will better enable us to service our customers and consumers. As such, we now believe our CCR integration efforts will capture an incremental $200 million to $250 million above our original $350 million target. And we expect to capture these incremental annualized synergies starting this year in 2012 and fully realize them by the end of 2015.
Correspondingly, we're also increasing our estimate of total one-time cost associated with the capture of CCR synergies from $425 million to $800 million as we implement new initiatives to capture these higher synergies. Therefore, combining both our new global productivity initiative and our newly expanded CCR integration efforts represents a total incremental annualized savings of $550 million to $650 million. We expect to phase in the capture of these total incremental savings over 4 years, starting in 2012 through the end of 2015.
Going forward, we'll report our progress in capturing these total incremental savings under one joint productivity and reinvestment program.
As for how we intend to invest the savings generated by this new program, first, and in line with our 2020 Vision, these funds will enhance ongoing system-wide brand-building initiatives. And second, as these savings are realized, they may also help mitigate potential incremental near-term commodity costs.
As we look back on 2011, we are greatly encouraged by our business achieving yet another solid year of quality results. There is no better proof that our 2020 Vision is working than our company's continued ability to consistently deliver results that meet or exceed our long-term growth targets even while facing volatile market conditions. And as you consider how to model our business going forward, I want to be very clear that our system remains fully committed to continuing our relative historic price premium for our brands in the marketplace. For as we have communicated several times in the past, we strongly believe and have consistently proven that the best way to drive long-term sustainable value is by earning price with our consumers in concert with a robust occasion-based brand package and channel strategy that drives profitable sustainable growth.  That is why we remain confident we can keep delivering results in line with our long-term growth targets. Our system is healthy and financially strong. We continue to generate cash, invest in our brands, execute our 2020 Vision and growth strategies and pay a healthy dividend. Our seasoned management team, over 146,000 motivated company associates and highly capable global bottling partners are making the right actions and executing the right strategies to build on our strengths, to refresh a thirsty world and to drive our 2020 Vision.
Before concluding our prepared remarks, I want to remind you that I'm looking forward to presenting at CAGNY in Boca Raton on Wednesday, February 22; as well as at the CAGE Conference in London on Wednesday, March 21. I hope to see many of you there at these great investor and analyst events.

I mean, I think, first, I don't think you can draw any trend. And we're pleased with our volume growth of 3%, which is in line with our long-term growth targets. And I think it's important to note the following: We're cycling an organic volume growth",482,"Yes. I mean, I think, first, I don't think you can draw any trend. And we're pleased with our volume growth of 3%, which is in line with our long-term growth targets. And I think it's important to note the following: We're cycling an organic volume growth of 5% in the prior year, and full year volume is 4%, at organically high end of our long-term growth target for the year. And I'm really particularly pleased that all operating groups grew in the quarter. So a cornerstone of our vision is balanced growth across all geographies and balanced growth across our portfolio. We achieved that both for the quarter and for the year. And I don't think you can draw any conclusions. And also, we achieved this kind of growth in the year with not only just a very volatile economic environment, volatile commodity environment, but also one-offs like the issue in the Japan, the flooding in Thailand, rightsizing in a huge market like China where now our transactions are significantly ahead of our volume, which is a testament to the health of the business. And so yes, we've had some -- there has been some dislocations in some Middle East markets because of the volatility there, because of what's happened like Egypt and like other parts in North Africa. We believe that we see that improving. There's been -- South East Europe has been under tremendous pressure. Again, those markets are under 150 per capita because of all the volatility that's going on in Europe and around Greece. But I think we shouldn't draw any conclusions. As we look into 2012, we see healthy trends continuing in Latin America, healthy trends continuing in Eurasia and Africa -- African continent and also Middle East and Eurasia. We see healthy trends in most of the Pacific Rim and area, and we see healthy trends right here in North America. Right now, we see better trends in terms of the consumer mobility, eating out more and just less confusion of the consumer here in North America than we did 12 months ago. And we see that manifesting itself in our Foodservice business. And Europe, finally, I think, is going to be more volatile. And I think we will probably see first half of the year being more challenged in Europe than the second half of the year. That's sort of the way I would sum it. But I do -- in Europe, we have some great markets continuing to grow like Germany, like Scandinavia, like Northwest Europe. And then we still have challenging markets in the Southern Rim. Although again we had moderate growth in Spain also in the fourth quarter. So I believe that we will achieve our long-term growth targets over time in terms of volume, as well as also in terms of our ability to generate price mix across the world."

And that's what I would say because I think there is never room in business for irrationality over the long term. And that's how I would project. And I think we have -- we're going into this from a point of strength. Our brands are stronger. Our system is much stronger. Our metrics for customer service are much, much better, and I see us continuing with our momentum. And I think pricing actions should continue into 2012 in terms of rationality. And we anticipate taking additional pricing on key segments of the business through this year in accordance with our normal commercial practices. And we manage a very broad portfolio of our business. That's how I would reference it. In terms of international, I think you heard Gary talk about a 3% price mix in international, and I believe that, that's a testament again to the strength of our international business, which continues to be able to generate good price mix on top of good volume and still growing our market share.

And I would characterize it this way: that is a very good thing for the long-term. And that may sound unusual for me to say. But what it means is that we are continuing to invest and grow all of the emerging markets around the world. Most of those do have margins below the U.S. or Europe, for example, the more developed markets. But we're not milking the business. We're continuing to grow the business. At the same time, get very healthy margins in the business, and you can see those coming through the bottom line. So we continue to strengthen the whole business globally. As long as we're doing the right thing, I think you're going to see a negative geographic mix for a very long time, because what you want to see is healthy growth in emerging markets. You want to see very good growth in India. You want to see very good growth in China, et cetera. And at the same time, as Muhtar said, and critically important, then growth actually across every geographic region in which we operate. But when you put all that together, you will get negative geographic growth, and I think that's a great thing. But in total, as long as it's coming out in our 1% to 2% range, in the quarter it came out right in the middle of that, we're exactly where we want to be."

I forgot to -- on rightsizing in -- I'll characterize it this way. In China, what we're able to do is actually take the entry-level pack from a 600 ml down to a 500 ml size bottle at the same price. So we actually gave the consumer something they actually preferred at the same price, which implicitly carries a price increase inside of that. So from there, we actually generated margin. For the U.S., what we're very focused on is ensuring we’re giving the consumer -- this is back to that occasion-based, right package, right channel, right time, right place, giving the consumer what they want. This is the way you drive profitable, sustainable growth and deliver margins rather than just taking a couple of sizes, stacking it high and selling it cheap."

Let me just start answering your question and then Gary can come in also. But I think in terms of the overall businesses concerned, we believe that we can definitely continue to achieve a balanced portfolio and balanced geographic growth. And I think it is really critical for us to be able to do that, as we've done in '09, '10 and '11. And we have reason to believe that we can grow across Western markets, and we can grow across, certainly across at a higher rate, across our emerging markets, and that you'll see that continuing. And as we continue to gain scale in the emerging markets, you will continue to see our margins improving in those markets as they have been doing in the last 3, 4 years. So I will just say that yes, definitely balanced across geographies, North America, Japan, Europe. And then certainly, again, broad-based in the portfolio, both in sparkling and in still beverages. And still beverages growth that I mentioned in Latin America, for example, and the fact that it's an almost -- it's got to 1 billion cases in Mexico after 4 short years after Jugos Del Valle got integrated successfully into our business and now it's in many, many markets, flourishing in many markets across Latin America, is just another testament of still how much growth Latin America has still to offer. And the good news is that again, the growth -- as we build on growth on Jugos Del Valle, it hasn't stopped in any way the growth of sparkling beverages that continue to flourish and continue to prosper in Latin America."

And so I think it's one of those things that's going to help us in that market as well. Relative to gross margins, I'd say what you should expect to see is you should have seen increasing margins. But what's happening is with that $350 million to $450 million of commodity pressure, what we're doing is we believe we can offset that and hold our margins with the pricing actions that we're taking in the market, as well as the productivity efforts that we're taking as well. So it's really those commodity pressures that, again, granted are half of what they were in '11, but still substantial in 2012."

In fourth quarter, first clean quarter in lapping CCE acquisition, your profit was up 25%. I think the benefit that you called out in Q1, the timing shift on marketing, was about 7 points. So even excluding that, it looks like the profit was up pretty nicely in fourth quarter. So maybe a little bit of color as to what drove that profit improvement in Q4. And then as you think about 2012, you've got moderating inflation, you've got pricing that went into the marketplace, you've got cost synergies and cost savings coming through, why wouldn't we expect to see a pretty healthy profit growth in North America in 2012?"

Relative to the fourth quarter performance on North America, you do see very healthy increase. A lot of that is actually what we're cycling. Because a lot of the marketing in the fourth quarter in legacy CCE, when we acquired it, there was a lot of marketing that was spent in the fourth quarter of 2010 that CCE had already planned and then we executed against in that fourth quarter. This year actually got spread through the year. So it was a timing of marketing, and so there are a few of those type anomalies. If you remember, if you go back I think I said in the third quarter call, that the fourth quarter of this year will be the first quarter that's actually comparable, but there are still some unusual things in the fourth quarter of 2010 that you need to go back and make sure you look at. So I just -- I'd say, everyone on the call, if you're interested in that, go back and look at some of those things. And what you'll see, it'll actually bring that profit increase down. It's still a nice increase and profitable, but it'll bring it down some in the fourth quarter of 2011. Relative to 2012, let me just say I hear you, and we are very enthusiastic about our business in North America. It is operating well. They were able to do one of the largest vertical integrations in the history of business and do it flawlessly, get basically 4 years of synergies in the first year, increased those synergies and at the same time continue to execute and take share in the market in a very profitable way. So I feel very good about North America, I'm bullish on North America. And we've got a very capable team over there executing every day."

But if you look at Brazil, which is one of the big ones, it's been a pretty big move. Brazil strengthened significantly during last year then weakened significantly, and now it's coming back some. But it's a lot of these smaller emerging market currencies that are giving that impact. Now with that said, if you -- let me just tell you, give you some idea of the volatility. The swing of currencies on our earnings in 2012 in the last month is over $100 million in the last 30 days. And that's an improvement, by the way. Because we're seeing those kind of volatilities, we're seeing a lot of those emerging market currencies starting to come back, and they're coming back as the world is starting to accept a little risk where there was total risk aversion a month -- 6 weeks ago. So is there some upside? I hope so, but I don't know today. Because of the volatility, we just don't know.

And I think that we ended up slightly positive despite all the dislocations in Japan. And that again basically bodes well going forward as to the strength of our business there. I think in terms of your question, how that relates to the Pacific, you need to look at I think the full year results of the Pacific. It was, from an income perspective, overall positive. And it's about the timing, and it's about marketing. Expenses also. How they're sort of distributed over the year. In terms of Brazil, I would say that Brazil -- I could just summarize by saying volume was up 1% for the full year. General slowdown of the economy and unfavorable weather did impact our business, but we are outperforming the industry, gaining share across all categories for the quarter and the full year. And I think you should expect sequential improvement in Brazil as we move through 2012. As far as Philippines is concerned, we've had essentially a difficult year as we continue to transform that business as it needs to be transformed into a healthy situation for the long term.

Today, I'm pleased to share The Coca-Cola Company continues to operate from a position of real strength. Our brands continue to get stronger. Our strategies continue to be sound, and our execution continues to be focused and effective. All of this continues to drive sustainable growth and continues to bring us closer to achieving our 2020 Vision. One day, one week, one month and one quarter at a time. Thanks to the extraordinary determination and resolve of our 146,000 company associates around the world, we delivered volume and revenue growth this quarter in every one of our 5 geographic operating groups. And we achieved financial results for both the quarter and the full year in line with or ahead of our long-term growth targets, making this the seventh consecutive quarter we have either met or exceeded our long-term growth targets.
Our global sparkling beverage portfolio kept growing, up 2% for the quarter and a solid 4% for the full year. Our global still beverage portfolio is also performing well, up 6% for the quarter and a strong 8% for the full year. And we gained global volume and value share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages, while also gaining global share in both sparkling and still beverage categories. We achieved these results for both the quarter and the full year against the backdrop of a volatile global economic landscape. Even as we believe that the unease in the global markets will continue in the near term, the breadth of our global footprint and the strength of our brands create a business that was built for times like these, resilient and resolute to grow.
Our solid performance in 2011 reflects the consistent investments we have made over time to strengthen the health of our brands, starting with brand Coca-Cola, the very oxygen of our business, up 3% in both the quarter and the full year. In fact, brand Coca-Cola grew by at least 24 million servings in 24 different countries this past quarter. Our brand health and brand value have been created over the long-term through strong and consistent investments in our business, rather than through short-term incremental actions. And this is why we remain so committed to our long-term brand investment strategies. Our 2011 performance results underscore how our company, together with our global bottling partners, is well aligned and positioned to lead in this difficult environment.
As we enter into the third year of our 2020 Vision, our roadmap for winning together remains clear to us and our committed bottling partners. The assumptions that shaped our vision have not changed. Our expectations for strong performance have not wavered. The key to our calculus for growth and achieving our 2020 Vision will be to ensure that we keep creating balanced growth across both emerging and developed markets, as well as sparkling and still categories.
We successfully achieved this balance in 2011. For the full year, we delivered almost 1 billion unit cases of incremental organic volume growth, or the equivalent of adding another Japan to our business. And importantly, we delivered positive full year growth in key developed markets like North America, Japan and Germany, while also generating double-digit full year growth in key emerging markets like India and China. And we will continue to make significant investments in our future, all across the world.
In fact, in order to achieve our 2020 Vision, we anticipate our global system will add about 100,000 jobs in this decade as we invest to support the tremendous opportunity we see in nonalcoholic beverages, one of the fastest-growing industries in consumer packaged goods.
So let's review our fourth quarter and full year results. Worldwide, we grew volume 3% this quarter, in line with our long-term growth target. For the full year, we grew worldwide volume by 5%, including the benefit of cross-licensed brands, primarily Dr. Pepper in North America. Excluding these brands, we delivered strong full year volume growth of 4%, also in line with our long-term target.
As for our profit results, we grew comparable earnings per share by 10% for both the quarter and the full year, ahead of our long-term target. As we close the second year of our 2020 Vision, this also marks the second consecutive year we've delivered double-digit comparable earnings per share growth. 
Now let's briefly review performance results across our operating groups, beginning first with North America where our team remains focused on driving profitable and sustainable growth. North America volume was up 1% in the quarter, making this North America's seventh consecutive quarter of growth. And for the full year, North America's organic volume growth was also up 1%.
The North America business gained total market volume and value share in sparkling, still and nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages in both the quarter and the full year. And we delivered these strong results while in the process of successfully integrating the largest acquisition in our company's history. Our sparkling beverage results in North America were even for the quarter, with brand Coca-Cola volume up 1%. We achieved these results while also earning an increase in retail pricing of 4% in sparkling beverages through the effective execution of our occasion-based brand, package, price and channel strategies.
As for Coke Zero, it was up high-single digits in North America this past quarter and up double digits for the full year, making this the fifth consecutive year of double-digit growth. We also drove positive growth for Fanta, which was up 3% in 2011, its second consecutive year of positive growth.
Our still beverages in North America delivered 3% growth in the quarter and 4% growth for the full year while gaining share for the seventh consecutive quarter. POWERADE continues to be a leading driver of this solid growth, up 11% in the quarter and 12% for the full year. And POWERADE once again captured both volume and value share in the sports drinks category, both for the quarter and for the full year. Our key brands delivered double-digit growth in the quarter led by Gold Peak, which grew double digits for the 19th consecutive quarter.
As we've always said, there's no other western developed market in the world that boasts as dynamic the demographics as those present in North America between now and 2020. Young, vibrant, diverse, educated and entrepreneurial. We like these attributes and have every reason to remain excited about the long-term outlook of our flagship market.
Turning now to our Pacific Group where in 2011, our business again delivered consistent growth across a diverse set of markets. Overall, our Pacific Group volume was up 5% in both the quarter and the full year, and these results were led by China, up double digits in the quarter and for the full year, making this 9 out of the last 10 years that our business in China has delivered double-digit growth.
Our efforts to enhance the consumer experience with our sparkling beverage brands keep paying dividends, with sparkling beverages up double digits in China for both the quarter and the full year. Importantly, we're seeing strong growth across our entire sparkling portfolio, with Coca-Cola, Sprite and Fanta all delivering double-digit growth in both the fourth quarter as well as in the full year 2011.
At the same time, our still beverage portfolio brands are sustaining their solid momentum, also delivering double-digit growth for the full year. These results confirm that we are executing the right strategies and have the right capabilities in place in China to deliver sustainable double-digit growth over the long-term.
Japan's fourth quarter results were up 5%, resulting in slightly positive full year growth, rounding to even. This is a better-than-anticipated full year result in light of the tragic national disasters that occurred last March. This also underscores the strength and resilience of our people and brands across the entire Japanese bottling system. Notably, we realized greater momentum across several key channels in Japan this quarter, including convenience stores and vending as we further increase our focus on single-serve beverages.
Moving now to Latin America where in 2011 we once again expanded our volume and value share leadership position. Volume in this total region was up 4% in the quarter and 6% for the full year. This strong performance was once again led by Mexico, up 4% for the quarter and 9% for the full year. Our business in Mexico gained volume and value share in both sparkling and still beverages for both the quarter and the full year. In fact, our still beverage portfolio in Mexico reached nearly 1 billion unit cases in 2011, a short 4 years after the successful integration of Jugos Del Valle into our winning portfolio.
The rapid evolution of our brands in Mexico is a great testament to our team's ability to execute clear, occasion-based channel strategies across all beverage categories in this key market. We're also advancing our momentum in Argentina, which delivered double-digit full year growth while capturing volume and value share in both sparkling and still beverages for the 12th consecutive quarter.
And finally, Brazil, volume was up 1% for the full year. Despite a general slowdown in the economy and unfavorable weather, our business in Brazil keeps outperforming the industry, gaining share across both sparkling and still beverages in both for the quarter as well as the full year.
Let's now turn to the Eurasia and Africa Group. In 2011, we made sound progress against our goal to strategically invest for tomorrow while gaining share today. Volume in this region grew 4% in the quarter and a solid 6% for the full year. Importantly, our growth in Eurasia and Africa was driven by the continued strong momentum of brand Coca-Cola, up 5% in the quarter and 7% for the full year 2011.
Our overall performance in this key region was once again led by India, which delivered 20% growth for the quarter, resulting in double-digit growth for the full year. 2011 was the fifth consecutive year that India achieved double-digit growth. And that’s been the case throughout 2011, growth in India was well balanced across our entire portfolio. Sparkling beverages in India were up over 20% this quarter while brand Coca-Cola was up a strong 15%. And still beverages in India were up 16% this quarter, benefiting from a healthy growth across our juice portfolio, including Maaza, up 19%.
Russia was down low-single digits in the quarter, fourth quarter, cycling last year's very strong 31% growth. On a full year basis, our business in Russia was up mid-single digits. Our business in Russia is being led by the strong growth of brand Coca-Cola, which delivered double-digit growth in 2011. Brand Coca-Cola is now more than twice the size of our primary competitor's cola brand in Russia. Notably, our overall business in Russia keeps outperforming the rest of the industry, gaining both sparkling and still beverage volume and value share.
Turning to Turkey. We gained volume and value share this quarter in both sparkling and still beverages. For 2011, Turkey again delivered double-digit growth as it did the previous year in 2010. And despite geopolitical challenges in the region, our Middle East and North Africa business unit delivered a solid 7% in the quarter and 8% for the full year.
A clear example of our commitment to invest in tomorrow in this exciting Middle East region is our recently announced agreement to acquire approximately half of the equity of Aujan Industries. Aujan holds the #1 position in the still beverage business across the entire Middle East. Their brands hold a top 3 position in every market where they compete. This strong partnership with Aujan, coupled with the strength of our bottling partners, will make the Coca-Cola system a leader in the fast-growing still beverage category in the Middle East.
Let's now turn to Europe, a region of the world that is still facing a very uncertain economic environment. Yet, for The Coca-Cola Company, it is also a region that serves as a testament to how well our system is positioned to face these serious economic challenges. Our business in Europe grew 1% in the quarter, making this Europe's sixth consecutive quarter of volume growth, resulting in a full year growth rate of 2%. We achieved these results by strategically tailoring our price and package offerings to meet the needs of each market and their varying economic conditions. Our growth in Europe was widespread, with positive fourth quarter and full year growth across several key markets in Northwest Europe and Spain. And we saw the continued growth of Innocent, supported by the successful launch of not-from-concentrate juice in Great Britain. Our growth in Europe was once again led by Germany, up a very strong 9% for the quarter and up 6% for the full year, representing our best full year growth result in Germany since 1992.
While some of this growth should be attributed to favorable weather and consumer sentiment, there's no doubt that our bottling restructuring efforts as well as effective marketing campaigns have played a key role in this improvement. We're confident that our business in Germany is in a sound position to continue delivering long-term sustainable growth.
Looking ahead to 2012 and 2013. Despite the lingering debt crisis coupled with economic and political uncertainty, we are confident that we have the right brands, the right structure, the right strategies and right capabilities in place to continue delivering profitable growth in Europe over the longer term.
Now let's turn to an overview of how we are building our brands. As we've said before, we always place our brands first in all that we do, across more than 200 countries all around the world. This is how we've built the world's most valuable beverage brand portfolio, with 15 $1 billion brands, more than any other beverage company. Our top 4 brands: Coca-Cola, Sprite, Fanta and Diet Coke, all once again exceeded $10 billion in global retail sales in 2011. A key component of how we strengthen our global brand portfolio is through innovative consumer engagement. We continuously strive to engage with our consumers in an integrated manner across all social media platforms. A recent example of our efforts in this front was this past weekend's very successful Super Bowl campaign where we engaged fans like never before. Through a unique online viewing experience, fans got to chat with our animated polar bears and see their game reactions. And they watched the bears move from the digital realm of the TV as they starred in 3 new well-received and highly rated TV commercials. And an estimated 300,000-plus fans joined the polar bears live, far exceeding expectations. And by the second quarter, the Coca-Cola Facebook feed was receiving 3,400 hits per second. This is just one of the -- a string of marketing achievements for our company.
Recently, we were humbled by the Advertising Age naming The Coca-Cola Company as its 2011 Marketer of the Year. And it's gratifying to see our global marketing efforts recognized by this industry-leading publication as we strive to develop and deploy the world's most innovative and effective marketing.
Let me update you now on our progress around winning at the point of sale. Our system continues to develop critical capabilities to better support over 20 million customers we partner with each and every week to deliver these servings. We measure our progress against this effort by tracking our results across several high-impact, pragmatic and locally actionable metrics. One metric we have referenced several times this past year is our immediate consumption volume growth. And this metric is meaningful as it drives trial, drives recruitment and system profitability. In 2011, our immediate consumption beverages were up 4% globally, driven by focused in-store activation efforts and cold drink equipment expansion. In fact, as a global system, we've placed over 1.2 million new pieces of cold drink equipment in 2011 and have placed over 2.2 million since 2010, the first year of our 2020 Vision.
Another key metric we monitor closely is the expansion of our right execution daily, or RED program in short. Some of you may remember RED as our world-class commercial process designed to improve execution at the outlet level. Today, operations representing over 1/3 of our global volume utilize RED. And for comparison, when we initiated our 2020 Vision just 3 years ago, less than 15% of our global volume was distributed through operations using RED. So as we move into 2012, our RED program will remain an area of increasing emphasis, focus and growth for our system.
Before concluding our operating results review, I'd like to update you on our productivity goals. A leading priority of our company is to design and implement an effective and efficient business system, with productivity as one of our core pillars of our 2020 Vision. As such, in 2012, we're implementing a new 4-year productivity and reinvestment program that we will -- we expect will achieve between $550 million and $650 million of total incremental annualized savings by the end of 2015. I'm pleased and excited to announce this program from a position of continued growth and momentum towards realizing our 2020 Vision as we consistently deliver results in line with or ahead of our long-term targets. This program will further enable our efforts to strengthen our brands and reinvest our resources to drive long-term profitable growth.
We remain relentless in our efforts to become more efficient, leaner and adaptive to changing market conditions, while at the same time building a continuous improvement in cost management culture in keeping with our 2020 Vision. Gary is going to share further details about this new 4-year program in a few moments.
Finally, I also want to highlight some of the important progress we're making in the area of sustainable packaging, water stewardship and climate protection. By the end of 2011, we've shipped nearly 10 billion PlantBottle packages, helping reduce our annual emissions of carbon dioxide, while also decreasing our dependency on oil-based resin. As noted in our latest Sustainability Report, we improved our water use efficiency for the eighth consecutive year, reducing the average amount of water required to produce each beverage serving. We estimate that we replenished 35% of the water used in our finished products due to some 380-plus community water partnerships in 94 countries as we work toward our goal of water neutrality by 2020. And we increased our production volume while reducing our system-wide global carbon emissions by 2%, putting us a step closer to our goal of growing our business but not our carbon.
These are just a few examples of how we're building our business responsibly by making a positive difference in the communities that we serve -- we proudly serve. These efforts are helping us engage with consumers, reduce our cost of doing business and improve our bottom line.
We are keenly aware of how uncertain the global economic landscape remains today. That said, as we look ahead, we see a world looking for hope, for optimism and for renewal. The Coca-Cola Company and the Coca-Cola system is uniquely positioned to refresh this thirsty world. We're refreshing the thirst of our investors consistently by delivering high-quality returns to shareowners, while also generating steady cash flows and paying a steady healthy dividend. We're refreshing the needs of thirsty global consumers through our diverse brand portfolio and the world's most innovative and effective marketing. We're refreshing the needs of a thirsty system by increasing our levels of global investment along with our dedicated bottling partners. We're refreshing our operations through a culture of continuous improvement. And central to this is extending and driving productivity efforts to design and implement a more effective and efficient business system. And we are refreshing the needs of our communities through global and industry sustainability leadership.
The nonalcoholic ready-to-drink industry grew by $35 billion in total retail value in 2011. We're pleased to say that our Coca-Cola system represented more than 40% of this total industry growth, underscoring that our 2020 Vision is working well. And while 2011 was another strong year of performance for The Coca-Cola Company, we believe we are just getting started and that our best and brightest days lie ahead.
We have a lot to be thankful for, and confident about healthy and beloved brand, a clear roadmap for continued growth, a well-aligned global bottling system, dedicated and passionate associates and strong financial results and discipline. Taking into account all of these assets to our business, we remain resolute in our desire and confident in our ability to achieve our long-term growth targets and further enhance the value of your investment in The Coca-Cola Company.
With that, let me now turn the call over to Gary."
26642,145599866,217020,"The Coca-Cola Company, Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 07, 2012",2012-02-07,"Earnings Calls","The Coca-Cola Company","Executives","Thanks, Muhtar, and good morning, everyone. We once again delivered quality results this quarter and for the full year, in line with or ahead of our long-term growth targets. In fact, our full year volume and profit results were in line with or exceeded o",1945,"Thanks, Muhtar, and good morning, everyone. We once again delivered quality results this quarter and for the full year, in line with or ahead of our long-term growth targets. In fact, our full year volume and profit results were in line with or exceeded our long-term growth targets for the sixth consecutive year. We continue to achieve these consistent high-quality results during a period of still mixed economic recovery, which is a real testament to our global system's ability to execute our strategic plans in alignment with our 2020 Vision.
So let's review our earnings results in more detail. We reported comparable earnings per share of $0.79 this quarter, up 10% versus the prior year. Our full year comparable earnings per share growth also was up 10%, ahead of our long-term growth targets. For the quarter, comparable currency neutral operating income was up 14%, bringing our full year comparable currency neutral operating income growth to 12%, also ahead of our long-term growth target. For clarity, the impact of currency on our comparable operating income results was a 3% headwind for the quarter and a 3% benefit for the full year, right in line with the quarterly and full year outlook range we've provided during our last earnings call in October. Our business delivered comparable currency neutral net revenue growth of 6% this quarter, in line with our long-term growth target, including a 5% increase in concentrate sales and positive price mix.
On a full year basis, our comparable currency neutral net revenue growth came in at 29%, including a 5% increase in concentrate sales, positive price mix and the impact of the CCE transaction. And again, for clarity, the impact of currency on our comparable net revenue results was a 1% headwind for the quarter and a 3% benefit for the full year.
Our combined international and bottling investments group price product mix was a positive 3% for the quarter. And our North American price product mix came in at a positive 2% in the quarter, driven by a 4% increase in our pricing to retailers for our sparkling beverages in North America.
Our consolidated geographic mix was down 1%, which resulted in a consolidated price mix at the midpoint of our long-term target range of 1% to 2%. For 2012, we anticipate our consolidated price mix results will remain in this target range of 1% to 2%.
Turning to the rest of our P&L. We expected our consolidated comparable gross revenues to decrease slightly in 2011, which they did due to increased commodity cost, as well as the impact of our acquisition of CCE's North American bottling operations. Importantly, we expect our 2012 consolidated comparable gross margins will remain in line with 2011, even after taking into consideration further commodity cost inflation, which I'll discuss in a few minutes.
Our comparable currency neutral SG&A expenses were even in the quarter and up 30% for the full year. As explained in prior quarterly calls, this full year increase reflects the impact of acquiring CCE's former North American business, which we did not fully cycle until the fourth quarter of 2011. The increase in SG&A also reflects our continued investments around the world. On this front, for the full year 2011, we grew our direct marketing expenses ahead of unit case growth, sustaining our commitment to invest in the health and the strength of our brands.
As for operating expense leverage, it came in positive this quarter for both North America and the Bottling Investments Group. As expected, operating expense leverage for our international operations came in slightly negative in the fourth quarter due to the timing of expenses. And operating expense leverage for international came in at even for the full year as planned.
For 2012, we expect to capture low-single digit operating expense leverage as we keep strategically investing in brand-building activities around the world and efficiently managing our operating expenses.
Our net interest income came in at a positive $66 million, slightly above the full year forecast we provided in our last earnings call. For 2012, our best estimate is that net interest income will come in between $20 million and $40 million, primarily due to lower interest rates in some international locations. We expect this income to be spread relatively evenly across the quarters in 2012, and we'll update you each quarter as appropriate. Finally, we closed 2011 with an underlying effective tax rate of 23.9% and expect our 2012 underlying effective tax rate to fall between 24% and 25%. 
Moving to our cash flow from operations. Year-to-date, this came in at $9.5 billion. As a reminder, this cash flow result includes $769 million contribution made to our pension plans in the first quarter of 2011. Net of these additional pension plan contributions, we grew our net cash flow from operations a positive 7% for the full year.
With regards to our share repurchase program, our net share repurchases totaled $2.9 billion in 2011, at the high end of the $2.5 billion to $3 billion range communicated during our last earnings call. And in 2012, we again expect to repurchase a net share amount within the same $2.5 billion to $3 billion range.
Now let me take a moment to update our outlook on several additional items that may help you model our business in 2012, starting with a quick reminder about this year's calendar. Even though 2012 is a leap year, our first quarter of 2012 will have one less day when compared to the first quarter of 2011. And the fourth quarter of 2012 will have 2 more days when compared to the fourth quarter of 2011.
Now let me come back with our outlook on commodities. As we indicated in our last earnings call, our incremental commodity costs for 2011 came in at approximately $800 million. As a reminder, these costs were related to the raw material and conversion costs associated with sweeteners, metals, juices and PET plastic.
As we look ahead to 2012, we anticipate the underlying commodities related to these inputs will remain somewhat pressured, driven primarily by increases in the cost of juices and sweeteners. As a result, we expect the full year 2012 incremental impact of commodity costs on our results to range between $350 million and $450 million. Having said that, we believe we have the right strategic plans in place to mitigate the impact of these incremental commodity costs and remain confident in our ability to achieve our long-term growth targets.
Turning now to currency. These have continued to fluctuate with the dollar strengthening, although more moderately against many key currencies. We're mostly hedged for 2012 on the euro and yen, with good coverage on several other currencies. After considering these hedged positions, we currently expect currencies to have a low single-digit negative impact on operating income for the first quarter of this year and a mid-single digit negative impact for the full year. As per our normal practice, we'll update you both on our commodity and currency forecast on a quarterly basis as we go through the year.
Now let me update you on our productivity goals. As we closed 2011, we've now successfully completed our 2008 to 2011 4-year global productivity program. We completed this program on plan and with actual annualized savings of over $500 million, exceeding our initial savings target of $400 million to $500 million. As Muhtar mentioned earlier, we're now launching a new 4-year productivity and reinvestment program. In light of this, I want to take a moment and walk you through the components of the new program.
First, a new 4-year global productivity initiative starting this year. This initiative will target between $350 million and $400 million in annualized savings focused around 4 primary areas: one, global supply chain optimization; two, global marketing and innovation effectiveness; three, OpEx leverage and operational excellence; and four, data and IT systems standardization. We're in the initial stages of defining the one-time costs associated with capturing these savings, and we'll provide an update on these costs in our next earnings call.
Second, as we move through 2011, we accelerated our CCR integration efforts to support brand-building initiatives, reinvest in marketing and sales capabilities, as well as to partially offset some of last year's increasing commodity costs. As a result, we effectively realized nearly all of the $350 million in annualized savings in 2011, almost 3 years ahead of schedule. This is a testament to the great work of our CCR team and their ability to effectively realize and capture synergies while simultaneously delivering profitable growth.
Further, we have successfully identified incremental CCR integration synergies in North America, primarily in the area of our North American product supply, which will better enable us to service our customers and consumers. As such, we now believe our CCR integration efforts will capture an incremental $200 million to $250 million above our original $350 million target. And we expect to capture these incremental annualized synergies starting this year in 2012 and fully realize them by the end of 2015.
Correspondingly, we're also increasing our estimate of total one-time cost associated with the capture of CCR synergies from $425 million to $800 million as we implement new initiatives to capture these higher synergies. Therefore, combining both our new global productivity initiative and our newly expanded CCR integration efforts represents a total incremental annualized savings of $550 million to $650 million. We expect to phase in the capture of these total incremental savings over 4 years, starting in 2012 through the end of 2015.
Going forward, we'll report our progress in capturing these total incremental savings under one joint productivity and reinvestment program.
As for how we intend to invest the savings generated by this new program, first, and in line with our 2020 Vision, these funds will enhance ongoing system-wide brand-building initiatives. And second, as these savings are realized, they may also help mitigate potential incremental near-term commodity costs.
As we look back on 2011, we are greatly encouraged by our business achieving yet another solid year of quality results. There is no better proof that our 2020 Vision is working than our company's continued ability to consistently deliver results that meet or exceed our long-term growth targets even while facing volatile market conditions. And as you consider how to model our business going forward, I want to be very clear that our system remains fully committed to continuing our relative historic price premium for our brands in the marketplace. For as we have communicated several times in the past, we strongly believe and have consistently proven that the best way to drive long-term sustainable value is by earning price with our consumers in concert with a robust occasion-based brand package and channel strategy that drives profitable sustainable growth.  That is why we remain confident we can keep delivering results in line with our long-term growth targets. Our system is healthy and financially strong. We continue to generate cash, invest in our brands, execute our 2020 Vision and growth strategies and pay a healthy dividend. Our seasoned management team, over 146,000 motivated company associates and highly capable global bottling partners are making the right actions and executing the right strategies to build on our strengths, to refresh a thirsty world and to drive our 2020 Vision.
Before concluding our prepared remarks, I want to remind you that I'm looking forward to presenting at CAGNY in Boca Raton on Wednesday, February 22; as well as at the CAGE Conference in London on Wednesday, March 21. I hope to see many of you there at these great investor and analyst events.

I mean, I think, first, I don't think you can draw any trend. And we're pleased with our volume growth of 3%, which is in line with our long-term growth targets. And I think it's important to note the following: We're cycling an organic volume growth",482,"Yes. I mean, I think, first, I don't think you can draw any trend. And we're pleased with our volume growth of 3%, which is in line with our long-term growth targets. And I think it's important to note the following: We're cycling an organic volume growth of 5% in the prior year, and full year volume is 4%, at organically high end of our long-term growth target for the year. And I'm really particularly pleased that all operating groups grew in the quarter. So a cornerstone of our vision is balanced growth across all geographies and balanced growth across our portfolio. We achieved that both for the quarter and for the year. And I don't think you can draw any conclusions. And also, we achieved this kind of growth in the year with not only just a very volatile economic environment, volatile commodity environment, but also one-offs like the issue in the Japan, the flooding in Thailand, rightsizing in a huge market like China where now our transactions are significantly ahead of our volume, which is a testament to the health of the business. And so yes, we've had some -- there has been some dislocations in some Middle East markets because of the volatility there, because of what's happened like Egypt and like other parts in North Africa. We believe that we see that improving. There's been -- South East Europe has been under tremendous pressure. Again, those markets are under 150 per capita because of all the volatility that's going on in Europe and around Greece. But I think we shouldn't draw any conclusions. As we look into 2012, we see healthy trends continuing in Latin America, healthy trends continuing in Eurasia and Africa -- African continent and also Middle East and Eurasia. We see healthy trends in most of the Pacific Rim and area, and we see healthy trends right here in North America. Right now, we see better trends in terms of the consumer mobility, eating out more and just less confusion of the consumer here in North America than we did 12 months ago. And we see that manifesting itself in our Foodservice business. And Europe, finally, I think, is going to be more volatile. And I think we will probably see first half of the year being more challenged in Europe than the second half of the year. That's sort of the way I would sum it. But I do -- in Europe, we have some great markets continuing to grow like Germany, like Scandinavia, like Northwest Europe. And then we still have challenging markets in the Southern Rim.

And I would characterize it this way: that is a very good thing for the long-term. And that may sound unusual for me to say. But what it means is that we are continuing to invest and grow all of the emerging markets around the world. Most of those do have margins below the U.S. or Europe, for example, the more developed markets. But we're not milking the business. We're continuing to grow the business. At the same time, get very healthy margins in the business, and you can see those coming through the bottom line. So we continue to strengthen the whole business globally. As long as we're doing the right thing, I think you're going to see a negative geographic mix for a very long time, because what you want to see is healthy growth in emerging markets. You want to see very good growth in India. You want to see very good growth in China, et cetera.

And as we continue to gain scale in the emerging markets, you will continue to see our margins improving in those markets as they have been doing in the last 3, 4 years. So I will just say that yes, definitely balanced across geographies, North America, Japan, Europe. And then certainly, again, broad-based in the portfolio, both in sparkling and in still beverages. And still beverages growth that I mentioned in Latin America, for example, and the fact that it's an almost -- it's got to 1 billion cases in Mexico after 4 short years after Jugos Del Valle got integrated successfully into our business and now it's in many, many markets, flourishing in many markets across Latin America, is just another testament of still how much growth Latin America has still to offer.

And so I think it's one of those things that's going to help us in that market as well. Relative to gross margins, I'd say what you should expect to see is you should have seen increasing margins. But what's happening is with that $350 million to $450 million of commodity pressure, what we're doing is we believe we can offset that and hold our margins with the pricing actions that we're taking in the market, as well as the productivity efforts that we're taking as well. So it's really those commodity pressures that, again, granted are half of what they were in '11, but still substantial in 2012."

Relative to the fourth quarter performance on North America, you do see very healthy increase. A lot of that is actually what we're cycling. Because a lot of the marketing in the fourth quarter in legacy CCE, when we acquired it, there was a lot of marketing that was spent in the fourth quarter of 2010 that CCE had already planned and then we executed against in that fourth quarter. This year actually got spread through the year. So it was a timing of marketing, and so there are a few of those type anomalies. If you remember, if you go back I think I said in the third quarter call, that the fourth quarter of this year will be the first quarter that's actually comparable, but there are still some unusual things in the fourth quarter of 2010 that you need to go back and make sure you look at. So I just -- I'd say, everyone on the call, if you're interested in that, go back and look at some of those things. And what you'll see, it'll actually bring that profit increase down. It's still a nice increase and profitable, but it'll bring it down some in the fourth quarter of 2011. Relative to 2012, let me just say I hear you, and we are very enthusiastic about our business in North America. It is operating well. They were able to do one of the largest vertical integrations in the history of business and do it flawlessly, get basically 4 years of synergies in the first year, increased those synergies and at the same time continue to execute and take share in the market in a very profitable way.

But if you look at Brazil, which is one of the big ones, it's been a pretty big move. Brazil strengthened significantly during last year then weakened significantly, and now it's coming back some. But it's a lot of these smaller emerging market currencies that are giving that impact. Now with that said, if you -- let me just tell you, give you some idea of the volatility. The swing of currencies on our earnings in 2012 in the last month is over $100 million in the last 30 days. And that's an improvement, by the way. Because we're seeing those kind of volatilities, we're seeing a lot of those emerging market currencies starting to come back, and they're coming back as the world is starting to accept a little risk where there was total risk aversion a month -- 6 weeks ago. So is there some upside? I hope so, but I don't know today. Because of the volatility, we just don't know.

In terms of Brazil, I would say that Brazil -- I could just summarize by saying volume was up 1% for the full year.

So high-single digits. It was not anything close to 20%."

Let me begin by saying that I'm pleased with our first quarter results. I've never been more excited about the prospects for our brands, as well as our system, or more proud of our people who are driving our consistent and quality performance results.
We continue to deliver volume, value and profit growth as we enter the third year of our 2020 Vision. And we once again saw positive volume growth across every one of our 5 geographic operating groups. We also continue to gain volume and value share globally in the nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages and in every Sparkling and Still Beverage category in which we compete. We are winning with our global sparkling beverage portfolio, which was up a solid 4% this past quarter, led by the global growth of brand Coca-Cola, which was up also a healthy 4%.
And we are continuing to win with our global Still Beverage portfolio, which grew a strong 9% this quarter. As we stand a little less than a quarter of the way into our journey towards our 2020 Vision, a today's results demonstrate yet again how we are passionately and effectively refreshing a thirsty world with a capable, resilient and advantaged global bottling system. 
Before reviewing our quarterly operating results, let's take a few moments to address today's mixed global economic environment. With respect to Europe, we are observing ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty as 2012 unfolds. Austerity measures implemented across the region are weighing on consumer confidence, which recently reached its lowest level since the first quarter of 2009.  Despite the challenges in Europe, we are executing on all fronts to drive performance and share gains.  So while we expect the macroeconomic conditions will remain difficult in Europe throughout 2012, we remain cautiously encouraged by our performance in this market. 
Turning to the United States, despite its struggle with a sustained period of relative high unemployment, we're pleased to see some early signs of a slowly improving macroeconomic environment. We remain firmly committed to building strong brands and creating value in the United States to capture more than our fair share of the industry's profitable growth.
Finally, let me touch on recent macroeconomic developments across a couple of key BRIC markets. In China, we've all seen economists lower their 2012 GDP growth rate forecast. While we agree that there has been some moderate slowdown in China, we also believe that this is a national progression and that it is a positive for the long-term sustainable growth of the country.  As we move through 2012, we anticipate that our business in China may not be immune to this cooling economy, and therefore, we may also see our volume results in China moderate to some extent.  Having said that, we are confident that China will continue to serve as a double-digit growth market for our business over the long term.
As for Brazil, which underwent a cooling down period of its own in 2011, there are now signs of improving consumer sentiment. We expect this trend to hold as we move through the balance of 2012 with our business in Brazil continuing to gain market share.
In summary, we always find ourselves operating in a fast evolving global environment, one with some economies slowing, other economies stabilizing while sustaining high unemployment and still others improving and well in their way to recovery.  In all cases, we remain intently focused on realizing our 2020 Vision, and we will keep investing through these challenging times to drive long-term advantaged and sustainable growth.
So if we have learned anything these past few years, it is that during times of ongoing uncertainty, consumers are even thirstier for brands that inspire real moments of optimism and happiness.
Turning now to our total company performance results, our volume grew 5% in the quarter, ahead of our long-term target, fueled by organic volume growth in all 5 geographic operating groups.  As for our financial results, we grew comparable currency-neutral net revenue by 7%, and we grew comparable currency-neutral operating income by 8% once you adjust for the cycling of lower commodity cost in the prior period.  As such, we remain confident in our ability to deliver full year 2012 operating income results in line with our long-term targets.
Now let's review our performance results across our global markets in more detail, beginning with North America, our flagship market. Our North America business was up 2%, delivering an eighth consecutive quarter of growth. Importantly, our North America system once again led the industry, capturing volume and value share in Nonalcoholic Ready-to-drink beverages. Our Sparkling Beverages in North America were up 1% in the quarter, with brand Coca-Cola also positive in the quarter, while further improving its brand health scores.  The momentum behind both Coke Zero as well as Fanta continues with these brands up 9% and 4% respectively this quarter, and we also earned higher pricing in North America, which enabled us to generate a positive 3% price mix for both bottled, canned sparkling beverages, as well as our total North America beverage business.
Our Still Beverages is in North America were up 6% in the quarter, gaining both volume and value share, while delivering industry-leading results across many categories. In Sports Drinks, POWERADE grew double digits yet again this quarter, while once again capturing volume and value share. Our glacéau trademark grew 9%, also capturing volume and value share, led by another quarter of double-digit growth for both smartwater and vitaminwater zero. And our key performance again accelerated this quarter, up double digits, led by Gold Peak, which grew double digits for the 20th consecutive quarter.  And in Water, DASANI also expanded double digits this quarter, with the national rollout of our innovative PlantBottle that is positively impacting purchase intent and brand equity.
As we've said many times before, we believe North America is a growth market for our business. Despite a challenging competitive and macroeconomic backdrop, our results both validate this belief and provide us with every reason to remain optimistic about the long-term outlook for America.
Now let me turn to our Pacific Group which grew 8% in the quarter, including 6% growth for brand Coca-Cola. In China, the overall beverage industry was not immune from the impact of the economic slowdown we mentioned earlier, as well as the unseasonably cold weather that occurred during this quarter's Chinese new year celebration. Despite this, our business in China delivered a solid 9% growth this quarter while cycling a strong first quarter last year. And importantly, our rightsizing efforts are generating strong incremental transactions in line with our expectations. 
Sparkling Beverage transactions were up double digits this past quarter, driven by the expansion of our 300ml package. This helped us capture both volume and value share in the Sparkling Beverage category this quarter.
Just a few weeks ago, I was pleased and honored to inaugurate our 42nd bottling plant in China in Jing Tao. This new plant is now our largest production facility in China, with an expected annual production capacity of more than 5 billion servings of sparkling and still beverages. This new LEED-certified plant is part of our system's 3-year $4 billion China investment plant and reaffirms our strong commitment to China.
Japan's first quarter results were up 3%, building on the great work done by our system to restore and strengthen our business during a very challenging 2011.  Our Japan business gained both volume and value share in the Nonalcoholic Beverages this quarter. And is growth in Japan was broad-based, with numerous sparkling and still beverages delivering positive results, including brand Coca-Cola up 2%, Fanta up 6%, I LOHAS Water up 6% and Georgia Coffee up 3%. Additionally, our Japan business grew across all channels, including convenience stores and vending.
Also during the quarter, our Japan business unit was recognized with our company's highest honor, the 2011  Woodroof Cup based on the business unit's achievement of key performance metrics as set forth in our 2020 Vision.  As such, we remain confident that our system in Japan is well-aligned and in a strong position to deliver full year low single-digit growth in 2012.
I also want to call out 2 other markets within this diverse and dynamic geographic region of the world. First, our business in the Philippines is growing again, up mid single digits this past quarter, reflecting how the hard work put in by our Bottling Investment Group keeps yielding strong results. While we believe there is still much opportunity left to be captured in the Philippines, we also believe that our business there is on the right track, and that we are successfully building the capabilities needed to deliver consistent and sustainable growth.
Second, our business in Thailand grew over 20% in the first quarter, and brand Coca-Cola was up over 30% as we build momentum in this market while investing for the future.  We have planned in place to expand our beverage production capabilities in this fast-growing market, consistent with our systems culture of targeted investment that underpins our 2020 Vision.
Moving now to Latin America, our volume grew 5% for the quarter, including 4% growth for brand Coca-Cola. In the process, we gained additional share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages, as well as in both Sparkling and Still Beverages in Latin America this quarter. Latin America's solid first quarter results were driven by our consistent growth in Mexico, improved results in Brazil, and high single-digit growth in both our Latin center and South Latin regions. 
In Mexico, we delivered 3% growth, 14% from last year. We captured additional nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverage volume and value share in Mexico, and this is a further testament to our team's ability to execute clear occasion-based channel strategies across all beverage categories in our highest per capita market. 
As for Brazil, we reiterated many times last year that as this country's economy improve, so will our results. This quarter's 4% volume growth in Brazil validates this belief, and importantly, our continued volume and value share gains in Brazil are a testament to our sustained long-term growth strategies, which never wavered during last year's economic slowdown. Looking ahead, we expect our 2012 growth results in Brazil to remain steady at low to mid single digits as the Brazilian economy recovers.  And our commitment to the future of Brazil has never been stronger as shown by our system's recent announcement to accelerate our investments in Brazil to nearly $8 billion through 2016.
Our Eurasia and Africa business grew a strong 9% in the quarter, including solid 9% growth for brand Coca-Cola. Our overall group results were led by robust growth across the entire region, including growth in India, Russia, South Africa, the Middle East and North Africa. Overall performance was once again led by India, which grew 20% in the quarter, delivering balanced growth across all categories. 
I was particularly encouraged by brand Coca-Cola's 27% growth in India this past quarter. And our Still Beverages in India were up over 20% in the quarter, led by Maaza up over 30%. 
Russia was up 3% this quarter, cycling last year's strong 27% growth. Our business in Russia continues to be led by the strong momentum of brand Coca-Cola, which once again delivered double-digit growth.  Additionally, our Dobry Juice brand delivered 9% growth and as a result, our overall business in Russia keeps outperforming the rest of the industry, gaining nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverage volume and value share. 
Finally, we saw positive volume across growth in every other business unit in our Eurasia and Africa group, including double-digit growth in South Africa, as well as in the Middle East and North Africa region.  We are excited about the future opportunities for our business in this dynamic growing part of the world.
Moving now to Europe, volume is up 1%, gaining share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages. Notably, this is Europe's seventh consecutive quarter of positive growth. And this growth was led by Germany, which was up 3% for the quarter, capturing once again share in the nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages, as well as in both Sparkling and Still Beverage categories.
Brand Coca-Cola was up 4% this quarter in Germany, benefiting from both our effective marketing campaigns and our consumer recruitment initiatives. In total, this marks Germany's fifth consecutive quarter of positive growth. This consistency validates how our ongoing bottling restructuring efforts have enhanced our ability to create value during difficult economic times.
Another region where our business is showing signs of moderate improvement despite challenging economic conditions is Central and Southern Europe. Most markets in this region posted positive growth, including Italy, which was up 4% for the quarter. Another very important geography where we achieved positive results is Spain, up 6% for the quarter. We are closely monitoring our business in both of these markets in light of recently announced austerity measures. Importantly, we believe we have the right brands, the right strategies and the right capabilities in place to continue delivering long-term sustainable growth in Europe.
As we look ahead to this summer, both in Europe, as well as across the world, we are very excited about the unique opportunity to grow the value of our brands even further through our investments in the 2012 London Summer Olympic Games. For context, during the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics, we activated 36 markets across the globe. For this year Summer Olympics, we plan to activate almost 100 markets, leveraging content, experiences and conversations generated through our global program. This fully integrated 2012 global Olympic marketing program will be all about recruiting teams by tapping into emotional passion points like sports and music. 
An early success of this program is over 160,000 YouTube views of Mark Ronson's behind the scenes footage as he developed our new Olympics theme song.  These views were generated without any active promotions on our part, and once again, a clear example of how we are successfully engaging consumers with innovative, compelling and shareable social media content.
As we work to engage with our consumers, we're also committed to building a better tomorrow. Last month, we released our 2012 Global Water Stewardship and Replenishment report, detailing our ongoing work to reduce, recycle and replenish the water we use around the world. To date, our company has launched 386 Community Water Partnership projects in 94 countries. These projects have improved water access for 1.6 million people, including more than 0.25 million women and children in Africa.  In 2011 alone, our Community Water Partnership projects replenished 35% of the water used in our finished product beverages.  These projects also benefited the communities we serve by providing sustainable agriculture training and resources to more than 12,000 farmers and by supporting the reforestation of over 30,000 hectares.
As we build a better tomorrow, our efforts and performance are being recognized. This past quarter, we were humbly honored to receive several acknowledgments. Firstly, Fortune Magazine's survey of the Most Admired Companies listed us at #4 in their 2012 rankings, up from #6 in 2011, and up 20 spots from where we ranked just 5 years ago. In these same rankings, Fortune Magazine survey once again rated us as the #1 Most Admired Beverage Company in the world.
Secondly, Forbes also announced just 2 weeks ago that our company has risen to #7 in their publication's list of America's Most Reputable Companies, based on a consumer survey by Reputation Institute. This ranking is up from #25 in 2011.
We also saw our standing improve within the Harris Interactive Reputation Study, an annual survey that measures the corporate reputations of the 60 most visible companies in the U.S. In their latest survey, our company climbed to #3, up from 15th the previous year.
While all of us at The Coca-Cola Company are proud of these achievements, we understand that they only represent a snapshot of where we are today rather than where we aspire to be tomorrow. As I have stated many times before, the complexity and the challenge of today's mixed global economy also brings real opportunities and exciting growth prospects.
What was true on day 1 of our 2020 Vision is still true today. Our system has only just begun to achieve its potential. We have a clear roadmap for growth, a productivity and reinvestment program that is driving efficiencies and a global bottling system that well-aligned and poised for execution.  This strong alignment has not only enabled us to effectively navigate the volatility of these past several years, it has also put us in a position of real strength.  That is why we are confident that our Coca-Cola system will continue to passionately refresh a thirsty world, and create value for all of our consumers, customers and shareholders.
And with that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Gary."

We delivered strong results this quarter, underscoring once again that our global system is well-positioned to execute our strategic plans and alignment with our 2020 Vision. We reported comparable earnings pe",1165,"Thanks, Muhtar. And good morning, everyone. We delivered strong results this quarter, underscoring once again that our global system is well-positioned to execute our strategic plans and alignment with our 2020 Vision. 
We reported comparable earnings per share of $0.89 this quarter, up 3% versus the prior year. And as Muhtar shared earlier, our earnings growth was driven by broad-based volume growth across all of our 5 operating groups. In fact, we had volume growth across nearly all of our business units within our global operations this quarter.
Comparable currency-neutral operating income was up 5% this quarter. On a comparable basis, the impact of currency on this quarter's operating income results was a 2% headwind, in line with outlook we provided during our last earnings call in February.
In addition, and also as for the outlook we provided through this quarter, we cycled lower commodity costs in the first quarter of 2011. Adjusting for the 3% impact relating to the cycling of these lower commodity costs, our comparable currency-neutral operating income was up 8% in the first quarter of 2012.  When you also consider that this quarter had one less selling day than the first quarter of 2011, we are very pleased with this operating income results.
Comparable currency-neutral net revenue grew 7% this quarter, including a 3% increase in concentrate sales and 3% positive price mix. The currency impact on this quarter's comparable net revenue result was a 1% headwind.
This quarter's 3% consolidated price mix is particularly encouraging, especially when considering today's challenging macroeconomic conditions. Looking ahead, we still expect our full year 2012 consolidated price mix results to come in between 1% and 2% in line with our long-term target range.
This quarter's comparable gross margin was in line with our full year 2011 gross margin, consistent with outlook we provided earlier this quarter. As a reminder, we expect our full year 2012 consolidated comparable gross margin to remain in line with full year 2011.
Our comparable currency-neutral SG&A expenses were up 4% in the quarter as we sustained our commitment to invest in the health and the strength of our brands. As for operating expense leverage, it came in positive this quarter. For 2012, we still expect to capture low single-digit operating expense leverage as we further invest in strategic brand building initiatives around the world and effectively manage our operating expenses.
Our net interest income came in at $27 million this quarter ahead of our initial forecast, primarily due to a benefit related to our interest rate swaps. As such, and based on our current best estimates of interest rates in our international operations, we now expect our full year 2012 net interest income to come in at the higher end of the $20 million to $40 million range we provided in our last earnings call. In addition, we expect our net interest to come in close to even in the second quarter. We'll continue to update you on net interest outlook on a quarterly basis.
Our underlying effective tax rate currently stands at 24.8% within the 24% to 25% range we communicated during our last earnings call. As for our cash flow from operations, this increased 13% year-to-date. Please note that this cash flow result is net of the approximately $130 million in incremental contributions made to our pension plans this quarter when compared to the contributions we made to our pension plans in the first quarter of last year.
With regard to our share repurchase program, our net share repurchases during the quarter totaled nearly $850 million, including accruals for stock options and treasury shares that did not settle prior to the close of the quarter.  This places us well on track to achieve the $2.5 billion to $3 billion range for full year 2012 as we communicated during our last earnings call.
Now let me take a moment to remind you of our full year outlook on currencies and commodities, which we provided in our last earnings call. With regard to commodities, in our last call, we said that we expected the full year 2012  incremental impact of the big 4 commodity cost on our results to range between $350 million and $450 million. And just a reminder, the big 4 commodities are aluminum, sweetener, juice and PET.  While our commodity cost outlook remains unchanged, if current trends hold, we may see this outlook slowly improve in the coming months. And we'll update you on any changes to our outlook during our next earnings call.
As for currencies, based on our hedge positions, current spot rates and the cycling of our prior year rates, we continue to expect currencies to have a mid single-digit negative impact on operating income for the full year. Furthermore, we expect to see this impact come in at the high-end of this mid single-digit range in the second quarter.
Let me highlight one additional item for those that model our business. In light of the recent change to our global tea joint venture with Nestlé, and as a reminder, earlier this year, we announced our agreement with Nestlé to refocus the geographic scope of this joint venture primarily to Europe and Canada while phasing out the joint venture in most other territories by the end of 2012, accordingly, we have eliminated the joint venture volume from our reported results for both 2011 and 2012 in those territories where the joint venture is being phased out.  Please note that this change did not impact the company's reported volume results this quarter on a consolidated level or for any individual operating group.
Finally, with regard to our new productivity and reinvestment program, we reconfirm our expectations to capture total incremental annualized savings of $550 million to $650 million, phased over a 4-year period, starting in 2012 through the end of 2015. As noted on our last call, these funds will serve to enhance our ongoing systemwide brand building initiatives as we reinvest in our business to drive long-term profitable growth. We're still in the initial stages of defining the total onetime cost associated with the capture of these incremental annualized savings, and we'll provide an update on these costs during our next earnings call.
In summary, as we begin the third year of our 2020 Vision, we are greatly encouraged by our business, achieving yet another solid quarter of quality volume, value and profit results. Our system remains healthy and financially strong. We're generating cash, investing in our world-class brands, and executing our consistent growth strategies from a position of real strength.  And importantly, we continue to pay a healthy dividend.
Our seasoned leadership team and highly capable global bottling partners are taking the right actions and executing the right strategies to successfully realize our 2020 Vision. So while we're still navigating through on an ongoing mixed global economic recovery, we remain confident in our ability to deliver full year results in line with our long-term growth targets.

And then secondarily, maybe Gary, if you just talk about, if it's a -- given your potentially better view on costs balance of the year and the potential for some volume performance continuing to be doing well this year, just a better drop through of profitability, I guess, as we move through the year, if we can just talk a little bit about that as well."

I think what I'd like to just the message I'd like to get across is that we leave behind the first quarter of 2012 with confidence and with momentum in our business. And I think it is broad-based growth as you mentioned. In fact, the top 10 countries in our business generated about 65 -- a little over 65% of the total incremental growth cases, organic unit case growth in the quarter. And that is more broad-based than in the past. And that's a good sign. And I think we've always said that there's tremendous -- I see everywhere I go, I see tremendous opportunity for our brands. Our system is strong, our system is a result of investments that our system that continues to make every quarter and also, generating revenue and we're able to crack this calculus for growth. And everywhere we go, in this difficult macroeconomic environment, it's important to note that The Coca-Cola system is one of the most important net contributors to the economy. Globally, we're one of the top 10 private employers, nongovernmental employers, and we create, based on our vision, we will create an additional 120,000 new jobs in the next 10 years. And more and more, governments are recognizing that unemployment is the #1, #2, #3 priority. And I think with that, with our system, we're earning our right every day in every market. And that's important. Obviously, the macroeconomic conditions around the world is challenged. The recovery is slow. Unemployment remains high, and I believe will remain high as we go through this year. But the premise, Brian, on which we've built our 2020 Vision holds true today. What we said is no matter how you slice and dice it, there will be about 1 billion new people coming into the middle class. We'll have about 800 million new urbanized consumers in the decade. This decade that we're talking about, 2010 to 2020. Now the quarter we just left behind, about 22 million new urbanized consumers and about 22 million to 25 million new middle class have been created in the world. And we were there to serve their needs and refresh them. So yes, challenged environment; yes, slow recovery; yes, some slowing down in emerging markets, but when we talk about slowing down, you go down from a 9% to an 8.5% or and 8.2%. I think there is still tremendous amount of growth and middle class creation around the world, whether you take Africa, Latin America, Asia, and we are there.

As we look, it is still a challenged economic environment across the world. We have seen, if you think back actually first quarter of 2010, things look like economically, they were getting better, and then they didn't. First quarter of 2011 looked like things were getting better, and then they didn't. And then we've seen the significant volatility around commodities and currencies across the world over the last several years as well. So I think I guess where we are is trying to be somewhat conservative. And trying to say, we're 3 quarters -- or 3 months into the year, 1 quarter into the year, kind of the smallest quarter in fact, and I think we need to continue to go through the year. Are things looking better? Yes, it looks like interest is interest income is going to be a little bit better. Looks like if things hold, commodities will probably be better. So things are actually looking pretty good, but I think at this point, our view was we kind of hold with where we are. We kind of get through another quarter and kind of see how the year is going. Is the economic recovery that we're starting to slowly see in the U.S. going to continue or not. So that's kind of where we are. We're kind of being trying to be conservative and recognized that we are in this as a marathon and not as a sprint. This is about long-term value creation."

I just spent a good bit of time in Asia a couple of weeks ago. And I think you've seen the Pacific Group's volume growth up 8%, which was broad-based in the quarter with the numbers we've shared with you for places like not just China and Japan, up 9% and 3% restrictively, but also for Thailand and the Philippines and so forth. And I think importantly again, very encouraged that brand Coca-Cola is up 6% in that massive geography. And reported net revenue for the quarter up 12%. And I think -- and good price mix across. So it's important really to be able to ensure that when you have -- when we talk about sustainable growth, we mean growth, not just in volume, not just in a certain category, but broad-based growth, and also growth in the revenue line that can be matched or better than the volume line. And I think we've seen that. And yes, no question, everyone you talked to, whether it's the shop owner in any particular part of China, or whether it's the government, or whether it's some national government, there is a little cooling down. I think that's healthy. And I think that's healthy for the real estate market in China, that's healthy for the banking industry in China, that's healthy for the long-term sustainable growth of the economy in China, which I have no doubt is going to continue. So we see China as a fantastic opportunity. As I said, we just opened our largest to date facility in China, 42nd, and the largest of them all and LEED-certified on top of it. And that's again a sign of our commitment. Many more such factories to come in our $4 billion announced investment program for China. And so, I see China as certainly playing an important role for our 2020 Vision. I'm particularly pleased of our Japan, where I met with all our bottling partners in Tokyo and presented their Woodruff Cup Award for each of our bottling partners and again, category by category, we see very good improvement in our business in Japan. So the terrible tragedy of 2011 allowed us to galvanize our system and strengthen our system and continue to grow our system. And importantly, every channel, important channel, like convenience, like vending is now expected to grow Japan. And that's a very important thing for our business -- and categories, whether it's coffee with Georgia or sparkling or tea, again, we're generating growth. So prospects, I think overall, we've always said the picture of success in Japan is low single-digit growth. And I believe that we're poised well to achieve that target for Japan. And then I went to Thailand, where we're having, as I said, very good growth prospects and share gains, tremendous share gains in that important market, with a very healthy consumption habit for sparkling beverages. And I see, whether it's other markets like Vietnam or Indonesia, or West Asia, I see great prospects for our growth, and I'll soon be also heading towards West Asia in a couple of months. And again, you heard the results that we've been able to post this past quarter in India. Continue to have very healthy brand metrics for Coca-Cola and as well as our still brands there in that incredibly prospective geography.  So I think Asia, overall, little cooling, healthy and great long-term prospects for both our business, as well as I think leading the world out of some of the current global macro issues."

And then Gary, just on the profitability side in North America, if you can just walk us through the puts and takes in Q1 as it relates to cycling of the commodities and kind of for the balance of the year, how should we think about that phasing of commodities and the margins in North America as we go forward?"

I think we continue to see validation, a little more validation on what I indicated also in the previous call. There are some signs, healthier signs from the U.S. consumer right now than it was 12 months ago this time in terms of more travel, more mobility, more bookings and mobility is an important factor for our business for consumer goods. And also, I think eating out a little healthier numbers in terms of that whether we see compared to say 12to 16 months ago. Having said that -- and I do believe that, that trend is likely to continue, providing we can sort of have some prices at the pump for gasoline about where they stay now. So I premise that with that caveat. I think for -- we have always said that United States is a growth business. Despite the current macroeconomic challenges, we've been posting growth quarter after quarter. I'm very pleased that this past quarter also that Sparkling beverages was positive, brand Coca-Cola was positive. And we've started putting together the framework for our growth in North America, way before the acquisition of the CCC's business in North America. I want to reiterate that once again. The brand price pack channel architecture, beginning -- getting our brands to a better, healthier position than they were previously getting the right package to be sold at the right outlet and the right channel at the right price, all of that architecture we started working on 3 to 4 years ago. And I think we are seeing some results out of all of that work. And as I said, we believe that the positive sentiment that we see compared to a year ago, the U.S. consumer lightly positive sentiment would probably continue is what I would estimate providing other conditions hold, particularly price of gasoline.

And it's really working. Everything that Muhtar is talking about is actually working. And our brand score is getting better. Because of the things we have been doing over the last few years. But then if you look at, great, Gary, got that, but let's talk about financial results and you're showing that on a comparable basis, operating income is down 9% quarter on quarter. So how do you talk about that? Well on that one, that is the issue that I alerted. I think all of it too earlier this quarter. The way the commodities hit last year, that $800 million of commodity pressure that we had last year, it always in quarters 2, 3 and 4 basically. None of it in the numbers in Q1 in North America. So when you adjust for that for adjust commodities, that minus 9 actually gets to only slightly negative. And then you have to recognize that there was 1 less day. You adjust for that actually North America suddenly flips into it was actually positive. You take that then you look at remainder of year. And you recognize that we've gotten the pricing so that the commodities aren't going to be as big an issue going forward for the remainder of the year, and all the other things we've been doing we would expect to see North America in very good positive territory remainder of year. Things are going to, knock on wood, exactly the way we planned for them too at this point."

We did have share gains pretty much across the board, across the world and the U.S. So we did have share gains in Sparkling. On the commodity issue relative to North America, and if I don't exactly answer the question, come back and tell me, but basically, if you strip out the commodity impact, North America's OI for the quarter, instead of being down 9 would've been down 1 is exactly what it would've been. And then, if you add in an extra day, it would have been positive. So what you're seeing is that 1 day actually 1 less day is having a huge impact on the P&L because you've got basically all of the costs going through for the full quarter with a day less sales is basically what's happening, which is why when you go to Q2 and 3, actually it becomes much more normalized and the commodities are not an issue at all. In fact, it kind of reverses a little bit because you have more of that hitting in Q2 and 3 last year, with none of it hitting in Q1 last year. So it's kind of a cycling thing. But that's why when you adjust for all that, our view is and what we have planned and what we saw all along is that North America actually sort of improves significantly after Q1 into the remainder of the year.

We see opportunity for our brands that are stronger, we earn our price everyday, we're generating revenue growth, we're net contributors to the economies, and our brands are healthy. And IC business as growing ahead of our total business and that's a good thing for the world. Our IC business eyes the business globally grew 6% in the world compared to 5% global volume growth. And by the way this volume growth that we just had in the first quarter is one of the highest organic volume growths we've had in the last, say, 8 to 10 quarters that I look back, because this is all pure organic growth, and it is strong and there's momentum. And I think as I said, the competitive environment, I think, out in the world is obviously consumers are reticent to go out, to spend money. The environment is not healthy, particularly in Europe in terms of consumer sentiment. But our business is able to continue to invest and also ensure that we generate value for our customers in Europe, in this case large customers, large format, small format. And one of the really important metrics that we always follow is immediate consumption, which is a healthier mix is growing ahead of our total business. And once again, that is a testament to the strength of our system because you can always -- it's much easier to go and gain distribution in the future consumption channel. But in order to ensure that you supply and work in partner with every single small format store takes a very strong and a very different kind of system which is the one we have."

Let me begin by saying that I'm pleased with our first quarter results. I've never been more excited about the prospects for our brands, as well as our system, or more proud of our people who are driving our consistent and quality performance results. We continue to deliver volume, value and profit growth as we enter the third year of our 2020 Vision, and we once again saw positive volume growth across every one of our 5 geographic operating groups. We also continue to gain volume and value share globally in the nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages and in every sparkling and still beverage category in which we compete. We are winning with our global sparkling beverage portfolio, which was up a solid 4% this past quarter, led by the global growth of brand Coca-Cola, which was up also a healthy 4%. And we are continuing to win with our global still beverage portfolio, which grew a strong 9% this quarter. As we stand a little less than a quarter of the way into our journey towards our 2020 Vision, today's results demonstrate yet again how we are passionately and effectively refreshing a thirsty world with a capable, resilient and advantaged global bottling system. 
Before reviewing our quarterly operating results, let's take a few moments to address today's mixed global economic environment. With respect to Europe, we are observing ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty as 2012 unfolds. Austerity measures implemented across the region are weighing on consumer confidence, which recently reached its lowest level since the first quarter of 2009. Despite the challenges in Europe, we are executing on all fronts to drive performance and share gains. So while we expect the macroeconomic conditions will remain difficult in Europe throughout 2012, we remain cautiously encouraged by our performance in this market.
Turning to the United States, despite its struggle with a sustained period of relative high unemployment, we're pleased to see some early signs of a slowly improving macroeconomic environment. We remain firmly committed to building strong brands and creating value in the United States to capture more than our fair share of the industry's profitable growth.
Finally, let me touch on recent macroeconomic developments across a couple of key BRIC markets. In China, we've all seen economists lower their 2012 GDP growth rate forecast. While we agree that there has been some moderate slowdown in China, we also believe that this is a national progression and then it is a positive for the long-term sustainable growth of the country. As we move through 2012, we anticipate that our business in China may not be immune to this cooling economy, and therefore, we may also see our volume results in China moderate to some extent. Having said that, we are confident that China will continue to serve as a double-digit growth market for our business over the long term. As for Brazil, which underwent a cooling-down period of its own in 2011, there are now signs of improving consumer sentiment. We expect this trend to hold as we move through the balance of 2012 with our business in Brazil continuing to gain market share.
In summary, we always find ourselves operating in a fast-evolving global environment, one with some economies slowing, other economies stabilizing while sustaining high unemployment and still others improving and well on their way to recovery. In all cases, we remain intently focused on realizing our 2020 Vision, and we will keep investing through these challenging times to drive long-term advantaged and sustainable growth. So if we have learned anything these past few years, it is that during times of ongoing uncertainty, consumers are even thirstier for brands that inspire real moments of optimism and happiness.
Turning now to our total company performance results, our volume grew 5% in the quarter, ahead of our long-term target and fueled by organic volume growth in all 5 geographic operating groups. As for our financial results, we grew comparable currency-neutral net revenue by 7%, and we grew comparable currency-neutral operating income by 8% once you adjust for the cycling of lower commodity cost in the prior period. As such, we remain confident in our ability to deliver full year 2012 operating income results in line with our long-term targets.
Now let's review our performance results across our global markets in more detail, beginning with North America, our flagship market. Our North America business was up 2%, delivering an eighth consecutive quarter of growth. Importantly, our North America system once again led the industry, capturing volume and value share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages. Our sparkling beverages in North America were up 1% in the quarter, with brand Coca-Cola also positive in the quarter while further improving its brand health scores. The momentum behind both Coke Zero as well as Fanta continues, with these brands up 9% and 4%, respectively, this quarter, and we also earned higher pricing in North America, which enabled us to generate a positive 3% price mix for both bottled and canned sparkling beverages, as well as our total North America beverage business. Our still beverages is in North America were up 6% in the quarter, gaining both volume and value share while delivering industry-leading results across many categories. In sports drinks, POWERADE grew double digits yet again this quarter while once again capturing volume and value share. Our glacéau trademark grew 9%, also capturing volume and value share, led by another quarter of double-digit growth for both smartwater and vitaminwater zero. And our key performance again accelerated this quarter, up double digits, led by Gold Peak, which grew double digits for the 20th conservative -- consecutive quarter. And in water, DASANI also expanded double digits this quarter with the national rollout of our innovative PlantBottle that is positively impacting purchase intent and brand equity. As we've said many times before, we believe North America is a growth market for our business. Despite a challenging competitive and macroeconomic backdrop, our results both validate this belief and provide us with every reason to remain optimistic about the long-term outlook for America.
Now let me turn to our Pacific Group, which grew 8% in the quarter, including 6% growth for brand Coca-Cola. In China, the overall beverage industry was not immune from the impact of the economic slowdown we mentioned earlier, as well as the unseasonably cold weather that occurred during this quarter's Chinese New Year celebration. Despite this, our business in China delivered a solid 9% growth this quarter while cycling a strong first quarter last year. And importantly, our rightsizing efforts are generating strong incremental transactions in line with our expectations. Sparkling beverage transactions were up double digits this past quarter, driven by the expansion of our 300 ml package. This helped us capture both volume and value share in the sparkling beverage category this quarter.
Just a few weeks ago, I was pleased and honored to inaugurate our 42nd bottling plant in China in Yingkou. This new plant is now our largest production facility in China, with an expected annual production capacity of more than 5 billion servings of sparkling and still beverages. This new LEED-certified plant is part of our system's 3-year $4 billion China investment plant and reaffirms our strong commitment to China.
Japan's first quarter results were up 3%, building on the great work done by our system to restore and strengthen our business during a very challenging 2011. Our Japan business gained both volume and value share in the nonalcoholic beverages this quarter. And this growth in Japan was broad-based, with numerous sparkling and still beverages delivering positive results, including brand Coca-Cola up 2%, Fanta up 6%, I LOHAS water up 4% and Georgia coffee up 3%. Additionally, our Japan business grew across all channels, including convenience stores and vending. Also during the quarter, our Japan business unit was recognized with our company's highest honor, the 2011 Woodroof Cup based on the business unit's achievement of key performance metrics as set forth in our 2020 Vision.  As such, we remain confident that our system in Japan is well aligned and in strong -- in a strong position to deliver full year, low single-digit growth in 2012.
I also want to call out 2 other markets within this diverse and dynamic geographic region of the world. First, our business in the Philippines is growing again, up mid single digits this past quarter, reflecting how the hard work put in by our Bottling Investment Group keeps yielding strong results. While we believe there is still much opportunity left to be captured in the Philippines, we also believe that our business there is on the right track and that we are successfully building the capabilities needed to deliver consistent and sustainable growth. Second, our business in Thailand grew over 20% in the first quarter, and brand Coca-Cola was up over 30% as we build momentum in this market while investing for the future. We have planned in place to expand our beverage production capabilities in this fast-growing market, consistent with our system's culture of targeted investment that underpins our 2020 Vision.
Moving now to Latin America, our volume grew 5% for the quarter, including 4% growth for brand Coca-Cola. In the process, we gained additional share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages, as well as in both sparkling and still beverages in Latin America this quarter. Latin America's solid first quarter results were driven by our consistent growth in Mexico, improved results in Brazil, and high single-digit growth in both our Latin Center and South Latin regions. In Mexico, we delivered 3% growth, cycling 14% from last year. We captured additional nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverage volume and value share in Mexico, and this is a further testament to our team's ability to execute clear occasion-based channel strategies across all beverage categories in our highest per capita market.
As for Brazil, we reiterated many times last year that as this country's economy improved, so would our results. This quarter's 4% volume growth in Brazil validates this belief, and importantly, our continued volume and value share gains in Brazil are a testament to our sustained long-term growth strategies which never wavered during last year's economic slowdown. Looking ahead, we expect our 2012 growth results in Brazil to remain steady at low to single -- mid single digits as the Brazilian economy recovers. And our commitment to the future of Brazil has never been stronger as shown by our system's recent announcement to accelerate our investments in Brazil to nearly $8 billion through 2016.
Our Eurasia and Africa business grew a strong 9% in the quarter, including solid 9% growth for brand Coca-Cola. Our overall group results were led by robust growth across the entire region, including growth in India, Russia, South Africa, the Middle East and North Africa. Overall performance was once again led by India, which grew 20% in the quarter, delivering balanced growth across all categories. I was particularly encouraged by brand Coca-Cola's 27% growth in India this past quarter, and our still beverages in India were up over 20% in the quarter, led by Maaza up over 30%. Russia was up 3% this quarter, cycling last year's strong 27% growth. Our business in Russia continues to be led by the strong momentum of brand Coca-Cola, which once again delivered double-digit growth.  Additionally, our Dobriy juice brand delivered 9% growth and as a result, our overall business in Russia keeps outperforming the rest of the industry, gaining nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverage volume and value share. Finally, we saw positive volume across growth in every other business unit in our Eurasia and Africa group, including double-digit growth in South Africa, as well as in the Middle East and North Africa region. We are excited about the future opportunities for our business in this dynamic growing part of the world.
Moving now to Europe, volume was up 1%, gaining share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages. Notably, this is Europe's seventh consecutive quarter of positive growth. And this growth was led by Germany, which was up 3% for the quarter, capturing, once again, share in the nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages, as well as in both sparkling and still beverage categories. Brand Coca-Cola was up 4% this quarter in Germany, benefiting from both our effective marketing campaigns and our consumer recruitment initiatives. In total, this marks Germany's fifth consecutive quarter of positive growth. This consistency validates how our ongoing bottling restructuring efforts have enhanced our ability to create value during difficult economic times. Another region where our business is showing signs of moderate improvement despite challenging economic conditions is Central and Southern Europe. Most markets in this region posted positive growth, including Italy which was up 4% for the quarter. Another very important geography where we achieved positive results is Spain, up 6% for the quarter. We are closely monitoring our business in both of these markets in light of recently announced austerity measures. Importantly, we believe we have the right brands, the right strategies and the right capabilities in place to continue delivering long-term sustainable growth in Europe.
As we look ahead to this summer, both in Europe as well as across the world, we are very excited about the unique opportunity to grow the value of our brands even further through our investments in the 2012 London Summer Olympic Games. For context, during the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics, we activated 36 markets across the globe. For this year's Summer Olympics, we plan to activate almost 100 markets, leveraging content, experiences and conversations generated through our global program. This fully integrated 2012 global Olympic marketing program will be all about recruiting teams by tapping into emotional passion points like sports and music. An early success of this program is the over 160,000 YouTube views of Mark Ronson's behind-the-scenes footage as he developed our new Olympics theme song. These views were generated without any active promotions on our part and, once again, are a clear example of how we are successfully engaging consumers with innovative, compelling and shareable social media content.
As we work to engage with our consumers, we're also committed to building a better tomorrow. Last month, we released our 2012 Global Water Stewardship and Replenishment Report, detailing our ongoing work to reduce, recycle and replenish the water we use around the world. To date, our company has launched 386 Community Water Partnership projects in 94 countries. These projects have improved water access for 1.6 million people, including more than 0.25 million women and children in Africa.  In 2011 alone, our Community Water Partnership projects replenished 35% of the water used in our finished product beverages.  These projects also benefited the communities we serve by providing sustainable agriculture training and resources to more than 12,000 farmers and by supporting the reforestation of over 30,000 hectares.
As we build a better tomorrow, our efforts and performance are being recognized. This past quarter, we were humbly honored to receive several acknowledgments. Firstly, Fortune Magazine's survey of the Most Admired Companies listed us at #4 in their 2012 rankings, up from #6 in 2011 and up 20 spots from where we ranked just 5 years ago. In these same rankings, Fortune Magazine's survey once again rated us as the #1 most admired beverage company in the world. Secondly, Forbes also announced just 2 weeks ago that our company had risen to #7 on their publication's list of America's most reputable companies based on a consumer survey by Reputation Institute. This ranking is up from #25 in 2011. We also saw our standing improved within the Harris Interactive reputation study, an annual survey that measures the corporate reputations of the 60 most visible companies in the U.S. In their latest survey, our company climbed to #3, up from 15th the previous year.
While all of us at The Coca-Cola Company are proud of these achievements, we understand that they only represent a snapshot of where we are today rather than where we aspire to be tomorrow. As I have stated many times before, the complexity and the challenge of today's mixed global economy also brings real opportunities and exciting growth prospects. What was true on Day 1 of our 2020 Vision is still true today. Our system has only just begun to achieve its potential. We have a clear roadmap for growth, a productivity and reinvestment program that is driving efficiencies and a global bottling system that is well aligned and poised for execution. This strong alignment has not only enabled us to effectively navigate the volatility of these past several years, it has also put us in a position of real strength. That is why we are confident that our Coca-Cola system will continue to passionately refresh a thirsty world and create value for all of our consumers, customers and shareholders.
And with that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Gary."
26642,182278755,284671,"The Coca-Cola Company, Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 17, 2012",2012-04-17,"Earnings Calls","The Coca-Cola Company","Executives","Thanks, Muhtar. Good morning, everyone. We delivered strong results this quarter, underscoring once again that our global system is well positioned to execute our strategic plans and alignment with our 2020 Vision. We reported comparable earnings per shar",1166,"Thanks, Muhtar. Good morning, everyone. We delivered strong results this quarter, underscoring once again that our global system is well positioned to execute our strategic plans and alignment with our 2020 Vision. We reported comparable earnings per share of $0.89 this quarter, up 3% versus the prior year. And as Muhtar shared earlier, our earnings growth was driven by broad-based volume growth across all of our 5 operating groups. In fact, we had volume growth across nearly all of our business units within our global operations this quarter.
Comparable currency-neutral operating income was up 5% this quarter. On a comparable basis, the impact of currency on this quarter's operating income results was a 2% headwind, in line with outlook we provided during our last earnings call in February. In addition, and also as for the outlook we provided through this quarter, we cycled lower commodity cost in the first quarter of 2011. Adjusting for the 3% impact relating to the cycling of these lower commodity cost, our comparable currency-neutral operating income was up 8% in the first quarter of 2012. When you also consider that this quarter had 1 less selling day than the first quarter of 2011, we are very pleased with this operating income result. 
Comparable currency-neutral net revenue grew 7% this quarter, including a 3% increase in concentrate sales and 3% positive price mix. The currency impact on this quarter's comparable net revenue result was a 1% headwind. This quarter's 3% consolidated price mix is particularly encouraging especially when considering today's challenging macroeconomic conditions. Looking ahead, we still expect our full year 2012 consolidated price mix results to come in between 1% and 2% in line with our long-term target range.
This quarter's comparable gross margin was in line with our full year 2011 gross margin, consistent with the outlook we provided earlier this quarter. As a reminder, we expect our full year 2012 consolidated comparable gross margin to remain in line with full year 2011.
Our comparable currency-neutral SG&A expenses were up 4% in the quarter as we sustained our commitment to invest in the health and the strength of our brands. As for operating expense leverage, it came in positive this quarter. For 2012, we still expect to capture low single-digit operating expense leverage as we further invest in strategic brand building initiatives around the world and effectively manage our operating expenses.
Our net interest income came in at $27 million this quarter ahead of our initial forecast, primarily due to a benefit related to our interest rate swaps. As such and based on our current best estimates of interest rates in our international operations, we now expect our full year 2012 net interest income to come in at the higher end of the $20 million to $40 million range we provided in our last earnings call. In addition, we expect our net interest to come in close to even in the second quarter. We'll continue to update you on net interest outlook on a quarterly basis.
Our underlying effective tax rate currently stands at 24.8% within the 24% to 25% range we communicated during our last earnings call. 
As for our cash flow from operations, this increased 13% year-to-date. Please note that this cash flow result is net of the approximately $130 million in incremental contributions made to our pension plans this quarter when compared to the contributions we made to our pension plans in the first quarter of last year.
With regard to our share repurchase program, our net share repurchases during the quarter totaled nearly $850 million, including accruals for stock options and treasury shares that did not settle prior to the close of the quarter. This places us well on track to achieve the $2.5 billion to $3 billion range for full year 2012 as we communicated during our last earnings call.
Now let me take a moment to remind you of our full year outlook on currencies and commodities which we provided in our last earnings call. With regard to commodities, in our last call, we said that we expected the full year 2012 incremental impact of the Big 4 commodity cost on our results to range between $350 million and $450 million. And just a reminder, the Big 4 commodities are aluminum, sweetener, juice and PET. While our commodity cost outlook remains unchanged, if current trends hold, we may see this outlook slowly improve in the coming months. And we'll update you on any changes to our outlook during our next earnings call.
As for currencies, based on our hedge positions, current spot rates and the cycling of our prior year rates, we continue to expect currencies to have a mid single-digit negative impact on operating income for the full year. Furthermore, we expect to see this impact come in at the high end of this mid single-digit range in the second quarter.
Let me highlight one additional item for those that model our business. In light of the recent change to our global tea joint venture with Nestlé, and as a reminder, earlier this year, we announced our agreement with Nestlé to refocus the geographic scope of this joint venture primarily to Europe and Canada while phasing out the joint venture in most other territories by the end of 2012, accordingly, we have eliminated the joint venture volume from our reported results for both 2011 and 2012 in those territories where the joint venture is being phased out. Please note that this change did not impact the company's reported volume results this quarter on a consolidated level or for any individual operating group.
Finally, with regard to our new productivity and reinvestment program, we reconfirm our expectations to capture total incremental annualized savings of $550 million to $650 million, phased over a 4-year period, starting in 2012 through the end of 2015. As noted in our last call, these funds will serve to enhance our ongoing system-wide brand building initiatives as we reinvest in our business to drive long-term profitable growth. We're still in the initial stages of defining the total onetime cost associated with the capture of these incremental annualized savings, and we'll provide an update on this cost during our next earnings call.
In summary, as we begin the third year of our 2020 Vision, we are greatly encouraged by our business achieving yet another solid quarter of quality volume, value and profit results. Our system remains healthy and financially strong. We're generating cash, investing in our world-class brands and executing our consistent growth strategies from a position of real strength. And importantly, we continue to pay a healthy dividend. Our seasoned leadership team and highly capable global bottling partners are taking the right actions and executing the right strategies to successfully realize our 2020 Vision. So while we're still navigating through an ongoing mixed global economic recovery, we remain confident in our ability to deliver full year results in line with our long-term growth targets.

Muhtar, if you could talk a little bit about how you view that performance carrying out through the balance of the year, maybe some of the factors that you've got in place or some of the activity you have in place to continue to drive that through the balance of the year. And then secondarily, maybe Gary, if you could just talk about if it's a -- given your potentially better view on cost balance of the year and the potential for some volume performance continuing to be about well -- doing well this year, just a better drop through profitability, I guess as we move through the year, if we can just talk a little bit about that as well."

I think what I'd like to just get -- the message I'd like to get across is that we leave behind the first quarter of 2012 with confidence and with momentum in our business. And I think it is broad-based growth,",505,"Bryan, good morning, thanks. This is Muhtar. I think what I'd like to just get -- the message I'd like to get across is that we leave behind the first quarter of 2012 with confidence and with momentum in our business. And I think it is broad-based growth, as you mentioned. In fact, the top 10 countries in our business generated about 65% -- a little over 65% of the total incremental growth cases -- organic unit case growth in the quarter. And that is more broad-based than in the past. And that's a good sign. And I think we've always said that there's tremendous -- I see -- everywhere I go, I see tremendous opportunity for our brands. Our system is strong. Our system -- this is the result of investments that our system continues to make every quarter and also generating revenue, and we're able to crack this calculus for growth. And everywhere we go in this difficult macroeconomic environment, it's important to note that The Coca-Cola system is one of the most important net contributors to the economy. Globally, we're one of the top 10 private employers, nongovernmental employers, and we create -- based on our vision, we will create an additional 120,000 new jobs in the next 10 years. And more and more, governments are recognizing that unemployment is the #1, #2 and #3 priority. And I think with that, with our system, we're earning our right every day in every market. And that's important. As I -- obviously, the macroeconomic conditions around the world is challenged. The recovery is slow. Unemployment remains high and is -- I believe will remain high as we go through this year. But the premise, Bryan, on which we've built our 2020 Vision holds true today. What we said is no matter how you slice and dice it, there will be about 1 billion new people coming into the middle class. We'll have about 800 million new urbanized consumers in the decade. This decade that we're talking about, 2010 to 2020. Now the quarter we just left behind, about 22 million new urbanized consumers and about 22 million to 25 million new middle class have been created in the world, and we were there to serve their needs and refresh them. So yes, challenged environment; yes, slow recovery; yes, some slowing down in emerging markets. But when we talk about slowing down, you go down from a 9% to an 8.5% or an 8.2%, I think there is still tremendous amount of growth and middle class creation around the world, whether you take Africa, Latin America, Asia, and we're there. And in the western markets, we've always said our balanced -- our vision calls for balanced growth, balanced in geographies, balanced in portfolio. And once again, we were able to validate that, that is something that we are able to execute with our -- passionately with our bottling partners. So I'll now pass it over to Gary to answer the second part of your question."

As we look, it is still a challenged economic environment across the world. We have seen -- if you think back, actually first quarter of 2010, things looked like, economically, they were getting better and then they didn't. First quarter of 2011 looked like things were getting better and then they didn't. And then we have seen the significant volatility around commodities and currencies across the world over the last several years as well. So I think -- I guess where we are is trying to be somewhat conservative and try to say we're 3 quarters -- or 3 months into the year, 1 quarter into the year, the kind of the smallest quarter in fact, and I think we need to continue to go through the year. Are things looking better? Yes, it looks like interest is a little -- interest income is going to be a little bit better. It looks like if things hold, commodities will probably be better. So things are actually looking pretty good, but I think at this point, our view was, we kind of hold with where we are. We kind of get through another quarter to kind of see how the year is going. Is the economic recovery that we're starting to slowly see in the U.S. going to continue or not? So that's kind of where we are. We're kind of being -- trying to be conservative and recognized that we are in this as a marathon and not as a sprint. This is about long-term value creation."

And I think you've seen the Pacific Group's volume growth up 8%, which was broad-based in the quarter with the numbers that we've shared with you for places like -- not just China and Japan up 9% and 3%, respectively, but also for Thailand and the Philippines and so forth. And I think importantly, again, very encouraged that brand Coca-Cola is up 6% in that massive geography, and reported net revenue for the quarter up 12%. And I think -- and good price mix across. So it's important really to be able to ensure that when you have -- when we talk about sustainable growth, we mean growth not just in volume, not just in a certain category, but broad-based growth and also growth in the revenue line that can be matched or better than the volume line, and I think we've seen that. And yes, no question, everyone you talk to, whether it's the shop owner in any particular part of China or whether it's the government, or whether it's some national government, there is a little cooling down. It's that -- I think that's healthy. And I think that's healthy for the real estate market in China. That's healthy for the banking industry in China. That's healthy for the long-term sustainable growth of the economy in China, which I have no doubt is going to continue. So we see China as a fantastic opportunity. As I said, we've just opened our largest-to-date facility in China, 42nd, and the largest of them all, and LEED-certified on top of it. And that's again one sign of our commitment, many more such factories to come in our $4 billion announced investment program for China. And so I see China as certainly playing an important role for our 2020 Vision. I'm particularly pleased about Japan, where I met with all our bottling partners in Tokyo and presented their Woodruff Cup Award to each one of our bottling partners. And again, category by category, we see very good improvement in our business in Japan. So the terrible tragedy of 2011 allowed us to galvanize our system and strengthen our system and continue to grow our system. And importantly, every channel, important channel, like convenience, like vending, is now expected to grow in Japan. And that's a very important thing for our business -- and categories, whether it's coffee with Georgia or sparkling or tea. Again, we're generating growth. So prospects, I think overall, we've always said the picture of success in Japan is low single-digit growth. And I believe that we're poised well to achieve that target for Japan. And then I went to Thailand, where we're having, as I said, very good growth prospects and share gains, tremendous share gains in that important market, with a very healthy consumption habit for sparkling beverages. And I see -- whether it's other markets like Vietnam or Indonesia or West Asia, I see great prospects for our growth. And I'll soon be also heading towards West Asia in a couple of months. And again, you heard the results that we've been able to post this past quarter in India, continue to have very healthy brand metrics for Coca-Cola, as well as our still brands there in that incredibly prospective geography. So I think Asia, overall, little cooling, healthy and great long-term prospects for both our business, as well as I think leading the world out of some of the current global macro issues."

I think we continue to see validation, a little more validation, on what I indicated also in the previous call. There are some signs, healthier signs, from the U.S. consumer right now than it was 12 months ago at this time in terms of more travel, more mobility, more bookings. And mobility is an important factor for our business for consumer goods. And also, I think eating out, a little healthier numbers in terms of that, whether we are seeing compared to, say, 12 to 16 months ago. Having said that -- and I do believe that, that trend is likely to continue, providing we can sort of keep -- have some prices on the -- at the pump for gasoline where -- about where they stay now. So I premise that with that caveat. I think for -- we have always said that United States is a growth business. Despite the current macroeconomic challenges, we've been posting growth quarter after quarter. I'm very pleased that this past quarter also that sparkling beverages was positive, brand Coca-Cola was positive. And we've started putting together the framework for our growth in North America way before the acquisition of the CCC [ph] business in North America. I want to reiterate that once again. The brand, price, pack, channel architecture, the -- beginning -- getting our brands to a healthier position than they were previously, getting the right package to be sold at the right outlet and the right channel at the right price, all of that architecture we started working on 3 to 4 years ago. And I think we are seeing some results out of all of that work. And as I've said, we believe that the positive sentiment that we see compared to 1 year ago of the U.S. consumer, slightly positive sentiment would probably continue is what I would estimate, providing other conditions hold, particularly the price of gasoline.

Judy, I'd say just a couple of things. And the first, I just want to congratulate our colleagues in North America because I think if you -- as you think about it and think about this quarter, it was sparkling plus 1, brand Coca-Cola positive growth in the quarter. And those are things that not that long ago, I think everyone listening in this call would have said it's impossible to do. And it's really working. Everything that Muhtar is talking about is actually working. And our brand score is getting better because of the things we have been doing over the last few years. But then, if you look at, ""All right, great, Gary, got that, but let's talk about financial results and you're showing that on a comparable basis, operating income is down 9% quarter on quarter. So how do you talk about that?"" Well, on that one, that is the issue that I alerted, I think all of you, too, earlier this quarter. The way the commodities hit last year, that $800 million of commodity pressure that we had last year, it all was in quarters 2, 3 and 4, basically, none of it in the numbers in Q1 in North America. So when you adjust for that for just commodities, that minus 9 actually gets to only slightly negative. And then you have to recognize that there was 1 less day. If you adjust for that, actually, North America suddenly flips into it was actually positive. You take that then you look at remainder of year, and you recognize that we've gotten the pricing so that the commodities aren't going to be that as big an issue going forward, remainder of year. And all the other things we've been doing, we would expect to see North America in very good positive territory, remainder of year. Things are going, knock on wood, exactly the way we planned for them, too, at this point."

Let me start -- well, in fact, I'll go ahead and answer that last part first. We did have share gains pretty much across the board, across the world and the U.S. So we did have share gains in sparkling. On the commodity issue relative to North America, and if I don't exactly answer the question, just come back and tell me, but basically, if you strip out the commodity impact, North America's OI for the quarter instead of being down 9 would have been down 1. It's exactly what it would have been. And if then -- if you add in an extra day, it would have been positive. So what you're seeing is that 1 day, actually 1 less day, is having a huge impact on the P&L because you've got basically all of the costs going through for the full quarter with 1 day less sales is basically what's happening, which is why when you go to Q2 and 3, actually, it becomes much more normalized and the commodities are not an issue at all. In fact, it kind of reverses a little bit because you had more of that hitting in Q2 and 3 last year, with none of it hitting in Q1 last year. So it's kind of a cycling thing, but that's why when you adjust for all that, our view is and what we have planned and what we saw all along is that North America actually sort of improved significantly after Q1 into the remainder of the year. And that's kind of what -- that's exactly what we're seeing today."

But the cadence of the business this year actually is exactly as you just said it. That's exactly right. It is more back-end loaded because of how the commodities hit and went through the P&L last year and the 1 day less in the first quarter, 2 extra days in the fourth quarter. Some of the reason -- I have to hedge a little bit on this, is because there was 1 less day, you had a little bit of an Easter shift to help probably the first quarter slightly, but you really can't measure it. So I'd say basically, what you're saying is exactly right."

And our IC business is growing ahead of our total business, and that's a good thing for the world. Our IC business globally grew 6% in the world compared to 5% global volume growth. And by the way, this volume growth that we've just had in the first quarter is one of the highest organic volume growths we've had in the last, say, 8 to 10 quarters that I look back, because this is all-pure organic growth and it is strong and there is momentum. And I think, as I've said, the competitive environment, I think, out in the world is obviously, consumers are reticent to go out, to spend money. The environment is not healthy particularly in Europe in terms of consumer sentiment, but our business is able to continue to invest and also ensure that we generate value for our customers in Europe, in this case large customers, large format, small format. And one of the really important metrics that we always follow is immediate consumption, which is a healthier mix. It's growing ahead of our total business. And once again, that is a testament to the strength of our system because you can always -- it's much easier to go and gain distribution in the future consumption channel, but in order to ensure that you supply and work in partner with every single small format store takes a very strong and a very different kind of system, which is the one we have."

Let me begin by saying that I'm pleased with our first quarter results. I've never been more excited about the prospects for our brands, as well as our system, or more proud of our people who are driving our consistent and quality performance results. We continue to deliver volume, value and profit growth as we enter the third year of our 2020 Vision, and we once again saw positive volume growth across every one of our 5 geographic operating groups. We also continue to gain volume and value share globally in the nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages and in every sparkling and still beverage category in which we compete. We are winning with our global sparkling beverage portfolio, which was up a solid 4% this past quarter, led by the global growth of brand Coca-Cola, which was up also a healthy 4%. And we are continuing to win with our global still beverage portfolio, which grew a strong 9% this quarter. As we stand a little less than a quarter of the way into our journey towards our 2020 Vision, today's results demonstrate yet again how we are passionately and effectively refreshing a thirsty world with a capable, resilient and advantaged global bottling system. 
Before reviewing our quarterly operating results, let's take a few moments to address today's mixed global economic environment. With respect to Europe, we are observing ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty as 2012 unfolds. Austerity measures implemented across the region are weighing on consumer confidence, which recently reached its lowest level since the first quarter of 2009. Despite the challenges in Europe, we are executing on all fronts to drive performance and share gains. So while we expect the macroeconomic conditions will remain difficult in Europe throughout 2012, we remain cautiously encouraged by our performance in this market.
Turning to the United States. Despite its struggle with a sustained period of relative high unemployment, we're pleased to see some early signs of a slowly improving macroeconomic environment. We remain firmly committed to building strong brands and creating value in the United States to capture more than our fair share of the industry's profitable growth.
Finally, let me touch on recent macroeconomic developments across a couple of key BRIC markets. In China, we've all seen economists lower their 2012 GDP growth rate forecast. While we agree that there has been some moderate slowdown in China, we also believe that this is a national progression and that it is a positive for the long-term sustainable growth of the country. As we move through 2012, we anticipate that our business in China may not be immune to this cooling economy, and therefore, we may also see our volume results in China moderate to some extent. Having said that, we are confident that China will continue to serve as a double-digit growth market for our business over the long term. As for Brazil, which underwent a cooling-down period of its own in 2011, there are now signs of improving consumer sentiment. We expect this trend to hold as we move through the balance of 2012 with our business in Brazil continuing to gain market share.
In summary, we always find ourselves operating in a fast-evolving global environment, one with some economies slowing, other economies stabilizing while sustaining high unemployment and still others improving and well on their way to recovery. In all cases, we remain intently focused on realizing our 2020 Vision, and we will keep investing through these challenging times to drive long-term advantaged and sustainable growth. So if we have learned anything these past few years, it is that during times of ongoing uncertainty, consumers are even thirstier for brands that inspire real moments of optimism and happiness.
Turning now to our total company performance results. Our volume grew 5% in the quarter, ahead of our long-term target and fueled by organic volume growth in all 5 geographic operating groups. As for our financial results, we grew comparable currency-neutral net revenue by 7%, and we grew comparable currency-neutral operating income by 8% once you adjust for the cycling of lower commodity cost in the prior period. As such, we remain confident in our ability to deliver full year 2012 operating income results in line with our long-term targets.
Now let's review our performance results across our global markets in more detail, beginning with North America, our flagship market. Our North America business was up 2%, delivering an eighth consecutive quarter of growth. Importantly, our North America system once again led the industry, capturing volume and value share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages. Our sparkling beverages in North America were up 1% in the quarter, with brand Coca-Cola also positive in the quarter while further improving its brand health scores. The momentum behind both Coke Zero as well as Fanta continues, with these brands up 9% and 4%, respectively, this quarter, and we also earned higher pricing in North America, which enabled us to generate a positive 3% price mix for both bottled and canned sparkling beverages, as well as our total North America beverage business. Our still beverages in North America were up 6% in the quarter, gaining both volume and value share while delivering industry-leading results across many categories. In sports drinks, POWERADE grew double digits yet again this quarter while once again capturing volume and value share. Our glacéau trademark grew 9%, also capturing volume and value share, led by another quarter of double-digit growth for both smartwater and vitaminwater zero. And our key performance again accelerated this quarter, up double digits, led by Gold Peak, which grew double digits for the 20th conservative -- consecutive quarter. And in water, DASANI also expanded double digits this quarter with the national rollout of our innovative PlantBottle that is positively impacting purchase intent and brand equity. As we've said many times before, we believe North America is a growth market for our business. Despite a challenging competitive and macroeconomic backdrop, our results both validate this belief and provide us with every reason to remain optimistic about the long-term outlook for America.
Now let me turn to our Pacific Group, which grew 8% in the quarter, including 6% growth for brand Coca-Cola. In China, the overall beverage industry was not immune from the impact of the economic slowdown we mentioned earlier, as well as the unseasonably cold weather that occurred during this quarter's Chinese New Year celebration. Despite this, our business in China delivered a solid 9% growth this quarter while cycling a strong first quarter last year. And importantly, our rightsizing efforts are generating strong incremental transactions in line with our expectations. Sparkling beverage transactions were up double digits this past quarter, driven by the expansion of our 300 ml package. This helped us capture both volume and value share in the sparkling beverage category this quarter.
Just a few weeks ago, I was pleased and honored to inaugurate our 42nd bottling plant in China in Yingkou. This new plant is now our largest production facility in China, with an expected annual production capacity of more than 5 billion servings of sparkling and still beverages. This new LEED-certified plant is part of our system's 3-year $4 billion China investment plan and reaffirms our strong commitment to China.
Japan's first quarter results were up 3%, building on the great work done by our system to restore and strengthen our business during a very challenging 2011. Our Japan business gained both volume and value share in the nonalcoholic beverages this quarter. And this growth in Japan was broad-based, with numerous sparkling and still beverages delivering positive results, including brand Coca-Cola up 2%, Fanta up 6%, I LOHAS water up 4% and Georgia coffee up 3%. Additionally, our Japan business grew across all channels, including convenience stores and vending. Also during the quarter, our Japan business unit was recognized with our company's highest honor, the 2011 Woodruff Cup based on the business unit's achievement of key performance metrics as set forth in our 2020 Vision.  As such, we remain confident that our system in Japan is well aligned and in strong -- in a strong position to deliver full year, low single-digit growth in 2012.
I also want to call out 2 other markets within this diverse and dynamic geographic region of the world. First, our business in the Philippines is growing again, up mid single digits this past quarter, reflecting how the hard work put in by our Bottling Investment Group keeps yielding strong results. While we believe there is still much opportunity left to be captured in the Philippines, we also believe that our business there is on the right track and that we are successfully building the capabilities needed to deliver consistent and sustainable growth. Second, our business in Thailand grew over 20% in the first quarter, and brand Coca-Cola was up over 30% as we build momentum in this market while investing for the future. We have plans in place to expand our beverage production capabilities in this fast-growing market, consistent with our system's culture of targeted investment that underpins our 2020 Vision.
Moving now to Latin America, our volume grew 5% for the quarter, including 4% growth for brand Coca-Cola. In the process, we gained additional share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages, as well as in both sparkling and still beverages in Latin America this quarter. Latin America's solid first quarter results were driven by our consistent growth in Mexico, improved results in Brazil, and high single-digit growth in both our Latin Center and South Latin regions. In Mexico, we delivered 3% growth, cycling 14% from last year. We captured additional nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverage volume and value share in Mexico, and this is a further testament to our team's ability to execute clear occasion-based channel strategies across all beverage categories in our highest per capita market.
As for Brazil, we reiterated many times last year that as this country's economy improved, so would our results. This quarter's 4% volume growth in Brazil validates this belief, and importantly, our continued volume and value share gains in Brazil are a testament to our sustained long-term growth strategies which never wavered during last year's economic slowdown. Looking ahead, we expect our 2012 growth results in Brazil to remain steady at low to single – mid-single digits as the Brazilian economy recovers. And our commitment to the future of Brazil has never been stronger, as shown by our system's recent announcement to accelerate our investments in Brazil to nearly $8 billion through 2016.
Our Eurasia and Africa business grew a strong 9% in the quarter, including solid 9% growth for brand Coca-Cola. Our overall group results were led by robust growth across the entire region, including growth in India, Russia, South Africa, the Middle East and North Africa. Overall performance was once again led by India, which grew 20% in the quarter, delivering balanced growth across all categories. I was particularly encouraged by brand Coca-Cola's 27% growth in India this past quarter, and our still beverages in India were up over 20% in the quarter, led by Maaza up over 30%. Russia was up 3% this quarter, cycling last year's strong 27% growth. Our business in Russia continues to be led by the strong momentum of brand Coca-Cola, which once again delivered double-digit growth.  Additionally, our Dobriy juice brand delivered 9% growth and as a result, our overall business in Russia keeps outperforming the rest of the industry, gaining nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverage volume and value share. Finally, we saw positive volume across growth in every other business unit in our Eurasia and Africa group, including double-digit growth in South Africa, as well as in the Middle East and North Africa region. We are excited about the future opportunities for our business in this dynamic growing part of the world.
Moving now to Europe. Volume was up 1%, gaining share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages. Notably, this is Europe's seventh consecutive quarter of positive growth. And this growth was led by Germany, which was up 3% for the quarter, capturing, once again, share in the nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages, as well as in both sparkling and still beverage categories. Brand Coca-Cola was up 4% this quarter in Germany, benefiting from both our effective marketing campaigns and our consumer recruitment initiatives. In total, this marks Germany's fifth consecutive quarter of positive growth. This consistency validates how our ongoing bottling restructuring efforts have enhanced our ability to create value during difficult economic times. Another region where our business is showing signs of moderate improvement despite challenging economic conditions is Central and Southern Europe. Most markets in this region posted positive growth, including Italy which was up 4% for the quarter. Another very important geography where we achieved positive results is Spain, up 6% for the quarter. We are closely monitoring our business in both of these markets in light of recently announced austerity measures. Importantly, we believe we have the right brands, the right strategies and the right capabilities in place to continue delivering long-term sustainable growth in Europe.
As we look ahead to this summer, both in Europe as well as across the world, we are very excited about the unique opportunity to grow the value of our brands even further through our investments in the 2012 London Summer Olympic Games. For context, during the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics, we activated 36 markets across the globe. For this year's Summer Olympics, we plan to activate almost 100 markets, leveraging content, experiences and conversations generated through our global program. This fully integrated 2012 global Olympic marketing program will be all about recruiting teams by tapping into emotional passion points like sports and music. An early success of this program is the over 160,000 YouTube views of Mark Ronson's behind-the-scenes footage as he developed our new Olympics theme song. These views were generated without any active promotions on our part and, once again, are a clear example of how we are successfully engaging consumers with innovative, compelling and shareable social media content.
As we work to engage with our consumers, we're also committed to building a better tomorrow. Last month, we released our 2012 Global Water Stewardship and Replenishment Report, detailing our ongoing work to reduce, recycle and replenish the water we use around the world. To date, our company has launched 386 Community Water Partnership projects in 94 countries. These projects have improved water access for 1.6 million people, including more than 0.25 million women and children in Africa.  In 2011 alone, our Community Water Partnership projects replenished 35% of the water used in our finished product beverages. These projects also benefited the communities we serve by providing sustainable agriculture training and resources to more than 12,000 farmers and by supporting the reforestation of over 30,000 hectares.
As we build a better tomorrow, our efforts and performance are being recognized. This past quarter, we were humbly honored to receive several acknowledgments. Firstly, Fortune Magazine's survey of the Most Admired Companies listed us at #4 in their 2012 rankings, up from #6 in 2011 and up 20 spots from where we ranked just 5 years ago. In these same rankings, Fortune Magazine's survey once again rated us as the #1 most admired beverage company in the world. Secondly, Forbes also announced just 2 weeks ago that our company had risen to #7 on their publication's list of America's Most Reputable Companies based on a consumer survey by Reputation Institute. This ranking is up from #25 in 2011. We also saw our standing improved within the Harris Interactive reputation study, an annual survey that measures the corporate reputations of the 60 most visible companies in the U.S. In their latest survey, our company climbed to #3, up from 15th the previous year.
While all of us at The Coca-Cola Company are proud of these achievements, we understand that they only represent a snapshot of where we are today rather than where we aspire to be tomorrow. As I have stated many times before, the complexity and the challenge of today's mixed global economy also brings real opportunities and exciting growth prospects. What was true on Day 1 of our 2020 Vision is still true today. Our system has only just begun to achieve its potential. We have a clear roadmap for growth, a productivity and reinvestment program that is driving efficiencies and a global bottling system that is well aligned and poised for execution. This strong alignment has not only enabled us to effectively navigate the volatility of these past several years, it has also put us in a position of real strength. That is why we are confident that our Coca-Cola system will continue to passionately refresh a thirsty world and create value for all of our consumers, customers and shareholders.
And with that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Gary."

On a comparable basis, the impact of currency on this quarter's operating income results was a 2% headwind, in line with outlook we provided during our last earnings call in February. In addition, and also as for the outlook we provided through this quarter, we cycled lower commodity cost in the first quarter of 2011. Adjusting for the 3% impact relating to the cycling of these lower commodity cost, our comparable currency-neutral operating income was up 8% in the first quarter of 2012. When you also consider that this quarter had one less selling day than the first quarter of 2011, we are very pleased with this operating income result. 
Comparable currency-neutral net revenue grew 7% this quarter, including a 3% increase in concentrate sales and 3% positive price mix. The currency impact on this quarter's comparable net revenue result was a 1% headwind. This quarter's 3% consolidated price mix is particularly encouraging, especially when considering today's challenging macroeconomic conditions. Looking ahead, we still expect our full year 2012 consolidated price mix results to come in between 1% and 2% in line with our long-term target range.
This quarter's comparable gross margin was in line with our full year 2011 gross margin, consistent with the outlook we provided earlier this quarter. As a reminder, we expect our full year 2012 consolidated comparable gross margin to remain in line with full year 2011.
Our comparable currency-neutral SG&A expenses were up 4% in the quarter as we sustained our commitment to invest in the health and the strength of our brands. As for operating expense leverage, it came in positive this quarter. For 2012, we still expect to capture low single-digit operating expense leverage as we further invest in strategic brand building initiatives around the world and effectively manage our operating expenses.
Our net interest income came in at $27 million this quarter ahead of our initial forecast, primarily due to a benefit related to our interest rate swaps. As such and based on our current best estimates of interest rates in our international operations, we now expect our full year 2012 net interest income to come in at the higher end of the $20 million to $40 million range we provided in our last earnings call. In addition, we expect our net interest to come in close to even in the second quarter. We'll continue to update you on net interest outlook on a quarterly basis.
Our underlying effective tax rate currently stands at 24.8% within the 24% to 25% range we communicated during our last earnings call. 
As for our cash flow from operations, this increased 13% year-to-date. Please note that this cash flow result is net of the approximately $130 million in incremental contributions made to our pension plans this quarter when compared to the contributions we made to our pension plans in the first quarter of last year.
With regard to our share repurchase program, our net share repurchases during the quarter totaled nearly $850 million, including accruals for stock options and treasury shares that did not settle prior to the close of the quarter. This places us well on track to achieve the $2.5 billion to $3 billion range for full year 2012 as we communicated during our last earnings call.
Now let me take a moment to remind you of our full year outlook on currencies and commodities which we provided in our last earnings call. With regard to commodities, in our last call, we said that we expected the full year 2012 incremental impact of the Big 4 commodity cost on our results to range between $350 million and $450 million. And just a reminder, the Big 4 commodities are aluminum, sweetener, juice and PET. While our commodity cost outlook remains unchanged, if current trends hold, we may see this outlook slowly improve in the coming months. And we'll update you on any changes to our outlook during our next earnings call.
As for currencies, based on our hedge positions, current spot rates and the cycling of our prior year rates, we continue to expect currencies to have a mid single-digit negative impact on operating income for the full year. Furthermore, we expect to see this impact come in at the high end of this mid single-digit range in the second quarter.
Let me highlight one additional item for those that model our business. In light of the recent change to our global tea joint venture with Nestlé, and as a reminder, earlier this year, we announced our agreement with Nestlé to refocus the geographic scope of this joint venture primarily to Europe and Canada while phasing out the joint venture in most other territories by the end of 2012. Accordingly, we have eliminated the joint venture volume from our reported results for both 2011 and 2012 in those territories where the joint venture is being phased out. Please note that this change did not impact the company's reported volume results this quarter on a consolidated level or for any individual operating group.
Finally, with regard to our new productivity and reinvestment program, we reconfirm our expectations to capture total incremental annualized savings of $550 million to $650 million, phased over a 4-year period, starting in 2012 through the end of 2015. As noted in our last call, these funds will serve to enhance our ongoing system-wide brand building initiatives as we reinvest in our business to drive long-term profitable growth. We're still in the initial stages of defining the total onetime cost associated with the capture of these incremental annualized savings, and we'll provide an update on these costs during our next earnings call.
In summary, as we begin the third year of our 2020 Vision, we are greatly encouraged by our business achieving yet another solid quarter of quality volume, value and profit results. Our system remains healthy and financially strong. We're generating cash, investing in our world-class brands and executing our consistent growth strategies from a position of real strength. And importantly, we continue to pay a healthy dividend. Our seasoned leadership team and highly capable global bottling partners are taking the right actions and executing the right strategies to successfully realize our 2020 Vision. So while we're still navigating through an ongoing mixed global economic recovery, we remain confident in our ability to deliver full year results in line with our long-term growth targets.
Operator, we're now ready for questions."

And then secondarily, maybe Gary, if you could just talk about if it's a -- given your potentially better view on cost balance of the year and the potential for some volume performance continuing to be well -- doing well this year, just better drop through profitability, I guess as we move through the year, if we can just talk a little bit about that as well."

I think what I'd like to just get -- the message I'd like to get across is that we leave behind the first quarter of 2012 with confidence and with momentum in our business. And I think it is broad-based growth,",505,"Bryan, good morning, thanks. This is Muhtar. I think what I'd like to just get -- the message I'd like to get across is that we leave behind the first quarter of 2012 with confidence and with momentum in our business. And I think it is broad-based growth, as you mentioned. In fact, the top 10 countries in our business generated about 65% -- a little over 65% of the total incremental growth cases -- organic unit case growth in the quarter. And that is more broad-based than in the past. And that's a good sign. And I think we've always said that there's tremendous -- I see -- everywhere I go, I see tremendous opportunity for our brands. Our system is strong. Our system -- this is the result of investments that our system continues to make every quarter and also generating revenue, and we're able to crack this calculus for growth. And everywhere we go in this difficult macroeconomic environment, it's important to note that The Coca-Cola system is one of the most important net contributors to the economy. Globally, we're one of the top 10 private employers, nongovernmental employers, and we create -- based on our vision, we will create an additional 120,000 new jobs in the next 10 years. And more and more, governments are recognizing that unemployment is the #1, #2 and #3 priority. And I think with that, with our system, we're earning our right every day in every market. And that's important. As I -- obviously, the macroeconomic conditions around the world is challenged. The recovery is slow. Unemployment remains high and is -- I believe will remain high as we go through this year. But the premise, Bryan, on which we've built our 2020 Vision holds true today. What we said is no matter how you slice and dice it, there will be about 1 billion new people coming into the middle class. We'll have about 800 million new urbanized consumers in the decade. This decade that we're talking about, 2010 to 2020. Now the quarter we just left behind, about 22 million new urbanized consumers and about 22 million to 25 million new middle class have been created in the world, and we were there to serve their needs and refresh them. So yes, challenged environment; yes, slow recovery; yes, some slowing down in emerging markets. But when we talk about slowing down, you go down from a 9% to an 8.5% or an 8.2%, I think there is still tremendous amount of growth and middle class creation around the world, whether you take Africa, Latin America, Asia, and we're there. And in the western markets, we've always said our balanced -- our vision calls for balanced growth, balanced in geographies, balanced in portfolio. And once again, we were able to validate that, that is something that we are able to execute with our -- passionately with our bottling partners. So I'll now pass it over to Gary to answer the second part of your question."

As we look, it is still a challenged economic environment across the world. We have seen -- if you think back, actually first quarter of 2010, things looked like, economically, they were getting better and then they didn't. First quarter of 2011 looked like things were getting better and then they didn't. And then we've seen the significant volatility around commodities and currencies across the world over the last several years as well. So I think -- I guess where we are is trying to be somewhat conservative and try to say we're 3 quarters -- or 3 months into the year, 1 quarter into the year, the kind of the smallest quarter in fact, and I think we need to continue to go through the year. Are things looking better? Yes, it looks like interest is a little -- interest income is going to be a little bit better. It looks like if things hold, commodities will probably be better. So things are actually looking pretty good, but I think at this point, our view was, we kind of hold with where we are. We kind of get through another quarter to kind of see how the year is going. Is the economic recovery that we're starting to slowly see in the U.S. going to continue or not? So that's kind of where we are. We're kind of being -- trying to be conservative and recognize that we are in this as a marathon and not as a sprint. This is about long-term value creation."

And I think you've seen the Pacific Group's volume growth up 8%, which was broad-based in the quarter with the numbers that we've shared with you for places like -- not just China and Japan up 9% and 3%, respectively, but also for Thailand and the Philippines and so forth. And I think importantly, again, very encouraged that brand Coca-Cola is up 6% in that massive geography, and reported net revenue for the quarter up 12%. And I think -- and good price mix across. So it's important really to be able to ensure that when you have -- when we talk about sustainable growth, we mean growth not just in volume, not just in a certain category, but broad-based growth and also growth in the revenue line that can be matched or better than the volume line, and I think we've seen that. And yes, no question, everyone you talk to, whether it's the shop owner in any particular part of China or whether it's the government, or whether it's some national government, there is a little cooling down. Is that -- I think that's healthy. And I think that's healthy for the real estate market in China. That's healthy for the banking industry in China. That's healthy for the long-term sustainable growth of the economy in China, which I have no doubt is going to continue. So we see China as a fantastic opportunity. As I said, we've just opened our largest-to-date facility in China, 42nd, and the largest of them all, and LEED-certified on top of it. And that's again one sign of our commitment, many more such factories to come in our $4 billion announced investment program for China. And so I see China as certainly playing an important role for our 2020 Vision. And particularly pleased about Japan, where I met with all our bottling partners in Tokyo and presented their Woodruff Cup awards to each one of our bottling partners. And again, category by category, we see very good improvement in our business in Japan. So the terrible tragedy of 2011 allowed us to galvanize our system and strengthen our system and continue to grow our system. And importantly, every channel, important channel, like convenience, like vending, is now expected to grow in Japan. And that's a very important thing for our business -- and categories, whether it's coffee with Georgia or sparkling or tea. Again, we're generating growth. So prospects, I think overall, we've always said the picture of success in Japan is low single-digit growth. And I believe that we're poised well to achieve that target for Japan. And then I went to Thailand, where we're having, as I said, very good growth prospects and share gains, tremendous share gains in that important market, with a very healthy consumption habit for sparkling beverages. And I see -- whether it's other markets like Vietnam or Indonesia or West Asia, I see great prospects for our growth. And I'll soon be also heading towards West Asia in a couple of months. And again, you heard the results that we've been able to post this past quarter in India, continue to have very healthy brand metrics for Coca-Cola, as well as our still brands there in that incredibly prospective geography. So I think Asia, overall, little cooling, healthy and great long-term prospects for both our business, as well as I think leading the world out of some of the current global macro issues."

I think we continue to see validation, a little more validation, on what I indicated also in the previous call. There are some signs, healthier signs, from the U.S. consumer right now than it was 12 months ago at this time in terms of more travel, more mobility, more bookings. And mobility is an important factor for our business for consumer goods. And also, I think eating out, a little healthier numbers in terms of that, that we were seeing compared to, say, 12 to 16 months ago. Having said that -- and I do believe that, that trend is likely to continue, providing we can sort of keep -- have some prices on the -- at the pump for gasoline where -- about where they stay now. So I premise that with that caveat. I think for -- we have always said that United States is a growth business. Despite the current macroeconomic challenges, we've been posting growth quarter after quarter. I'm very pleased that this past quarter also that sparkling beverages was positive, brand Coca-Cola was positive. And we've started putting together the framework for our growth in North America way before the acquisition of the CCE business in North America. I want to reiterate that once again. The brand, price, pack, channel architecture, the -- beginning -- getting our brands to a healthier position than they were previously, getting the right package to be sold at the right outlet and the right channel at the right price, all of that architecture we started working on 3 to 4 years ago. And I think we are seeing some results out of all of that work. And as I've said, we believe that the positive sentiment that we see compared to a year ago of the U.S. consumer, slightly positive sentiment would probably continue is what I would estimate, providing other conditions hold, particularly the price of gasoline.

And those are things that not that long ago, I think everyone listening in this call would have said it's impossible to do. And it's really working. Everything that Muhtar is talking about is actually working. And our brand score is getting better because of the things we have been doing over the last few years. But then, if you look at, ""All right, great, Gary, got that, but let's talk about the financial results and you're showing that on a comparable basis, operating income is down 9% quarter on quarter. So how do you talk about that?"" Well, on that one, that is the issue that I alerted, I think, all of you to earlier this quarter. The way the commodities hit last year, that $800 million of commodity pressure that we had last year, it all was in quarters 2, 3 and 4, basically, none of it in the numbers in Q1 in North America. So when you adjust for that for just commodities, that minus 9 actually gets to only slightly negative. And then you have to recognize that there was one less day. You adjust for that and actually, North America suddenly flips into it was actually positive. You take that then you look at remainder of year, and you recognize that we've gotten the pricing so that the commodities aren't going to be that as big an issue going forward, remainder of year. And all the other things we've been doing, we would expect to see North America in very good positive territory, remainder of year. Things are going, knock on wood, exactly the way we planned for them, too, at this point."

I guess thinking about it, the alliance of the 2 strong competitors, wouldn't this accelerate the pace that you execute your game plan?

I want to reiterate that. That strategy is valid and still in place. And obviously, it will evolve as we introduce a wider variety of packages to promote affordability, it has the consumer experience with our brands, all with a focus to drive incremental increased transactions and profitable growth. And to continue building brand equity with consumers, I think this is critical for us and that will -- you will see us continue to do that. I believe that we're confident in our ability to deliver double-digit growth over the long term, and I think continuing introduction of a wider variety of packages to promote affordability and I think immediate consumption growth. So we will continue driving all of those priorities. As far as the investments are concerned, $4 billion, that I would say probably it's -- you could allocate about 50% into infrastructure and 50% into the brand building area. That's probably a good split. And if you looked at the past 3 years, that's probably where it ended up."

Let me start -- well, in fact, I'll go ahead and answer that last part first. We did have share gains pretty much across the board, across the world and the U.S. So we did have share gains in sparkling. On the commodity issue relative to North America, and if I don't exactly answer the question, just come back and tell me, but basically, if you strip out the commodity impact, North America's OI for the quarter instead of being down 9 would have been down 1. It's exactly what it would have been. And if then -- if you add in an extra day, it would have been positive. So what you're seeing is that 1 day, actually 1 less day, is having a huge impact on the P&L because you've got basically all of the costs going through for the full quarter with a day less sales is basically what's happening, which is why when you go to Q2 and 3, actually, it becomes much more normalized and the commodities are not an issue at all. In fact, it kind of reverses a little bit because you had more of that hitting in Q2 and 3 last year, with none of it hitting in Q1 last year. So it's kind of a cycling thing, but that's why when you adjust for all that, our view is and what we had planned and what we saw all along is that North America actually started to improve significantly after Q1 into the remainder of the year. And that's kind of what -- that's exactly what we're seeing today."

It is more back-end loaded because of how the commodities hit and went through the P&L last year and the 1 day less in the first quarter, 2 extra days in the fourth quarter. Some of the reason -- I have to hedge a little bit on this, is because there was 1 less day, you had a little bit of an Easter shift to help probably the first quarter slightly, but you really can't measure it.

And I think, as I've said, the competitive environment, I think, out in the world is obviously, consumers are reticent to go out, to spend money. The environment is not healthy, particularly in Europe in terms of consumer sentiment, but our business is able to continue to invest and also ensure that we generate value for our customers in Europe, in this case large customers, large format, small format. And one of the really important metrics that we always follow is immediate consumption, which is a healthier mix. It's growing ahead of our total business. And once again, that is a testament to the strength of our system because you can always -- it's much easier to go and gain distribution in the future consumption channel, but in order to ensure that you supply and work in partner with every single small format store takes a very strong and a very different kind of system, which is the one we have."

Let me begin by saying that I'm pleased with our second quarter and year-to-date results. We're delivering consistent top-line performance, in line with our 2020 Vision, and long-term growth targets, despite an increasingly unpredictable global economy. Our business to realized solid top-line results this past quarter, growing worldwide volume by 4% in the quarter and 5% year-to-date. Our second quarter comparable currency neutral net revenue was up 7% in the quarter, driven by solid price mix of 3%. Year-to-date, comparable currency neutral net revenue was also up 7% and our comparable currency neutral operating income also grew 7% in the quarter, raising our year-to-date operating income growth to 6%.
We once again led industry growth extending our volume and value share gains globally in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages. We gained global share in the sparkling beverage category, where our portfolio is now up 3% year-to-date. This was driven by the global growth of brand Coca-Cola, which is also up a healthy 3% year-to-date.
We gained the global share in the still beverages category with where our portfolio grew a solid 9% in both the quarter, as well as year-to-date. Importantly, we delivered these results while further enhancing the well-being of the communities and customers we proudly serve and the consumers whose lives we touch each and every day.
During today's call as we discuss our performance, I'll also share a few of the meaningful ways we are serving our communities across our geographic operations, as these efforts are an integral part of realizing and sustaining our 2020 Vision.
We recognize that consumers across the globe continue to feel the effects and impacts of prolonged uncertainty in Europe, the further cooling of the economy in China, and the protracted recovery here in the United States. Despite this, our consistent quality performance results, as well as our systems commitment to invest in the business for long-term growth give us confidence that we have the right strategies and the right plans in place to deliver full year 2012 results that meet our long-term growth targets. For in times like these, there's no better industry to be in then the nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverage industry. We're proud to be part of a strong and growing industry that passionately serves millions of outlets and refreshes billions of consumers every single day.
Now, let us review our performance results across our global markets in more detail, beginning with our flagship market North America, where this past quarter, our business delivered its ninth consecutive quarter of growth, up 1% for both the quarter, as well as year-to-date.
Importantly, we achieved this growth in North America while sustaining a positive 3% price mix for our total beverage business. And in the process, we once again captured value share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages this quarter consistent with our focus on driving profitable growth in North America. This growth was led by our still beverage portfolio, which was up 8% this quarter, gaining both volume and value share across nearly all of the categories in which we compete. In sports drinks, POWERADE once again grew double-digit this quarter, while also capturing volume and value share. This marks the third consecutive quarter in which POWERADE has led the North America sports drink category in absolute unit case volume growth.
Our glacéau brands, up 5% this quarter, also captured share, driven by the further momentum of vitaminwater 0, up high single digits, as well as by another quarter of double-digit growth for smartwater.
In addition, smartwater began using plant bottle packaging this past May, as we further leverage this proprietary innovative and sustainable packaging that we launched nationally with our DASANI water brand last year. Speaking of DASANI, this brand provided yet another quarter of double-digit growth in North America, delivering both volume and value share gains. The acceleration of RTE portfolio in North America also continued this quarter, up double digits while gaining both volume and value share.
This result was led by Gold Peak, which has now grown double digits for 21 consecutive quarters. Finally, our juice and juice drink portfolio in North America was up 3%, led by high single-digit growth for our Simply brands, as well as mid single-digit growth for our Minute Maid brands. These results solidify our share leadership in the high value, 100% chilled orange juice segment. Our sparkling beverages in North America was down 2% in our second quarter, in line with the broader sparkling beverage industries' results during the same April to June timeframe. Importantly, our sparkling beverage portfolio earned a positive 5% price mix this quarter in a rational pricing environment. We also sustained our momentum behind both Coke Zero and Fanta, with both these brands up mid single-digits this quarter. We're particularly pleased to see this continued solid growth for Coke Zero in North America, considering that this brands baseline was built off of 5 consecutive years of double-digit growth.
This winning track record reflects our commitment to sustainable innovation that delivers year-over-year growth. And Coca-Cola's brand equity scores keep improving, with Coca-Cola's favored brand score among the total U.S. population up when compared to a year ago. This favored brand score for Coca-Cola is now nearly 2x greater than the score of this primary competitor.
Finally, our Coca-Cola Freestyle fountain dispenser, which recently won the Gold Innovation Award from the National Automatic Merchandising Association, is now available in more than 4,400 outlets across North America.
One of the many ways we've consistently served our communities in North America is through our investments in initiatives that promote physical activity and well-being. A good example is how we are encouraging physical activity through our Sprite Spark Parks project. Launched in 2011, this project has supported the construction and refurbishment of more than 150 neighborhood parks, athletic fields and basketball courts. We're also partnering with the National Foundation For Governors Fitness Councils and the American College of Sports Medicine to build gyms and schools across the country. Last month, we announced that we will dedicate $5 million to provide 100 communities with new fitness centers for schools.
While our commitment to our communities both in North America, as well as across the globe goes well beyond just physical activity programs, we will always encourage our consumers to be healthy and active and provide them with opportunities to do so.
With this at the heart of our brand values.
In summary, we have every reason to remain optimistic about the long-term outlook for this market, which has the best demographics of the developed world and remains an unparalleled center of innovation and entrepreneurial activity.
Now, let me turn to our Pacific Group, which grew 8% in both the quarter and year-to-date, including 6% year-to-date growth for brand Coca-Cola. Additionally our Pacific Group captured both volume and value share in nonalcoholic beverages this quarter.
During our last earnings call, we shared our expectations that our volume growth in China might moderate to some extent as our business would not be immune to China's cooling economy. In fact, China's GDP growth rate is at a 3-year low yet still above 7%. As anticipated, the broader beverage industry in China has felt the impact of this economic slowdown. Despite this, our business in China delivered 7% growth in the second quarter, while cycling a strong 21% growth from last year. Year-to-date, growth in China was a solid 8%, cycling 17% from last year.
The right size packaging efforts we put in place in China last year keep generating consistent, strong incremental transactions, in line with our expectations. As such, both sparkling beverage and total beverage transactions were up double digits for both the quarter, as well as year-to-date in China. And importantly, we once again captured both volume and value share in the sparkling category -- beverage category in China this past quarter. We're very excited about our opportunities in this region. Our clear focus on building our business for sustainable growth, provides us with confidence that China will continue to serve as a double-digit growth market over the long term.
Our business in Japan delivered yet another quarter of strong growth, with volume up 4%, bringing our year-to-date growth in this important critical market to up to 4% as well, on a year-to-date basis. Importantly, these results in Japan were broad-based, with growth seen across all channels, including convenience stores, as well as vending. And our Japan business gains both volume and value share in the nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverage category this quarter. So looking ahead, we expect our third quarter volume results in Japan to moderate below our 4% year-to-date trend as we enter what is forecasted to be a cooler summer season when compared to last summer's historically record hot temperatures. Having said that, we remain confident that our system in Japan is well aligned and in a strong position to deliver full year low single-digit growth in 2012.
I also want to update our results in Thailand. I also want to update our results in Thailand. Our business in this market to state it solid momentum, growing over 20% for both the quarter and year-to-date. In the process, we gained volume and value share in Thailand across nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages, as well as in both sparkling and still beverage categories. We are excited about the future growth opportunities in Thailand and we'll keep investing for the future in this vibrant market.
As for the Philippines, we just celebrated the 100th anniversary of our entry into this market. Importantly, we again captured volume and value share in nonalcoholic beverages in the Philippines and have grown our volume in mid single-digits for both the quarter, as well as year-to-date.
We launched our 5 by 20 program in the Philippines almost exactly 1 year ago. As background, this program is our global initiative to enable the economic empowerment of 5 million women entrepreneurs by 2012-- 2020. In the Philippines, we are working with local partners to implement a pilot business skills training program and we are now in the process of scaling up this program nationwide. They economically empower 100,000 women store owners and operators by 2020. We believe there is no better investment we can make to spur economic growth and foster sustainable development.
Moving now to Latin America, our volume grew 3% for the quarter and is up 4% year-to-date. This growth was once again led by brand Coca-Cola, up 3% year-to-date. In the process, we once again captured both volume and value share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages in Latin America, as well as share gains in both sparkling and still beverages.
In Mexico, our volume growth in the quarter was up 1% as we cycled a very strong 10% growth from previous year. This brings our year-to-date volume growth in Mexico to 2%, while cycling 12% from last year.
Importantly, we once again outperformed the beverage industry in Mexico, capturing nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverage volume and value share, as well as in sparkling and still beverages.
In Brazil, our business continued to deliver solid results with volume growth up 6% in the quarter and 5% year-to-date. And our business in Brazil is also driving industry growth, gaining both volume and value share in nonalcoholic beverages, as well as again in sparkling and still beverages.
Looking ahead, we expect our 2012 growth results in Brazil to hold steady at low-to-single -- low to mid single-digits, especially in light of recent revisions to the Brazilian economies GDP forecast for the remainder of this year.
Our Eurasia and Africa business extended its momentum, growing a strong 12% in the quarter and 11% year-to-date, including solid 11% year-to-date growth for brand Coca-Cola. These group's overall performance was once again led by India, which grew a strong 20% for both the quarter and year-to-date, delivering balance and consistent growth across all beverage categories. Sparkling beverage growth in India was led by brand Coca-Cola, up 35% in the quarter and 32% year-to-date. In still beverages in India, our Maaza juice brand was up over 30% in both quarter and year-to-date. And importantly, our business in India captured volume and value share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages and also in both sparkling and still beverages. I was recently in India where we announced our systems plan to increase investments in India by $3 billion, bringing total system investments to $5 billion between now and 2020. These investments will drive innovation and enable our efforts to deliver a portfolio that enhances the consumer experience and builds brand loyalty to deliver long-term sustainable growth.
Russia was up 9% this quarter, raising our year-to-date growth to 7%. The steady acceleration of our business in Russia was once again led by the strong momentum of brand Coca-Cola, which grew 23% in the quarter and is now up 22% year-to-date. Similarly, strong results were also observed across our broader sparkling portfolio as Fanta and Sprite both registered double-digit growth this past quarter in Russia. And our juice brand, delivered 12% growth in the quarter, bringing this brand's year-to-date results to double-digit. As a result, our overall business in Russia keeps outperforming the rest of the industry, gaining nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverage volume and value share.
We also saw robust growth across the rest of Eurasia and Africa region this quarter, including double-digit growth in South Africa and the Middle East, as well as North Africa region. Lastly, we finalize our acquisition of approximately half the equity of Aujan Industries this past quarter.
As a reminder, Aujan holds the number one position in the still beverage business across the entire Middle East.
Between our solid performance, the strength of our bottling partners and our new partnership with Aujan, it is easy to see why we are so excited about the future of our business in this dynamic part of the world.
Moving now to Europe where our volume was down 4% for the quarter, cycling strong 5% growth from last year. As a result, our business in Europe is now down 2% on a year-to-date basis, cycling 3% growth from prior year. This past quarter, Europe was challenge by both historically unseasonable implement weather as well as ongoing macro uncertainties. Despite this, our business in Europe held share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages, as well as sparkling beverages while capturing both volume and value share and still beverages. Germany remains the bright spot in this region, up 1% for the quarter and 2% on a year-to-date basis. This marks Germany's sixth consecutive quarter of positive growth. Importantly, we once again captured volume and value share in ready-to-drink beverages.
This serves as a solid evidence that we have the right brands, the right strategies, and the right capabilities in place to deliver long-term sustainable growth in this critically important market.
We recently concluded our highly successful activation of the Euro 2012 football tournament. In recent consumer surveys, Coca-Cola was overwhelmingly recognize as the tournament's primary brand sponsor with the brand awareness translating into volume and value share gains in the tournament's host nations. We're also very excited about the special opportunity to grow the value of our brands even further through our investment in the 2012 London Summer Olympics. From a brand standpoint, we shared our last quarter -- we shared last quarter how our Olympics moved to the Beat program has been launched globally and activated in over 100 markets. Additionally, to brand Coca-Cola we're leveraging this unique platform to activate a fully integrated global Olympic POWERADE program in more than 35 markets across -- all across the world. This will be POWERADE's first global activation program since it's launched 20 years ago at the 1992 Barcelona Olympic Games.
And in keeping with our positively culture, we placed our commitment to sustainable communities at the heart of our Olympic activation efforts. This year, we're offering the widest range of drinks and sizes ever to be made available at the Olympic Games and we have pledged that all bottles collected at the Olympic Games venues will be recycled and back on shelves within a short 6 weeks. We have also updated the labels for our Coca-Cola packages to present consumers with a clear recycling call to action. And we've also created more than 120 permanent Coca-Cola recycled zones all across Great Britain.
Before closing, let me say how pleased we are with this past quarter when Coca-Cola was recognized as the number one brand by core brand based on a survey tracking the corporate brands of 1,000 companies across 54 industries. This is the 11th straight year we have received this honor, this is especially gratifying since core brand's ranking are based on a poll of 10,000 business professionals with rankings based on brand familiarity, reputation, perception of management, as well as investment potential.
While all of us at The Coca-Cola Company are proud of our performance year-to-date, we believe that our best days are still ahead. Our 2020 Vision provides our systems with a clear roadmap for growth. Our consistent quality volume, value and profit results demonstrate that our global bottling system is very well aligned and poise for execution. As we look ahead for the balance of this year, we understand that consumers still face an unpredictable environment. Having said that, we remain confident that we have the well-loved brands, vision and roadmap with our global bottling partners to effectively navigate today's environment.
We will continue to passionately refresh a thirsty world. We will do so by offering a growing choice of quality beverages that refresh and hydrate our consumers while bringing them simple moments of happiness.
We will do so by sustaining our commitments to communities and to the many well-being initiatives we support. And we will do so by ensuring that we always place our highest priority on creating sustainable value for our consumers, for our customers and for our shareholders.
With that, let me now turn the call over to Gary."
26642,206985603,326142,"The Coca-Cola Company, Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 17, 2012",2012-07-17,"Earnings Calls","The Coca-Cola Company","Executives","Thanks, Muhtar, and good morning, everyone. We delivered solid results this quarter, demonstrating once again that despite an unpredictable environment, our global system is well positioned to execute our strategic plans in alignment with our 2020 Vision.",1250,"Thanks, Muhtar, and good morning, everyone. We delivered solid results this quarter, demonstrating once again that despite an unpredictable environment, our global system is well positioned to execute our strategic plans in alignment with our 2020 Vision. Let me start with our comparable earnings per share, which came in at $1.22 this quarter, up 4% versus the prior year. This raises our year-to-date comparable earnings per share growth to 4% as well. Our comparable currency neutral operating income was up 7% this quarter, increasing our year-to-date comparable currency neutral operating income to 6%. From a comparable basis, the impact of currency on this quarter's operating income results was a 5% headwind. Comparable currency neutral net revenues grew 7% this quarter, including a 3% increase in concentrate sales and a 3% positive price mix. The currency impact from this quarter's comparable net revenue result was a 4% headwind. On a year-to-date basis, our comparable currency neutral net revenue growth held steady at 7%. We also maintained our consolidated price mix at a positive 3% this quarter.
In fact, we realize positive price mix across everyone of our geographic operating groups this quarter. Looking ahead, we will cycle higher price mix comparisons during the back half of 2012, which will lead to lower consolidated price mix results in the third and fourth quarters. Having said that, we continue to expect our full year 2012 consolidated price mix results to come in between 1% and 2%, in line with our long-term target range.
Our gross margin's softened a little further this past quarter, particularly in late May and June. This sequential trend is being driven by both ongoing currency headwinds, as well as by changing and changes in channel and package mix across markets as today's economic conditions are leading consumers to temporarily shift their channel and package preferences. As we look ahead, we anticipate that these currency and mix shift headwinds will continue through 2012. As such, we now expect our full year 2012 comparable gross margins to come in below our second quarter gross margin with this headwind primarily observed in the third quarter of 2012. Despite this, we remain confident in our ability to deliver full year comparable currency neutral operating income growth in line with our long-term growth targets. Our comparable currency neutral SG&A expenses were up 5% in both the quarter and year-to-date. These results include an overall increase in year-to-date direct marketing expenses as we sustain our commitment to invest in the health and the strength of our brands. Our operating expense leverage once again came in positive this quarter, bringing our year-to-date operating expense leverage up to 1 point in line with our previously stated outlook. We now expect our third quarter operating expense leverage to range between a negative 3 and negative 5 points is. However, this pressure on operating expense leverage is expected to reverse in the fourth quarter, especially as we benefit from having 2 additional selling days in the fourth quarter and enabling us to achieve slightly positive operating expense leverage on a full-year basis.
Our net interest came in even in the second quarter, exactly in line with the outlook we provided in our last earnings call. This held our year-to-date net interest income at $27 million. We now expect our net interest to come in as a slight expense at the back half of the year primarily due to expected lower rates in some of our international locations, as well as ongoing currency headwinds. As a result, we are now updating our full-year net interest income outlook $10 million to $20 million with the interest expense that we see in the second half of 2012 evenly spread between the third and fourth quarter.
Our underlying effective tax rate now stands at 24%, which is an improvement over the 24.8% rate we communicated during our last earnings call. And we expect to be able to carry this 24% tax rate through the remainder of this year and end into next year. In our cash flow from operations increased a very strong 15% year-to-date. Our year-to-date net share repurchases total $1.6 billion. This places us well on track to achieve a $2.5 billion to $3 billion range for full year 2012 that we communicated at the outset of this year. With regard to commodities in our last call, we said we expected the full year 2012 incremental impact of our big 4 commodity cost on our results to range between $350 million and $450 million. We also said that if current trends held, we could see this outlook slowly improve. Today, I can confirm based on our latest forecast, we now expect our full year incremental cost on commodities to come in closer to $300 million.
As for currencies, we previously provided an outlook that they would have a mid single-digit negative impact on our full-year operating income. Today, we are still seeing the dollar strengthened against other currencies, including many of those that we do not traditionally hedge and is not effective, but cost is not affected to do so due to the high cost associated with these hedges. As such, and based on our hedge positions, current spot rates and the cycling of our prior year rates, we expect currencies to have an 8% to 9% negative impact on operating income in the third quarter. In addition, we now expect the full-year impact of currencies on our operating income to be a headwind at the high-end of the previously communicated mid single-digit range.
And there's one housekeeping item to keep in mind as you update your models. Our shareowners recently approved a two-for-one stock split which will double the number of outstanding shares in August. In closing, as we reach this halfway point of 2012, we find ourselves navigating through a challenging global economy. The recovery in the United States remains moderate and consumer sentiment is still challenged. Consumers in Europe are feeling the effects of that region's prolonged macroeconomic uncertainty. And the economy in China, while still growing, continues to demonstrate signs of cooling. But it's important to put today is for challenges in our business results and the proper perspective. For a while consumers may be feeling some pressures in these market, we continue to execute with excellence. We are earning pricing and gaining value share in North America while sequentially improving profitability. We're holding our share in Europe while investing in our brands for long-term growth, and we're delivering double-digit transactions growth in China as we solidify our leadership across multiple categories in this growing market. The bottom line is that we are successfully managing our business for the long-term while delivering consistent and solid top-line and bottom-line results. Our system is healthy and is financially strong as ever, generating solid cash flow and investing to support our world-class portfolio brands. We are also investing across the globe to support the long-term health and well-being of our communities, customers and consumers. And importantly, we continue to reward our shareowners, prudently managing our investment to deliver quality results while also paying a healthy dividend. So as we look ahead to the rest of 2012 and a protracted and unpredictable economic recovery, we are encouraged by our consistent results, as well as by our faith and our 2020 Vision and remain confident in our ability to deliver full-year volume, revenue and operating income results in line with our long-term growth targets.

I think operating in this environment has become a norm for us. It's not a passing feature now operating in this very volatile and unpredictable environment and I think that we're meeting the long-term growth targets set out for our 2020 Vision, even in difficult economic circumstances. And I think part of our success is because there's been a healthy appetite for investment across our global bottling system in this environment and stronger than it's been for a long time. Our 2020 Vision is a system vision. It's focus on long-term growth collectively with our partners, bottling partners. And we look back 2010, 2011, the nonalcoholic ready-to-drink industry group by about $65 billion in total retail dollar value and we're pleased to say that our system represented an 40% of that total industry growth, well above our fair shares, underscoring that vision and that collective effort and that investment is working. That said, we're naturally keenly aware of how turbulent the economic landscape is today and we'll continue to be this year. And we've said many times during the past few years, we may hit a bump in the road given the continued volatility in the macro environment but that we're focused on meeting our long-term growth targets on realizing -- and realizing a 2020 Vision and so far, I think you can say that quarter after quarter, we've proven that. All of us at Coca-Cola the entire system remain constructively discontent. We know that we can always do better and I think, you got to realize we've got a wonderful portfolio of geographic regions. And so, some of them may -- not all of them will not ever do well all the time. But just like this past quarter, where we had very unseasonable weather in Europe, we had tremendous again, negative consumer sentiment brewing in Europe. We still have delivered our results and we will continue to do so. And then also, quarter-after-quarter, we're gaining share and quarter-after-quarter, our business, our top brands have been improving. Brand help metrics, I keep on saying, that's an important metric to look at. And when you look at the past sort of quarters, back to 2011 versus today, we've again delivered very strong increments of improvement in our Coke, Fanta, Sprite brand scores as well as weekly plus drinkers. And as you go around the world, I think certainly, there is a sentiment that this is going to be a prolonged crisis, that the high levels of unemployment are here to stay, both in Europe, as well as in the United States and also, that there's a little somewhat cooling off of economies in Asia, particularly in China. But in this environment, I don't believe there's a better business and there's a better system to continue to crack the calculus for growth. When you look at BRICS, Brazil, Russia India and China and the Sub-Saharan Africa referred to ask the BRICS nations. We grew in Q2 a combined plus 8% and so it's worth noting that those markets represent nearly 400 million case of incremental growth last year. And so, we continue to generate significant growth in those emerging markets and we continue to create growth in developed markets like Japan, what you saw in this past quarter, as well as the United States. Ninth consecutive quarter of growth in the United States and when we first talked about that, again, in the midst of economic turmoil, back 2.5 years ago, very few people thought that we could achieve that. That's why I have confidence goal that we believe that we can continue to meet our long-term growth targets despite a very volatile unpredictable and prolonged economic recovery."

You talked a little bit about the gross margin impact. In order to get that type of negative deleveraging, we probably have to see a little higher level of SG&A spending. So can you talk a little bit about that? And then also can you talk about some of the improvement that you started to show in North America in terms of operating profit growth there. As North America sort of I guess, the question is are you expecting North America to also get better from here?

And I'm going to have to take it in pieces and parts, if I could, and see if we can put all that together, we could come up with an answer on it. But let's start with gross margin first because I think that's the most important place",583,"A very good question. And I'm going to have to take it in pieces and parts, if I could, and see if we can put all that together, we could come up with an answer on it. But let's start with gross margin first because I think that's the most important place to start. Even on gross margin, I think you got to split it into a couple of pieces, split the company, look at BIG and International operations and then North America. And on BIG and International, a lot of the gross margin pressure there is really FX currency headwind and it's coming through in cost of sales and there's an impact on revenue and so that is causing some margin pressure and the highest impact of exchange rates, highest headwind impact of exchange rates on us this year will be in the third quarter. And then it starts moderating again on what recycling. So that's the first thing. The second thing while we're on International, on margins particularly is our expectation as we just said is that in Japan, we think growth is going to moderate slightly from the very strong 4% that we've seen year-to-date in Japan. They're going to still have a very good year but I think that will moderate and that'll put -- that'll be some margin compression on the total company. And then if you go to North America, I think, I'd say we've been very pleased. We've seen sequential improvement in North America from first quarter operating income was down 9, 10-ish. This quarter, it's even, and I think we'll continue to see sequential improvement albeit kind of slow improvement and I'll go into why in North America. So in North America, I think what we're seeing and what we saw happen actually in the United States is in about mid-May, we started seeing consumer shifts and the consumer started changing behavior. We think temporarily, but I think it's just you pick up the newspaper, you turn on the television and you see economic, huge economic issues all over the world whether it's no job creation in the U.S. to all of the issues in Europe, China slowing somewhat, and what we then saw was the consumer change go more towards future consumption, packages and channels versus immediate consumption. And one of the things that's a little surprising and I think we'll have to see how this goes and I think for sure, it's a temporary shift, but as the price of gasoline came down kind of in that May, June time period, normally, what you would see particularly in convenience retail is your immediate consumption to go up and it did not. So that, it is probably going to continue somewhat through the third quarter. Again, some margin pressure. So that's what leading us to that gross margin and that's the primary part of it. We've got and then we're cycling some things last year relative to SG&A, so I think there will be some increase in SG&A particularly in the third quarter and that kind of cycles out the fourth. So you put all that together, that's kind of where we get to on the negative 3 to 5-point of leverage in third quarter coming back in the fourth quarter to positive, slightly positive and as the kind of the gross margin as well. That was a long answer but I think it's complicated because there's a lot of different parts to it."

I think it's important to recognize that weather is probably as much to do with what we saw in the second quarter as the economic macros. Probably 50-50 on all of Europe and probably even more so for Northwest Europe. Britain had the wettest summer so far that it's had in over the last hundred years. So the weather's been unbelievably bad. If it turns and I don't want to use weather as an excuse, if it turns, things will be better. We're not anticipating that but hopefully, that will be somewhat better and we are cycling a pretty good summer from last year, a very good summer from last year as well."

And this should not be taken as a kind of a fall off the clip. But certainly, Europe is going to continue to be challenging as an environment but our business gets essentially stronger in Europe because our brands are stronger. We're investing with our bottlers both CC and bottlers as well as Coca-Cola Hellenic.

But also, and so it was not in terms of expectations, it's probably where we expected the business to land in terms of how we saw the marketplace developing. I think year-to-date, growth in China as being a solid 8%, the cycling plus 17 from prior year, I believe, we're content. But certainly, we'll always try to achieve double-digit growth. But importantly, I think the rightsizing packaging efforts that we put into place in China last year continue to generate consistent incremental transactions, in line with our expectations. In fact, a little bit ahead of our expectations. And as such, total beverage transaction and you've heard us talked about transactions really been very good metrics for the health of the business. We're up double digits for both the quarter, up about 12% and also on a year-to-date basis, up about 14%. So just want to stretch that and really important point. And again, we captured both volume and value share significantly in the sparkling beverage category in China in this past quarter. And our brands, particularly in the sparking category have been doing very well and transactions, as I say, which is a great health of the business had been progressing well. In terms of regions, I think the northern regions and the regions more in line regions are doing a little better than the coastal regions in China. And I think we'll continue to see that throughout the year as some popular consumers have moved back into the central and inland regions of China given some of the slowing down of the export businesses along the coast."

Moderate volume, 1% to 2%, and then also some positive price mix on top of that and that's how we would see the business progressing. In terms of share, I think it's important to reflect on the fact that over the last 2, 3 years, we've been gaining market share consistently quarter-after-quarter in the United States. If you look at consecutively, in terms of value share, since the beginning of 2010, every quarter, we've gained  share. If you look at the numbers and value share every quarter, adding on top of the quarter prior. So we've been coming through a historically a very strong share gain environment.

You had immediate consumption channel that's been growing. Is that not enough to really offset what's going on within kind of the immediate consumption side, the mix shift that you're seeing? And then if that's the case, I'm just surprised that the categories like energy drink continues to really accelerate even into June. So what are some of dynamics that you're seeing as it relates to some of that channel and product shift that you've talked about and I guess why is that more of a temporary situation in Europe for you?"

That's one reason. The second reason is the strength of our program, the third reason is what Gary mentioned in terms of holiday season following to the quarter as opposed to the quarter, et cetera et cetera so there's a lot of number of reasons why we're talking about it being not a permanent feature but a feature that will wash out through time. That's why and so I hope that explains some of that."

Let me begin by saying that I'm pleased with our second quarter and year-to-date results. We're delivering consistent top line performance in line with our 2020 Vision and long-term growth targets despite an",2968,"Thank you, Jackson, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin by saying that I'm pleased with our second quarter and year-to-date results. We're delivering consistent top line performance in line with our 2020 Vision and long-term growth targets despite an increasingly unpredictable global economy. Our business realized solid top line results this past quarter, growing worldwide volume by 4% in the quarter and 5% year-to-date. Our second quarter comparable currency neutral net revenue was up 7% in the quarter, driven by solid price mix of 3%. Year-to-date, comparable currency neutral net revenue was also up 7% and our comparable currency neutral operating income also grew 7% in the quarter, raising our year-to-date operating income growth to 6%.
We once again led industry growth, extending our volume and value share gains globally in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages. We gained global share in the sparkling beverage category, where our portfolio is now up 3% year-to-date. This was driven by the global growth of brand Coca-Cola, which is also up a healthy 3% year-to-date. We gained global share in the still beverages category, where our portfolio grew a solid 9% in both the quarter, as well as year-to-date. Importantly, we delivered these results while further enhancing the well-being of the communities and customers we proudly serve and the consumers whose lives we touch each and every day.
During today's call as we discuss our performance, I'll also share a few of the meaningful ways we are serving our communities across our geographic operations, as these efforts are an integral part of realizing and sustaining our 2020 Vision. We recognize that consumers across the globe continue to feel the effects and impacts of prolonged uncertainty in Europe, the further cooling of the economy in China and a protracted recovery here in the United States. Despite this, our consistent quality performance results, as well as our systems commitment to invest in the business for long-term growth give us confidence that we have the right strategies and the right plans in place to deliver full year 2012 results that meet our long-term growth targets. For in times like these, there is no better industry to be in than the nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverage industry. We're proud to be part of a strong and growing industry that passionately serves millions of outlets and refreshes billions of consumers every single day.
Now let us review our performance results across our global markets in more detail, beginning with our flagship market North America, where this past quarter, our business delivered its ninth consecutive quarter of growth, up 1% for both the quarter, as well as year-to-date. Importantly, we achieved this growth in North America while sustaining a positive 3% price mix for our total beverage business. And in the process, we once again captured value share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages this quarter consistent with our focus on driving profitable growth in North America. This growth was led by our still beverage portfolio, which was up 8% this quarter, gaining both volume and value share across nearly all of the categories in which we compete. 
In sports drinks, POWERADE once again grew double-digits this quarter, while also capturing volume and value share. This marks the third consecutive quarter in which POWERADE has led the North America sports drink category in absolute unit case volume growth. Our glacéau brands, up 5% this quarter, also captured share, driven by the further momentum of vitaminwater zero, up high single-digits, as well as by another quarter of double-digit growth for smartwater. In addition, smartwater began using PlantBottle packaging this past May, as we further leverage this proprietary innovative and sustainable packaging that we launched nationally with our DASANI water brand last year. Speaking of DASANI, this brand provided yet another quarter of double-digit growth in North America, delivering both volume and value share gains. 
The acceleration of our tea portfolio in North America also continued this quarter, up double-digits while gaining both volume and value share. This result was led by Gold Peak, which has now grown double-digits for 21 consecutive quarters. Finally, our juice and juice drink portfolio in North America was up 3%, led by high single-digit growth for our Simply brands, as well as mid-single-digit growth for our Minute Maid brands. These results solidify our share leadership in the high-value, 100% chilled orange juice segment. Our sparkling beverages in North America was down 2% in our second quarter, in line with the broader sparkling beverage industry's results during the same April to June timeframe. Importantly, our sparkling beverage portfolio earned a positive 5% price mix this quarter in a rational pricing environment. We also sustained our momentum behind both Coke Zero and Fanta, with both these brands up mid-single-digits this quarter. We're particularly pleased to see this continued solid growth for Coke Zero in North America, considering that this brand's baseline was built off of 5 consecutive years of double-digit growth.
This winning track record reflects our commitment to sustainable innovation that delivers year-over-year growth. And Coca-Cola's brand equity scores keep improving, with Coca-Cola's favorite brand score among the total U.S. population up when compared to a year ago. This favorite brand score for Coca-Cola is now nearly 2x greater than the score of its primary competitor. Finally, our Coca-Cola Freestyle fountain dispenser, which recently won the Gold Innovation Award from the National Automatic Merchandising Association, is now available in more than 4,400 outlets across North America.
One of the many ways we've consistently served our communities in North America is through our investments in initiatives that promote physical activity and well-being. A good example is how we are encouraging physical activity through our Sprite Spark Parks Project. Launched in 2011, this project has supported the construction and refurbishment of more than 150 neighborhood parks, athletic fields and basketball courts. We're also partnering with the National Foundation For Governors' Fitness Councils and the American College of Sports Medicine to build gyms and schools across the country. Last month, we announced that we will dedicate $5 million to provide 100 communities with new fitness centers for schools. While our commitment to our communities both in North America, as well as across the globe, goes well beyond just physical activity programs, we will always encourage our consumers to be healthy and active and provide them with opportunities to do so. With this is at the heart of our brand values.
In summary, we have every reason to remain optimistic about the long-term outlook for this market, which has the best demographics of the developed world and remains an unparalleled center of innovation and entrepreneurial activity.
Now let me turn to our Pacific Group, which grew 8% in both the quarter and year-to-date, including 6% year-to-date growth for brand Coca-Cola. Additionally, our Pacific Group captured both volume and value share in nonalcoholic beverages this quarter. During our last earnings call, we shared our expectations that our volume growth in China might moderate to some extent as our business would not be immune to China's cooling economy. In fact, China's GDP growth rate is at a 3-year low yet still above 7%. As anticipated, the broader beverage industry in China has felt the impact of this economic slowdown. Despite this, our business in China delivered 7% growth in the second quarter, while cycling a strong 21% growth from last year. Year-to-date, growth in China was a solid 8%, cycling 17% from last year.
The right-sized packaging efforts we put in place in China last year keep generating consistent, strong incremental transactions, in line with our expectations. As such, both sparkling beverage and total beverage transactions were up double-digits for both the quarter, as well as year-to-date in China. And importantly, we once again captured both volume and value share in the sparkling category -- beverage category in China this past quarter. We're very excited about our opportunities in this region. Our clear focus on building our business for sustainable growth, provides us with confidence that China will continue to serve as a double-digit growth market over the long term.
Our business in Japan delivered yet another quarter of strong growth, with volume up 4%, bringing our year-to-date growth in this important critical market to up to 4% as well on a year-to-date basis. Importantly, these results in Japan were broad-based, with growth seen across all channels, including convenience stores, as well as vending. And our Japan business gained both volume and value share in the nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverage category this quarter. So looking ahead, we expect our third quarter volume results in Japan to moderate below our 4% year-to-date trend as we enter what is forecasted to be a cooler summer season when compared to last summer's historically record hot temperatures. Having said that, we remain confident that our system in Japan is well-aligned and in a strong position to deliver full year low single-digit growth in 2012.
I also want to update our results in Thailand. Our business in this market sustained its solid momentum, growing over 20% for both the quarter and year-to-date. In the process, we gained volume and value share in Thailand across nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages, as well as in both sparkling and still beverage categories. We are excited about the future growth opportunities in Thailand, and we'll keep investing for the future in this vibrant market. 
As for the Philippines, we just celebrated the 100th anniversary of our entry into this market. Importantly, we again captured volume and value share in nonalcoholic beverages in the Philippines and have grown our volume in mid-single-digits for both the quarter, as well as year-to-date. We launched our 5 BY 20 program in the Philippines almost exactly 1 year ago. As background, this program is our global initiative to enable the economic empowerment of 5 million women entrepreneurs by 2012 -- 2020. In the Philippines, we are working with local partners to implement a pilot business skills training program and we are now in the process of scaling up this program nationwide to economically empower 100,000 women store owners and operators by 2020. We believe there is no better investment we can make to spur economic growth and foster sustainable development.
Moving now to Latin America. Our volume grew 3% for the quarter and is up 4% year-to-date. This growth was once again led by brand Coca-Cola, up 3% year-to-date. In the process, we once again captured both volume and value share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages in Latin America, as well as share gains in both sparkling and still beverages.  
In Mexico, our volume growth in the quarter was up 1% as we cycled a very strong 10% growth from previous year. This brings our year-to-date volume growth in Mexico to 2%, while cycling 12% from last year. Importantly, we once again outperformed the beverage industry in Mexico, capturing nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverage volume and value share, as well as in sparkling and still beverages.  
In Brazil, our business continued to deliver solid results with volume growth up 6% in the quarter and 5% year-to-date. And our business in Brazil is also driving industry growth, gaining both volume and value share in nonalcoholic beverages, as well as again in sparkling and still beverages. Looking ahead, we expect our 2012 growth results in Brazil to hold steady at low to single -- low to mid-single-digits, especially in light of recent revisions to the Brazilian economy's GDP forecast for the remainder of this year.
Our Eurasia & Africa business extended its momentum, growing a strong 12% in the quarter and 11% year-to-date, including solid 11% year-to-date growth for brand Coca-Cola. This group's overall performance was once again led by India, which grew a strong 20% for both the quarter and year-to-date, delivering balanced and consistent growth across all beverage categories. Sparkling beverage growth in India was led by brand Coca-Cola, up 35% in the quarter and 32% year-to-date. In still beverages in India, our Maaza juice brand was up over 30% in both quarter and year-to-date. And importantly, our business in India captured volume and value share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages and also in both sparkling and still beverages. I was recently in India, where we announced our systems plan to increase investments in India by $3 billion, bringing total system investments to $5 billion between now and 2020. These investments will drive innovation and enable our efforts to deliver a portfolio that enhances the consumer experience and builds brand loyalty to deliver long-term sustainable growth.
Russia was up 9% this quarter, raising our year-to-date growth to 7%. The steady acceleration of our business in Russia was once again led by the strong momentum of brand Coca-Cola, which grew 23% in the quarter and is now up 22% year-to-date. Similarly, strong results were also observed across our broader sparkling portfolio as Fanta and Sprite both registered double-digit growth this past quarter in Russia. And our Dobriy juice brand delivered 12% growth in the quarter, bringing this brand's year-to-date results to double-digits. As a result, our overall business in Russia keeps outperforming the rest of the industry, gaining nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverage volume and value share.
We also saw robust growth across the rest of Eurasia & Africa region this quarter, including double-digit growth in South Africa and the Middle East, as well as North Africa region. Lastly, we finalized our acquisition of approximately half the equity of Aujan Industries this past quarter. As a reminder, Aujan holds the #1 position in the still beverage business across the entire Middle East. Between our solid performance, the strength of our bottling partners and our new partnership with Aujan, it is easy to see why we are so excited about the future of our business in this dynamic part of the world.
Moving now to Europe, where our volume was down 4% for the quarter, cycling strong 5% growth from last year. As a result, our business in Europe is now down 2% on a year-to-date basis, cycling 3% growth from prior year. This past quarter, Europe was challenged by both historically unseasonable inclement weather as well as ongoing macro uncertainties. Despite this, our business in Europe held share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages, as well as sparkling beverages while capturing both volume and value share in still beverages. Germany remains the bright spot in this region, up 1% for the quarter and 2% on a year-to-date basis. This marks Germany's sixth consecutive quarter of positive growth. Importantly, we once again captured volume and value share in ready-to-drink beverages.  This serves as a solid evidence that we have the right brands, the right strategies and the right capabilities in place to deliver long-term sustainable growth in this critically important market.
We recently concluded our highly successful activation of the UEFA Euro 2012 football tournament. In recent consumer surveys, Coca-Cola was overwhelmingly recognized as the tournament's primary brand sponsor with this brand awareness translating into volume and value share gains in the tournament's host nations. We're also very excited about the special opportunity to grow the value of our brands even further through our investment in the 2012 London Summer Olympics. From a brand standpoint, we shared our last quarter -- we shared last quarter how our Olympics Move to the Beat program has been launched globally and activated in over 100 markets. Additionally to brand Coca-Cola, we're leveraging this unique platform to activate and fully integrate a global Olympic POWERADE program in more than 35 markets all across the world. This will be POWERADE's first global activation program since its launch 20 years ago at the 1992 Barcelona Olympic Games.
And in keeping with our LIVE POSITIVELY culture, we've placed our commitment to sustainable communities at the heart of our Olympic activation efforts. This year, we're offering the widest range of drinks and sizes ever to be made available at the Olympic Games and we have pledged that all bottles collected at the Olympic Games venues will be recycled and back on shelves within a short 6 weeks. We have also updated the labels for our Coca-Cola packages to present consumers with a clear recycling call to action. And we've also created more than 120 permanent Coca-Cola recycled zones all across Great Britain.
Before closing, let me say how pleased we are with this past quarter when Coca-Cola was recognized as the #1 brand by CoreBrand based on a survey tracking the corporate brands of 1,000 companies across 54 industries. This is the 11th straight year we have received this honor, is especially gratifying since CoreBrand's rankings are based on a poll of 10,000 business professionals with rankings based on brand familiarity, reputation, perception of management, as well as investment potential.
While all of us at The Coca-Cola Company are proud of our performance year-to-date, we believe that our best days are still ahead. Our 2020 Vision provides our systems with a clear roadmap for growth. Our consistent quality volume, value and profit results demonstrate that our global bottling system is very well-aligned and poised for execution. As we look ahead for the balance of this year, we understand that consumers still face an unpredictable environment. Having said that, we remain confident that we have the well-loved brands, vision and roadmap with our global bottling partners to effectively navigate today's environment.
We will continue to passionately refresh a thirsty world. We will do so by offering a growing choice of quality beverages that refresh and hydrate our consumers while bringing them simple moments of happiness. We will do so by sustaining our commitments to communities and to the many well-being initiatives we support. And we will do so by ensuring that we always place our highest priority on creating sustainable value for our consumers, for our customers and for our shareholders.
With that, let me now turn the call over to Gary."
26642,206985603,326262,"The Coca-Cola Company, Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 17, 2012",2012-07-17,"Earnings Calls","The Coca-Cola Company","Executives","Thanks, Muhtar, and good morning, everyone. We delivered solid results this quarter, demonstrating once again that despite an unpredictable environment, our global system is well positioned to execute our strategic plans in alignment with our 2020 Vision.",1254,"Thanks, Muhtar, and good morning, everyone. We delivered solid results this quarter, demonstrating once again that despite an unpredictable environment, our global system is well positioned to execute our strategic plans in alignment with our 2020 Vision. 
Let me start with our comparable earnings per share, which came in at $1.22 this quarter, up 4% versus the prior year. This raises our year-to-date comparable earnings per share growth to 4% as well. Our comparable currency neutral operating income was up 7% this quarter, increasing our year-to-date comparable currency neutral operating income to 6%. On a comparable basis, the impact of currency on this quarter's operating income results was a 5% headwind. Comparable currency neutral net revenues grew 7% this quarter, including a 3% increase in concentrate sales and a 3% positive price mix. The currency impact from this quarter's comparable net revenue results was a 4% headwind. On a year-to-date basis, our comparable currency neutral net revenue growth held steady at 7%. We also maintained our consolidated price mix at a positive 3% this quarter.
In fact, we realize positive price mix across every one of our geographic operating groups this quarter. Looking ahead, we will cycle higher price mix comparisons during the back half of 2012, which will lead to lower consolidated price mix results in the third and fourth quarters. Having said that, we continue to expect our full year 2012 consolidated price mix results to come in between 1% and 2%, in line with our long-term target range.
Our gross margins softened a little further this past quarter, particularly in late May and June. This sequential trend is being driven by both ongoing currency headwinds, as well as by changing -- changes in channel and package mix across markets as today's economic conditions are leading consumers to temporarily shift their channel and package preferences. As we look ahead, we anticipate that these currency and mix shift headwinds will continue through 2012. As such, we now expect our full year 2012 comparable gross margin to come in below our second quarter gross margin with this headwind primarily observed in the third quarter of 2012. Despite this, we remain confident in our ability to deliver full year comparable currency neutral operating income growth in line with our long-term growth targets. 
Our comparable currency neutral SG&A expenses were up 5% in both the quarter and year-to-date. These results include an overall increase in year-to-date direct marketing expenses, as we sustain our commitment to invest in the health and the strength of our brands. Our operating expense leverage once again came in positive this quarter, bringing our year-to-date operating expense leverage up to 1 point in line with our previously stated outlook. We now expect our third quarter operating expense leverage to range between a negative 3 and negative 5 points. However, this pressure on operating expense leverage is expected to reverse in the fourth quarter, especially as we benefit from having 2 additional selling days in the fourth quarter and enabling us to achieve slightly positive operating expense leverage on a full year basis.
Our net interest came in even in the second quarter, exactly in line with the outlook we provided in our last earnings call. This held our year-to-date net interest income at $27 million. We now expect our net interest to come in as a slight expense in the back half of the year primarily due to expected lower rates in some of our international locations, as well as ongoing currency headwinds. As a result, we are now updating our full year net interest income outlook $10 million to $20 million with the net interest expense that we see in the second half of 2012 evenly spread between the third and fourth quarter.
Our underlying effective tax rate now stands at 24%, which is an improvement over the 24.8% rate we communicated during our last earnings call. And we expect to be able to carry this 24% tax rate through the remainder of this year and into next year. And our cash flow from operations increased a very strong 15% year-to-date. 
Our year-to-date net share repurchases total $1.6 billion. This places us well on track to achieve a $2.5 billion to $3 billion range for full year 2012 that we communicated at the outset of this year. With regard to commodities, in our last call, we said we expected the full year 2012 incremental impact of our big 4 commodity cost on our results to range between $350 million and $450 million. We also said that if current trends held, we could see this outlook slowly improve. Today, I can confirm based on our latest forecast, we now expect our full year incremental cost on commodities to come in closer to $300 million.
As for currencies, we previously provided an outlook that they would have a mid-single-digit negative impact on our full year operating income. Today, we are still seeing the dollar strengthen against other currencies, including many of those that we do not traditionally hedge that is not effect -- because it's not effective to do so due to the high cost associated with these hedges. As such and based on our hedge positions, current spot rates and the cycling of our prior year rates, we expect currencies to have an 8% to 9% negative impact on operating income in the third quarter. In addition, we now expect the full year impact of currencies on our operating income to be a headwind at the high end of the previously communicated mid-single-digit range. And there's one housekeeping item to keep in mind as you update your models. Our shareowners recently approved a two-for-one stock split, which will double the number of outstanding shares in August. 
In closing, as we reach this halfway point of 2012, we find ourselves navigating through a challenging global economy. The recovery in the United States remains moderate and consumer sentiment is still challenged. Consumers in Europe are feeling the effects of that region's prolonged macroeconomic uncertainty. And the economy in China, while still growing, continues to demonstrate signs of cooling. But it's important to put today's challenges in our business results in the proper perspective. For while consumers may be feeling some pressure in these markets, we continue to execute with excellence. We are earning price and gaining value share in North America while sequentially improving profitability. We're holding our share in Europe while investing in our brands for long-term growth. And we're delivering double-digit transactions growth in China as we solidify our leadership across multiple categories in this growing market. The bottom line is that we are successfully managing our business for the long-term while delivering consistent and solid top line and bottom line results. Our system is healthy and is financially strong as ever, generating solid cash flow and investing to support our world-class portfolio of brands.

I think operating in this environment has become the norm for us. It's not a passing feature now operating in this very volatile and unpredictable environment. And I think that we're meeting the long-term growth targets set out for our 2020 Vision, even in difficult economic circumstances. And I think part of our success has been because there's been a healthy appetite for investment across our global bottling system in this environment and stronger than it's been for a long time. Our 2020 Vision is a system vision. It's focused on long-term growth collectively with our bottling partners. And when you look back at 2010, 2011, the nonalcoholic ready-to-drink industry grew by about $65 billion in total retail dollar value. And we're pleased to say that our system represented nearly 40% of that total industry growth, well above our fair shares, underscoring that vision and that collective effort and that investment is working. That said, we're naturally keenly aware of how turbulent the economic landscape is today and will continue to be this year. And we've said many times before during the past few years that we may hit a bump in the road, given the continued volatility in the macro environment, but that we're focused on meeting our long-term growth targets on realizing -- and realizing our 2020 Vision. And so far, I think you can say that quarter-after-quarter, we've proven that. All of us at Coca-Cola, the entire system, remain constructively discontent. But we know that we can always do better. And I think you've got to realize we've got a wonderful portfolio of geographic regions. And so some of them may -- not all of them will not ever do well all the time. But just like this past quarter, where we had very unseasonable weather in Europe, we had tremendous again, negative consumer sentiment brewing in Europe, we still have delivered our results and we will continue to do so. And then also, quarter-after-quarter, we're gaining share and quarter-after-quarter, our business, our top brands have been improving. Brand health metrics, I keep on saying, that's an important metric to look at. And when you look at the past sort of quarters, back to 2011 versus today, we've again delivered very strong increments of improvement in our Coke, Fanta, Sprite brand scores as well as weekly plus drinkers. And as you go around the world, I think certainly there is a sentiment that this is going to be a prolonged crisis, that the high levels of unemployment are here to stay, both in Europe, as well as in the United States. And also that there's a little somewhat cooling off of economies in Asia, particularly China. But in this environment, I don't believe there's a better business and there is a better system to continue to crack the calculus for growth. When you look at BRICS, Brazil, Russia, India and China and the Sub-Saharan Africa, referred to as the BRICS nations, we grew in Q2 a combined plus 8%. And so it's worth noting that those markets represent nearly 400 million cases of incremental growth last year. And so we continue to generate significant growth in those emerging markets and we continue to create growth in developed markets, like Japan, what you saw in this past quarter, as well as the United States, ninth consecutive quarter of growth in the United States. And when we first talked about that, again, in the midst of economic turmoil back 2.5 years ago, very few people thought that we could achieve that. So that's why I have confidence, Bill, that we believe that we can continue to meet our long-term growth targets despite a very volatile, unpredictable and prolonged economic recovery."

And let me -- I'm going to have to take it in pieces and parts if I could and see if we can put that all that together and to come up with an answer on it. But let's start at gross margin first because I think that's the most important place to start. Even on gross margin, I think you've got to split it into a couple of pieces, split the company, look at BIG and international operations and then North America. And on BIG and international, a lot of the gross margin pressure there is really FX currency headwinds. And it's coming through in cost of sales, and there's an impact on revenue. And so that is causing some margin pressure. And the highest impact of exchange rates, highest headwind impact of exchange rates on us this year will be in the third quarter. And then it starts moderating again on what we're cycling. So that's the first thing. The second thing, while we're on international, on margins particularly is our expectation, as we just said, is that in Japan, we think growth is going to moderate slightly from the very strong 4% that we've seen year-to-date in Japan. They're going to still have a very good year. But I think that will moderate and that will put -- that will be some margin compression on the total company. Then if you go to North America, I think, I'd say we've been very pleased. We've seen sequential improvement in North America from -- first quarter operating income was down 9, 10-ish. This quarter, it's even. And I think we'll continue to see sequential improvement, albeit kind of slow improvement, and I'll go into why, in North America. So in North America, I think what we're seeing and what we saw happen actually in the United States is in about mid-May, we started seeing consumer shifts and the consumer started changing behavior, we think temporarily. But I think it's just you pick up the newspaper, you turn on the television and you see huge economic issues all over the world, whether it's no job creation in the U.S. to all of the issues in Europe, China slowing somewhat. And what we then saw was the consumer change go more toward future consumption, packages and channels versus immediate consumption. And one of the things that's a little surprising -- and I think we'll have to see how this goes and I think it's, for sure, a temporary shift. But as the price of gasoline came down kind of in that May, June time period, normally, what you would see particularly in convenience retail is your immediate consumption to go up, and it did not. So that, I think, is probably going to continue somewhat through the third quarter. Again, some margin pressure. So that's what's leading us to that gross margin and that's the primary part of it. We've got -- and then we were cycling some things last year relative to SG&A. So I think there will be some increase in SG&A, particularly in the third quarter. And that kind of cycles out in the fourth. So you put all that together, that's kind of where we get to on the negative 3 to 5 points of leverage in third quarter coming back in the fourth quarter to positive, slightly positive and the kind of the gross margin as well. That was a long answer, but I think it's complicated because there's a lot of different parts to it."

In Q2, we had about 11 countries out of our sort of top 22 markets that had IC growth. And the primary reason for that was the very, very, very poor summer -- the start to the very poor summer in Europe. And so I think that is also an important factor that has to be kept in mind. It was a very unseasonable situation in Europe and hopefully, it will reverse itself in the coming months."

And I think as anticipated, the broader beverage industry in China has also felt the impact of that slowdown in the first half of 2012. But also -- and so it was not, in terms of expectations, it's probably where we expected the business to land in terms of how we saw the marketplace developing. I think year-to-date, growth in China being a solid 8%, the cycling plus 17% from prior year, I believe, we're content. But certainly, we'll always try to achieve double-digit growth. But importantly, I think the rightsizing packaging efforts that we put into place in China last year continued to generate consistent incremental transactions, in line with our expectations. In fact, a little bit ahead of our expectations. And as such, total beverage transactions, and you've heard us talked about transactions being really a really very good metric for the health of the business, we're up double-digits for both the quarter, up about 12%, and also on a year-to-date basis, up about 14%. So just want to stress that, a really important point. And again, we captured both volume and value share significantly in the sparkling beverage category in China in this past quarter. And our brands, particularly in the sparking category, have been doing very well. And transactions, as I say, which is a great health of the business, had been progressing well. In terms of regions, I think the northern regions and the regions -- the more inland regions are doing a little better than the coastal regions in China. And I think we'll continue to see that throughout the year as some consumers have moved back into the central and inland regions of China, given some of the slowing down on the export businesses along the coast."

I think, look, in terms of moderate growth in volume in North America and we have -- and also certain amount of positive price mix, given the strength of our brands, I think, and also our new occasion channel-based packaging architecture that we've actually recreated with smaller packages with the mini cans, with 14 ounces and with the advent also of a much wider Freestyle distribution of the Freestyle dispensing units, I think probably is the right way to think about -- given that it's going to be a protracted recovery, that's the way we would think about it. Moderate volume, 1% to 2%, and then also some positive price mix on top of that. And that's how we would see the business progressing. In terms of share, I think it's important to reflect on the fact that over the last 2, 3 years, we've been gaining market share consistently quarter-after-quarter in the United States. If you look at consecutively, in terms of value share, since the beginning of 2010, every quarter, we've gained share if you look at the numbers in value share every quarter, adding on top of the quarter prior. So we've been coming through historically a very strong share gain environment. And I think certainly, we see the pricing environment to be logical and one that is rational and that's very important. And I think we just have to ensure that we keep the right balance of both the marketing and pricing and also improvements in customer service with Coca-Cola Refreshments that are taking -- that are improving every quarter. As we move into the year, I think you should also see us continuing that kind of trend in the United States going forward. And Gary, if you want to talk about the margins?"

And I think, Ali, your question is, is that kind of the elasticities and kind of the relationship we would expect to see going forward? And I tell you a couple of things. One, in a very rational pricing environment, so I think you have underline that and it is, the historical elasticity models would have said that you would have seen a lot greater volume decline, greater than 2%, if you took 5% of pricing. So I think that's a very good thing, obviously. Going forward, in a more normalized market, where you're not seeing the huge commodity spikes that we've seen over the last 2 years, I think a much healthier environment, we would want to see sparkling growing kind of the low 1 or 2 percentage points kind of -- and more moderate pricing on top of that to still get a 3% or 4% or something revenue growth, but do it in a more balanced fashion with between volume and price.

And although it hasn't continued, thank goodness, at the same rate, we also are facing some commodity increases, of course, this year, too, not anywhere close to what it was.

Let me begin by saying that I'm pleased with our second quarter and year-to-date results. We're delivering consistent top line performance in line with our 2020 Vision and long-term growth targets despite an increasingly unpredictable global economy. Our business realized solid top line results this past quarter, growing worldwide volume by 4% in the quarter and 5% year-to-date. Our second quarter comparable currency neutral net revenue was up 7% in the quarter, driven by solid price mix of 3%. Year-to-date, comparable currency neutral net revenue was also up 7% and our comparable currency neutral operating income also grew 7% in the quarter, raising our year-to-date operating income growth to 6%.
We once again led industry growth, extending our volume and value share gains globally in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages. We gained global share in the sparkling beverage category, where our portfolio is now up 3% year-to-date. This was driven by the global growth of brand Coca-Cola, which is also up a healthy 3% year-to-date. We gained global share in the still beverages category, where our portfolio grew a solid 9% in both the quarter as well as year-to-date.
Importantly, we delivered these results while further enhancing the well-being of the communities and customers we proudly serve and the consumers whose lives we touch each and every day. During today's call as we discuss our performance, I'll also share a few of the meaningful ways we are serving our communities across our geographic operations, as these efforts are an integral part of realizing and sustaining our 2020 Vision.
We recognize that consumers across the globe continue to feel the effects and impacts of prolonged uncertainty in Europe, the further cooling of the economy in China and a protracted recovery here in the United States. Despite this, our consistent quality performance results, as well as our systems commitment to invest in the business for long-term growth, give us confidence that we have the right strategies and the right plans in place to deliver full year 2012 results that meet our long-term growth targets, for in times like these, there is no better industry to be in than the nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverage industry. We're proud to be part of a strong and growing industry that passionately serves millions of outlets and refreshes billions of consumers every single day.
Now let us review our performance results across our global markets in more detail, beginning with our flagship market, North America, where this past quarter, our business delivered its ninth consecutive quarter of growth, up 1% for both the quarter as well as year-to-date. Importantly, we achieved this growth in North America while sustaining a positive 3% price mix for our total beverage business. And in the process, we once again captured value share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages this quarter, consistent with our focus on driving profitable growth in North America. This growth was led by our still beverage portfolio, which was up 8% this quarter, gaining both volume and value share across nearly all of the categories in which we compete. 
In sports drinks, POWERADE once again grew double-digits this quarter, while also capturing volume and value share. This marks the third consecutive quarter in which POWERADE has led the North America sports drink category in absolute unit case volume growth.
Our glacéau brands, up 5% this quarter, also captured share, driven by the further momentum of vitaminwater zero, up high single-digits, as well as by another quarter of double-digit growth for smartwater. In addition, smartwater began using PlantBottle packaging this past May, as we further leverage this proprietary, innovative and sustainable packaging that we launched nationally with our DASANI water brand last year. Speaking of DASANI, this brand provided yet another quarter of double-digit growth in North America, delivering both volume and value share gains. 
The acceleration of our tea portfolio in North America also continued this quarter, up double-digits while gaining both volume and value share. This result was led by Gold Peak, which has now grown double-digits for 21 consecutive quarters.
Finally, our juice and juice drink portfolio in North America was up 3%, led by high single-digit growth for our Simply brands, as well as mid-single-digit growth for our Minute Maid brands. These results solidify our share leadership in the high-value, 100% chilled orange juice segment.
Our sparkling beverages in North America was down 2% in our second quarter, in line with the broader sparkling beverage industry's results during the same April to June time frame. Importantly, our sparkling beverage portfolio earned a positive 5% price mix this quarter in a rational pricing environment. We also sustained our momentum behind both Coke Zero and Fanta, with both these brands up mid-single-digits this quarter. We're particularly pleased to see this continued solid growth for Coke Zero in North America, considering that this brand's baseline was built off of 5 consecutive years of double-digit growth.
This winning track record reflects our commitment to sustainable innovation that delivers year-over-year growth. And Coca-Cola's brand equity scores keep improving, with Coca-Cola's favorite brand score among the total U.S. population up when compared to a year ago. This favorite brand score for Coca-Cola is now nearly 2x greater than the score of its primary competitor. Finally, our Coca-Cola Freestyle fountain dispenser, which recently won the Gold Innovation Award from the National Automatic Merchandising Association, is now available in more than 4,400 outlets across North America.
One of the many ways we've consistently served our communities in North America is through our investments in initiatives that promote physical activity and well-being. A good example is how we are encouraging physical activity through our Sprite Spark Parks Project. Launched in 2011, this project has supported the construction and refurbishment of more than 150 neighborhood parks, athletic fields and basketball courts. We're also partnering with the National Foundation for Governors' Fitness Councils and the American College of Sports Medicine to build gyms in schools across the country. Last month, we announced that we will dedicate $5 million to provide 100 communities with new fitness centers for schools. While our commitment to our communities both in North America, as well as across the globe, goes well beyond just physical activity programs, we will always encourage our consumers to be healthy and active and provide them with opportunities to do so. This is at the heart of our brand values.
In summary, we have every reason to remain optimistic about the long-term outlook for this market, which has the best demographics of the developed world and remains an unparalleled center of innovation and entrepreneurial activity.
Now let me turn to our Pacific Group, which grew 8% in both the quarter and year-to-date, including 6% year-to-date growth for brand Coca-Cola. Additionally, our Pacific Group captured both volume and value share in nonalcoholic beverages this quarter.
During our last earnings call, we shared our expectations that our volume growth in China might moderate to some extent as our business would not be immune to China's cooling economy. In fact, China's GDP growth rate is at a 3-year low, yet still above 7%. As anticipated, the broader beverage industry in China has felt the impact of this economic slowdown. Despite this, our business in China delivered 7% growth in the second quarter, while cycling a strong 21% growth from last year. Year-to-date growth in China was a solid 8%, cycling 17% from last year.
The rightsized packaging efforts we put in place in China last year keep generating consistent, strong incremental transactions, in line with our expectations. As such, both sparkling beverage and total beverage transactions were up double-digits for both the quarter as well as year-to-date in China. And importantly, we once again captured both volume and value share in the sparkling category -- beverage category in China this past quarter.
We're very excited about our opportunities in this region. Our clear focus on building our business for sustainable growth provides us with confidence that China will continue to serve as a double-digit growth market over the long term.
Our business in Japan delivered yet another quarter of strong growth, with volume up 4%, bringing our year-to-date growth in this important critical market to up to 4% as well on a year-to-date basis. Importantly, these results in Japan were broad-based, with growth seen across all channels, including convenience stores as well as vending. And our Japan business gained both volume and value share in the nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverage category this quarter. So looking ahead, we expect our third quarter volume results in Japan to moderate below our 4% year-to-date trend as we enter what is forecasted to be a cooler summer season when compared to last summer's historically record hot temperatures. Having said that, we remain confident that our system in Japan is well-aligned and in a strong position to deliver full year low single-digit growth in 2012.
I also want to update our results in Thailand. Our business in this market sustained its solid momentum, growing over 20% for both the quarter and year-to-date. In the process, we gained volume and value share in Thailand across nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages, as well as in both sparkling and still beverage categories. We are excited about the future growth opportunities in Thailand, and we'll keep investing for the future in this vibrant market. 
As for the Philippines, we just celebrated the 100th anniversary of our entry into this market. Importantly, we again captured volume and value share in nonalcoholic beverages in the Philippines and have grown our volume mid-single-digits for both the quarter as well as year-to-date.
We launched our 5 BY 20 program in the Philippines almost exactly 1 year ago. As background, this program is our global initiative to enable the economic empowerment of 5 million women entrepreneurs by 2012 -- 2020. In the Philippines, we are working with local partners to implement a pilot business skills training program, and we are now in the process of scaling up this program nationwide to economically empower 100,000 women store owners and operators by 2020. We believe there is no better investment we can make to spur economic growth and foster sustainable development.
Moving now to Latin America. Our volume grew 3% for the quarter and is up 4% year-to-date. This growth was once again led by brand Coca-Cola, up 3% year-to-date. In the process, we once again captured both volume and value share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages in Latin America, as well as share gains in both sparkling and still beverages.  
In Mexico, our volume growth in the quarter was up 1% as we cycled a very strong 10% growth from previous year. This brings our year-to-date volume growth in Mexico to 2%, while cycling 12% from last year. Importantly, we once again outperformed the beverage industry in Mexico, capturing nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverage volume and value share, as well as in sparkling and still beverages.  
In Brazil, our business continued to deliver solid results, with volume growth up 6% in the quarter and 5% year-to-date. And our business in Brazil is also driving industry growth, gaining both volume and value share in nonalcoholic beverages, as well as again in sparkling and still beverages. Looking ahead, we expect our 2012 growth results in Brazil to hold steady at low to single -- low to mid-single-digits, especially in light of recent revisions to the Brazilian economy's GDP forecast for the remainder of this year.
Our Eurasia & Africa business extended its momentum, growing a strong 12% in the quarter and 11% year-to-date, including solid 11% year-to-date growth for brand Coca-Cola. This group's overall performance was once again led by India, which grew a strong 20% for both the quarter and year-to-date, delivering balanced and consistent growth across all beverage categories. Sparkling beverage growth in India was led by brand Coca-Cola, up 35% in the quarter and 32% year-to-date. In still beverages in India, our Maaza juice brand was up over 30% in both quarter and year-to-date. And importantly, our business in India captured volume and value share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages and also in both sparkling and still beverages.
I was recently in India, where we announced our systems plan to increase investments in India by $3 billion, bringing total system investments to $5 billion between now and 2020. These investments will drive innovation and enable our efforts to deliver a portfolio that enhances the consumer experience and builds brand loyalty to deliver long-term sustainable growth.
Russia was up 9% this quarter, raising our year-to-date growth to 7%. The steady acceleration of our business in Russia was once again led by the strong momentum of brand Coca-Cola, which grew 23% in the quarter and is now up 22% year-to-date. Similarly, strong results were also observed across our broader sparkling portfolio as Fanta and Sprite both registered double-digit growth this past quarter in Russia. And our Dobriy juice brand delivered 12% growth in the quarter, bringing this brand's year-to-date results to double digits. As a result, our overall business in Russia keeps outperforming the rest of the industry, gaining nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverage volume and value share.
We also saw robust growth across the rest of Eurasia & Africa region this quarter, including double-digit growth in South Africa and the Middle East, as well as North Africa region.
Lastly, we finalized our acquisition of approximately half the equity of Aujan Industries this past quarter. As a reminder, Aujan holds the #1 position in the still beverage business across the entire Middle East. Between our solid performance, the strength of our bottling partners and our new partnership with Aujan, it is easy to see why we are so excited about the future of our business in this dynamic part of the world.
Moving now to Europe, where our volume was down 4% for the quarter, cycling strong 5% growth from last year. As a result, our business in Europe is now down 2% on a year-to-date basis, cycling 3% growth from prior year. This past quarter, Europe was challenged by both historically unseasonable inclement weather as well as ongoing macro uncertainties. Despite this, our business in Europe held share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages, as well as sparkling beverages, while capturing both volume and value share in still beverages. Germany remains the bright spot in this region, up 1% for the quarter and 2% on a year-to-date basis. This marks Germany's sixth consecutive quarter of positive growth. Importantly, we once again captured volume and value share in ready-to-drink beverages. This serves as a solid evidence that we have the right brands, the right strategies and the right capabilities in place to deliver long-term sustainable growth in this critically important market.
We recently concluded our highly successful activation of the UEFA Euro 2012 football tournament. In recent consumer surveys, Coca-Cola was overwhelmingly recognized as the tournament's primary brand sponsor, with this brand awareness translating into volume and value share gains in the tournament's host nations.
We're also very excited about the special opportunity to grow the value of our brands even further through our investment in the 2012 London Summer Olympics. From a brand standpoint, we shared our last quarter -- we shared last quarter how our Olympics Move to the Beat program has been launched globally and activated in over 100 markets. Additionally to brand Coca-Cola, we're leveraging this unique platform to activate and fully integrate a global Olympic POWERADE program in more than 35 markets across -- all across the world. This will be POWERADE's first global activation program since its launch 20 years ago at the 1992 Barcelona Olympic Games.
And in keeping with our LIVE POSITIVELY culture, we've placed our commitment to sustainable communities at the heart of our Olympic activation efforts. This year, we're offering the widest range of drinks and sizes ever to be made available at the Olympic Games, and we have pledged that all bottles collected at the Olympic Games venues will be recycled and back on shelves within a short 6 weeks. We have also updated the labels for our Coca-Cola packages to present consumers with a clear recycling call to action. And we've also created more than 120 permanent Coca-Cola Recycle Zones all across Great Britain.
Before closing, let me say how pleased we are with this past quarter when Coca-Cola was recognized as the #1 brand by CoreBrand, based on a survey tracking the corporate brands of 1,000 companies across 54 industries. This is the 11th straight year we have received this honor, is especially gratifying since CoreBrand's rankings are based on a poll of 10,000 business professionals with rankings based on brand familiarity, reputation, perception of management, as well as investment potential.
While all of us at The Coca-Cola Company are proud of our performance year-to-date, we believe that our best days are still ahead. Our 2020 Vision provides our system with a clear road map for growth. Our consistent quality volume, value and profit results demonstrate that our global bottling system is very well-aligned and poised for execution. As we look ahead for the balance of this year, we understand that consumers still face an unpredictable environment. Having said that, we remain confident that we have the well-loved brands, vision and road map with our global bottling partners to effectively navigate today's environment.
We will continue to passionately refresh a thirsty world. We will do so by offering a growing choice of quality beverages that refresh and hydrate our consumers while bringing them simple moments of happiness. We will do so by sustaining our commitments to communities and to the many well-being initiatives we support. And we will do so by ensuring that we always place our highest priority on creating sustainable value for our consumers, for our customers and for our shareholders.
With that, let me now turn the call over to Gary."
26642,206985603,326386,"The Coca-Cola Company, Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 17, 2012",2012-07-17,"Earnings Calls","The Coca-Cola Company","Executives","Thanks, Muhtar, and good morning, everyone. We delivered solid results this quarter, demonstrating once again that despite an unpredictable environment, our global system is well positioned to execute our strategic plans in alignment with our 2020 Vision.",1256,"Thanks, Muhtar, and good morning, everyone. We delivered solid results this quarter, demonstrating once again that despite an unpredictable environment, our global system is well positioned to execute our strategic plans in alignment with our 2020 Vision. 
Let me start with our comparable earnings per share, which came in at $1.22 this quarter, up 4% versus the prior year. This raises our year-to-date comparable earnings per share growth to 4% as well. Our comparable currency neutral operating income was up 7% this quarter, increasing our year-to-date comparable currency neutral operating income to 6%. On a comparable basis, the impact of currency on this quarter's operating income results was a 5% headwind. Comparable currency neutral net revenues grew 7% this quarter, including a 3% increase in concentrate sales and a 3% positive price mix. The currency impact from this quarter's comparable net revenue results was a 4% headwind. On a year-to-date basis, our comparable currency neutral net revenue growth held steady at 7%.
We also maintained our consolidated price mix at a positive 3% this quarter. In fact, we realized positive price mix across every one of our geographic operating groups this quarter. Looking ahead, we will cycle higher price mix comparisons during the back half of 2012, which will lead to lower consolidated price mix results in the third and fourth quarters. Having said that, we continue to expect our full year 2012 consolidated price mix results to come in between 1% and 2%, in line with our long-term target range.
Our gross margins softened a little further this past quarter, particularly in late May and June. This sequential trend is being driven by both ongoing currency headwinds, as well as by changing -- changes in channel and package mix across markets, as today's economic conditions are leading consumers to temporarily shift their channel and package preferences. As we look ahead, we anticipate that these currency and mix shift headwinds will continue through 2012. As such, we now expect our full year 2012 comparable gross margin to come in below our second quarter gross margin, with this headwind primarily observed in the third quarter of 2012. Despite this, we remain confident in our ability to deliver full year comparable currency neutral operating income growth in line with our long-term growth targets. 
Our comparable currency neutral SG&A expenses were up 5% in both the quarter and year-to-date. These results include an overall increase in year-to-date direct marketing expenses, as we sustain our commitment to invest in the health and the strength of our brands. Our operating expense leverage once again came in positive this quarter, bringing our year-to-date operating expense leverage up to 1 point, in line with our previously stated outlook. We now expect our third quarter operating expense leverage to range between a negative 3 and negative 5 points. However, this pressure on operating expense leverage is expected to reverse in the fourth quarter, especially as we benefit from having 2 additional selling days in the fourth quarter, and enabling us to achieve slightly positive operating expense leverage on a full year basis.
Our net interest came in even in the second quarter, exactly in line with the outlook we provided in our last earnings call. This held our year-to-date net interest income at $27 million. We now expect our net interest to come in as a slight expense in the back half of the year, primarily due to expected lower rates in some of our international locations, as well as ongoing currency headwinds. As a result, we are now updating our full year net interest income outlook to $10 million to $20 million, with the net interest expense we sense -- that we see in the second half of 2012 evenly spread between the third and fourth quarter.
Our underlying effective tax rate now stands at 24%, which is an improvement over the 24.8% rate we communicated during our last earnings call. And we expect to be able to carry this 24% tax rate through the remainder of this year and into next year. And our cash flow from operations increased a very strong 15% year-to-date. 
Our year-to-date net share repurchases total $1.6 billion. This places us well on track to achieve the $2.5-billion to $3-billion range for full year 2012 that we communicated at the outset of this year. With regard to commodities, in our last call, we said we expected the full year 2012 incremental impact of our big 4 commodity cost on our results to range between $350 million and $450 million. We also said that if current trends held, we could see this outlook slowly improve. Today, I can confirm, based on our latest forecast, we now expect our full year incremental cost on commodities to come in closer to $300 million.
As for currencies, we previously provided an outlook that they would have a mid-single-digit negative impact on our full year operating income. Today, we are still seeing the dollar strengthen against other currencies, including many of those that we do not traditionally hedge, that is not effect -- because it's not effective to do so due to the high cost associated with these hedges. As such and based on our hedge positions, current spot rates and the cycling of our prior year rates, we expect currencies to have an 8% to 9% negative impact on operating income in the third quarter. In addition, we now expect the full year impact of currencies on our operating income to be a headwind at the high end of the previously communicated mid-single-digit range.
And there's one housekeeping item to keep in mind as you update your models. Our shareowners recently approved a 2-for-1 stock split, which will double the number of outstanding shares in August. 
In closing, as we reach this halfway point of 2012, we find ourselves navigating through a challenging global economy. The recovery in the United States remains moderate and consumer sentiment is still challenged. Consumers in Europe are feeling the effects of that region's prolonged macroeconomic uncertainty. And the economy in China, while still growing, continues to demonstrate signs of cooling.
But it's important to put today's challenges and our business results in the proper perspective, for while consumers may be feeling some pressure in these markets, we continue to execute with excellence. We are earning price and gaining value share in North America while sequentially improving profitability. We're holding our share in Europe while investing in our brands for long-term growth. And we're delivering double-digit transactions growth in China as we solidify our leadership across multiple categories in this growing market.
The bottom line is that we are successfully managing our business for the long-term while delivering consistent and solid top line and bottom line results. Our system is healthy and is financially strong as ever, generating solid cash flow and investing to support our world-class portfolio of brands. We are also investing across the globe to support the long-term health and well-being of our communities, customers and consumers. And importantly, we continue to reward our shareowners, prudently managing our investments to deliver quality results while also paying a healthy dividend. 
So as we look ahead to the rest of 2012 and a protracted and unpredictable economic recovery, we are encouraged by our consistent results, as well as by our faith in our 2020 Vision, and remain confident in our ability to deliver full year volume, revenue and operating income results in line with our long-term growth targets. Operator, we're now ready for the questions, please."

I think operating in this environment has become the norm for us. It's not a passing feature now, operating in this very volatile and unpredictable environment. And I think that we're meeting the long-term growth targets set out for our 2020 Vision, even in difficult economic circumstances. And I think part of our success has been because there's been a healthy appetite for investment across our global bottling system in this environment, and stronger than it's been for a long time. Our 2020 Vision is a system vision. It's focused on long-term growth collectively with our partners -- bottling partners. And when you look back at 2010, 2011, the nonalcoholic ready-to-drink industry grew by about $65 billion in total retail dollar value. And we're pleased to say that our system represented nearly 40% of that total industry growth, well above our fair share, underscoring that vision and that collective effort and that investment is working. That said, we're naturally keenly aware of how turbulent the economic landscape is today and will continue to be this year. And we've said many times before during the past few years that we may hit a bump in the road, given the continued volatility in the macro environment, but that we're focused on meeting our long-term growth targets on realizing -- and realizing our 2020 Vision. And so far, I think you can say that, quarter-after-quarter, we've proven that. All of us at Coca-Cola, the entire system, remain constructively discontent. We know that we can always do better. And I think you've got to realize we've got a wonderful portfolio of geographic regions. And so some of them may -- not all of them will not ever do well all the time. But just like this past quarter, where we had very unseasonable weather in Europe, we had tremendous, again, negative consumer sentiment brewing in Europe, we still have delivered our results and we will continue to do so. And then also, quarter-after-quarter, we're gaining share and, quarter-after-quarter, our business, our top brands have been improving. Brand health metrics, I keep on saying that's an important metric to look at. And when you look at the past sort of quarters, back to 2011 versus today, we've again delivered very strong increments of improvement in our Coke, Fanta, Sprite brand scores, as well as weekly-plus drinkers. And as you go around the world, I think certainly there is a sentiment that this is going to be a prolonged crisis, that the high levels of unemployment are here to stay, both in Europe as well as in the United States, and also that there's a little somewhat cooling off of economies in Asia, particularly China. But in this environment, I don't believe there's a better business and there is a better system to continue to crack the calculus for growth. When you look at BRICS, Brazil, Russia, India and China and the Sub-Saharan Africa, referred to as the BRICS nations, we grew in Q2 a combined plus 8%. And so it's worth noting that those markets represent nearly 400 million cases of incremental growth last year. And so we continue to generate significant growth in those emerging markets and we continue to create growth in developed markets, like Japan, what you saw in this past quarter, as well as the United States, ninth consecutive quarter of growth in the United States. And when we first talked about that, again, in the midst of economic turmoil back 2.5 years ago, very few people thought that we could achieve that. So that's why I have confidence, Bill, that we believe that we can continue to meet our long-term growth targets despite a very volatile, unpredictable and prolonged economic recovery."

So can you talk a little bit about that? And then also, can you talk about some of the improvement that you've started to show in North America in terms of operating profit growth there? With North America sort of -- I guess, the question is, are you expecting North America to also get better from here?

And let me -- I'm going to have to take it in pieces and parts, if I could, and see if we can put that all that together and come up with an answer on it. But let's start at gross margin first, because I think that's the most important place to start. Even on gross margin, I think you've got to split it into a couple of pieces, split the company, look at BIG and international operations and then North America. And on BIG and international, a lot of the gross margin pressure there is really FX currency headwinds. And it's coming through in cost of sales, and there's an impact on revenue. And so that is causing some margin pressure. And the highest impact of exchange rates -- highest headwind impact of exchange rates on us this year will be in the third quarter. And then it starts moderating again on what we're cycling. So that's the first thing. The second thing, while we're on international, on margins particularly is our expectation, as we just said, is that in Japan, we think growth is going to moderate slightly from the very strong 4% that we've seen year-to-date in Japan. They're going to still have a very good year. But I think that will moderate and that will put -- that will be some margin compression on the total company. Then if you go to North America, I think, I'd say we've been very pleased. We've seen sequential improvement in North America from -- first quarter operating income was down 9, 10-ish. This quarter, it's even. And I think we'll continue to see sequential improvement, albeit kind of slow improvement, and I'll go into why, in North America. So in North America, I think what we're seeing and what we saw happen actually in the United States is in about mid-May, we started seeing consumer shifts and the consumer started changing behavior, we think temporarily. But I think it's just you pick up the newspaper, you turn on the television and you see economic -- huge economic issues all over the world, whether it's no job creation in the U.S. to all of the issues in Europe, China slowing somewhat. And what we then saw was the consumer change go more toward future consumption, packages and channels versus immediate consumption. And one of the things that's a little surprising -- and I think we'll have to see how this goes and I think it's, for sure, a temporary shift. But as the price of gasoline came down kind of in that May-June time period, normally what you would see, particularly in convenience retail, is your immediate consumption should go up, and it did not. So that, I think, is probably going to continue somewhat through the third quarter. Again, some margin pressure. So that's what's leading us to that gross margin and that's the primary part of it. We've got -- and then we were cycling some things last year relative to SG&A. So I think there will be some increase in SG&A, particularly in the third quarter, and that kind of cycles out in the fourth. So you put all that together, that's kind of where we get to on the negative 3 to 5 points of leverage in third quarter, coming back in the fourth quarter to positive -- slightly positive and kind of the gross margin as well. That was a long answer, but I think it's complicated because there are a lot of different parts to it."

And the primary reason for that was the very, very, very poor summer -- the start to the very poor summer in Europe. And so I think that is also an important factor that has to be kept in mind. It was a very unseasonable situation in Europe and hopefully, it will reverse itself in the coming months."

But our business gets essentially stronger in Europe because our brands are stronger. We're investing with our bottlers, both CCE, our Iberian bottlers, as well as Coca-Cola Hellenic.

And I think as anticipated, the broader beverage industry in China has also felt the impact of that slowdown in the first half of 2012. But also -- and so it was not -- in terms of expectations, it's probably where we expected the business to land in terms of how we saw the marketplace developing. I think, year-to-date growth in China being a solid 8%, cycling plus 17% from prior year, I believe we're content. But certainly, we'll always try to achieve double-digit growth. But importantly, I think the rightsizing packaging efforts that we put into place in China last year continued to generate consistent incremental transactions, in line with our expectations. In fact, a little bit ahead of our expectations. And as such, total beverage transactions -- and you've heard us talk about transactions being really a really very good metric for the health of the business -- were up double-digits for both the quarter, up about 12%, and also on a year-to-date basis, up about 14%. So just want to stress that, a really important point. And again, we captured both volume and value share significantly in the sparkling beverage category in China in this past quarter. And our brands, particularly in the sparkling category, have been doing very well. And transactions, as I say, which is a great health of the business, have been progressing well. In terms of regions, I think the northern regions and the regions -- more inland regions are doing a little better than the coastal regions in China. And I think we'll continue to see that throughout the year as some consumers have moved back into the central and inland regions of China, given some of the slowing down of the export businesses along the coast."

Given that it's going to be a protracted recovery, that's the way we would think about it. Moderate volume, 1% to 2%, and then also some positive price mix on top of that. And that's how we would see the business progressing. In terms of share, I think it's important to reflect on the fact that over the last 3 -- 2, 3 years, we've been gaining market share consistently quarter-after-quarter in the United States. If you look at consecutively, in terms of value share, since the beginning of 2010, every quarter, we've gained share if you look at the numbers in value share every quarter, adding on top of the quarter prior. So we've been coming through historically a very strong share gain environment. And I think certainly, we see the pricing environment to be logical and one that is rational, and that's very important. And I think we just have to ensure that we keep the right balance of both marketing and pricing and also improvements in customer service with Coca-Cola Refreshments that are taking -- that are improving every quarter.

Going forward, in a more normalized market, where you're not seeing the huge commodity spikes that we've seen over the last 2 years, I think a much healthier environment, we would want to see sparkling growing kind of the low 1 or 2 percentage points, kind of -- and more moderate pricing on top of that to still get a 3% or 4% or something revenue growth, but do it in a more balanced fashion with -- between volume and price, but..."

And also as you know, over time, the pricing impact gets evened out and the consumers get back to a normalized sort of sequence. And so I think you will be seeing some of that happen in the United States. That's one reason. The second reason is the strength of our programs. The third reason is what Gary mentioned in terms of holiday season falling into the quarter as opposed to not in the quarter, et cetera, et cetera. So there's a lot of number of reasons why we're talking about it being not a permanent feature but a feature that will wash out through time. That's why. And so I hope that explains some of that.  
Thank you, Gary and Jackson. And in closing, I think I'd like to once again reiterate that we had a strong quarter and delivered quality midyear performance results. Along with our partners, bottling partners, customer partners, we're successfully navigating through an unpredictable external economic environment with a well-aligned system equipped for long-term sustainable growth. Our 2020 Vision is working. Our system remains resolutely focused on capturing the great opportunities we see ahead in all of the markets.

Let me begin by saying that I'm pleased with our second quarter and year-to-date results. We're delivering consistent top line performance in line with our 2020 Vision and long-term growth targets despite an increasingly unpredictable global economy. Our business realized solid top line results this past quarter, growing worldwide volume by 4% in the quarter and 5% year-to-date. Our second quarter comparable currency neutral net revenue was up 7% in the quarter, driven by solid price mix of 3%. Year-to-date, comparable currency neutral net revenue was also up 7% and our comparable currency neutral operating income also grew 7% in the quarter, raising our year-to-date operating income growth to 6%.
We once again led industry growth, extending our volume and value share gains globally in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages. We gained global share in the sparkling beverage category, where our portfolio is now up 3% year-to-date. This was driven by the global growth of brand Coca-Cola, which is also up a healthy 3% year-to-date. We gained global share in the still beverages category, where our portfolio grew a solid 9% in both the quarter as well as year-to-date.
Importantly, we delivered these results while further enhancing the well-being of the communities and customers we proudly serve and the consumers whose lives we touch each and every day. During today's call as we discuss our performance, I'll also share a few of the meaningful ways we are serving our communities across our geographic operations, as these efforts are an integral part of realizing and sustaining our 2020 Vision.
We recognize that consumers across the globe continue to feel the effects and impacts of prolonged uncertainty in Europe, the further cooling of the economy in China and a protracted recovery here in the United States. Despite this, our consistent quality performance results, as well as our systems commitment to invest in the business for long-term growth, give us confidence that we have the right strategies and the right plans in place to deliver full year 2012 results that meet our long-term growth targets, for in times like these, there is no better industry to be in than the nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverage industry. We're proud to be part of a strong and growing industry that passionately serves millions of outlets and refreshes billions of consumers every single day.
Now let us review our performance results across our global markets in more detail, beginning with our flagship market, North America, where this past quarter, our business delivered its ninth consecutive quarter of growth, up 1% for both the quarter as well as year-to-date. Importantly, we achieved this growth in North America while sustaining a positive 3% price mix for our total beverage business. And in the process, we once again captured value share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages this quarter, consistent with our focus on driving profitable growth in North America. This growth was led by our still beverage portfolio, which was up 8% this quarter, gaining both volume and value share across nearly all of the categories in which we compete. 
In sports drinks, POWERADE once again grew double-digits this quarter, while also capturing volume and value share. This marks the third consecutive quarter in which POWERADE has led the North America sports drink category in absolute unit case volume growth.
Our glacéau brands, up 5% this quarter, also captured share, driven by the further momentum of vitaminwater zero, up high single-digits, as well as by another quarter of double-digit growth for smartwater. In addition, smartwater began using PlantBottle packaging this past May, as we further leverage this proprietary, innovative and sustainable packaging that we launched nationally with our DASANI water brand last year. Speaking of DASANI, this brand provided yet another quarter of double-digit growth in North America, delivering both volume and value share gains. 
The acceleration of our tea portfolio in North America also continued this quarter, up double-digits while gaining both volume and value share. This result was led by Gold Peak, which has now grown double-digits for 21 consecutive quarters.
Finally, our juice and juice drink portfolio in North America was up 3%, led by high single-digit growth for our Simply brands, as well as mid-single-digit growth for our Minute Maid brands. These results solidify our share leadership in the high-value, 100% chilled orange juice segment.
Our sparkling beverages in North America was down 2% in our second quarter, in line with the broader sparkling beverage industry's results during the same April to June time frame. Importantly, our sparkling beverage portfolio earned a positive 5% price mix this quarter in a rational pricing environment. We also sustained our momentum behind both Coke Zero and Fanta, with both these brands up mid-single-digits this quarter. We're particularly pleased to see this continued solid growth for Coke Zero in North America, considering that this brand's baseline was built off of 5 consecutive years of double-digit growth.
This winning track record reflects our commitment to sustainable innovation that delivers year-over-year growth. And Coca-Cola's brand equity scores keep improving, with Coca-Cola's favorite brand score among the total U.S. population up when compared to a year ago. This favorite brand score for Coca-Cola is now nearly 2x greater than the score of its primary competitor. Finally, our Coca-Cola Freestyle fountain dispenser, which recently won the Gold Innovation Award from the National Automatic Merchandising Association, is now available in more than 4,400 outlets across North America.
One of the many ways we've consistently served our communities in North America is through our investments in initiatives that promote physical activity and well-being. A good example is how we are encouraging physical activity through our Sprite Spark Parks Project. Launched in 2011, this project has supported the construction and refurbishment of more than 150 neighborhood parks, athletic fields and basketball courts. We're also partnering with the National Foundation for Governors' Fitness Councils and the American College of Sports Medicine to build gyms in schools across the country. Last month, we announced that we will dedicate $5 million to provide 100 communities with new fitness centers for schools. While our commitment to our communities both in North America, as well as across the globe, goes well beyond just physical activity programs, we will always encourage our consumers to be healthy and active and provide them with opportunities to do so. This is at the heart of our brand values.
In summary, we have every reason to remain optimistic about the long-term outlook for this market, which has the best demographics of the developed world and remains an unparalleled center of innovation and entrepreneurial activity.
Now let me turn to our Pacific Group, which grew 8% in both the quarter and year-to-date, including 6% year-to-date growth for brand Coca-Cola. Additionally, our Pacific Group captured both volume and value share in nonalcoholic beverages this quarter.
During our last earnings call, we shared our expectations that our volume growth in China might moderate to some extent as our business would not be immune to China's cooling economy. In fact, China's GDP growth rate is at a 3-year low, yet still above 7%. As anticipated, the broader beverage industry in China has felt the impact of this economic slowdown. Despite this, our business in China delivered 7% growth in the second quarter, while cycling a strong 21% growth from last year. Year-to-date growth in China was a solid 8%, cycling 17% from last year.
The rightsized packaging efforts we put in place in China last year keep generating consistent, strong incremental transactions, in line with our expectations. As such, both sparkling beverage and total beverage transactions were up double-digits for both the quarter as well as year-to-date in China. And importantly, we once again captured both volume and value share in the sparkling category -- beverage category in China this past quarter.
We're very excited about our opportunities in this region. Our clear focus on building our business for sustainable growth provides us with confidence that China will continue to serve as a double-digit growth market over the long term.
Our business in Japan delivered yet another quarter of strong growth, with volume up 4%, bringing our year-to-date growth in this important critical market to up to 4% as well on a year-to-date basis. Importantly, these results in Japan were broad-based, with growth seen across all channels, including convenience stores as well as vending. And our Japan business gained both volume and value share in the nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverage category this quarter. So looking ahead, we expect our third quarter volume results in Japan to moderate below our 4% year-to-date trend as we enter what is forecasted to be a cooler summer season when compared to last summer's historically record hot temperatures. Having said that, we remain confident that our system in Japan is well aligned and in a strong position to deliver full year low single-digit growth in 2012.
I also want to update our results in Thailand. Our business in this market sustained its solid momentum, growing over 20% for both the quarter and year-to-date. In the process, we gained volume and value share in Thailand across nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages, as well as in both sparkling and still beverage categories. We are excited about the future growth opportunities in Thailand, and we'll keep investing for the future in this vibrant market. 
As for the Philippines, we just celebrated the 100th anniversary of our entry into this market. Importantly, we again captured volume and value share in nonalcoholic beverages in the Philippines and have grown our volume mid-single-digits for both the quarter as well as year-to-date.
We launched our 5 BY 20 program in the Philippines almost exactly 1 year ago. As background, this program is our global initiative to enable the economic empowerment of 5 million women entrepreneurs by 2012 -- 2020. In the Philippines, we are working with local partners to implement a pilot business skills training program, and we are now in the process of scaling up this program nationwide to economically empower 100,000 women store owners and operators by 2020. We believe there is no better investment we can make to spur economic growth and foster sustainable development.
Moving now to Latin America. Our volume grew 3% for the quarter and is up 4% year-to-date. This growth was once again led by brand Coca-Cola, up 3% year-to-date. In the process, we once again captured both volume and value share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages in Latin America, as well as share gains in both sparkling and still beverages.  
In Mexico, our volume growth in the quarter was up 1% as we cycled a very strong 10% growth from previous year. This brings our year-to-date volume growth in Mexico to 2%, while cycling 12% from last year. Importantly, we once again outperformed the beverage industry in Mexico, capturing nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverage volume and value share, as well as in sparkling and still beverages.  
In Brazil, our business continued to deliver solid results, with volume growth up 6% in the quarter and 5% year-to-date. And our business in Brazil is also driving industry growth, gaining both volume and value share in nonalcoholic beverages, as well as again in sparkling and still beverages. Looking ahead, we expect our 2012 growth results in Brazil to hold steady at low to single -- low to mid-single-digits, especially in light of recent revisions to the Brazilian economy's GDP forecast for the remainder of this year.
Our Eurasia & Africa business extended its momentum, growing a strong 12% in the quarter and 11% year-to-date, including solid 11% year-to-date growth for brand Coca-Cola. This group's overall performance was once again led by India, which grew a strong 20% for both the quarter and year-to-date, delivering balanced and consistent growth across all beverage categories. Sparkling beverage growth in India was led by brand Coca-Cola, up 35% in the quarter and 32% year-to-date. In still beverages in India, our Maaza juice brand was up over 30% in both quarter and year-to-date. And importantly, our business in India captured volume and value share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages and also in both sparkling and still beverages.
I was recently in India, where we announced our systems plan to increase investments in India by $3 billion, bringing total system investments to $5 billion between now and 2020. These investments will drive innovation and enable our efforts to deliver a portfolio that enhances the consumer experience and builds brand loyalty to deliver long-term sustainable growth.
Russia was up 9% this quarter, raising our year-to-date growth to 7%. The steady acceleration of our business in Russia was once again led by the strong momentum of brand Coca-Cola, which grew 23% in the quarter and is now up 22% year-to-date. Similarly, strong results were also observed across our broader sparkling portfolio as Fanta and Sprite both registered double-digit growth this past quarter in Russia. And our Dobriy juice brand delivered 12% growth in the quarter, bringing this brand's year-to-date results to double digits. As a result, our overall business in Russia keeps outperforming the rest of the industry, gaining nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverage volume and value share.
We also saw robust growth across the rest of Eurasia & Africa region this quarter, including double-digit growth in South Africa and the Middle East, as well as North Africa region.
Lastly, we finalized our acquisition of approximately half the equity of Aujan Industries this past quarter. As a reminder, Aujan holds the #1 position in the still beverage business across the entire Middle East. Between our solid performance, the strength of our bottling partners and our new partnership with Aujan, it is easy to see why we are so excited about the future of our business in this dynamic part of the world.
Moving now to Europe, where our volume was down 4% for the quarter, cycling strong 5% growth from last year. As a result, our business in Europe is now down 2% on a year-to-date basis, cycling 3% growth from prior year. This past quarter, Europe was challenged by both historically unseasonable inclement weather as well as ongoing macro uncertainties. Despite this, our business in Europe held share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages, as well as sparkling beverages, while capturing both volume and value share in still beverages. Germany remains the bright spot in this region, up 1% for the quarter and 2% on a year-to-date basis. This marks Germany's sixth consecutive quarter of positive growth. Importantly, we once again captured volume and value share in ready-to-drink beverages. This serves as a solid evidence that we have the right brands, the right strategies and the right capabilities in place to deliver long-term sustainable growth in this critically important market.
We recently concluded our highly successful activation of the UEFA Euro 2012 football tournament. In recent consumer surveys, Coca-Cola was overwhelmingly recognized as the tournament's primary brand sponsor, with this brand awareness translating into volume and value share gains in the tournament's host nations.
We're also very excited about the special opportunity to grow the value of our brands even further through our investment in the 2012 London Summer Olympics. From a brand standpoint, we shared our last quarter -- we shared last quarter how our Olympics Move to the Beat program has been launched globally and activated in over 100 markets. Additionally to brand Coca-Cola, we're leveraging this unique platform to activate and fully integrate a global Olympic POWERADE program in more than 35 markets across -- all across the world. This will be POWERADE's first global activation program since its launch 20 years ago at the 1992 Barcelona Olympic Games.
And in keeping with our LIVE POSITIVELY culture, we've placed our commitment to sustainable communities at the heart of our Olympic activation efforts. This year, we're offering the widest range of drinks and sizes ever to be made available at the Olympic Games, and we have pledged that all bottles collected at the Olympic Games venues will be recycled and back on shelves within a short 6 weeks. We have also updated the labels for our Coca-Cola packages to present consumers with a clear recycling call to action. And we've also created more than 120 permanent Coca-Cola Recycle Zones all across Great Britain.
Before closing, let me say how pleased we are with this past quarter when Coca-Cola was recognized as the #1 brand by CoreBrand, based on a survey tracking the corporate brands of 1,000 companies across 54 industries. This is the 11th straight year we have received this honor, is especially gratifying since CoreBrand's rankings are based on a poll of 10,000 business professionals with rankings based on brand familiarity, reputation, perception of management, as well as investment potential.
While all of us at The Coca-Cola Company are proud of our performance year-to-date, we believe that our best days are still ahead. Our 2020 Vision provides our system with a clear road map for growth. Our consistent quality volume, value and profit results demonstrate that our global bottling system is very well-aligned and poised for execution. As we look ahead for the balance of this year, we understand that consumers still face an unpredictable environment. Having said that, we remain confident that we have the well-loved brands, vision and road map with our global bottling partners to effectively navigate today's environment.
We will continue to passionately refresh a thirsty world. We will do so by offering a growing choice of quality beverages that refresh and hydrate our consumers while bringing them simple moments of happiness. We will do so by sustaining our commitments to communities and to the many well-being initiatives we support. And we will do so by ensuring that we always place our highest priority on creating sustainable value for our consumers, for our customers and for our shareholders.
With that, let me now turn the call over to Gary."

We delivered solid results this quarter, demonstrating once again that despite an unpredictable environment, our global system is well positioned to execute our strategic plans in alignment with our 2020 Vision.",1256,"Thanks, Muhtar, and good morning, everyone. We delivered solid results this quarter, demonstrating once again that despite an unpredictable environment, our global system is well positioned to execute our strategic plans in alignment with our 2020 Vision. 
Let me start with our comparable earnings per share, which came in at $1.22 this quarter, up 4% versus the prior year. This raises our year-to-date comparable earnings per share growth to 4% as well. Our comparable currency neutral operating income was up 7% this quarter, increasing our year-to-date comparable currency neutral operating income to 6%. On a comparable basis, the impact of currency on this quarter's operating income results was a 5% headwind. Comparable currency neutral net revenues grew 7% this quarter, including a 3% increase in concentrate sales and a 3% positive price mix. The currency impact from this quarter's comparable net revenue results was a 4% headwind. On a year-to-date basis, our comparable currency neutral net revenue growth held steady at 7%.
We also maintained our consolidated price mix at a positive 3% this quarter. In fact, we realized positive price mix across every one of our geographic operating groups this quarter. Looking ahead, we will cycle higher price mix comparisons during the back half of 2012, which will lead to lower consolidated price mix results in the third and fourth quarters. Having said that, we continue to expect our full year 2012 consolidated price mix results to come in between 1% and 2%, in line with our long-term target range.
Our gross margins softened a little further this past quarter, particularly in late May and June. This sequential trend is being driven by both ongoing currency headwinds, as well as by changing -- changes in channel and package mix across markets, as today's economic conditions are leading consumers to temporarily shift their channel and package preferences. As we look ahead, we anticipate that these currency and mix shift headwinds will continue through 2012. As such, we now expect our full year 2012 comparable gross margin to come in below our second quarter gross margin, with this headwind primarily observed in the third quarter of 2012. Despite this, we remain confident in our ability to deliver full year comparable currency neutral operating income growth in line with our long-term growth targets. 
Our comparable currency neutral SG&A expenses were up 5% in both the quarter and year-to-date. These results include an overall increase in year-to-date direct marketing expenses, as we sustain our commitment to invest in the health and the strength of our brands. Our operating expense leverage once again came in positive this quarter, bringing our year-to-date operating expense leverage up to 1 point, in line with our previously stated outlook. We now expect our third quarter operating expense leverage to range between a negative 3 and negative 5 points. However, this pressure on operating expense leverage is expected to reverse in the fourth quarter, especially as we benefit from having 2 additional selling days in the fourth quarter, and enabling us to achieve slightly positive operating expense leverage on a full year basis.
Our net interest came in even in the second quarter, exactly in line with the outlook we provided in our last earnings call. This held our year-to-date net interest income at $27 million. We now expect our net interest to come in as a slight expense in the back half of the year, primarily due to expected lower rates in some of our international locations, as well as ongoing currency headwinds. As a result, we are now updating our full year net interest income outlook to $10 million to $20 million, with the net interest expense we sense -- that we see in the second half of 2012 evenly spread between the third and fourth quarter.
Our underlying effective tax rate now stands at 24%, which is an improvement over the 24.8% rate we communicated during our last earnings call. And we expect to be able to carry this 24% tax rate through the remainder of this year and into next year. And our cash flow from operations increased a very strong 15% year-to-date. 
Our year-to-date net share repurchases total $1.6 billion. This places us well on track to achieve the $2.5-billion to $3-billion range for full year 2012 that we communicated at the outset of this year. With regard to commodities, in our last call, we said we expected the full year 2012 incremental impact of our big 4 commodity cost on our results to range between $350 million and $450 million. We also said that if current trends held, we could see this outlook slowly improve. Today, I can confirm, based on our latest forecast, we now expect our full year incremental cost on commodities to come in closer to $300 million.
As for currencies, we previously provided an outlook that they would have a mid-single-digit negative impact on our full year operating income. Today, we are still seeing the dollar strengthen against other currencies, including many of those that we do not traditionally hedge, that is not effect -- because it's not effective to do so due to the high cost associated with these hedges. As such and based on our hedge positions, current spot rates and the cycling of our prior year rates, we expect currencies to have an 8% to 9% negative impact on operating income in the third quarter. In addition, we now expect the full year impact of currencies on our operating income to be a headwind at the high end of the previously communicated mid-single-digit range.
And there's one housekeeping item to keep in mind as you update your models. Our shareowners recently approved a 2-for-1 stock split, which will double the number of outstanding shares in August. 
In closing, as we reach this halfway point of 2012, we find ourselves navigating through a challenging global economy. The recovery in the United States remains moderate and consumer sentiment is still challenged. Consumers in Europe are feeling the effects of that region's prolonged macroeconomic uncertainty. And the economy in China, while still growing, continues to demonstrate signs of cooling.
But it's important to put today's challenges and our business results in the proper perspective, for while consumers may be feeling some pressure in these markets, we continue to execute with excellence. We are earning price and gaining value share in North America while sequentially improving profitability. We're holding our share in Europe while investing in our brands for long-term growth. And we're delivering double-digit transactions growth in China as we solidify our leadership across multiple categories in this growing market.
The bottom line is that we are successfully managing our business for the long-term while delivering consistent and solid top line and bottom line results. Our system is healthy and is financially strong as ever, generating solid cash flow and investing to support our world-class portfolio of brands. We are also investing across the globe to support the long-term health and well-being of our communities, customers and consumers. And importantly, we continue to reward our shareowners, prudently managing our investments to deliver quality results while also paying a healthy dividend. 
So as we look ahead to the rest of 2012 and a protracted and unpredictable economic recovery, we are encouraged by our consistent results, as well as by our faith in our 2020 Vision, and remain confident in our ability to deliver full year volume, revenue and operating income results in line with our long-term growth targets. Operator, we're now ready for the questions, please."

I think operating in this environment has become the norm for us. It's not a passing feature now, operating in this very volatile and unpredictable environment. And I think that we're meeting the long-term growth targets set out for our 2020 Vision, even in difficult economic circumstances. And I think part of our success has been because there's been a healthy appetite for investment across our global bottling system in this environment, and stronger than it's been for a long time. Our 2020 Vision is a system vision. It's focused on long-term growth collectively with our partners -- bottling partners. And when you look back at 2010, 2011, the nonalcoholic ready-to-drink industry grew by about $65 billion in total retail dollar value. And we're pleased to say that our system represented nearly 40% of that total industry growth, well above our fair share, underscoring that vision and that collective effort and that investment is working. That said, we're naturally keenly aware of how turbulent the economic landscape is today and will continue to be this year. And we've said many times before during the past few years that we may hit a bump in the road, given the continued volatility in the macro environment, but that we're focused on meeting our long-term growth targets on realizing -- and realizing our 2020 Vision. And so far, I think you can say that, quarter-after-quarter, we've proven that. All of us at Coca-Cola, the entire system, remain constructively discontent. We know that we can always do better. And I think you've got to realize we've got a wonderful portfolio of geographic regions. And so some of them may -- not all of them will not ever do well all the time. But just like this past quarter, where we had very unseasonable weather in Europe, we had tremendous, again, negative consumer sentiment brewing in Europe, we still have delivered our results and we will continue to do so. And then also, quarter-after-quarter, we're gaining share and, quarter-after-quarter, our business, our top brands have been improving. Brand health metrics, I keep on saying that's an important metric to look at. And when you look at the past sort of quarters, back to 2011 versus today, we've again delivered very strong increments of improvement in our Coke, Fanta, Sprite brand scores, as well as weekly-plus drinkers. And as you go around the world, I think certainly there is a sentiment that this is going to be a prolonged crisis, that the high levels of unemployment are here to stay, both in Europe as well as in the United States, and also that there's a little somewhat cooling off of economies in Asia, particularly China. But in this environment, I don't believe there's a better business and there is a better system to continue to crack the calculus for growth. When you look at BRICS, Brazil, Russia, India and China and the Sub-Saharan Africa, referred to as the BRICS nations, we grew in Q2 a combined plus 8%. And so it's worth noting that those markets represent nearly 400 million cases of incremental growth last year. And so we continue to generate significant growth in those emerging markets and we continue to create growth in developed markets, like Japan, what you saw in this past quarter, as well as the United States, ninth consecutive quarter of growth in the United States. And when we first talked about that, again, in the midst of economic turmoil back 2.5 years ago, very few people thought that we could achieve that. So that's why I have confidence, Bill, that we believe that we can continue to meet our long-term growth targets despite a very volatile, unpredictable and prolonged economic recovery."

You talked a little bit about the gross margin impact. In order to get to that type of negative deleveraging, we'd probably have to see a little higher level of SG&A spending. So can you talk a little bit about that? And then also, can you talk about some of the improvement that you've started to show in North America in terms of operating profit growth there? With North America sort of -- I guess, the question is, are you expecting North America to also get better from here?

And let me -- I'm going to have to take it in pieces and parts, if I could, and see if we can put that all that together and come up with an answer on it. But let's start at gross margin first, because I think that's the most important place to start. Even on gross margin, I think you've got to split it into a couple of pieces, split the company, look at BIG and international operations and then North America. And on BIG and international, a lot of the gross margin pressure there is really FX currency headwinds. And it's coming through in cost of sales, and there's an impact on revenue. And so that is causing some margin pressure. And the highest impact of exchange rates -- highest headwind impact of exchange rates on us this year will be in the third quarter. And then it starts moderating again on what we're cycling. So that's the first thing. The second thing, while we're on international, on margins particularly is our expectation, as we just said, is that in Japan, we think growth is going to moderate slightly from the very strong 4% that we've seen year-to-date in Japan. They're going to still have a very good year. But I think that will moderate and that will put -- that will be some margin compression on the total company. Then if you go to North America, I think, I'd say we've been very pleased. We've seen sequential improvement in North America from -- first quarter operating income was down 9, 10-ish. This quarter, it's even. And I think we'll continue to see sequential improvement, albeit kind of slow improvement, and I'll go into why, in North America. So in North America, I think what we're seeing and what we saw happen actually in the United States is in about mid-May, we started seeing consumer shifts and the consumer started changing behavior, we think temporarily. But I think it's just you pick up the newspaper, you turn on the television and you see economic -- huge economic issues all over the world, whether it's no job creation in the U.S. to all of the issues in Europe, China slowing somewhat. And what we then saw was the consumer change go more toward future consumption, packages and channels versus immediate consumption. And one of the things that's a little surprising -- and I think we'll have to see how this goes and I think it's, for sure, a temporary shift. But as the price of gasoline came down kind of in that May-June time period, normally what you would see, particularly in convenience retail, is your immediate consumption should go up, and it did not. So that, I think, is probably going to continue somewhat through the third quarter. Again, some margin pressure. So that's what's leading us to that gross margin and that's the primary part of it. We've got -- and then we were cycling some things last year relative to SG&A. So I think there will be some increase in SG&A, particularly in the third quarter, and that kind of cycles out in the fourth. So you put all that together, that's kind of where we get to on the negative 3 to 5 points of leverage in third quarter, coming back in the fourth quarter to positive -- slightly positive and kind of the gross margin as well. That was a long answer, but I think it's complicated because there are a lot of different parts to it."

In Q2, we had about 11 countries out of our sort of top 22 markets that had IC growth. And the primary reason for that was the very, very, very poor summer -- the start to the very poor summer in Europe. And so I think that is also an important factor that has to be kept in mind. It was a very unseasonable situation in Europe and hopefully, it will reverse itself in the coming months."

And I think as anticipated, the broader beverage industry in China has also felt the impact of that slowdown in the first half of 2012. But also -- and so it was not -- in terms of expectations, it's probably where we expected the business to land in terms of how we saw the marketplace developing. I think, year-to-date growth in China being a solid 8%, cycling plus 17% from prior year, I believe we're content. But certainly, we'll always try to achieve double-digit growth. But importantly, I think the rightsizing packaging efforts that we put into place in China last year continued to generate consistent incremental transactions, in line with our expectations. In fact, a little bit ahead of our expectations. And as such, total beverage transactions -- and you've heard us talk about transactions being really a really very good metric for the health of the business -- were up double-digits for both the quarter, up about 12%, and also on a year-to-date basis, up about 14%. So just want to stress that, a really important point. And again, we captured both volume and value share significantly in the sparkling beverage category in China in this past quarter. And our brands, particularly in the sparkling category, have been doing very well. And transactions, as I say, which is a great health of the business, have been progressing well. In terms of regions, I think the northern regions and the regions -- more inland regions are doing a little better than the coastal regions in China. And I think we'll continue to see that throughout the year as some consumers have moved back into the central and inland regions of China, given some of the slowing down of the export businesses along the coast."

Or does some of the macro challenges you're seeing now and maybe the persistence of those challenges make you think a little bit differently about that?

I think, look, in terms of moderate growth in volume in North America and we have -- and also certain amount of positive price mix, given the strength of our brands, I think, and also our new occasion channel-based packaging architecture that we've actually recreated with smaller packages with the mini cans, with the 14 ounces and with the advent also of a much wider Freestyle distribution of the Freestyle dispensing units, I think probably is the right way to think about. Given that it's going to be a protracted recovery, that's the way we would think about it. Moderate volume, 1% to 2%, and then also some positive price mix on top of that. And that's how we would see the business progressing. In terms of share, I think it's important to reflect on the fact that over the last 3 -- 2, 3 years, we've been gaining market share consistently quarter-after-quarter in the United States. If you look at consecutively, in terms of value share, since the beginning of 2010, every quarter, we've gained share if you look at the numbers in value share every quarter, adding on top of the quarter prior. So we've been coming through historically a very strong share gain environment. And I think certainly, we see the pricing environment to be logical and one that is rational, and that's very important. And I think we just have to ensure that we keep the right balance of both marketing and pricing and also improvements in customer service with Coca-Cola Refreshments that are taking -- that are improving every quarter. As we move into the year, I think you should also see us continuing that kind of trend in the United States going forward. And, Gary, if you want to talk about the margins?"

One, in a very rational pricing environment, so I think you have to underline that, and it is, the historical elasticity models would have said that you would have seen a lot greater volume decline, greater than 2%, if you took 5% of pricing. So I think that's a very good thing, obviously. Going forward, in a more normalized market, where you're not seeing the huge commodity spikes that we've seen over the last 2 years, I think a much healthier environment, we would want to see sparkling growing kind of the low 1 or 2 percentage points, kind of -- and more moderate pricing on top of that to still get a 3% or 4% or something revenue growth, but do it in a more balanced fashion with -- between volume and price, but..."

And therefore, I think you need to put it into that perspective, and therefore, look at it in that regard. And also as you know, over time, the pricing impact gets evened out and the consumers get back to a normalized sort of sequence. And so I think you will be seeing some of that happen in the United States. That's one reason. The second reason is the strength of our programs. The third reason is what Gary mentioned in terms of holiday season falling into the quarter as opposed to not in the quarter, et cetera, et cetera. So there's a lot of number of reasons why we're talking about it being not a permanent feature but a feature that will wash out through time. That's why. And so I hope that explains some of that.  
Thank you, Gary and Jackson. And in closing, I think I'd like to once again reiterate that we had a strong quarter and delivered quality midyear performance results. Along with our partners, bottling partners, customer partners, we're successfully navigating through an unpredictable external economic environment with a well-aligned system equipped for long-term sustainable growth. Our 2020 Vision is working. Our system remains resolutely focused on capturing the great opportunities we see ahead in all of the markets. And as we partner with our global consumers, customers, communities, we fundamentally believe we are building something lasting and something good while creating long-term sustainable value for our shareholders. As always, we thank you for your interest and your investment in our company, and thank you for joining us this morning."

Let me begin by saying that we are pleased with our third quarter and year-to-date performance. We continue to deliver consistent quality results with our business growing worldwide volume by 4% in the quart",3490,"Thank you, Jackson, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin by saying that we are pleased with our third quarter and year-to-date performance. We continue to deliver consistent quality results with our business growing worldwide volume by 4% in the quarter and 5% year-to-date. Importantly, we realized positive growth across all 5 of our geographic operating groups this quarter, despite facing still an uncertain global economy. Together with our global system, we are operating from a position of real strength. This past quarter, we built on this advantage by, once again, leading industry growth and extending our volume and value share gains globally in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages. We gained global share in the sparkling beverage category where our portfolio is up 3% in both the quarter and on a year-to-date basis. 
To put this in perspective, our global sparkling business has generated nearly $450 million incremental cases year-to-date or the equivalent of adding another Russia to our global business. And this growth has been consistently and reliably led by brand Coca-Cola, which has grown every quarter over the past 3.5 years and is up a healthy 3% year-to-date. 
We also gained global share in the still beverage category where our portfolio grew a solid 10% in the quarter and 9% year-to-date. This quarter's still beverage results were well balanced with high single-digit growth in juice and juice drinks and sports drinks, as well as double-digit growth in the water, energy and ready-to-drink tea categories. We are committed to striking a sound balance between of the growth of our sparkling and still beverages. We see this balance as the key to growing our total business while sustainably enhancing our margins and profits, in line with our 2020 Vision. We're also committed to providing consumers more choice in brands, beverage types and calories or no calories, all of which contributes near growth into our business. The balance result that we have achieved across our portfolio demonstrate that we are delivering on this commitment. 
As we've shared during our prior earnings call this year, we recognize that consumers across the globe are still feeling the effects the prolonged uncertainty in Europe, the ongoing cooling of the economy in China and a mild recovery in the United States. We believe these global macroeconomic pressures will extend through 2012 and likely into 2013. Despite this, we are heartened by our ability to consistently deliver quality results, as well as by our global systems commitment to invest in the business for the long-term growth. 
We are also encouraged by how we have successfully and systematically adapted our business model these past few years to readily address the changing demands of the global marketplace. First, we better positioned our company to capture North America's long-term growth opportunity by acquiring CCE's North America business. Our North America business has delivered volume growth every quarter since we executed this important transaction. Second, we broadened the relevance of our Bottling Investments Group, evolving it further from its initial role of fixing challenging markets to a more significant role of spiriting our growth in select strategic markets, such as India and China. 
Constant renewal is in our DNA. Now with solid fundamentals and real momentum in our business, we are ready to take the next step towards our 2020 Vision. As announced last quarter, effective January 1, 2013, we're organizing our company around 3 major operating businesses: Coca-Cola International, consisting of our Europe, Pacific and Eurasia & Africa operations; Coca-Cola Americas, consisting of our North America and Latin America operations; and Bottling Investments Group, which will continue to oversee our company-owned bottling operations outside of North America. By consolidating leadership of our global operations under 2 large and similar-sized geographic regions, as well as in our Bottling Investments Group, we will streamline reporting lines and intensify our focus on key markets. This new lead-evolve structure will also enable us to better leverage synergies and more flexibly adjust our business strategies within those geographies in the future. All of this will further strengthen our efforts to achieve long-term sustainable growth as we advance our momentum towards our 2020 Vision. 
Now let's review our performance across our global markets in more detail beginning with our flagship market, North America. This past quarter, our business in North America delivered its 10th consecutive quarter of growth, up 2% for the quarter and year-to-date. We also captured volume and value share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages while sustaining a positive 3% price/mix for our total North America beverage business. Our growth in North America was once again driven by our still beverage portfolio, which was up 7% this quarter. This is the 10th consecutive quarter that our North America still beverage portfolio has either maintained or gained both volume and value share. In sports drinks, POWERADE grew volume 9% this quarter, while also leading the North America sports drink category in absolute unit case volume growth for the fourth consecutive quarter. Our juice and juice drinks portfolio in North America outpaced the category, up 6% for the quarter while gaining both volume and value share. Our positive result in this category was broad-based, driven by strong growth in our juice drinks business, volume and value share growth across our Minute Maid Light portfolio and further value share gains in the 100% chilled orange juice segment. Our glacéau brands were up mid-single digits in North America, once again this quarter, gaining both volume and value share and lead by the 18th straight quarter of double-digit growth for our premium smartwater brand. The rest of our North America water business grew 4% in the quarter led by DASANI, which maintained its premium price position and soft gains across that brand equity measures driven by consumer awareness of our innovative PlantBottle packaging. And our key portfolio in North America sustained its momentum, up double-digits while gaining both volume and value share. This result was led by Gold Peak, which has now grown strong double-digits for 22 consecutive quarters. Our sparkling beverages in North America were even in the third quarter, a sequential improvement over our second quarter result and ahead of the broader sparkling beverage industry. Importantly, our sparkling beverage portfolio earned a positive 3% price/mix in both the quarter and the year-to-date and what continues to be a rationale pricing environment. Coca-Cola Zero growth accelerated, up 9% this quarter. We also sustained our momentum behind Fanta, which was up mid-single-digits for the third consecutive quarter. We are encouraged by our consistent progress in North America and we remain positive about the long-term outlook for this very important market. 
We are also leading effort across communities in the United States to tackle obesity. Last week, we joined a fellow members of the beverage industry to announce the first of its kind partnership with the cities of Chicago and San Antonio encouraging the citizens of these cities to be more health aware and physically active. We introduced a city-to-city wellness challenge, as well as our new calories count program that will provide consumers with the choices information they needed to choose beverages that are right for themselves and for their families. When it comes to noncommunicable diseases such as obesity, we know that there are no simple answers. But we also know that a lack of physical activity is a primary contributor to obesity. We also know that there is a lack of understanding of how many calories people consume in a day. As such, our company is committed to partnering with customers and cities to promote active, healthy, balanced lifestyle, as well as making calorie information more transparent.
Now let me turn to our Pacific Group, which grew 3% in the third quarter and 6% year-to-date. Our business in Japan was up 2% this quarter, bringing our year-to-date volume growth in Japan to 3%. Japan has now delivered volume growth in 8 of the last 9 quarters. Our business in Japan continues to gain share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages this quarter and also grew both volume and value share in still beverages. This positive result was driven by the sustained momentum of our Georgia coffee brand and water and sports drink category offerings, which led to consistent volume growth across channels, including drugstores, convenience retail outlet, as well as supermarkets. Looking ahead and consistent with what we said during our last earnings call, we expect our fourth quarter volume results in Japan to moderate somewhat below our year-to-date trend as we cycle strong growth from prior year. Having said that, our business in Japan is on track to deliver full year low-single-digit growth. 
Moving now to China. Our business delivered 2% volume growth this quarter, cycling last year's double-digit growth. On a year-to-date basis, our volume in China has grown 6%, cycling strong 15% growth from last year. And once again, this quarter, we captured both volume and value share in sparkling beverages. Importantly and in alignment with our strategic priorities in China, we are growing transactions ahead of volume with total transactions up 10% year-to-date. One package that is helping us to deliver against that strategy is our 300 ML -- millimeter package. On a year-to-date basis, this new package has generated over $0.5 billion incremental transactions in China. We will keep driving our 300 ML package to provide consumers with a great offering at the right price point while also building our brand and the sparkling category in a healthy way over the long term. 
As we look ahead to the next 6 months, it is reasonable to expect that China's ongoing economic slowdown may have a short-term effect on our industry and on our business. In our view, the Chinese economy's undergoing natural and necessary economy transition as the government place greater emphasis on controlling long-term inflation over injecting short-term economic stimulus. While the Chinese economy undergoes this period of transition, we have every confidence in the long-term resilience of our business for 3 key reasons. First, our brands in China are strong. In our latest survey of consumers aged 12 to 49 years old, Coca-Cola was rated as both the most favorite sparkling and nonalcoholic ready-to-drink brand. In this same survey, Minute Maid was rated as the most favorite juice drinks brands. Second, we hold the leadership position in the sparkling category. This is the ninth consecutive quarter in which our sparkling beverages in China either maintained or gained both volume and value share. And third, our system in China is strategically focused, well-aligned and committed to invest for sustainable long-term growth. As such, we remain encouraged and excited about our opportunities in this region and continue to believe that China will serve as the long-term growth driver for our business. 
I also want to share our perspective on a few other markets in the Pacific that are exhibiting strong growth starting with Thailand, which again delivered double-digit growth, up a sound 19% this quarter. Thailand growth was led by brand Coca-Cola, which was up 26% in the quarter and 34% year-to-date. I also want to highlight our result in South Korea, another market, which has grown double-digits in both the quarter and on a year-to-date basis. As additional context, our business in South Korea has nearly doubled since 2007. This is a testament to our system's ability to implement a robust set of occasion-based price and packaging offerings to consumers and drive growth across these region. We are excited about the growth opportunities in both Thailand and South Korea and we'll keep investing for the future in these vibrant markets. 
Moving now to Latin America, our volume grew 5% for both the quarter, as well as year-to-date. As in previous quarters, this growth was led by brand Coca-Cola, up 3% in both the quarter and year-to-date. In Latin America, we once again captured both volume and value share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages. Our 2 largest markets in Latin America, Mexico and Brazil, were both up a solid 6% this past quarter while also growing volume and value share in sparkling, still and also the entire nonalcoholic ready-to-drink category. Importantly, our growth in both these markets was well-balanced across all categories. Mexico grew sparkling beverages 3% and still beverages were up double-digits for the quarter. Similarly, Brazil delivered 4% sparkling beverage growth and double-digit still beverage growth for the quarter. Brazil is up 5% on a year-to-date basis. In light of these strong results, we now expect our 2012 growth in Brazil to be in the mid-single-digits. 
Let me also share our perspective on a few other markets in Latin America that we see as great opportunities for long-term growth, specifically Columbia, Ecuador and Peru. Together, these markets are 1/3 the size of our current Brazilian business. Our system is very focused on implementing the same winning strategies in these markets that have driven such positive results in Brazil this past decade. We will keep investing in Columbia, investing in Ecuador and Peru and across the entire Latin America region as we execute our 2020 Vision. As such, it is easy to see why we are excited about the long-term growth opportunity represented by these 3 dynamic Latin American markets. 
Our Eurasia & Africa business extended its strong momentum growing a solid 11% in both the quarter and year-to-date, including 11% year-to-date growth for brand Coca-Cola. During the quarter, our business in Eurasia & Africa grew both volume and value share in total 
nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages. On a country level, India, once again led this groups performance delivering balanced and consistent quality growth. Our business in India was up 15% for the quarter with double-digit growth and volume and value share gains realized growth both sparkling and still beverages. Sparkling beverage growth in India was led by brand Coca-Cola, up over 30% for the second consecutive quarter, as we sustained our focus on immediate consumption offerings. And still beverages in India were led by our juice drink brands with Maaza up over 20%, again in the quarter. Russia was up 7% in both the quarter and year-to-date with the strong result driven by the further acceleration of brand Coca-Cola, which grew 18% in the quarter and 20% year-to-date. 
Like last quarter, we observed similarly strong results across our broader sparkling portfolio in Russia with Fanta up 15% and Sprite up 7%. And our Dobriy juice brand, built on its recent success, delivering 16% growth in the quarter and raising this brand's year-to-date performance up to 12%. 
Our strong performance across the Eurasia & Africa Group was supported by our partnership with Aujan. We are excited about the further growth opportunities represented by our partnership with Aujan, which holds the #1 position in the still beverage business across the entire Middle East. And our collaborations in Eurasia & Africa extend beyond business relationships as is exemplified by our partnership with The Global Fund to bring critical medicines to rural Africa. At last month's Clinton Global Initiative, we announced our plans to expand the reach of project Last Mile, which was established in 2010 to help Tanzania's government run medicine distribution network build a more efficient supply chain by leveraging our expensive distribution system and core business expertise. Nearly 20 million Africans have benefited from this partnership since 2010. The newest face of this partnership will increase the availability of medicines to 75% of Tanzania and expand the project's reach to Ghana and Mozambique. The success of this project demonstrates our belief in the power of civil society, government and the private sector, or what we call the Golden Triangle, working closely together to solve real global issues and problems. 
Moving now to Europe, we saw our business return to growth, up a solid 1% for the quarter. These results were achieved despite the continuation of unseasonably poor weather in the first half of the quarter, as well as the impact of ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty. Even with these external headwinds, all 4 of our European business units saw positive growth this quarter, demonstrating our ability to execute with excellence across this entire region. Germany once again led the region, up 3% for the quarter and 2% year-to-date. This marks Germany's seventh consecutive quarter of positive growth. And while our business in Germany is winning today, we are connecting with consumers to ensure continued success for tomorrow. An example of this was our award-winning Coca-Cola summer campaign in Germany, which was named the best 2012 out-of-home campaign by Germany's leading marketing industry weekly. Understanding that music is a passion point for teenagers, our campaign in Germany leveraged our global partnership with Spotify, a leading music streaming platform, to offer teenagers access to millions of songs and exclusive Coca-Cola content. This campaign generated more than 1.5 billion contacts and reached more than 90% of all teenagers in Germany as they created their own Coca-Cola playlist and shared them with their friends via Facebook. We are successfully applying the same consumer engagement principles across regions as exemplified by our highly successful global activation of the 2012 London Summer Olympics Games. Our internal indicators show that the marketing programs we executed across almost 100 markets drove global improvements in recruitment, frequency and brand equity with our consumers. 
Our television commercials were acknowledged by asymmetric as consistently being among the highest rated ads during the Olympics. Our efforts across the digital and mobile space were also recognized. We received a digital Gold Award by who analyzed the social media performance of every major sponsor. And we were honored with a global Marketer of the Year award by the Mobile Marketing Association while also taking home the best in show not at their hours as revenue for our Olympic Games Move to the Beat campaign. On social media programs success goes well beyond our Olympics activation. Over just last 9 months, Coca-Cola's Facebook page has grown over 40%. This past quarter, Coca-Cola became the first brand to achieve over 50 million likes. And as of today, this number has increased further surpassing 52 million. This arose the growth of our social engagements footprint across all major social networks that generate conversation and content with our consumers. The recent study by PECO Media found that Coca-Cola was the #1 brand in social media impressions by nearly 2:1 margin over the next most mentioned brand. Another area of emphasis for our system is the support sustainable communities by replenishing 100% of the water used in our finished beverages by 2020. To advance this goal, we recently announced the global clean water partnership with Decca Research and Development to bring clean water to communities where potable water access is limited. This partnership will leverage innovative technology to deliver clean drinking water to schools, health clinics and community centers in rural regions of Africa, Asia and Latin America. When fully scaled, this partnership is expected to add more than 0.5 billion liters of clean drinking water per year to the global water supply.
The water is the lifeblood of our business. We're committed to doing our part to replenish the water we use and give back to communities we proudly serve. By partnering with Decca, we hope to empower local entrepreneurs with the specific focus on women by delivering, as well as maintaining a clean water solution for communities and improving the daily lives of thousands of people around the world. Finally, we were humbled and honored earlier this month when brand Coca-Cola atop the list of Interbrand the best global brands rankings. Interbrand has rated Coca-Cola as the #1 brand on this list every year since 2000. This is a testament to our ongoing commitment to invest in our brands, innovate our marketing and engage with our consumers in a sustainable manner that builds long-term value. Certainly the world has been very volatile from a macroeconomic perspective over the last 4 years of the global company. And also on behalf of all our associates, I am pleased to say that we continue to crack the calculus for growth in this challenging and volatile environment. We've done this by consistently increasing our investments in our system and our brands to ensure that our global portfolio is more relevant and healthier year-to-date than it's ever been during our history. We remain resolutely focused on ensuring that we leverage our unique heritage and fuse it with what is expected by our consumers today in order to earn and sustain our place in their daily lives today and tomorrow. 
I want to thank all of our consumers who excite us into their lives, 1.8 billion times each and everyday. And I want to thank all of our shareholders for your interest in an investment in our company. It's a great responsibility. You can rest assured that our entire leadership team is working diligently to protect and grow the value of your investment in our company, both today and for tomorrow. So with that, let me time the call over to Gary."
26642,216022433,365297,"The Coca-Cola Company, Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Oct 16, 2012",2012-10-16,"Earnings Calls","The Coca-Cola Company","Executives","Thanks, Muhtar, and good morning, everyone. We delivered another quarter of solid performance results reflecting our global system's ability to consistently execute our strategic plans while managing through a still unpredictable macroeconomic environment",1398,"Thanks, Muhtar, and good morning, everyone. We delivered another quarter of solid performance results reflecting our global system's ability to consistently execute our strategic plans while managing through a still unpredictable macroeconomic environment. As you all recall, I provided a commentary about third quarter during our last earnings call because we knew there were several unique timing and cycling factors to consider when modeling the third quarter. Taking these factors into account, in place to say that our third quarter results were consistent with the commentary we provided in our last earnings call. And as such, we remain confident in our ability to deliver full year volume revenue and operating income results in line with our long-term growth targets. 
So let me start our review with our third quarter results with our comparable earnings per share, which came in at $0.51 this quarter and at $1.56 on a year-to-date basis, up 2% year-to-date, despite facing considerable currency headwinds throughout the year. Our comparable currency neutral operating income was up 1% this quarter, in line with our expectations. And on a comparable basis, the impact of currency on this quarter's operating income results was a 7% headwind. On a year-to-date basis, our comparable currency neutral operating income is up 4%, also in line with our expectations. As per my previous comment, we expect to deliver full year operating income results in line with our long-term growth targets and we understand that this implies we will achieve double-digit comparable currency neutral operating income growth in the fourth quarter. Comparable currency neutral net revenues grew 6% in the quarter. The currency impact on this quarter's comparable net revenue results was a 5% headwind. On a year-to-date basis, comparable currency neutral net revenue growth is also at 6%. As we discuss profit and revenue growth rates let me take a moment to remind everyone that the profits and revenues generated by some of our more recent strategic partnerships, including Aujan and, among others, are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. So while unit cases related to these businesses are fully reflected in our volume growth, their associated concentrate sales or concentrate gallons associated profits and revenues are not currently contributing to our operating income and revenue growth rates. Instead these profits are consultative into our equity income results. While this did not materially impact our third quarter results, I think it's important to because there is an impact on growth rates. 
Returning now to a review of the third quarter results, our concentrate sales came in slightly ahead of unit case volume by approximately 1/2 of 1%. As a reminder, growth rates or concentrate sales and unit cases can vary from quarter-to-quarter. Having said that, concentrate sales are in-line with unit cases year-to-date, and we expect our full year concentrate sales growth to be in line with unit case volume growth.
As for our consolidated price/mix, this came in slightly positive in the quarter rounding to even, consistent with outlook we provided in our last quarter call. On a year-to-date basis, our consolidated price/mix is up 2%. We continue to expect our full year 2012 consolidated price/mix results to come in between 1% and 2%, in line with our long-term target range. Our third quarter comparable gross margin's were in line with our second quarter comparable gross margins. This was a slight improvement over the estimate we provided during our last earnings call, as we successfully offset some of the currency in mid-shift headwinds pleased with our business. For the full year, we still expect our comparable gross margin to come in below our second and third quarter comparable gross margins. On comparable currency neutral SG&A expenses, they were up 8% in the quarter and 6% year-to-date. These results include a mid-single-digit increase in our third quarter direct marketing expenses as we continue to invest in the health and strength of our brands. Our third quarter SG&A also reflects an increase due to the timing of certain operating expenses, as well as of the cost of adding incremental feet on the street, primarily North America in support of our growing business. And 1 point of our both quarter and year-to-date SG&A rate is related to the impact of structural items, primarily in our Bottling Investments Group and North American business. As we look to the rest of the year, we expect our full year SG&A to come in close to our current year-to-date rate. Our operating expense leverage was minus 4 points this quarter, right in line with the minus 3 to a minus 5 point range we estimated during our last earnings call. 
As we've stated in our last call, we expect this trend to reverse in the fourth quarter as we benefit from having 2 additional selling days, this should enable us to achieve slightly positive steep operating leverage on a full year basis. Our net interest came in at a positive $16 million in the third quarter, which is ahead of our initial expectations. This raised our year-to-date net interest income to $43 million. Looking ahead, we still expect our net interest to come in as an expense in the first quarter, primarily due to expected lower rates in some of our international locations, as well as ongoing currency headwinds. As a result, we're updating our full year net interest income outlook to a $30 million to $40 million range. 
Our underlying effective tax rate held steady at 24%, and we expect to carry this 24% tax rate into next year. And our cash flow from operations increased a very healthy and very strong 15% year-to-date. Our year-to-date share repurchases, net of employee stock option exercises, totaled $2.3 billion placing us well on-track to achieve the $2.5 billion to $3 billion range for full year 2012 that we communicated at the outset of this year.
With regard to commodities. In our last call, we reduced the estimated full year incremental impact of our BIG 4 commodity cost on our results to $300 million. Based on our latest forecast and hedge positions, we now expect our full year incremental cost of commodities will come in at approximately $225 million. As for currencies, we previously provided an outlook that we would have an 8% to 9% headwind on an operating income in the third quarter. Today I can confirm that currency came in slightly better than our initial outlook, resulting in a 7% headwind on third quarter comparable operating income. Based on our hedge positions, current spot rates and the cycling of our prior year rates, we continue to expect currencies to be a mid-single-digit headwind on our operating income, in both the fourth quarter and on a full year basis. 
In closing, and as Muhtar said earlier, we are strategically and successfully advancing our global momentum, while navigating through a challenging global economy. Our system is focused on maximizing economic profit and long-term cash flow, which allows us to continue to reinvest in the business and anticipate changes in the marketplace and competitive dynamics. While we have made several important and strategic investments of this year, our financial priorities remain the same, we'll reinvest in the core business. We still expect to spend around $3 billion in capital expenditures in 2012. We will strategically invest in acquisitions and partnerships, the strength in our Bottling System and to increase our position in key nonalcoholic ready-to-drink growth categories. We will continue to pay dividends. In 2012, we increased our quarterly dividend 8.5% and we have returned $4.3 billion in dividends to shareholders in 2011. And further, we expect our Board of Directors to approve another quarterly dividend this week, which by the way, will be paid in December of this year, as it has been every year since 1934. And we'll continue to repurchase shares with excess cash at our current program, which we started in 2006, we've already repurchased 533 million shares at an average price of $31.17. Since our share repurchase program started in 1984, we have repurchased 2.9 billion shares at an average price of $12.55. As a result of our strong cash flow and that of our bottlers, I remain very confident that we can continue to invest and to deliver our long-term growth targets on a sustainable basis to achieve our 2020 Vision and deliver value to our shareowners.

Let me just address a few of the things in your question and then Gary will add some more commentary. First I wanted to just ensure -- stress, that our business momentum continues in the midst of ongoing global economic challenges. Our system is very well aligned and on-track to achieve our 2020 Vision and the appetite for investment by our bottling partners is strong as it is ever been and consumers' love for our brands is better, stronger than ever. And as such, we do remain confident in our ability to meet our long-term targets while also delivering sustainable profitable growth and value for our shareowners. With respect and so -- with worth it. With respect to your question on the fourth quarter, let me, as Gary said, we that this on what we know today, we feel very confident that we can dock our ship for 2012 in line with our long-term growth targets for both the top line and bottom, in terms of operating profit. And so as Gary mentioned, that will imply having a double-digit growth in our operating income for the fourth quarter, we feel confident that, that can be achieved based on what we know and based on current train and that is a host of reasons, cycling of marketing expenses, as you daw total marketing for the company was up quite significantly in the fourth quarter. We had to spend related to one-time spend related to the Olympics, to the UEFA Cup and spending on our brands in a healthy way. And I think is important to note that you can find many companies today around the world, around -- in the United States, around the world, that can generate their profit line from no growth in top line that is not sustainable. We feel very confident that were doing the right thing for our business, right thing for our brand and we will dock our ship in 2012 yet again, in line with our long term growth target, despite having facing significant commodity headwinds in both 2011 and cycling also on top of the headwinds in 2012, investing our brands, growing our top line and also earning our price/mix. So I'd like to just emphasize that and pass it over to Gary."

As you mentioned, the 2 extra days helped significantly both particularly in the finished products business. So both in North America and in BIG and we saw the opposite impact of the 1 less day in the first quarter. So the 2 extra days helps significantly. There are quite a bit of cycling things and you see a lot of that cycling in the third quarter, which made the third quarter so complex and that's why we try to give a lot of guidance at the end of the second quarter because of the third. But a lot of that is what we've been saying all year, particularly about the North America business, how we would expect to see sequential improvement in the North American business. If you remember, it just went from minus 9 to even, now a plus 3 and continue to see improvement in North America. The easing of commodities is obviously is helping some, although a lot of that commodity now has come through the easing, has come through into the standard costs. But that's helping. And currency will help as well. The headwinds of currency from the minus 7 in the third quarter to lower in the fourth quarter, not just on the translation of the results but the transactional impact, particularly inside of BIG where that currency owned the cost of their commodities or in their cost of goods, we do not pullout our currency neutral calculation. So the impact of currency does hurt BIG results and so that will improve as well in the fourth quarter. So I think everything we're seeing, the brands are healthy, we've taken price -- pricing across the world, we've seen much better elasticities than what we've ever had historically, which give -- has given us a lots of optimism as well."

And I think we continue to build our occasion-based price pack channel strategy that provides increased consumer choice, along with preferred packages, preferred price points, which is very important in this economic environment. We see also some more positive trends in the channel mix compared to last quarter. I think the overall convenience retail channel in the third quarter was stronger. Industry grew almost certainly above 4%, almost 5%. And we have not only taken significant pricing, 3% price/mix again in the quarter and maintained it for the full year. But also we are focused and very much on transactions getting pricing, maintaining share and growing transactions in the United States. That's the model, that's working. And specifically, we've got a great package in the 12.5 ounce, which is retailing for under $1 in that channel, for example. And then also, we continue to expand in our food service channel with our innovative freestyle. We will pass, for the first time, this year the 10,000 mark in terms of dispensers deployed in this coming quarter, in the quarter that we are in, the fourth quarter. The average incidence lift there is more than 6%, the volume lift is significant, as well as revenue lift for the customer. So that's another very important point of reference in our business in the United States. And again our growth is led by strong performance with Coke Zero, up almost double-digits in this past quarter, coming back very strongly, strong performance across multiple categories, such as POWERADE continuing, Gold Peak growing strong double-digits, Fuze growing, smartwater, glacéau, Minute Maid all growing in a very significant manner. So we feel confident that our North America strategies are working. We are focused on execution. We can always improve and strive for more, we always do, and we're optimistic about our outlook, despite the challenging competitive and macroeconomic backdrop. But important channels, we see better light coming through in some of the really important critical channels in the third quarter. I hope that's helpful."

So you've got some volume in Eurasia this quarter, for example, so if you look at the table in the release, if I remember correctly, it would show that Eurasia, Africa's volume, volumes up 11% and comparable currency neutral operating income is up 11% as well. So you're not seeing a lot of leverage in that. If you -- but remember, there is no income in there related to Aujan. It's sitting down in equity income, but the volume is in that 11%. So if you adjust for that, Eurasia, Africa actually has some really nice operating leverage within their P&L. And so on operating margins, they're actually sitting in a really nice place for the quarter and year-to-date. So and then on Latin America, I don't think anything really unusual at all. I think they just continued to hum along as they have for the last number of years and there's nothing other than we continue to invest in Latin America because it's such a great, great strong market."

But I'd say it's primarily, actually, the economic condition of Europe. And we've been seeing this flow-through for some time now. So I think it's the new normal and do we start seeing some more favorable results. But what you're seeing is go to Madrid and look at the cafes and there aren't a lot of people sitting around drinking Cokes or coffee or whatever. It's a shift in consumer spending in Europe from a medium consumption, much more to future consumption. So while we grew our volume across the region or across each of the business units, there is a shift and it's all about the macroeconomic environment that we're dealing with. So we feel very confident because people continue to love the brands, they continue to buy the brands, they are just buying them in more of a take home, because they're not going out. So it's the macros that are impacting that. And additionally, if you look at the growth rates, there's negative geographic price/mix in Europe as well, just look at the growth rates. Europe and Central and Southern Europe grew faster than Spain and Northwest Europe. So that's some of it as well. And we are cycling through the tax increase in France. So it's all of those kinds of things together. Don't expect to see it get worse. I think we're kind of at the bottom now and should be okay. Relative to price/mix in the Pacific, I think your initial reaction will probably be oh my God, it's a minus 6 and your initial reaction is probably that this is all China. Well, it's not actually. A lot of it is actually because if you look at cases and gallons, well as I said in the prepared remarks, that gallons are slightly about 0.5 point ahead of cases in the quarter. In Japan, where Japan's volume was up 2, gallons was actually down 2. And it's normal and it will be fine at the end of the year. But that's 4-point swing in Japan, which high profit per gallon market causes significant price/mix, negative price/mix, and that's a large part of what we're seeing in the Pacific. It's not a big deal. I think Japan was, I think, pretty much in line year-to-date and will be full year."

We have still said before in previous quarters that we're focused on transactions and that's the health of the business in China. And certainly, we are driving transactions in a very favorable way. Year-to-date volume is a solid 6% and our brands are very strong. We have a clear leadership position in the sparkling category and I have total confidence in both our bottling partners, COFCO and Swire beverages and Bottling Investments Group were to continue to deliver. You have noted from previous calls that on a total comparative basis, relative basis, China's contribution to profit is less than its contribution to volume in the Pacific Group for a number of reasons. One is because we've got much more developed countries that have much bigger margins for like, japan but like also Australasia. And therefore, the impact -- even if you were to promote in China and not that, again, we feel rational environment, but even if you were to promote, it would not have significant impact on the results of the Pacific Group simply because of the size and scale of the profit pools that are generated out of markets like Japan and out of markets like Australasia. And again, given the size of our Japan profit pool in the Pacific Group, what Gary mentioned is the primary cause of that, which is an increase in volume, 2%, but a commensurate decrease at the same percent point in actually concentrate shipments."

We feel, and certainly, it is also important to note that we aggressively led the industry on competition and pricing in the channel. And also the industry grew at around just on the shy of 5%, roughly, in the channel. And we led the pricing and we have, again, very healthy growth in transactions and we held share in the channel and of course, in total market and in terms of packaging, our variety of packages starting with the entry pack at 12.5 ounce is really working well for us at the entry price of under $1 and then that puts our 16 ounce significantly ahead of competition and pricing at $1.19 and so on and so forth. So I would say we are very confident and very pleased with the progress that we have in that the channel as we have in the Foodservice channel where we see increased traffic coming through, particularly in the latter part of the quarter. And then in energy, you asked, we had double-digit volume growth. Our brands were up and gained volume and value share in the energy channel, which is primarily the c -- convenient store channel. But also I'd say that's our variety of the packages, including the mini cans in the half ounce mini cans and all the way through the 0.25 liter, combined with the 2-liter, et cetera are working really well for us in the consumption channel as well."

26642,216022433,365349,"The Coca-Cola Company, Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Oct 16, 2012",2012-10-16,"Earnings Calls","The Coca-Cola Company","Executives","Thank you, Jackson, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin by saying that we are pleased with our third quarter and year-to-date performance. We continue to deliver consistent quality results, with our business growing worldwide volume by 4% in the quar",3500,"Thank you, Jackson, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin by saying that we are pleased with our third quarter and year-to-date performance. We continue to deliver consistent quality results, with our business growing worldwide volume by 4% in the quarter and 5% year-to-date. Importantly, we realized positive growth across all 5 of our geographic operating groups this quarter despite facing a still uncertain global economy. Together with our global system, we are operating from a position of real strength. 
This past quarter, we built on this advantage by, once again, leading industry growth and extending our volume and value share gains globally in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages. We gained global share in the sparkling beverage category, where our portfolio is up 3% in both the quarter and on a year-to-date basis. 
To put this in perspective, our global sparkling business has generated nearly $450 million incremental cases year-to-date or the equivalent of adding another Russia to our global business. And this growth has been consistently and reliably led by brand Coca-Cola, which has grown every quarter over the past 3.5 years and is up a healthy 3% year-to-date. We also gained global share in the still beverage category, where our portfolio grew a solid 10% in the quarter and 9% year-to-date. This quarter's still beverage results were well balanced, with high single-digit growth in juice and juice drinks and sports drinks, as well as double-digit growth in the water, energy and ready-to-drink tea categories. We are committed to striking a sound balance between the growth of our sparkling and still beverages. We see this balance is the key to growing our total business while sustainably enhancing our margins and profits, in line with our 2020 Vision. 
We're also committed to providing consumers more choice in brands, beverage types and calories or no calories, all of which contributes new growth to our business. The balance results that we have achieved across our portfolio demonstrate that we are delivering on this commitment. 
As we've shared during our prior earnings call this year, we recognize that consumers across the globe are still feeling the effects of the prolonged uncertainty in Europe, the ongoing cooling of the economy in China and a mild recovery in the United States. We believe these global macroeconomic pressures will extend through 2012 and likely into 2013. Despite this, we are heartened by our ability to consistently deliver quality results, as well as by our global systems commitment to invest in the business for the long-term growth. 
We're also encouraged by how we have successfully and systematically adapted our business model these past few years to readily address the changing demands of the global marketplace. First, we better positioned our company to capture North America's long-term growth opportunity by acquiring CCE's North America business. Our North America business has delivered volume growth every quarter since we executed this important transaction. Second, we broadened the relevance of our Bottling Investments Group, evolving it further from its initial role of fixing challenging markets to a more significant role of spiriting our growth in select strategic markets, such as India and China. 
Constant renewal is in our DNA. Now with solid fundamentals and real momentum in our business, we are ready to take the next step towards our 2020 Vision. As announced last quarter, effective January 1, 2013, we're organizing our company around 3 major operating businesses: Coca-Cola International, consisting of our Europe, Pacific and Eurasia & Africa operations; Coca-Cola Americas, consisting of our North America and Latin America operations; and Bottling Investments Group, which will continue to oversee our company-owned bottling operations outside of North America. By consolidating leadership of our global operations under 2 large and similar-sized geographic regions, as well as in our Bottling Investments Group, we will streamline reporting lines and intensify our focus on key markets. This new LEED-evolved [ph] structure will also enable us to better leverage synergies and more flexibly adjust our business strategies within those geographies in the future. All of this will further strengthen our efforts to achieve long-term sustainable growth as we advance our momentum towards our 2020 Vision. 
Now let's review our performance across our global markets in more detail, beginning with our flagship market, North America. This past quarter, our business in North America delivered its 10th consecutive quarter of growth, up 2% for the quarter and year-to-date. We also captured volume and value share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages while sustaining a positive 3% price mix for our total North America beverage business. Our growth in North America was once again driven by our still beverage portfolio, which was up 7% this quarter. This is the 10th consecutive quarter that our North America still beverage portfolio has either maintained or gained both volume and value share. In sports drinks, POWERADE grew volume 9% this quarter while also leading the North America sports drink category in absolute unit case volume growth for the fourth consecutive quarter. 
Our juice and juice drinks portfolio in North America outpaced the category, up 6% for the quarter while gaining both volume and value share. Our positive result in this category was broad-based, driven by strong growth in our juice drinks business, volume and value share growth across our Minute Maid Light portfolio, and further value share gains in the 100% chilled orange juice segment. 
Our glacéau brands were up mid-single digits in North America once again this quarter, gaining both volume and value share, and led by the 18th straight quarter of double-digit growth for our premium smartwater brand. The rest of our North America water business grew 4% in the quarter, led by DASANI, which maintained its premium price position, and saw further gains across key brand equity measures, driven by consumer awareness of our innovative PlantBottle packaging. 
And our key portfolio in North America sustained its momentum, up double-digits while gaining both volume and value share. This result was led by Gold Peak, which has now grown strong double digits for 22 consecutive quarters. Our sparkling beverages in North America were even in the third quarter, a sequential improvement over our second quarter results and ahead of the broader sparkling beverage industry. Importantly, our sparkling beverage portfolio earned a positive 3% price mix in both the quarter and year-to-date in what continues to be a rational pricing environment. Coca-Cola Zero growth accelerated, up 9% this quarter. We also sustained our momentum behind Fanta, which was up mid-single digits for the third consecutive quarter. 
We are encouraged by our consistent progress in North America, and we remain positive about the long-term outlook for this very important market. 
We are also leading the effort across communities in the United States to tackle obesity. Last week, we joined fellow members of the beverage industry to announce the first-of-its-kind partnership with the cities of Chicago and San Antonio, encouraging the citizens of these cities to be more health aware and physically active. We introduced a city-to-city wellness challenge, as well as our new Calories Count Vending Program that will provide consumers with the choices and information they need to choose beverages that are right for themselves and for their families. When it comes to noncommunicable diseases such as obesity, we know that there are no simple answers. But we also know that a lack of physical activity is a primary contributor to obesity. We also know that there is a lack of understanding of how many calories people consume in a day. As such, our company is committed to partnering with customers and cities to promote active, healthy, balanced lifestyles, as well as making calorie information more transparent.
Now let me turn to our Pacific Group, which grew 3% in the third quarter and 6% year-to-date. Our business in Japan was up 2% this quarter, bringing our year-to-date volume growth in Japan to 3%. Japan has now delivered volume growth in 8 of the last 9 quarters. Our business in Japan continues to gain share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages this quarter and also grew both volume and value share in still beverages. This positive result was driven by the sustained momentum of our Georgia coffee brand and water and sports drink category offerings, which led to consistent volume growth across channels, including drugstores, convenience retail outlet, as well as supermarkets. Looking ahead and consistent with what we said during our last earnings call, we expect our fourth quarter volume results in Japan to moderate somewhat below our year-to-date trend as we cycle strong growth from prior year. Having said that, our business in Japan is on track to deliver full year low-single-digit growth. 
Moving now to China. Our business delivered 2% volume growth this quarter, cycling last year's double-digit growth. On a year-to-date basis, our volume in China has grown 6%, cycling strong 15% growth from last year. And once again, this quarter, we captured both volume and value share in sparkling beverages. Importantly and in alignment with our strategic priorities in China, we are growing transactions ahead of volume, with total transactions up 10% year-to-date. One package that is helping us deliver against that strategy is our 300 ml, milliliter, package. On a year-to-date basis, this new package has generated over 0.5 billion incremental transactions in China. We will keep driving our 300 ml package to provide consumers with a great offering at the right price point while also building our brands and the sparkling category in a healthy way over the long term. 
As we look ahead to the next 6 months, it is reasonable to expect that China's ongoing economic slowdown may have a short-term effect on our industry and on our business. In our view, the Chinese economy is undergoing a natural and necessary economic transition as the government places greater emphasis on controlling long-term inflation over injecting short-term economic stimulus. While the Chinese economy undergoes this period of transition, we have every confidence in the long-term resilience of our business for 3 key reasons. First, our brands in China are strong. In our latest survey of consumers aged 12 to 49 years old, Coca-Cola was rated as both the most favorite sparkling and nonalcoholic ready-to-drink brand. In this same survey, Minute Maid was rated as the most favorite juice drinks brand. Second, we hold the leadership position in the sparkling category. This is the ninth consecutive quarter in which our sparkling beverages in China either maintained or gained both volume and value share. And third, our system in China is strategically focused, well aligned and committed to invest for sustainable long-term growth. As such, we remain encouraged and excited about our opportunities in this region and continue to believe that China will serve as the long-term growth driver for our business. 
I also want to share our perspective on a few other markets in the Pacific that are exhibiting strong growth, starting with Thailand, which again delivered double-digit growth, up a sound 19% this quarter. Thailand growth was led by brand Coca-Cola, which was up 26% in the quarter and 34% year-to-date. I also want to highlight our result in South Korea, another market which has grown double digits in both the quarter and on a year-to-date basis. As additional context, our business in South Korea has nearly doubled since 2007. This is a testament to our system's ability to implement a robust set of occasion-based price and packaging offerings to consumers and drive growth across these regions. We're excited about the growth opportunities in both Thailand and South Korea, and we'll keep investing for the future in these vibrant markets. 
Moving now to Latin America, our volume grew 5% for both the quarter, as well as year-to-date. As in previous quarters, this growth was led by brand Coca-Cola, up 3% in both the quarter and year-to-date. In Latin America, we once again captured both volume and value share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages. Our 2 largest markets in Latin America, Mexico and Brazil, were both up a solid 6% this past quarter while also growing volume and value share in sparkling, still and also the entire nonalcoholic ready-to-drink category. Importantly, our growth in both these markets was well balanced across all categories. Mexico grew sparkling beverages 3%, and still beverages were up double digits for the quarter. Similarly, Brazil delivered 4% sparkling beverage growth and double-digit still beverage growth for the quarter. Brazil was up 5% on a year-to-date basis. In light of these strong results, we now expect our 2012 growth in Brazil to be in the mid-single digits. 
Let me also share our perspective on a few other markets in Latin America that we see as great opportunities for long-term growth, specifically, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. Together, these markets are 1/3 the size of our current Brazilian business. Our system is very focused on implementing the same winning strategies in these markets that have driven such positive results in Brazil this past decade. We will keep investing in Colombia, investing in Ecuador and Peru and across the entire Latin America region, as we execute our 2020 Vision. As such, it is easy to see why we are excited about the long-term growth opportunity represented by these 3 dynamic Latin American markets. 
Our Eurasia & Africa business extended its strong momentum, growing a solid 11% in both the quarter and year-to-date, including 11% year-to-date growth for brand Coca-Cola. During the quarter, our business in Eurasia & Africa grew both volume and value share in total 
nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages. On a country level, India once again led this group's performance, delivering balanced and consistent quality growth. Our business in India was up 15% for the quarter, with double-digit growth and volume and value share gains realized across both sparkling and still beverages. Sparkling beverage growth in India was led by brand Coca-Cola, up over 30% for the second consecutive quarter, as we sustained our focus on immediate consumption offerings. And still beverages in India were led by our juice drink brands, with Maaza up over 20% again in the quarter. Russia was up 7% in both the quarter and year-to-date, with the strong result driven by the further acceleration of brand Coca-Cola, which grew 18% in the quarter and 20% year-to-date. Like last quarter, we observed similarly strong results across our broader sparkling portfolio in Russia, with Fanta up 15% and Sprite up 7%. And our Dobriy juice brand built on its recent success, delivering 16% growth in the quarter and raising this brand's year-to-date performance up to 12%. 
Our strong performance across the Eurasia & Africa Group was supported by our partnership with Aujan. We're excited about the further growth opportunities represented by our partnership with Aujan, which holds the #1 position in the still beverage business across the entire Middle East. And our collaborations in Eurasia & Africa extend beyond business relationships, as exemplified by our partnership with The Global Fund to bring critical medicines to rural Africa. At last month's Clinton Global Initiative, we announced our plans to expand the reach of project Last Mile, which was established in 2010 to help Tanzania's government-run medicine distribution network build a more efficient supply chain by leveraging our expansive distribution system and core business expertise. Nearly 20 million Africans have benefited from this partnership since 2010. The newest face of this partnership will increase the availability of medicines to 75% of Tanzania and expand the project's reach to Ghana and Mozambique. The success of this project demonstrates our belief in the power of civil society, government and the private sector, or what we call the Golden Triangle, working closely together to solve real global issues and problems. 
Moving now to Europe. We saw our business return to growth, up a solid 1% for the quarter. These results were achieved despite the continuation of unseasonably poor weather in the first half of the quarter, as well as the impact of ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty. Even with these external headwinds, all 4 of our European business units saw positive growth this quarter, demonstrating our ability to execute with excellence across this entire region. 
Germany once again led the region, up 3% for the quarter and 2% year-to-date. This marks Germany's seventh consecutive quarter of positive growth. And while our business in Germany is winning today, we are connecting with consumers to ensure continued success for tomorrow. An example of this was our award-winning Coca-Cola summer campaign in Germany, which was named the best 2012 out-of-home campaign by Germany's leading marketing industry weekly. Understanding that music is a passion point for teenagers, our campaign in Germany leveraged our global partnership with Spotify, a leading music streaming platform, to offer teenagers access to millions of songs and exclusive Coca-Cola content. This campaign generated more than 1.5 billion contacts and reached more than 90% of all teenagers in Germany as they created their own Coca-Cola playlists and shared them with their friends via Facebook. 
We are successfully applying the same consumer engagement principles across regions, as exemplified by our highly successful global activation of the 2012 London Summer Olympic Games. Our internal indicators showed that the marketing programs we executed across almost 100 markets drove global improvements in recruitment, frequency and brand equity with our consumers. Our television commercials were acknowledged by Ace Metrix as consistently being among the highest-rated ads during the Olympics. Our efforts across the digital and mobile space were also recognized. We received a Digital Gold Award by Unmetric, a brand tracker [ph], who analyzed the social media performance of every major sponsor. And we were honored with a Global Marketer of the Year award by the Mobile Marketing Association while also taking home a Best in Show nod at their awards ceremony for our Olympic Games Move to the Beat campaign. 
Our social media programs' success goes well beyond our Olympics activation. Over just the last 9 months, Coca-Cola's Facebook page has grown by over 40%. This past quarter, Coca-Cola became the first brand to achieve over 50 million likes. And as of today, this number has increased further, surpassing 52 million. This rise parallels the growth of our social engagements footprint across all major social networks that generate conversation and content with our consumers. The recent study by PQ Media found that Coca-Cola was the #1 brand in social media impressions by nearly a 2:1 margin over the next most-mentioned brand. 
Another area of emphasis for our system is to support sustainable communities by replenishing 100% of the water used in our finished beverages by 2020. To advance this goal, we recently announced the global clean water partnership with DEKA Research & Development to bring clean water to communities where potable water access is limited. This partnership will leverage innovative technology to deliver clean drinking water to schools, health clinics and community centers in rural regions of Africa, Asia and Latin America. When fully scaled, this partnership is expected to add more than 0.5 billion liters of clean drinking water per year to the global water supply.
While water is the lifeblood of our business, we're committed to doing our part to replenish the water we use and give back to communities we proudly serve. By partnering with DEKA, we hope to empower local entrepreneurs with the specific focus on women by delivering, as well as maintaining, a clean water solution for communities and improving the daily lives of thousands of people around the world. 
Finally, we were humbled and honored earlier this month when brand Coca-Cola topped the list of Interbrand's Best Global Brands rankings. Interbrand has rated Coca-Cola as the #1 brand on this list every year since 2000. This is a testament to our ongoing commitment to invest in our brands, innovate our marketing and engage with our consumers in a sustainable manner that builds long-term value. 
Certainly, the world has been very volatile from a macroeconomic perspective over the last 4 years. As a global company and also on behalf of all our associates, I'm pleased to say that we continue to crack the calculus for growth in this challenging and volatile environment. We've done this by consistently increasing our investments in our system and our brands to ensure that our global portfolio is more relevant and healthier today than it's ever been during our history. We remain resolutely focused on ensuring that we leverage our unique heritage and fuse it with what is expected by our consumers today in order to earn and sustain our place in their daily lives today and tomorrow. 
I want to thank all of our consumers who incite us into their lives 1.8 billion times each and every day. And I want to thank all of our shareholders for your interest and investment in our company. It's a great responsibility. You can rest assure that our entire leadership team is working diligently to protect and grow the value of your investment in our company, both today and for tomorrow. 
So with that, let me now turn the call over to Gary."

We delivered another quarter of solid performance results, reflecting our global system's ability to consistently execute our strategic plans while managing through a still unpredictable macroeconomic environmen",1395,"Thanks, Muhtar, and good morning, everyone. We delivered another quarter of solid performance results, reflecting our global system's ability to consistently execute our strategic plans while managing through a still unpredictable macroeconomic environment. As you all recall, I provided a commentary about the third quarter during our last earnings call because we knew there were several unique timing and cycling factors to consider when modeling the third quarter. Taking these factors into account, I'm pleased to say that our third quarter results were consistent with the commentary we provided in our last earnings call. And as such, we remain confident in our ability to deliver full year volume, revenue and operating income results in line with our long-term growth targets. 
So let me start our review with our third quarter results with our comparable earnings per share, which came in at $0.51 this quarter and at $1.56 on a year-to-date basis, up 2% year-to-date despite facing considerable currency headwinds throughout the year. Our comparable currency-neutral operating income was up 1% this quarter, in line with our expectations. And on a comparable basis, the impact of currency on this quarter's operating income results was a 7% headwind. 
On a year-to-date basis, our comparable currency-neutral operating income is up 4%, also in line with our expectations. As per my previous comment, we expect to deliver full year operating income results in line with our long-term growth targets, and we understand that this implies we will achieve double-digit comparable currency-neutral operating income growth in the fourth quarter. 
Comparable currency-neutral net revenues grew 6% in the quarter. The currency impact on this quarter's comparable net revenue results was a 5% headwind. On a year-to-date basis, comparable currency-neutral net revenue growth is also at 6%. As we discuss profit and revenue growth rates, let me take a moment to remind everyone that the profits and revenues generated by some of our more recent strategic partnerships, including Aujan and Innocent, among others, are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. So while unit cases related to these businesses are fully reflected in our volume growth, their associated concentrate sales -- or concentrate gallons-associated profits and revenues are not currently contributing to our operating income and revenue growth rates. Instead, these profits are consolidated into our equity income results. While this did not materially impact our third quarter results, I think it's important because there is an impact on growth rates. 
Returning now to a review of our third quarter results, our concentrate sales came in slightly ahead of unit case volume by approximately 0.5%. As a reminder, growth rates or concentrate sales and unit cases can vary from quarter-to-quarter. Having said that, concentrate sales are in line with unit cases year-to-date, and we expect our full year concentrate sales growth to be in line with unit case volume growth.
As for our consolidated price mix, this came in slightly positive in the quarter, rounding to even, consistent with outlook we provided in our last quarter call. On a year-to-date basis, our consolidated price mix is up 2%. We continue to expect our full year 2012 consolidated price mix results to come in between 1% and 2%, in line with our long-term target range. 
Our third quarter comparable gross margins were in line with our second quarter comparable gross margins. This was a slight improvement over the estimate we provided during our last earnings call, as we successfully offset some of the currency and mid-shift headwinds base of our business. For the full year, we still expect our comparable gross margins to come in below our second and third quarter comparable gross margins. 
On comparable currency-neutral SG&A expenses, they were up 8% in the quarter and 6% year-to-date. These results include a mid-single-digit increase in our third quarter direct marketing expenses, as we continue to invest in the health and strength of our brands. Our third quarter SG&A also reflects an increase due to the timing of certain operating expenses, as well as the cost of adding incremental feet on the street, primarily in North America, in support of our growing business. And one point of both our quarter and year-to-date SG&A rate is related to the impact of structural items, primarily in our Bottling Investments Group and North American business. As we look to the rest of the year, we expect our full year SG&A to come in close to our current year-to-date rate. Our operating expense leverage was minus 4 points this quarter, right in line with the minus 3- to a minus 5-point range that we estimated during our last earnings call. 
As we've stated in our last call, we expect this trend to reverse in the fourth quarter, as we benefit from having 2 additional selling days. This should enable us to achieve slightly positive operating expense leverage on a full year basis. Our net interest came in at a positive $16 million in the third quarter, which is ahead of our initial expectations. This raised our year-to-date net interest income to $43 million. Looking ahead, we still expect our net interest to come in as an expense in the first quarter, primarily due to expected lower rates in some of our international locations, as well as ongoing currency headwinds. As a result, we're updating our full year net interest income outlook to a $30 million to $40 million range. 
Our underlying effective tax rate held steady at 24%, and we expect to carry this 24% tax rate into next year. And our cash flow from operations increased a very healthy and very strong 15% year-to-date. Our year-to-date share repurchases, net of employee stock option exercises, totaled $2.3 billion, placing us well on track to achieve the $2.5 billion to $3 billion range for full year 2012 that we communicated at the outset of this year.
With regard to commodities, in our last call, we reduced the estimated full year incremental impact of our Big 4 commodity cost on our results to $300 million. Based on our latest forecast and hedge positions, we now expect our full year incremental cost of commodities will come in at approximately $225 million. 
As for currencies, we previously provided an outlook that we would have an 8% to 9% headwind on an operating income in the third quarter. Today I can confirm that currency came in slightly better than our initial outlook, resulting in a 7% headwind on third quarter comparable operating income. 
Based on our hedge positions, current spot rates and the cycling of our prior year rates, we continue to expect currencies to be a mid single-digit headwind on our operating income, in both the fourth quarter and on a full year basis.
In closing, and as Muhtar said earlier, we are strategically and successfully advancing our global momentum, while navigating through a challenging global economy. Our system is focused on maximizing economic profit and long-term cash flow, which allows us to continue to reinvest in the business and anticipate changes in the marketplace and competitive dynamics. 
While we have made several important and strategic investments this year, our financial priorities remain the same, we'll reinvest in the core business. We still expect to spend around $3 billion in capital expenditures in 2012. We will strategically invest in acquisitions and partnerships, the strength in our bottling system and to increase our position in key nonalcoholic ready-to-drink growth categories. 
We will continue to pay dividends. In 2012, we increased our quarterly dividend 8.5%, and we have returned $4.3 billion in dividends to shareholders in 2011. And further, we expect our Board of Directors to approve another quarterly dividend this week, which by the way, will be paid in December of this year, as it has been every year since 1934. And we'll continue to repurchase shares with excess cash in our current program, which we started in 2006. We've already repurchased 533 million shares at an average price of $31.17.  Since our share repurchase program started in 1984, we have repurchased 2.9 billion shares, at an average price of $12.55. 
As a result of our strong cash flow and that of our bottlers, I remain very confident that we can continue to invest and deliver our long-term growth targets on a sustainable basis to achieve our 2020 Vision and deliver value to our shareowners.

Let me just address a few of the things in your question, and then Gary will add some more commentary. First, I want to just ensure and stress that our business momentum continues in the midst of ongoing global economic challenges. Our system is very well aligned and on track to achieve our 2020 Vision. And the appetite for investment by our bottling partners is strong as it has ever been. And consumers' love for our brands is stronger than ever. And as such, we do remain confident in our ability to meet our long-term targets, while also delivering sustainable profitable growth and value for our shareowners. With respect -- and so at the outset, with respect to your question on the fourth quarter, let me -- as Gary said, we -- based on what we know today, we feel very confident that we can dock our ship for 2012, in line with our long-term growth targets for both top line and bottom in terms of operating profit. And so as Gary mentioned, that will imply having a double-digit growth in our operating income for the fourth quarter. We feel confident that, that can be achieved based on what we know and based on current trends. And there is a host of reasons. Cycling of marketing expenses, as you saw total marketing for the company was up quite significantly in the fourth quarter. We had spend related to -- a onetime spend related to the Olympics, to the UEFA Cup, spending on our brands in a healthy way. And I think it is important to note that you can find many companies today around the world, around -- in the United States, around the world that can generate their profit line from no growth in the top line that is not sustainable. We feel very confident that we're doing the right thing for our business, right thing for our brand and we will dock our ship in 2012, yet again, in line with our long-term growth target, despite having -- facing significant commodity headwinds in both 2011 and cycling also on top of the headwinds in 2012, investing in our brands, growing our top line and also earning our price/mix. So I'd like to just emphasize that, and pass it over to Gary."

As you mentioned, the 2 extra days helped significantly, both particularly in the finished products business. So both in North America and in BIG, and we saw the opposite impact of the 1 less day in the first quarter. So the 2 extra days help significantly. There are quite a bit of cycling things. And you see a lot of that cycling in the third quarter, which made the third quarter so complex, and that's why we try to give a lot of extra guidance at the end of the second quarter because of the third. But a lot of that is what we've been saying all year, particularly about the North America business, how we would expect to see sequential improvement in the North America business. If you remember, it just went from minus 9 to even, now to plus 3, and we will continue to see improvement in North America. The easing of commodities is obviously is helping some, although a lot of that commodity now has come through the easing, has come through into the standard costs, but that's helping. And currency will help as well. And the headwinds of currency from the minus 7 in the third quarter to lower in the fourth quarter, not just on the translation of the results but the transactional impact, particularly inside of BIG where that currency owned the cost of their commodities or in their cost of goods, we do not pull out our currency-neutral calculation. So the impact of currency does hurt BIG results, and so that will improve as well in the fourth quarter. So I think everything we're seeing -- the brands are healthy. We've taken pricing across the world, we've seen much better elasticities than what we've ever had historically, which give -- has given us a lot of optimism as well."

And this is, again, 10th quarter in a row of volume growth in our North America business. And I think we continue to build our occasion-based price, pack, channel strategy that provides increased consumer choice, along with preferred packages, preferred price points, which is very important in this economic environment. We see also some -- more positive trends in the channel mix compared to last quarter. I think the overall convenience retail channel in the third quarter was stronger. Industry grew almost -- certainly above 4%, almost 5%. And we have not only taken significant pricing, 3% price/mix, up again in the quarter and maintained it for the full year. But also we are focused very much on transactions getting pricing, maintaining share and growing transactions in the United States. That's the model. That's working. And specifically, we've got a great package in the 12.5 ounce, which is retailing for under $1 in that channel, for example. And then also, we continue to expand in our food service channel with our innovative Freestyle. We will pass, for the first time this year the 10,000th mark in terms of dispensers deployed in this coming quarter, in the quarter that we're in, the fourth quarter. The average incidence lift there is more than 6%, the volume lift is significant, as well as revenue lift for the customer. So that's another very important point of reference in our business in the United States. And again our growth is led by strong performance with Coke Zero, up almost double digit in this past quarter, coming back very strongly, strong performance across multiple categories, such as POWERADE continuing, Gold Peak growing strong double digit, Fuze growing, smartwater, glacéau, Minute Maid, all growing in a very significant manner. So we feel confident that our North America strategies are working. We are focused on execution. We can always improve and strive for more, we always do. And we're optimistic about our outlook, despite the challenging, competitive and macroeconomic backdrop. But important channels, we see a better light coming through in some of the really important -- critical channels in the third quarter. I hope that's helpful."

So you're not seeing a lot of leverage in that. If you -- but remember, there is no income in there related to Aujan. It's sitting down in equity income, but the volume is in that 11%. So if you adjust for that, Eurasia, Africa actually has some really nice operating leverage within their P&L.

But I'd say it's primarily actually the economic condition of Europe. And we've been seeing this flow-through for some time now. So I think it's kind of the new normal until we start seeing some more favorable results. But what you're seeing is go to Madrid and what you -- and look at the cafes, and there aren't a lot of people sitting around drinking cokes or coffee or whatever. It's a shift in consumer spending in Europe from immediate consumption much more to future consumption. So while we grew our volume across the region or across each of the business units, there is a shift, and it's all about the macroeconomic environment that we're dealing with. So we feel very confident because people continue to love the brands. They continue to buy the brands. They are just buying them in more of a take home because they're not going out. So it's the macros that are impacting that. And additionally, if you look at the growth rates, there's negative geographic price/mix in Europe as well, just look at the growth rates. Europe and Central and Southern Europe grew faster than Spain and Northwest Europe. So that's some of it as well. And we're cycling through the tax increase in France. So it's all of those kinds of things together. I don't expect to see it get worse. I think we're kind of at the bottom now and should be okay. Relative to price/mix in the Pacific, I think your initial reaction will probably be, ""Oh my God, it's minus 6."" And your initial reaction is probably that it's all China. Well, it's not actually. A lot of it is actually because if you look at cases and gallons, well as I said in the prepared remarks, that gallons are slightly about 0.5 point ahead of cases in the quarter. In Japan, where Japan volume was up 2, gallons were actually down 2. And it's normal and it will be fine at the end of the year. But that's 4-point swing in Japan, which as a very high profit per gallon market causes significant price/mix, negative price/mix, and that's a large part of what we're seeing in the Pacific. It's not a big deal. I think Japan was, I think, pretty much in line year-to-date and will be in full year."

Spain has one of the highest prices in Europe. So that has had the biggest contributing factor. One of the reasons for that was very unseasonable weather in Northern Europe during half of the quarter. It's never been -- weather, that in history -- then this -- then the beginning of the quarter for 2.5 for 2 months, 1.5 months, half of the quarter in Northern Europe. So that is coming back, and we feel that, that is one of the primary reasons. As we have more balanced growth in Europe, which we expect will happen, and as Gary said, we feel that it's not going to get any worse than it is and it may even -- and even in these conditions, we can generate growth and crack the calculus for growth, then we feel that, that will certainly be coming back quite significantly. Spain remains today, on a net revenue per unit case basis, the highest in Europe. So I just want to make sure that those -- that commentary get through."

And our transactions are up a healthy 7% in the past quarter. We have said it before in previous quarters that we're focused on transactions and that's the health of the business in China. And certainly, we're driving transactions in a very favorable way. Year-to-date, volume is a solid 6% and our brands are very strong. We have a clear leadership position in the sparkling category, and I have total confidence in both our bottling partners, COFCO and Swire beverages and Bottling Investments Group were to continue to deliver. You have noted from previous calls that on a total comparative basis, relative basis, China's contribution to profit is less than its contribution to volume in the Pacific Group for a number of reasons. One is because we've got much more developed countries that have much bigger margins for like, of course, Japan, but like also Australasia. And therefore, it is -- the impact -- even if we were to promote in China and note that, again, we feel it's a rational environment. But even if we were to promote, it would not have significant impact on the results of the Pacific Group, simply because of the size and scale of the profit pools that are generated out of markets like Japan and out of markets like Australasia. And again, given the size of our Japan profit pool in the Pacific Group, what Gary mentioned is the primary cause of that, which is an increase in volume, 2%, but a commensurate decrease at the same percent point in actually concentrate shipments."

And certainly, it is also important to note that we aggressively led the industry on competition and pricing in the channel. And also that the industry grew at around just on the shy of 5% roughly in the channel. And we led the pricing. And we have, again, very healthy growth in transactions. And we held share in the channel and of course in total market. And in terms of packaging, our variety of packages starting with the entry pack of 12.5 ounce is really working well for us at the entry price of under $1. And then that puts us -- our 16 ounce significantly ahead of competition and pricing at $1.19 and so on and so forth. So I would say we are very confident and very pleased with the progress that we have in that channel as we have in the Foodservice channel where we see increased traffic coming through, particularly in the latter part of the quarter. And then in energy, you asked, we had double-digit volume growth. Our brands were up and gained volume and value share in the energy channel, which is primarily the c-store, the convenient store channel. But also I'd say that our variety of packages, including the mini cans, 8.5 ounce mini cans and all the way through the 1.25 liter combined with the 2-liter, et cetera, are working really well for us in the future consumption channel as well."

26642,216022433,365402,"The Coca-Cola Company, Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Oct 16, 2012",2012-10-16,"Earnings Calls","The Coca-Cola Company","Executives","Thank you, Jackson, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin by saying that we're pleased with our third quarter and year-to-date performance. We continue to deliver consistent quality results, with our business growing worldwide volume by 4% in the quart",3497,"Thank you, Jackson, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin by saying that we're pleased with our third quarter and year-to-date performance. We continue to deliver consistent quality results, with our business growing worldwide volume by 4% in the quarter and 5% year-to-date. Importantly, we realized positive growth across all 5 of our geographic operating groups this quarter despite facing a still uncertain global economy. Together with our global system, we are operating from a position of real strength. 
This past quarter, we built on this advantage by once again leading industry growth and extending our volume and value share gains globally in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages. We gained global share in the sparkling beverage category, where our portfolio is up 3% in both the quarter and on a year-to-date basis. 
To put this in perspective, our global sparkling business has generated nearly 450 million incremental cases year-to-date or the equivalent of adding another Russia to our global business. And this growth has been consistently and reliably led by brand Coca-Cola, which has grown every quarter over the past 3.5 years and is up a healthy 3% year-to-date. We also gained global share in the still beverage category, where our portfolio grew a solid 10% in the quarter and 9% year-to-date. This quarter's still beverage results were well balanced, with high single-digit growth in juice and juice drinks and sports drinks, as well as double-digit growth in the water, energy and ready-to-drink tea categories. We are committed to striking a sound balance between the growth of our sparkling and still beverages. We see this balance as the key to growing our total business while sustainably enhancing our margins and profits, in line with our 2020 Vision. 
We're also committed to providing consumers more choice in brands, beverage types and calories or no calories, all of which contributes new growth to our business. The balance results that we have achieved across our portfolio demonstrate that we are delivering on this commitment. 
As we've shared during our prior earnings calls this year, we recognize that consumers across the globe are still feeling the effects of the prolonged uncertainty in Europe, the ongoing cooling of the economy in China and a mild recovery in the United States. We believe these global macroeconomic pressures will extend through 2012 and likely into 2013. Despite this, we are heartened by our ability to consistently deliver quality results, as well as by our global systems commitment to invest in the business for the long-term growth. 
We're also encouraged by how we have successfully and systematically adapted our business model these past few years to readily address the changing demands of the global marketplace. First, we better positioned our company to capture North America's long-term growth opportunity by acquiring CCE's North America business. Our North America business has delivered volume growth every quarter since we executed this important transaction. Second, we broadened the relevance of our Bottling Investments Group, evolving it further from its initial role of fixing challenging markets to a more significant role of spiriting our growth in select strategic markets, such as India and China. 
Constant renewal is in our DNA. Now with solid fundamentals and real momentum in our business, we are ready to take the next step towards our 2020 Vision. As announced last quarter, effective January 1, 2013, we're organizing our company around 3 major operating businesses: Coca-Cola International, consisting of our Europe, Pacific and Eurasia & Africa operations; Coca-Cola Americas, consisting of our North America and Latin America operations; and Bottling Investments Group, which will continue to oversee our company-owned bottling operations outside of North America. By consolidating leadership of our global operations under 2 large and similar-sized geographic regions, as well as in our Bottling Investments Group, we will streamline reporting lines and intensify our focus on key markets. This newly evolved structure will also enable us to better leverage synergies and more flexibly adjust our business strategies within those geographies in the future. All of this will further strengthen our efforts to achieve long-term sustainable growth as we advance our momentum towards our 2020 Vision. 
Now let's review our performance across our global markets in more detail, beginning with our flagship market, North America. This past quarter, our business in North America delivered its 10th consecutive quarter of growth, up 2% for the quarter and year-to-date. We also captured volume and value share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages while sustaining a positive 3% price mix for our total North America beverage business. Our growth in North America was once again driven by our still beverage portfolio, which was up 7% this quarter. This is the 10th consecutive quarter that our North America still beverage portfolio has either maintained or gained both volume and value share. In sports drinks, POWERADE grew volume 9% this quarter while also leading the North America sports drink category in absolute unit case volume growth for the fourth consecutive quarter. 
Our juice and juice drinks portfolio in North America outpaced the category, up 6% for the quarter while gaining both volume and value share. Our positive result in this category was broad-based, driven by strong growth in our juice drinks business, volume and value share growth across our Minute Maid Light portfolio, and further value share gains in the 100% chilled orange juice segment. 
Our glacéau brands were up mid-single digits in North America once again this quarter, gaining both volume and value share, and led by the 18th straight quarter of double-digit growth for our premium smartwater brand. The rest of our North America water business grew 4% in the quarter, led by DASANI, which maintained its premium price position, and saw further gains across key brand equity measures, driven by consumer awareness of our innovative PlantBottle packaging. 
And our key portfolio in North America sustained its momentum, up double digits while gaining both volume and value share. This result was led by Gold Peak, which has now grown strong double digits for 22 consecutive quarters. Our sparkling beverages in North America were even in the third quarter, a sequential improvement over our second quarter results and ahead of the broader sparkling beverage industry. Importantly, our sparkling beverage portfolio earned a positive 3% price mix in both the quarter and year-to-date in what continues to be a rational pricing environment. Coca-Cola Zero growth accelerated, up 9% this quarter. We also sustained our momentum behind Fanta, which was up mid-single digits for the third consecutive quarter. 
We are encouraged by our consistent progress in North America, and we remain positive about the long-term outlook for this very important market. 
We're also leading the effort across communities in the United States to tackle obesity. Last week, we joined fellow members of the beverage industry to announce the first-of-its-kind partnership with the cities of Chicago and San Antonio, encouraging the citizens of these cities to be more health aware and physically active. We introduced a city-to-city wellness challenge, as well as our new Calories Count Vending Program that will provide consumers with the choices and information they need to choose beverages that are right for themselves and for their families. When it comes to non-communicable diseases such as obesity, we know that there are no simple answers. But we also know that a lack of physical activity is a primary contributor to obesity. We also know that there is a lack of understanding of how many calories people consume in a day. As such, our company is committed to partnering with customers and cities to promote active, healthy, balanced lifestyles, as well as making calorie information more transparent.
Now let me turn to our Pacific Group, which grew 3% in the third quarter and 6% year-to-date. Our business in Japan was up 2% this quarter, bringing our year-to-date volume growth in Japan to 3%. Japan has now delivered volume growth in 8 of the last 9 quarters. Our business in Japan continues to gain share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages this quarter and also grew both volume and value share in still beverages. This positive result was driven by the sustained momentum of our Georgia coffee brand and water and sports drink category offerings, which led to consistent volume growth across channels, including drugstores, convenience retail outlet, as well as supermarkets. Looking ahead and consistent with what we said during our last earnings call, we expect our fourth quarter volume results in Japan to moderate somewhat below our year-to-date trend as we cycle strong growth from prior year. Having said that, our business in Japan is on track to deliver full year low-single-digit growth. 
Moving now to China. Our business delivered 2% volume growth this quarter, cycling last year's double-digit growth. On a year-to-date basis, our volume in China has grown 6%, cycling strong 15% growth from last year. And once again, this quarter, we captured both volume and value share in sparkling beverages. Importantly and in alignment with our strategic priorities in China, we are growing transactions ahead of volume, with total transactions up 10% year-to-date. One package that is helping us deliver against that strategy is our 300 ml, milliliter, package. On a year-to-date basis, this new package has generated over 0.5 billion incremental transactions in China. We will keep driving our 300 ml package to provide consumers with a great offering at the right price point while also building our brands and the sparkling category in a healthy way over the long term. 
As we look ahead to the next 6 months, it is reasonable to expect that China's ongoing economic slowdown may have a short-term effect on our industry and on our business. In our view, the Chinese economy is undergoing a natural and necessary economic transition as the government places greater emphasis on controlling long-term inflation over injecting short-term economic stimulus. While the Chinese economy undergoes this period of transition, we have every confidence in the long-term resilience of our business for 3 key reasons. First, our brands in China are strong. In our latest survey of consumers aged 12 to 49 years old, Coca-Cola was rated as both the most favorite sparkling and nonalcoholic ready-to-drink brand. In this same survey, Minute Maid was rated as the most favorite juice drinks brand. 
Second, we hold the leadership position in the sparkling category. This is the ninth consecutive quarter in which our sparkling beverages in China either maintained or gained both volume and value share. And third, our system in China is strategically focused, well aligned and committed to invest for sustainable long-term growth. As such, we remain encouraged and excited about our opportunities in this region and continue to believe that China will serve as the long-term growth driver for our business. 
I also want to share our perspective on a few other markets in the Pacific that are exhibiting strong growth, starting with Thailand, which again delivered double-digit growth, up a sound 19% this quarter. Thailand growth was led by brand Coca-Cola, which was up 26% in the quarter and 34% year-to-date. I also want to highlight our result in South Korea, another market which has grown double digits in both the quarter and on a year-to-date basis. As additional context, our business in South Korea has nearly doubled since 2007. This is a testament to our system's ability to implement a robust set of occasion-based price and packaging offerings to consumers and drive growth across this region. We're excited about the growth opportunities in both Thailand and South Korea, and we'll keep investing for the future in these vibrant markets. 
Moving now to Latin America, our volume grew 5% for both the quarter, as well as year-to-date. As in previous quarters, this growth was led by brand Coca-Cola, up 3% in both the quarter and year-to-date. In Latin America, we once again captured both volume and value share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages. Our 2 largest markets in Latin America, Mexico and Brazil, were both up a solid 6% this past quarter while also growing volume and value share in sparkling, still and also the entire nonalcoholic ready-to-drink category. Importantly, our growth in both these markets was well balanced across all categories. Mexico grew sparkling beverages 3%, and still beverages were up double digits for the quarter. Similarly, Brazil delivered 4% sparkling beverage growth and double-digit still beverage growth for the quarter. Brazil was up 5% on a year-to-date basis. In light of these strong results, we now expect our 2012 growth in Brazil to be in the mid-single digits. 
Let me also share our perspective on a few other markets in Latin America that we see as great opportunities for long-term growth; specifically, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. Together, these markets are 1/3 the size of our current Brazilian business. Our system is very focused on implementing the same winning strategies in these markets that have driven such positive results in Brazil this past decade. We will keep investing in Colombia, investing in Ecuador and Peru and across the entire Latin America region, as we execute our 2020 Vision. As such, it is easy to see why we are excited about the long-term growth opportunity represented by these 3 dynamic Latin American markets. 
Our Eurasia & Africa business extended its strong momentum, growing a solid 11% in both the quarter and year-to-date, including 11% year-to-date growth for brand Coca-Cola. During the quarter, our business in Eurasia & Africa grew both volume and value share in total  nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages. On a country level, India once again led this group's performance, delivering balanced and consistent quality growth. Our business in India was up 15% for the quarter, with double-digit growth and volume and value share gains realized across both sparkling and still beverages. Sparkling beverage growth in India was led by brand Coca-Cola, up over 30% for the second consecutive quarter, as we sustained our focus on immediate consumption offerings. And still beverages in India were led by our juice drink brands, with Maaza up over 20% again in the quarter. Russia was up 7% in both the quarter and year-to-date, with the strong result driven by the further acceleration of brand Coca-Cola, which grew 18% in the quarter and 20% year-to-date. Like last quarter, we observed similarly strong results across our broader sparkling portfolio in Russia, with Fanta up 15% and Sprite up 7%. And our Dobriy juice brand built on its recent success, delivering 16% growth in the quarter and raising this brand's year-to-date performance up to 12%. 
Our strong performance across the Eurasia & Africa Group was supported by our partnership with Aujan. We're excited about the further growth opportunities represented by our partnership with Aujan, which holds the #1 position in the still beverage business across the entire Middle East. And our collaborations in Eurasia & Africa extend beyond business relationships, as exemplified by our partnership with The Global Fund to bring critical medicines to rural Africa. At last month's Clinton Global Initiative, we announced our plans to expand the reach of project Last Mile, which was established in 2010 to help Tanzania's government-run medicine distribution network build a more efficient supply chain by leveraging our expansive distribution system and core business expertise. Nearly 20 million Africans have benefited from this partnership since 2010. The newest phase of this partnership will increase the availability of medicines to 75% of Tanzania and expand the project's reach to Ghana and Mozambique. The success of this project demonstrates our belief in the power of civil society, government and the private sector, or what we call the Golden Triangle, working closely together to solve real global issues and problems. 
Moving now to Europe. We saw our business return to growth, up a solid 1% for the quarter. These results were achieved despite the continuation of unseasonably poor weather in the first half of the quarter, as well as the impact of ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty. Even with these external headwinds, all 4 of our European business units saw positive growth this quarter, demonstrating our ability to execute with excellence across this entire region. 
Germany once again led the region, up 3% for the quarter and 2% year-to-date. This marks Germany's seventh consecutive quarter of positive growth. And while our business in Germany is winning today, we are connecting with consumers to ensure continued success for tomorrow. An example of this was our award-winning Coca-Cola summer campaign in Germany, which was named the best 2012 out-of-home campaign by Germany's leading marketing industry weekly. Understanding that music is a passion point for teenagers, our campaign in Germany leveraged our global partnership with Spotify, a leading music streaming platform, to offer teenagers access to millions of songs and exclusive Coca-Cola content. This campaign generated more than 1.5 billion contacts and reached more than 90% of all teenagers in Germany as they created their own Coca-Cola playlists and shared them with their friends via Facebook. 
We are successfully applying the same consumer engagement principles across regions, as exemplified by our highly successful global activation of the 2012 London Summer Olympic Games. Our internal indicators show that the marketing programs we executed across almost 100 markets drove global improvements in recruitment, frequency and brand equity with our consumers. Our television commercials were acknowledged by Ace Metrix as consistently being among the highest-rated ads during the Olympics. Our efforts across the digital and mobile space were also recognized. We received a Digital Gold Award by Unmetric, a brand tracker, who analyzed the social media performance of every major sponsor. And we were honored with the Global Marketer of the Year award by the Mobile Marketing Association while also taking home a Best in Show nod at their awards ceremony for our Olympic Games Move to the Beat campaign. 
Our social media programs' success goes well beyond our Olympics activation. Over just the last 9 months, Coca-Cola's Facebook page has grown by over 40%. This past quarter, Coca-Cola became the first brand to achieve over 50 million likes. And as of today, this number has increased further, surpassing 52 million. This rise parallels the growth of our social engagements footprint across all major social networks that generate conversation and content with our consumers. The recent study by PQ Media found that Coca-Cola was the #1 brand in social media impressions by nearly a 2:1 margin over the next most-mentioned brand. 
Another area of emphasis for our system is to support sustainable communities by replenishing 100% of the water used in our finished beverages by 2020. To advance this goal, we recently announced the global clean water partnership with DEKA Research & Development to bring clean water to communities where potable water access is limited. This partnership will leverage innovative technology to deliver clean drinking water to schools, health clinics and community centers in rural regions of Africa, Asia and Latin America. When fully scaled, this partnership is expected to add more than 0.5 billion liters of clean drinking water per year to the global water supply.
While water is the lifeblood of our business, we're committed to doing our part to replenish the water we use and give back to communities we proudly serve. By partnering with DEKA, we hope to empower local entrepreneurs with a specific focus on women by delivering, as well as maintaining, a clean water solution for communities and improving the daily lives of thousands of people around the world. 
Finally, we were humbled and honored earlier this month when brand Coca-Cola topped the list of Interbrand's Best Global Brands rankings. Interbrand has rated Coca-Cola as the #1 brand on its list every year since 2000. This is a testament to our ongoing commitment to invest in our brands, innovate our marketing and engage with our consumers in a sustainable manner that builds long-term value. 
Certainly, the world has been very volatile from a macroeconomic perspective over the last 4 years. As a global company and also on behalf of all our associates, I'm pleased to say that we continue to crack the calculus for growth in this challenging and volatile environment. We've done this by consistently increasing our investments in our system and our brands to ensure that our global portfolio is more relevant and healthier today than it's ever been during our history. We remain resolutely focused on ensuring that we leverage our unique heritage and fuse it with what is expected by our consumers today in order to earn and sustain our place in their daily lives today and tomorrow. 
I want to thank all of our consumers who invite us into their lives 1.8 billion times each and every day. And I want to thank all of our shareholders for your interest and investment in our company. It's a great responsibility. You can rest assured that our entire leadership team is working diligently to protect and grow the value of your investment in our company, both today and for tomorrow. 
So with that, let me now turn the call over to Gary."
26642,216022433,365402,"The Coca-Cola Company, Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Oct 16, 2012",2012-10-16,"Earnings Calls","The Coca-Cola Company","Executives","Thanks, Muhtar, and good morning, everyone. We delivered another quarter of solid performance results, reflecting our global system's ability to consistently execute our strategic plans while managing through a still unpredictable macroeconomic environmen",1393,"Thanks, Muhtar, and good morning, everyone. We delivered another quarter of solid performance results, reflecting our global system's ability to consistently execute our strategic plans while managing through a still unpredictable macroeconomic environment. As you'll recall, I provided a commentary about the third quarter during our last earnings call because we knew there were several unique timing and cycling factors to consider when modeling the third quarter. Taking these factors into account, I'm pleased to say that our third quarter results were consistent with the commentary we provided in our last earnings call. And as such, we remain confident in our ability to deliver full year volume, revenue and operating income results in line with our long-term growth targets. 
So let me start our review with our third quarter results with our comparable earnings per share, which came in at $0.51 this quarter and at $1.56 on a year-to-date basis, up 2% year-to-date despite facing considerable currency headwinds throughout the year. Our comparable currency-neutral operating income was up 1% this quarter, in line with our expectations. And on a comparable basis, the impact of currency on this quarter's operating income results was a 7% headwind. 
On a year-to-date basis, our comparable currency-neutral operating income is up 4%, also in line with our expectations. As per my previous comment, we expect to deliver full year operating income results in line with our long-term growth targets, and we understand that this implies we will achieve double-digit comparable currency-neutral operating income growth in the fourth quarter. 
Comparable currency-neutral net revenues grew 6% in the quarter. The currency impact on this quarter's comparable net revenue results was a 5% headwind. On a year-to-date basis, comparable currency-neutral net revenue growth is also at 6%. As we discuss profit and revenue growth rates, let me take a moment to remind everyone that the profits and revenues generated by some of our more recent strategic partnerships, including Aujan and Innocent, among others, are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. So while unit cases related to these businesses are fully reflected in our volume growth, their associated concentrate sales or concentrate gallons-associated profits and revenues are not currently contributing to our operating income and revenue growth rates. Instead, these profits are consolidated into our equity income results. While this did not materially impact our third quarter results, I think it's important because there is an impact on growth rates. 
Returning now to a review of our third quarter results, our concentrate sales came in slightly ahead of unit case volume by approximately 0.5%. As a reminder, growth rates for concentrate sales and unit cases can vary from quarter-to-quarter. Having said that, concentrate sales are in line with unit cases year-to-date, and we expect our full year concentrate sales growth to be in line with unit case volume growth.
As for our consolidated price mix, this came in slightly positive in the quarter, rounding to even, consistent with outlook we provided in our last quarter call. On a year-to-date basis, our consolidated price mix is up 2%. We continue to expect our full year 2012 consolidated price mix results to come in between 1% and 2%, in line with our long-term target range. 
Our third quarter comparable gross margins were in line with our second quarter comparable gross margins. This was a slight improvement over the estimate we provided during our last earnings call, as we successfully offset some of the currency and mix shift headwinds faced by our business. For the full year, we still expect our comparable gross margins to come in below our second and third quarter comparable gross margins. 
On comparable currency-neutral SG&A expenses, they were up 8% in the quarter and 6% year-to-date. These results include a mid-single-digit increase in our third quarter direct marketing expenses, as we continue to invest in the health and strength of our brands. Our third quarter SG&A also reflects an increase due to the timing of certain operating expenses, as well as the cost of adding incremental feet on the street, primarily in North America, in support of our growing business. And one point of both our quarter and year-to-date SG&A rate is related to the impact of structural items, primarily in our Bottling Investments Group and North American business. As we look to the rest of the year, we expect our full year SG&A to come in close to our current year-to-date rate. Our operating expense leverage was minus 4 points this quarter, right in line with the minus 3- to a minus 5-point range that we estimated during our last earnings call. 
As we've stated in our last call, we expect this trend to reverse in the fourth quarter, as we benefit from having 2 additional selling days. This should enable us to achieve slightly positive operating expense leverage on a full year basis. Our net interest came in at a positive $16 million in the third quarter, which is ahead of our initial expectations. This raised our year-to-date net interest income to $43 million. Looking ahead, we still expect our net interest to come in as an expense in the fourth quarter, primarily due to expected lower rates in some of our international locations, as well as ongoing currency headwinds. As a result, we're updating our full year net interest income outlook to a $30 million to $40 million range. 
Our underlying effective tax rate held steady at 24%, and we expect to carry this 24% tax rate into next year. And our cash flow from operations increased a very healthy and very strong 15% year-to-date. Our year-to-date share repurchases, net of employee stock option exercises, totaled $2.3 billion, placing us well on track to achieve the $2.5 billion to $3 billion range for full year 2012 that we communicated at the outset of this year.
With regard to commodities, in our last call, we reduced the estimated full year incremental impact of our Big 4 commodity cost on our results to $300 million. Based on our latest forecast and hedge positions, we now expect our full year incremental cost of commodities will come in at approximately $225 million. 
As for currencies, we previously provided an outlook that we would have an 8% to 9% headwind on an operating income in the third quarter. Today, I can confirm that currency came in slightly better than our initial outlook, resulting in a 7% headwind on third quarter comparable operating income. Based on our hedge positions, current spot rates and the cycling of our prior year rates, we continue to expect currencies to be a mid-single-digit headwind on our operating income in both the fourth quarter and on a full year basis. 
In closing, and as Muhtar said earlier, we are strategically and successfully advancing our global momentum while navigating through a challenging global economy. Our system is focused on maximizing economic profit and long-term cash flow, which allows us to continue to reinvest in the business and anticipate changes in the marketplace and competitive dynamics. While we have made several important and strategic investments this year, our financial priorities remain the same. We'll reinvest in the core business. We still expect to spend around $3 billion in capital expenditures in 2012. We will strategically invest in acquisitions and partnerships, the strength in our bottling system, and to increase our position in key nonalcoholic ready-to-drink growth categories. 
We will continue to pay dividends. In 2012, we increased our quarterly dividend 8.5%, and we have returned $4.3 billion in dividends to shareholders in 2011. And further, we expect our Board of Directors to approve another quarterly dividend this week, which by the way will be paid in December of this year, as it has been every year since 1934.
And we'll continue to repurchase shares with excess cash. In our current program, which we started in 2006, we've already repurchased 533 million shares at an average price of $31.17. Since our share repurchase program started in 1984, we have repurchased 2.9 billion shares at an average price of $12.55. 
As a result of our strong cash flow and that of our bottlers, I remain very confident that we can continue to invest and deliver our long-term growth targets on a sustainable basis to achieve our 2020 Vision and deliver value to our shareowners. Operator, we're now ready for questions."

Let me just address a few of the things in your question, and then Gary will add some more commentary. First, I want to just ensure and stress that our business momentum continues in the midst of ongoing global economic challenges. Our system is very well aligned and on track to achieve our 2020 Vision. And the appetite for investment by our bottling partners is strong as it has ever been. And consumers' love for our brands is stronger than ever. And as such, we do remain confident in our ability to meet our long-term targets, while also delivering sustainable, profitable growth and value for our shareowners. With respect -- and so -- at the outset. With respect to your question on the fourth quarter, let me -- as Gary said, we -- based on what we know today, we feel very confident that we can dock our ship for 2012, in line with our long-term growth targets for both top line and bottom in terms of operating profit. And so as Gary mentioned, that will imply having a double-digit growth in our operating income for the fourth quarter. We feel confident that, that can be achieved based on what we know and based on current trends. And that is a host of reasons; cycling of marketing expenses, as you saw total marketing for the company was up quite significantly in the fourth quarter. We had spend related to -- a onetime spend related to the Olympics, to the UEFA Cup, spending on our brands in a healthy way. And I think it is important to note that you can find many companies today around the world, around -- in the United States, around the world that can generate their profit line from no growth in top line. That is not sustainable. We feel very confident that we're doing the right thing for our business, right thing for our brand and we will dock our ship in 2012, yet again, in line with our long-term growth target, despite having -- facing significant commodity headwinds in both 2011 and cycling also on top of that, headwinds in 2012, investing in our brands, growing our top line and also earning our price/mix. So I'd like to just emphasize that, and pass it over to Gary."

As you mentioned, the 2 extra days helped significantly, most particularly in the finished products business, so both in North America and in BIG. And we saw the opposite impact of the 1 less day in the first quarter. So the 2 extra days helped significantly. There are quite a bit of cycling things. And you see a lot of that cycling in the third quarter, which made the third quarter so complex, and that's why we try to give a lot of extra guidance at the end of the second quarter because of the third. But a lot of that is what we've been saying all year, particularly about the North America business, how we would expect to see sequential improvement in the North America business. If you remember, just it went from minus 9 to even, now to plus 3, and you'll continue to see improvement in North America. The easing of commodities is -- obviously is helping some, although a lot of that commodity now has come through, the easing has come through into the standard costs, but that's helping. And currency will help as well, in that the headwinds of currency from the minus 7 in the third quarter to lower in the fourth quarter, not just on the translation of the results but the transactional impact, particularly inside of BIG where that currency owned -- the cost of their commodities or in their cost of goods, we do not pull out our currency-neutral calculation. So the impact of currency does hurt BIG results, and so that will improve as well in the fourth quarter. So I think everything we're seeing -- the brands are healthy. We've taken pricing across the world, we've seen much better elasticities than what we've ever had historically, which give -- has given us a lot of optimism as well."

And this is, again, 10th quarter in a row of volume growth in our North America business. And I think we continue to build our occasion-based price, pack, channel strategy that provides increased consumer choice, along with preferred packages, preferred price points, which is very important in this economic environment. We see also some more positive trends in the channel mix compared to last quarter. I think the overall convenience retail channel in the third quarter was stronger. Industry grew almost -- certainly above 4%, almost 5%. And we have not only taken significant pricing, 3% price/mix, up again in the quarter and maintained it for the full year, but also we are focused very much on transactions getting pricing, maintaining share and growing transactions in the United States. That's the model. That's working. And specifically, we've got a great package in the 12.5 ounce, which is retailing for under $1 in that channel, for example. And then also, we continue to expand in our food service channel with our innovative Freestyle. We will pass, for the first time this year the 10,000 mark in terms of dispensers deployed in this coming quarter, in the quarter that we're in, the fourth quarter. The average incidence lift there is more than 6%, the volume lift is significant, as well as revenue lift for the customer. So that's another very important point of reference in our business in the United States. And again our growth is led by strong performance with Coke Zero, up almost double digits in this past quarter, coming back very strongly, strong performance across multiple categories, such as POWERADE continuing, Gold Peak growing strong double digits, Fuze growing, smartwater, glacéau, Minute Maid, all growing in a very significant manner. So we feel confident that our North America strategies are working. We are focused on execution. We can always improve and strive for more, we always do. And we're optimistic about our outlook, despite the challenging competitive and macroeconomic backdrop. But important channels, we see better light coming through in some of the really important critical channels in the third quarter. I hope that's helpful."

So you've got",214,"Yes, one thing I would add, and I don't know if this is directly responsive to your question, but when I made a few comments in the prepared remarks about volume and how we have different business models like the Innocent, Aujan, et cetera. So you've got some volume in Eurasia this quarter, for example. So if you look at the table in the release, if I remember correctly, it would show that Eurasia and Africa's volume, volumes up 11% and comparable currency-neutral operating income is up 11% as well. So you're not seeing a lot of leverage in that. If you -- but remember, there is no income in there related to Aujan. It's sitting down in equity income, but the volume is in that 11%. So if you adjust for that, Eurasia, Africa actually has some really nice operating leverage within their P&L. And so on operating margins, they're actually sitting in a really nice place for the quarter and year-to-date. So and then on Latin America, I don't think anything really unusual at all. I think they just continue to hum along as they have for the last number of years. And there's nothing other than we continue to invest in Latin America because it's such a great, great, strong market."

And many were questioning Latin America's ability to continue grow. And I always said, ""Latin America is just beginning its journey in still beverages."" The key is to have balanced growth. Still beverages, though, growing, of course, from a very small base at a higher rate of growth than sparkling beverages. But I think there's -- Latin America is a great model for how we can continue to grow at even high per capita as for sparkling beverages entering into new categories. And I think that is adding tremendous value to our business and also tremendous strength to our bottom line as we continue to progress in Latin America. We're cycling a very strong quarter from Latin America last year and we still achieved 5% and generating very healthy returns."

The only –I'd add one other thing as well. We're probably starting to give you too much detail.

And while in absolute dollars it's not that big, it will continue. But in fact, it does have an impact of 1 point or 2 points on the leverage that you're seeing in Latin America. So I guess, all in, what we're saying is we are continuing to invest in the brands. We're investing well ahead of the curve. We're getting ready for 2014 World Cup. It's flowing through in the third quarter. And you'll see it flow-through next quarter as well because we're going to make sure that we do these things right."

But I'd say it's primarily actually the economic condition of Europe. And we've been seeing this flow through for some time now. So I think it's kind of the new normal until we start seeing some more favorable results. But what you're seeing is go to Madrid and what you -- and look at the cafes, and there aren't a lot of people sitting around drinking cokes or coffee or whatever. It is a shift in consumer spending in Europe from immediate consumption much more to future consumption. So while we grew our volume across the region or across each of the business units, there is a shift, and it's all about the macroeconomic environment that we're dealing with. So we feel very confident because people continue to love the brands. They continue to buy the brands. They are just buying them in more of a take home because they're not going out. So it's the macros that are impacting that. And additionally, if you look at the growth rates, there's negative geographic price/mix in Europe as well, just look at the growth rates. Europe and Central and Southern Europe grew faster than Spain and Northwest Europe. So that's some of it as well. And we're cycling through the tax increase in France. So it's all of those kinds of things together. Don't expect to see it get worse. I think we're kind of at the bottom now and should be okay. Relative to price/mix in the Pacific, I think your initial reaction would probably be, ""Oh my God, it's minus 6."" And your initial reaction is probably that it's all China. Well, it's not actually. A lot of it is actually because if you look at cases and gallons while, as I said in the prepared remarks, that gallons are slightly about 0.5 point ahead of cases in the quarter, in Japan, where Japan volume was up 2, gallons were actually down 2. And it's normal and it'll be fine at the end of the year. But that's 4-point swing in Japan, which as a very high profit per gallon market causes significant price/mix, negative price/mix, and that's a large part of what we're seeing in the Pacific. It's not a big deal. I think Japan was, I think, pretty much in line year-to-date and will be full year."

Spain has one of the highest prices in Europe. And so that has had the biggest contributing factor. One of the reasons for that was very unseasonable weather in Northern Europe during half of the quarter. It's never been wetter than -- in history than this – than the beginning of the quarter for 2.5 -- 2 months, 1.5 months, half of the quarter in Northern Europe. So that is coming back, and we feel that, that is one of the primary reasons. As we have more balanced growth in Europe, which we expect will happen, and as Gary said, we feel that it's not going to get any worse than it is and it may even -- and even in these conditions, we can generate growth and crack the calculus for growth, then we feel that, that will certainly be coming back quite significantly. Spain remains today, on a net revenue per unit case basis, the highest in Europe. So I just want to make sure that those -- that commentary gets through."

And our transactions are up a healthy 7% in the past quarter. We have said it before in previous quarters that we're focused on transactions and that's the health of the business in China. And certainly, we're driving transactions in a very favorable way. Year-to-date, volume is a solid 6% and our brands are very strong. We have a clear leadership position in the sparkling category, and I have total confidence in both our bottling partners, COFCO and Swire beverages and Bottling Investment Group were to continue to deliver. You have noted from previous calls that on a total comparative basis, relative basis, China's contribution to profit is less than its contribution to volume in the Pacific Group for a number of reasons. One is because we've got much more developed countries that have much bigger margins for like, of course, Japan, but like also Australasia. And therefore, it is -- the impact -- even if we were to promote in China and not that, again, we feel it's a rational environment. But even if we were to promote, it would not have significant impact on the results of the Pacific Group, simply because of the size and scale of the profit pools that are generated out of markets like Japan and out of markets like Australasia. And again, given the size of our Japan profit pool in the Pacific Group, what Gary mentioned is the primary cause of that, which is an increase in volume, 2%, but a commensurate decrease at the same percent point in actually concentrate shipments."

And certainly, it is also important to note that we aggressively led the industry on competition and pricing in the channel. And also that the industry grew at around just under -- shy of 5% roughly in the channel. And we led the pricing. And we have, again, very healthy growth in transactions. And we held share in the channel and of course in total market. And in terms of packaging, our variety of packages starting with the entry pack of 12.5 ounce is really working well for us at the entry price of under $1. And then that puts us -- our 16 ounce significantly ahead of competition and pricing at $1.19 and so on and so forth. So I would say we are very confident and very pleased with the progress that we have in that channel as we have in the Foodservice channel where we see increased traffic coming through, particularly in the latter part of the quarter. And then in energy, you asked, we had double-digit volume growth. Our brands were up and gained volume and value share in the energy channel, in -- which is primarily the c-store, the convenient store channel.
