Thanks to everyone for joining us this morning to review our fourth quarter and year-end 2011 results. With me on the call today are John Somerhalder, our Chairman, President and CEO; Andrew Evans, our Executive Vice President and CFO. We also have several members of our management team here to answer your questions following our prepared remarks. Our earnings release, earnings presentation and our Form 10-K for both AGL Resources and Nicor Gas are available on our website. To access these materials, please visit aglresources.com.
Let me remind you today that we will be making some forward-looking statements and projections and our actual results could differ materially from those forward-looking statements. The factors that could cause such material differences are included in our earnings release and our 10-K.
We also describe our business using some non-GAAP measures, such as operating margin, EBIT, adjusted net income and adjusted EPS. A reconciliation of those measures to the GAAP financials is available on the appendix of our presentation, as well as on our website.
Also you will note that we have modified our reporting segments to better reflect our operation post merger. We now have five operating segments. Distribution operations include the legacy AGL Resources utilities plus Nicor Gas. Retail operations include SouthStar plus Nicor’s Retail Energy and Services businesses. Wholesale operations include Sequent and Nicor Interchange. Midstream operations, includes our non-utility storage assets with the addition of Nicor Central Valley Gas Storage project and Cargo Shipping reflects the addition of Nicor’s Tropical Shipping units. Finally, for the segment called other, which including our non-operating business units and corporate expenses.
We will begin the call with some prepared remarks before taking your questions. Drew, I’ll turn it over to you to begin.

Starting on slide 3 of our presentation, we reported 2011 GAAP earning per share of $2.12 per diluted share. On an adjusted basis, which exclude $64 million of after-tax costs incurred during fee related to the Nicor merger, earnings per share were $2.92 which compares to $3.05 in 2010. The decline in year-over-year earnings is largely driven by several factors impacting our Wholesale Services business, including lower natural gas price spreads, lower volatility and takeaway capacity constraints that affected us, particularly, in the third quarter.
However, we saw strong performance in our utility business in 2011 resulting from new rate and infrastructure programs. Our results in total also reflect lower year-over-year incentive compensation due to not meeting our corporate earnings thresholds under our plans.
Our 2011 GAAP results included 22 days of operations from Nicor as a result of our merger closing on December 9. We’ve detailed our results here, so you can see the standalone legacy AGL Resource businesses as well as the contribution from Nicor for those 22 days. Note that the Nicor EBIT loss of $90 million includes $34 million of change in control payments that were triggered when the merger closed. Also our weighted average share count increased to 80.9 million diluted shares for the year due to the merger. For 2012, our diluted EPS guidance range is $2.80 to $2.95 and we will discuss the assumptions underlying our guidance in a few minutes.
Now let’s go to slide 4. In the fourth quarter of 2011, our diluted GAAP EPS was $0.37. On an adjusted basis excluding Nicor related expenses, it was $0.87 per share or $0.01 higher than the fourth quarter of 2010. Again, you can see the break out of our legacy businesses separate from the Nicor contribution.
On slide 5, you’ll find a reconciliation of annual 2011 EBIT, the initial segment guidance we’ve provided at our Analyst Meeting in May of last year. We included this slide to emphasize that the primary degradation earnings came from the Wholesale segment as we’ve discussed over the last several - couple of quarters.
Our performance at distribution operations was $38 million favorable to our guidance, but Wholesale was $48 million unfavorable to guidance. We did better than expected in the Midstream segment, but saw slight weakness at the retail segment relative to our expectations.
I’d also note here that the higher interest expense we incurred relative to our expectations really reflects our pre-funding of the Nicor merger to various debt issuances throughout the year and the fees associated with the bridge facility.
You can see the guidance range in our long-term EPS and dividend track record on slide 6 of the presentation. Our Board of Directors approved another 2% increase in our dividend earlier this month and our indicated annual dividend rate is now $1.84. At the mid-point of our 2012 guidance range, this would yield a payout ratio of approximately 64%.
Moving on to slide 7, you’ll find a snapshot of EBIT by segment. On the top left, you can see our results across the business looking back to 2006 and underneath that chart is the quarterly look at EBIT, which gives you a good sense of the seasonality of the - of our business.
On the right you can see that our distribution business continues to be the largest operating segment contributed to EBIT representing approximately 79% of total operating EBIT contributions in 2011. This percentage is up significantly relative to prior years in large part to the reduced earnings contribution from Wholesale services. Retail operations accounted for 18%, Midstream operations for 2% and Wholesale services 1%. There were no material earnings contributions from the Cargo Shipping segment for the 22 days that we owned it in 2011.
I’ll cover some of the major segment variances starting with our distribution business on slide 8. EBIT was up $60 million for the year or 17% compared to last year including an EBIT contribution of $15 million from the 22 days that Nicor Gas was included in our distribution results.
The primary drivers of operating margin improvement were new rate and infrastructure programs at the legacy AGL Resources utilities and the addition of Nicor Gas in the fourth quarter. Operating expenses were up 5% year-over-year, due primarily to the addition of Nicor Gas offset by lower incentive compensation accruals.
EBIT in the fourth quarter was slightly higher by - was higher by 35% year-over-year with similar drivers to our full-year performance. You can see that our average customer count for the year for the legacy AGLR utilities was up slightly from 2010 and remains stable. The customer count at Nicor Gas was just under $2.2 million for 2011 also stable relative to 2010.
Turning to the retail segment on slide 9, we recorded EBIT for 2011 of $93 million, a $10 million decline compared to 2010. Results were down in part due to weather that was 23% warmer than in 2010, resulting in lower customer usage. In addition, as gas prices declined during the fourth quarter of 2011 we recorded a lower-of-cost or market, or LOCOM adjustment that was $5 million higher than in the prior-year.
Operating expenses were lower by $5 million for the full-year due mainly to lower legal expense. You can see that the fourth quarter of 2011 results were also down year-over-year due primarily to the same factors I’ve just described. At the end of the year SouthStar’s market share was 33% in Georgia which equals our market share position at the end of both 2010 and 2009. So you can see that our customer count for 2001 declined slightly compared to the prior-year.
You will find 2011 results for our Wholesale Services segment on slide 10. As expected Sequent continues to face the challenges of lower market volatility and lower price spreads for storage and transportation. This is reflected in our EBIT contribution of just $5 million for 2011, a decline of $44 million from 2010.
The largest component of the EBIT decline came from $45 million reduction in commercial activity versus last year. Of this $45 million, $23 million was due to ongoing low volatility conditions and tight storage and transportation spreads. $18 million was related to the Marcellus takeaway issue that we detailed for you last quarter and $4 million was related to a customer bankruptcy which was also previously described.
We anticipate remaining in a low volatility environment for the foreseeable future and we've made a number of changes to better adapt our business to this new operating environment.
In addition to the impact of lower commercial activity during 2011, we had storage and transportation hedge gains that were $21 million higher than the prior-year, but we also recorded LOCOM in 2011 that was $24 million higher than in 2010 reflecting the decline in natural gas prices during the latter half of the year. Just to remind you, transportation storage hedge gains or losses and LOCOM or non-cash items, but impact the timing of reported income.
Sequent enters 2012 with a $3 million rollout schedule which compares to a rollout schedule of $16 million at the same time last year. You will recall that the rollout schedule was at $6 million at the end of the third quarter in 2011 and 2010. The rollout schedule year-over-year is lower primarily due to lower seasonal spreads resulting from lower volatility associated with robust natural gas supply and ample storage as well as warmer weather versus the prior-year.
Looking briefly at expenses for 2011 on our Wholesale business, they were down $5 million compared to the prior-year due mainly to a reduction in annual incentive compensation. Fourth quarter 2011 EBIT results for Wholesale were up $3 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2010 with primarily the same drivers as the full-year.
Now let’s move to slide 11, EBIT in our Midstream operation segment improved by $3 million in 2011 compared to 2010.The improvement was due to increased revenue at Golden Triangle Storage, which we put into commercial operation in the third quarter of last year. For the fourth quarter of 2011, EBIT improved by $1 million mainly due to slightly higher operating margin.
We've not included a slide here for our new Cargo Shipping segment as there was no material EBIT contribution from the segment for the 22 days that we owned the business since 2011. For the full-year the business was also breakeven on an EBIT basis. The downward trend in earnings at Cargo Shipping since 2007 coincides with the global economic recession, which has had significant impact on tourism in the overall economic conditions in the Caribbean region.
In the past two years, the earnings decline in shipping has resulted from a combination of fewer TEUs or twenty-foot equivalent units being shipped and higher fuel costs that cannot always be easily passed along to customers. As with our Wholesale and Midstream businesses we do not anticipate a change in the market conditions in 2012, but we’ll be focused on controlling fixed-cost in the business and evaluating new customer opportunities.
Some balance sheet highlights were noted on slide 12. Our balance sheet now includes full funding of a Nicor merger with our long term debt now $3.6 billion and short-term debt at $1.3 billion. As I noted earlier our interest expenses was up $27 million for 2011 as compared to 2010. That increase was mainly driven by the pre-funding for the cash portion of the Nicor merger as well as fees associated with the bridge facility we put in place when we announced the merger.
On slide 12, I’d also highlight our capital expenditures for 2011 and expectations for 2012. Utility CapEx including a full-year for Nicor Gas was $604 million in 2011. We anticipate spending about $725 million of utility CapEx in 2012, more than $300 million or over 40% of those expenditures are on writer base programs with minimal regulatory lag compared to about $200 million of writers related to spending in 2011.
Our non-utility capital spending will be around $100 million primarily reflecting the build-out of the second cavern Golden Triangle Storage and the completion of Central Valley Gas storage projects, both of which we expect to be completed in the first half of this year.
I won't go into detail on slide 13, but for reference you can see what our debt maturity schedule looks like following the merger closing. Relative to post merge size of our balance sheet we've no significant maturities until 2016 and even then at very manageable levels.
Thanks for your time today, and I’ll now turn the call over to John.

As Drew mentioned, we saw very strong performance in our utility business. And that is the result of a number of things we said in notion over the past couple of years on the regulatory front. To achieve reasonable rate outcomes and to pursue innovative programs such as our infrastructure investment programs where we deploy capital and see returns very quickly rather than waiting on traditional rate based adjustments.
Our retail business continues to generate stable earnings results despite some of the competitive pressures we face, particularly in the Georgia market. In a year where we had significant financing needs related to the Nicor merger we benefited from historically low interest rates. So while we have interest expense that is higher year-over-year because of the merger, we were able to finance the transaction at levels far below what we - what have expected in a more normal rate environment.
We add to these successes the fact that we closed the Nicor merger, the most transformational event in the company’s long history and made substantial progress in the integration of our two companies.
All of those things were positive for us in 2011 and set us up for well for achieving results in 2012. However, as we discussed with you on previous occasions, we clearly have challenges in certain of our businesses, which we saw on 2011, and we expect will continue in 2012.
We’ve three non-utility businesses that face significant headwinds, our Wholesale Services business, our Natural Gas Storage business and the Cargo Shipping unit that we acquired as part of the Nicor merger. Each of these businesses operates in a market, or in markets where the fundamentals have changed dramatically over the past couple of years, and those fundamental shifts in the market and economic forces meaning those businesses have seen and will likely continue to see weaker results than we expected. Those weaker results impacted our earnings in 2011 and resulted in the revised guidance range we issued during the third quarter of the year.
Unfortunately, market fundamentals have degraded even further in those businesses since our last call in October, as a result of mild weather and seasonably high storage levels and other factors. These circumstances have impacted the guidance range we established for 2012 relative to our long-term plan.
I do want to note that we still do the Nicor transaction as neutral to earnings for 2012 and accretive thereafter. Admittedly our forecast for the business has changed in response to market fundamentals. But the negative impacts are proportional across both AGL’s and Nicor’s legacy non-utility businesses.
And importantly, at our regulated businesses, we continue to operate with a backdrop of fair rate case outcomes from recent years over 40% of regulated capital expenditures underwriter programs, constructive regulatory relationships in all of our jurisdictions and the recent approval of Illinois Commerce Commission for this transformative merger.
Turning to slide 14, as Drew mentioned, we expect to earn within the range of $2.80, $2.95 per diluted share in 2012, excluding mark-to-market impacts and any additional Nicor merger-related costs.
Our guidance assumes several factors that we achieved appropriate progress towards 2012 or during 2012 towards the run-rate efficiencies we expect from the Nicor merger, that we’ve no rate case activity in 2012 from our regulated utilities that we experienced minimal growth in our retail businesses and at the challenging market conditions I described for our Wholesale, Midstream, and Cargo Shipping businesses persist throughout the year.
Specifically our guidance includes achievement of anticipated efficiencies related to corporate overhead and non-utility businesses as a result of the Nicor merger, the persistence of a low natural gas price and volatility environment for the foreseeable future, pension expense for 2012 that is expected to be significantly higher than 2011 due to lower discount rates. This issue alone is expected to impact earnings by about $0.07 per share, increased expenses related to pipeline integrity and maintenance and an outstanding diluted share count of approximately 117.5 million reflecting the full effect of the shares we issued as part of the Nicor purchase price. We plan to provide greater detail related to these issues as well as segments specific guidance at our Analyst Day in March.
From a regulatory perspective, as I mentioned, we’ve no pending rate cases and do not expect to file for new rate - case rates in any our jurisdictions this year. However, we’ll be working to put new writer-based capital expenditure programs in place as well as to extend some of the existing programs. For example, earlier this year, we filed for a new pipeline replacement program in Virginia under the State’s Save Program. We’re proposing a five-year modernization plan under which we plan to replace over 200 miles of aging pipeline.
This would be a $100 million program aimed at enhancing the reliability and integrity of the natural gas distribution system in Virginia, while supporting the local economy by providing jobs. Our filing has been deemed complete and we expect to begin the program in August. We also are evaluating options to extend our existing program in New Jersey and may file with the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities later this year. On the regulatory front, I also want to mention a recent development in the long running performance-based rates or PBR case in Illinois.
Turning to slide 15, we’ve highlighted key aspects of the stipulation resolution that we reached with the Illinois Commerce Commission staff. Under this stipulation, Nicor Gas would credit $64 million to customers. The stipulation must still be approved by the ICC, and I’d note that other parties in the case such as The Illinois Attorney General’s Office and The Citizens Utility Board have not signed on to the stipulation at this point.
Some of the accounting impacts are listed here, but on the whole the settlement is consisted with what we’ve reserved for this issue. We anticipate a ruling from the ICC later this year, and we’ll keep you apprised of any substantial developments in the case.
Turning to slide 16, you’ll find our priorities and objectives for 2012. In many ways, our objectives remain the same as they’ve over the past few years. For our utility businesses, we’ll continue to prudently invest in our operating infrastructure, so that we continue to provide safe and reliable systems to our customers at the lowest possible rates.
For retail and Wholesale, we’ll focus on maintaining market share in our core service territories and expand into new markets. For storage, our primary goal is to bring our storage facilities online that the ones that are currently under construction and contract them at the best - the combination of the best available rates and duration to optimize a portfolio in a very challenging market. At Cargo shipping, we’ll continue to focus on managing costs and maintaining a strong brand in the region and across all of our businesses we’ll focus on effectively controlling expenses.
Importantly, in 2012 we’ll continue to build on the work we began in 2011 to integrate the legacy AGL Resources businesses with Nicor across each segment and to generate the efficiencies we‘ve discussed that are central to the success of the transaction. We’re excited to bring so many talented employees from Nicor into the AGL family and look forward to continuing strong tradition of safety, reliability and customer service that both companies have built for decades.
On behalf of the employees of AGL Resources, we also welcome our new shareholders and we’d like to thank each of you for your continued interest and support of our company.
Operator, I’ll turn the call back over to you to begin the Q&A session.

The main adjustment is related to the discount rate of the liability. The last three weeks of the year saw pretty decent depression of long-term treasury rates, which is the principal benchmark - the principal underlying benchmark. What that does is just increase the size of the liability. And so this is something that actually - it’s about $13 million increase and that expense moves it out over a period of time. It’s a prudently incurred expense. It is related principally to distribution operations. We don’t anticipate going into a rate case to seek recovery of it because generally it’s like any other expense that we battle.
And so, the goal really is to just remain as efficient and combat the inflations that we’ve in the business. This is sort of a typical corporate issue with the extend that the discount rates starts to move back out if we saw increases in rates over the next couple of years. It actually would start to produce - we’ll see a reduction in the expense naturally, ultimately a generation of income.
We don’t have a real material change in sort of our unfunded status. I mean, the discount rate does in fact influence that, but it doesn’t really change our requirements for investment materially from what we’d have expected normally and our goal there is just to make sure that the plans are healthy and funded to reasonable levels in the short-term.
It’s a headwind, its - this is different than what you’re seeing reported by most other companies, principally the ones that reported in the September year-end because they didn’t have the sort of the detriment of the rate reductions that we saw through the fourth quarter.

The 6 of the 7 is Nicor Gas, which is roughly 80% non-weather sensitive. So we do have some weather risk and there’s some round numbers around what a 100 degree days means to net income, it’s a little over $1 million per 100 degree days to net income at Nicor.
And then the last was Florida which doesn’t depend on weather much to begin with. So just broadly speaking the utilities are fairly well normalized against weather and obviously this warm start to the winter affects Nicor, particularly, the rest of the utilities are fairly solid.

Thanks Dan and John. We will continue to rollout what now has been more than a decade long pipeline replacement program in Georgia and that program is coming to, it’s at the final stages, the next year or two we’ll largely have finished our program of replacement of pipe, but you recall we did expand into other infrastructure enhancements more than a year-ago with our STRIDE program, that took the PRP and added to that system reliability enhancement and expansion into new communities and towns.
And we have expanded into some new areas of the state where we see opportunity over time to grow our service territory and add to our customer base and we're seeing significant improvements in our reliability where we’ve had growth outside the - or urban core to improve our deliverability of natural gas to our increasing customer base over a period of many year. Those will continue.
We're on a cycle to review with the Georgia Public Service Commission the next stage of those infrastructure enhancement programs later this year probably, towards the end of the year and we’ll propose to them what we think is appropriate for infrastructure for the next few years. And our commitments around those programs have gone very well, the commission is I think fairly well satisfied that the program is delivering what they envisioned and shared.
In Illinois, we really do like the idea of deploying capital as appropriate in that area. There are some areas we could expand infrastructure to sort of new markets in the Illinois area. There are some infrastructure needs for replacement of not only the traditional utility pipeline infrastructure, but some gathering lines in the storage field that the utility owns there. And that will be a normal course of capital deployment, but we think that will be recognized and valued by the regulators in Illinois over time. We [released] that right now, but we think those investments will pay-off in system enhancement and reliability that we’ll get recovery of in a future case.

Our earnings release, earnings presentation and our Form 10-K for both AGL Resources and Nicor Gas are available on our website. To access these materials, please visit aglresources.com.
Let me remind you today that we will be making some forward-looking statements and projections and our actual results could differ materially from those forward-looking statements. The factors that could cause such material differences are included in our earnings release and our 10-K.
We also describe our business using some non-GAAP measures, such as operating margin, EBIT, adjusted net income and adjusted EPS. A reconciliation of those measures to the GAAP financials is available in the appendix of our presentation, as well as on our website.
Also you will note that we have modified our reporting segments to better reflect our operation post merger. We now have 5 operating segments. Distribution operations include the legacy AGL Resources utilities plus Nicor Gas. Retail operations include SouthStar plus Nicor’s Retail Energy and Services businesses. Wholesale operations include Sequent and Nicor Interchange. Midstream operations, includes our non-utility storage assets with the addition of Nicor Central Valley Gas Storage project and Cargo Shipping reflects the addition of Nicor’s Tropical Shipping units.

Starting on slide 3 of our presentation, we reported 2011 GAAP earning per share of $2.12 per diluted share. On an adjusted basis, which excludes $64 million of after-tax costs incurred during fee related to the N",1781,"Thanks, Sarah and good morning, everyone. Starting on slide 3 of our presentation, we reported 2011 GAAP earning per share of $2.12 per diluted share. On an adjusted basis, which excludes $64 million of after-tax costs incurred during fee related to the Nicor merger, earnings per share were $2.92 which compares to $3.05 in 2010. The decline in year-over-year earnings is largely driven by several factors impacting our Wholesale Services business, including lower natural gas price spreads, lower volatility and takeaway capacity constraints that affected us, particularly, in the third quarter.
However, we saw strong performance in our utility business in 2011 resulting from new rate and infrastructure programs. Our results in total also reflect lower year-over-year incentive compensation due to not meeting our corporate earnings thresholds under our plans.
Our 2011 GAAP results included 22 days of operations from Nicor as a result of our merger closing on December 9. We have detailed our results here, so you can see the standalone legacy AGL Resource businesses as well as the contribution from Nicor for those 22 days. 
Note that the Nicor EBIT loss of $90 million includes $34 million of change in control payments that were triggered when the merger closed. Also our weighted average share count increased to 80.9 million diluted shares for the year due to the merger. For 2012, our diluted EPS guidance range is $2.80 to $2.95 and we will discuss the assumptions underlying our guidance in a few minutes.
Now let’s go to slide 4. In the fourth quarter of 2011, our diluted GAAP EPS was $0.37. On an adjusted basis excluding Nicor related expenses, it was $0.87 per share or $0.01 higher than the fourth quarter of 2010. Again, you can see the break out of our legacy businesses separate from the Nicor contribution.
On slide 5, you’ll find a reconciliation of annual 2011 EBIT to the initial segment guidance we’ve provided at our Analyst Meeting in May of last year. We included this slide to emphasize that the primary degradation earnings came from the Wholesale segment as we’ve discussed over the last several -- couple of quarters.
Our performance at distribution operations was $38 million favorable to our guidance, but Wholesale was $48 million unfavorable to guidance. We did better than expected in the Midstream segment, but saw slight weakness at the retail segment relative to our expectations.
I’d also note here that the higher interest expense we incurred relative to our expectations really reflects our pre-funding of the Nicor merger to various debt issuances throughout the year and the fees associated with the bridge facility.
You can see the guidance range in our long-term EPS and dividend track record on slide 6 of the presentation. Our Board of Directors approved another 2% increase in our dividend earlier this month and our indicated annual dividend rate is now $1.84. At the mid-point of our 2012 guidance range, this would yield a payout ratio of approximately 64%.
Moving on to slide 7, you’ll find a snapshot of EBIT by segment. On the top left, you can see our results across the business looking back to 2006 and underneath that chart is the quarterly look at EBIT, which gives you a good sense of the seasonality of the -- of our business.
On the right you can see that our distribution business continues to be the largest operating segment contributor to EBIT representing approximately 79% of total operating EBIT contributions in 2011. This percentage is up significantly relative to prior years in large part to the reduced earnings contribution from Wholesale services. Retail operations accounted for 18%, Midstream operations for 2% and Wholesale services 1%. 
There were no material earnings contributions from the Cargo Shipping segment for the 22 days that we owned it in 2011.
I’ll cover some of the major segment variances starting with our distribution business on slide 8. EBIT was up $60 million for the year or 17% compared to last year including an EBIT contribution of $15 million from the 22 days that Nicor Gas was included in our distribution results.
The primary drivers of operating margin improvement were new rate and infrastructure programs at the legacy AGL Resources utilities and the addition of Nicor Gas in the fourth quarter. Operating expenses were up 5% year-over-year, due primarily to the addition of Nicor Gas offset by lower incentive compensation accruals.
EBIT in the fourth quarter was slightly higher by -- was higher by 35% year-over-year with similar drivers to our full-year performance. You can see that our average customer count for the year for the legacy AGLR utilities was up slightly from 2010 and remains stable. The customer count at Nicor Gas was just under $2.2 million for 2011 also stable relative to 2010.
Turning to the retail segment on slide 9, we recorded EBIT for 2011 of $93 million, a $10 million decline compared to 2010. Results were down in part due to weather that was 23% warmer than in 2010, resulting in lower customer usage. In addition, as gas prices declined during the fourth quarter of 2011 we recorded a lower-of-cost or market, or LOCOM adjustment that was $5 million higher than in the prior-year.
Operating expenses were lower by $5 million for the full-year due mainly to lower legal expense. You can see that the fourth quarter of 2011 results were also down year-over-year due primarily to the same factors I’ve just described. At the end of the year SouthStar’s market share was 33% in Georgia which equals our market share position at the end of both 2010 and 2009. So you can see that our customer count for 2001 declined slightly compared to the prior-year.
You will find 2011 results for our Wholesale Services segment on slide 10. As expected Sequent continues to face the challenges of lower market volatility and lower price spreads for storage and transportation. This is reflected in our EBIT contribution of just $5 million for 2011, a decline of $44 million from 2010.
The largest component of the EBIT decline came from $45 million reduction in commercial activity versus last year. Of this $45 million, $23 million was due to ongoing low volatility conditions and tight storage and transportation spreads. $18 million was related to the Marcellus takeaway issue that we detailed for you last quarter and $4 million was related to a customer bankruptcy which was also previously described.
We anticipate remaining in a low volatility environment for the foreseeable future and we've made a number of changes to better adapt our business to this new operating environment.
In addition to the impact of lower commercial activity during 2011, we had storage and transportation hedge gains that were $21 million higher than the prior-year, but we also recorded LOCOM in 2011 that was $24 million higher than in 2010 reflecting the decline in natural gas prices during the latter half of the year. Just to remind you, transportation storage hedge gains or losses and LOCOM are non-cash items, but impact the timing of reported income.
Sequent enters 2012 with a $3 million rollout schedule which compares to a rollout schedule of $16 million at the same time last year. You will recall that the rollout schedule was at $6 million at the end of the third quarter in 2011 and 2010. The rollout schedule year-over-year is lower primarily due to lower seasonal spreads resulting from lower volatility associated with robust natural gas supply and ample storage as well as warmer weather versus the prior-year.
Looking briefly at expenses for 2011 on our Wholesale business, they were down $5 million compared to the prior-year due mainly to a reduction in annual incentive compensation. Fourth quarter 2011 EBIT results for Wholesale were up $3 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2010 with primarily the same drivers as the full-year.
Now let’s move to slide 11, EBIT in our Midstream operation segment improved by $3 million in 2011 compared to 2010. The improvement was due to increased revenue at Golden Triangle Storage, which we put into commercial operation in the third quarter of last year. For the fourth quarter of 2011, EBIT improved by $1 million mainly due to slightly higher operating margin.
We've not included a slide here for our new Cargo Shipping segment as there was no material EBIT contribution from the segment for the 22 days that we owned the business since 2011. For the full-year the business was also breakeven on an EBIT basis. The downward trend in earnings at Cargo Shipping since 2007 coincides with the global economic recession, which has had significant impact on tourism in the overall economic conditions in the Caribbean region.
In the past 2 years, the earnings decline in shipping has resulted from a combination of fewer TEUs or twenty-foot equivalent units being shipped and higher fuel costs that cannot always be easily passed along to customers. As with our Wholesale and Midstream businesses we do not anticipate a change in the market conditions in 2012, but we’ll be focused on controlling fixed-cost in the business and evaluating new customer opportunities.
Some balance sheet highlights are noted on slide 12. Our balance sheet now includes full funding of a Nicor merger with our long term debt now $3.6 billion and short-term debt at $1.3 billion. As I noted earlier our interest expenses was up $27 million for 2011 as compared to 2010. That increase was mainly driven by the pre-funding for the cash portion of the Nicor merger as well as fees associated with the bridge facility we put in place when we announced the merger.
On slide 12, I would also highlight our capital expenditures for 2011 and expectations for 2012. Utility CapEx including a full-year for Nicor Gas was $604 million in 2011. We anticipate spending about $725 million of utility CapEx in 2012, more than $300 million or over 40% of those expenditures are on writer base programs with minimal regulatory lag compared to about $200 million of writers related to spending in 2011.
Our non-utility capital spending will be around $100 million primarily reflecting the build-out of the second cavern Golden Triangle Storage and the completion of Central Valley Gas storage projects, both of which we expect to be completed in the first half of this year.
I won't go into detail on slide 13, but for reference you can see what our debt maturity schedule looks like following the merger closing. Relative to post merger size of our balance sheet we've no significant maturities until 2016 and even then at very manageable levels.
Thanks for your time today, and I’ll now turn the call over to John."

And that is the result of a number of things we s",1315,"Thanks, Drew and good morning. I’ll start by recapping what I believe was by most measures a solid year for the company in 2011. As Drew mentioned, we saw very strong performance in our utility business. And that is the result of a number of things we said in notion over the past couple of years on the regulatory front. To achieve reasonable rate outcomes and to pursue innovative programs such as our infrastructure investment programs where we deploy capital and see returns very quickly rather than waiting on traditional rate based adjustments.
Our retail business continues to generate stable earnings results despite some of the competitive pressures we face, particularly in the Georgia market. In a year where we had significant financing needs related to the Nicor merger we benefited from historically low interest rates. So while we have interest expense that is higher year-over-year because of the merger, we were able to finance the transaction at levels far below what we -- what we would have expected in a more normal rate environment.
We add to these successes the fact that we closed the Nicor merger, the most transformational event in the company’s long history and made substantial progress in the integration of our 2 companies.
All of those things were positive for us in 2011 and set us up for well for achieving results in 2012. However, as we discussed with you on previous occasions, we clearly have challenges in certain of our businesses, which we saw on 2011, and we expect will continue in 2012.
We have 3 non-utility businesses that face significant headwinds, our Wholesale Services business, our Natural Gas Storage business and the Cargo Shipping unit that we acquired as part of the Nicor merger. Each of these businesses operates in a market, or in markets where the fundamentals have changed dramatically over the past couple of years, and those fundamental shifts in the market and economic forces meaning those businesses have seen and will likely continue to see weaker results than we expected. Those weaker results impacted our earnings in 2011 and resulted in the revised guidance range we issued during the third quarter of the year.
Unfortunately, market fundamentals have degraded even further in those businesses since our last call in October, as a result of mild weather, unseasonably high storage levels and other factors. These circumstances have impacted the guidance range we established for 2012 relative to our long-term plan.
I do want to note that we still do the Nicor transaction as neutral to earnings for 2012 and accretive thereafter. Admittedly our forecast for the business has changed in response to market fundamentals. But the negative impacts are proportional across both AGL’s and Nicor’s legacy non-utility businesses.
And importantly, at our regulated businesses, we continue to operate with a backdrop of fair rate case outcomes from recent years over 40% of regulated capital expenditures under writer programs, constructive regulatory relationships in all of our jurisdictions and the recent approval of Illinois Commerce Commission for this transformative merger.
Turning to slide 14, as Drew mentioned, we expect to earn within the range of $2.80 to $2.95 per diluted share in 2012, excluding mark-to-market impacts and any additional Nicor merger-related costs.
Our guidance assumes several factors that we achieved appropriate progress towards 2012 or during 2012 towards the run-rate efficiencies we expect from the Nicor merger, that we’ve no rate case activity in 2012 from our regulated utilities, that we experienced minimal growth in our retail businesses and that the challenging market conditions I described for our Wholesale, Midstream, and Cargo Shipping businesses persist throughout the year.
Specifically our guidance includes achievement of anticipated efficiencies related to corporate overhead and non-utility businesses as a result of the Nicor merger, the persistence of a low natural gas price and volatility environment for the foreseeable future, pension expense for 2012 that is expected to be significantly higher than 2011 due to lower discount rates. This issue alone is expected to impact earnings by about $0.07 per share, increased expenses related to pipeline integrity and maintenance and an outstanding diluted share count of approximately 117.5 million reflecting the full effect of the shares we issued as part of the Nicor purchase price. We plan to provide greater detail related to these issues as well as segments specific guidance at our Analyst Day in March.
From a regulatory perspective, as I mentioned, we have no pending rate cases and do not expect to file for new rate -- case rates in any our jurisdictions this year. However, we’ll be working to put new writer-based capital expenditure programs in place as well as to extend some of the existing programs. For example, earlier this year, we filed for a new pipeline replacement program in Virginia under the State’s Save Program. We’re proposing a 5-year modernization plan under which we plan to replace over 200 miles of aging pipeline.
This would be a $100 million program aimed at enhancing the reliability and integrity of the natural gas distribution system in Virginia, while supporting the local economy by providing jobs. Our filing has been deemed complete and we expect to begin the program in August. We also are evaluating options to extend our existing program in New Jersey and may file with the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities later this year. On the regulatory front, I also want to mention a recent development in the long running performance-based rates or PBR case in Illinois.
Turning to slide 15, we’ve highlighted key aspects of the stipulation resolution that we reached with the Illinois Commerce Commission staff. Under this stipulation, Nicor Gas would credit $64 million to customers. The stipulation must still be approved by the ICC, and I would note that other parties in the case such as The Illinois Attorney General’s Office and The Citizens Utility Board have not signed on to the stipulation at this point.
Some of the accounting impacts are listed here, but on the whole the settlement is consisted with what we have reserved for this issue. We anticipate a ruling from the ICC later this year, and we’ll keep you apprised of any substantial developments in the case.
Turning to slide 16, you’ll find our priorities and objectives for 2012. In many ways, our objectives remain the same as they’ve over the past few years. For our utility businesses, we will continue to prudently invest in our operating infrastructure, so that we continue to provide safe and reliable systems to our customers at the lowest possible rates.
For retail and Wholesale, we will focus on maintaining market share in our core service territories and expand into new markets. For storage, our primary goal is to bring our storage facilities online -- that the ones that are currently under construction and contract them at the best -- the combination of the best available rates and duration to optimize a portfolio in a very challenging market. At Cargo shipping, we will continue to focus on managing costs and maintaining a strong brand in the region and across all of our businesses we’ll focus on effectively controlling expenses.
Importantly, in 2012 we will continue to build on the work we began in 2011 to integrate the legacy AGL Resources businesses with Nicor across each segment and to generate the efficiencies we‘ve discussed that are central to the success of the transaction. We’re excited to bring so many talented employees from Nicor into the AGL family and look forward to continuing strong tradition of safety, reliability and customer service that both companies have built for decades.
On behalf of the employees of AGL Resources, we also welcome our new shareholders and we’d like to thank each of you for your continued interest in and support of our company.

The main adjustment is related to the discount rate of the liability. The last 3 weeks of the year saw pretty decent depression of long-term treasury rates, which is the principal benchmark -- the principal underlying benchmark. What that does is just increase the size of the liability. And so this is something that actually -- it’s about $13 million increase and that expense moves it out over a period of time. It’s a prudently incurred expense. It is related principally to distribution operations. We don’t anticipate going into a rate case to seek recovery of it because generally it’s like any other expense that we battle. And so, the goal really is to just remain as efficient and combat the inflations that we’ve in the business. This is sort of a typical corporate issue with the extent that the discount rates starts to move back out if we saw increases in rates over the next couple of years. It actually would start to produce -- we’ll see a reduction in the expense naturally, ultimately a generation of income. We don’t have a real material change in sort of our unfunded status. I mean, the discount rate does in fact influence that, but it doesn’t really change our requirements for investment materially from what we would have expected normally and our goal there is just to make sure that the plans are healthy and funded to reasonable levels in the short-term. It’s a headwind, it’s -- this is different than what you’re seeing reported by most other companies, principally the ones that reported in the September year-end because they didn’t have the sort of the detriment of the rate reductions that we saw through the fourth quarter."

What you see at Sequent is, 2 main category of earning’s drivers. One is the cash activity that you generate when it’s cold, and that is significantly down in Q4 and you'd obviously expect to see that down in Q1 given the warm weather.
What happens during that time period though is that it again accelerates forward hedge gains, because we were very well hedged on our storage and transportation portfolio. So as the market weakens those spreads collapse and we take accelerated hedge gains. So I think that trend would continue into Q1, if that price environment continues."

And then Pete also talked earlier about that simple cycle spread moving out. We do hold enough capacity and manage enough capacity under asset management agreement, storage capacity that, that gives us some help too.

We will continue to rollout what now has been more than a decade long pipeline replacement program in Georgia and that program is coming to -- it’s at the final stages, the next year or 2 we’ll largely have finished our program of replacement of pipe, but you recall we did expand into other infrastructure enhancements more than a year-ago with our STRIDE program, that took the PRP and added to that system reliability enhancement and expansion into new communities and towns. And we have expanded into some new areas of the state where we see opportunity over time to grow our service territory and add to our customer base. And we're seeing significant improvements in our reliability where we’ve had growth outside the -- or urban core to improve our deliverability of natural gas to our increasing customer base over a period of many year. Those will continue. We're on a cycle to review with the Georgia Public Service Commission the next stage of those infrastructure enhancement programs later this year probably, towards the end of the year and we’ll propose to them what we think is appropriate for infrastructure for the next few years. And our commitments around those programs have gone very well, the commission is I think fairly well satisfied that the program is delivering what they envisioned and shared. In Illinois, we really do like the idea of deploying capital as appropriate in that area. There are some areas we could expand infrastructure to sort of new markets in the Illinois area. There are some infrastructure needs for replacement of not only the traditional utility pipeline infrastructure, but some gathering lines in the storage field that the utility owns there. And that will be a normal course of capital deployment, but we think that will be recognized and valued by the regulators in Illinois over time. We released that right now, but we think those investments will pay-off in system enhancement and reliability that we’ll get recovery of in a future case."

Starting on slide 3 of our presentation, we reported 2011 GAAP earning per share of $2.12 per diluted share. On an adjusted basis, which excludes $64 million of after-tax costs incurred during fee related to the N",1781,"Thanks, Sarah and good morning, everyone. Starting on slide 3 of our presentation, we reported 2011 GAAP earning per share of $2.12 per diluted share. On an adjusted basis, which excludes $64 million of after-tax costs incurred during fee related to the Nicor merger, earnings per share were $2.92 which compares to $3.05 in 2010. The decline in year-over-year earnings is largely driven by several factors impacting our Wholesale Services business, including lower natural gas price spreads, lower volatility and takeaway capacity constraints that affected us, particularly, in the third quarter.
However, we saw strong performance in our utility business in 2011 resulting from new rate and infrastructure programs. Our results in total also reflect lower year-over-year incentive compensation due to not meeting our corporate earnings thresholds under our plans.
Our 2011 GAAP results included 22 days of operations from Nicor as a result of our merger closing on December 9. We have detailed our results here, so you can see the standalone legacy AGL Resource businesses as well as the contribution from Nicor for those 22 days. 
Note that the Nicor EBIT loss of $90 million includes $34 million of change in control payments that were triggered when the merger closed. Also our weighted average share count increased to 80.9 million diluted shares for the year due to the merger. For 2012, our diluted EPS guidance range is $2.80 to $2.95 and we will discuss the assumptions underlying our guidance in a few minutes.
Now let’s go to slide 4. In the fourth quarter of 2011, our diluted GAAP EPS was $0.37. On an adjusted basis excluding Nicor related expenses, it was $0.87 per share or $0.01 higher than the fourth quarter of 2010. Again, you can see the break out of our legacy businesses separate from the Nicor contribution.
On slide 5, you’ll find a reconciliation of annual 2011 EBIT to the initial segment guidance we’ve provided at our Analyst Meeting in May of last year. We included this slide to emphasize that the primary degradation earnings came from the Wholesale segment as we’ve discussed over the last several -- couple of quarters.
Our performance at distribution operations was $38 million favorable to our guidance, but Wholesale was $48 million unfavorable to guidance. We did better than expected in the Midstream segment, but saw slight weakness at the retail segment relative to our expectations.
I’d also note here that the higher interest expense we incurred relative to our expectations really reflects our pre-funding of the Nicor merger to various debt issuances throughout the year and the fees associated with the bridge facility.
You can see the guidance range in our long-term EPS and dividend track record on slide 6 of the presentation. Our Board of Directors approved another 2% increase in our dividend earlier this month and our indicated annual dividend rate is now $1.84. At the mid-point of our 2012 guidance range, this would yield a payout ratio of approximately 64%.
Moving on to slide 7, you’ll find a snapshot of EBIT by segment. On the top left, you can see our results across the business looking back to 2006 and underneath that chart is the quarterly look at EBIT, which gives you a good sense of the seasonality of the -- of our business.
On the right you can see that our distribution business continues to be the largest operating segment contributor to EBIT representing approximately 79% of total operating EBIT contributions in 2011. This percentage is up significantly relative to prior years in large part to the reduced earnings contribution from Wholesale services. Retail operations accounted for 18%, Midstream operations for 2% and Wholesale services 1%. 
There were no material earnings contributions from the Cargo Shipping segment for the 22 days that we owned it in 2011.
I’ll cover some of the major segment variances starting with our distribution business on slide 8. EBIT was up $60 million for the year or 17% compared to last year including an EBIT contribution of $15 million from the 22 days that Nicor Gas was included in our distribution results.
The primary drivers of operating margin improvement were new rate and infrastructure programs at the legacy AGL Resources utilities and the addition of Nicor Gas in the fourth quarter. Operating expenses were up 5% year-over-year, due primarily to the addition of Nicor Gas offset by lower incentive compensation accruals.
EBIT in the fourth quarter was slightly higher by -- was higher by 35% year-over-year with similar drivers to our full-year performance. You can see that our average customer count for the year for the legacy AGLR utilities was up slightly from 2010 and remains stable. The customer count at Nicor Gas was just under $2.2 million for 2011 also stable relative to 2010.
Turning to the retail segment on slide 9, we recorded EBIT for 2011 of $93 million, a $10 million decline compared to 2010. Results were down in part due to weather that was 23% warmer than in 2010, resulting in lower customer usage. In addition, as gas prices declined during the fourth quarter of 2011 we recorded a lower-of-cost or market, or LOCOM adjustment that was $5 million higher than in the prior-year.
Operating expenses were lower by $5 million for the full-year due mainly to lower legal expense. You can see that the fourth quarter of 2011 results were also down year-over-year due primarily to the same factors I’ve just described. At the end of the year SouthStar’s market share was 33% in Georgia which equals our market share position at the end of both 2010 and 2009. So you can see that our customer count for 2001 declined slightly compared to the prior-year.
You will find 2011 results for our Wholesale Services segment on slide 10. As expected Sequent continues to face the challenges of lower market volatility and lower price spreads for storage and transportation. This is reflected in our EBIT contribution of just $5 million for 2011, a decline of $44 million from 2010.
The largest component of the EBIT decline came from $45 million reduction in commercial activity versus last year. Of this $45 million, $23 million was due to ongoing low volatility conditions and tight storage and transportation spreads. $18 million was related to the Marcellus takeaway issue that we detailed for you last quarter and $4 million was related to a customer bankruptcy which was also previously described.
We anticipate remaining in a low volatility environment for the foreseeable future and we've made a number of changes to better adapt our business to this new operating environment.
In addition to the impact of lower commercial activity during 2011, we had storage and transportation hedge gains that were $21 million higher than the prior-year, but we also recorded LOCOM in 2011 that was $24 million higher than in 2010 reflecting the decline in natural gas prices during the latter half of the year. Just to remind you, transportation storage hedge gains or losses and LOCOM are non-cash items, but impact the timing of reported income.
Sequent enters 2012 with a $3 million rollout schedule which compares to a rollout schedule of $16 million at the same time last year. You will recall that the rollout schedule was at $6 million at the end of the third quarter in 2011 and 2010. The rollout schedule year-over-year is lower primarily due to lower seasonal spreads resulting from lower volatility associated with robust natural gas supply and ample storage as well as warmer weather versus the prior-year.
Looking briefly at expenses for 2011 on our Wholesale business, they were down $5 million compared to the prior-year due mainly to a reduction in annual incentive compensation. Fourth quarter 2011 EBIT results for Wholesale were up $3 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2010 with primarily the same drivers as the full-year.
Now let’s move to slide 11, EBIT in our Midstream operation segment improved by $3 million in 2011 compared to 2010. The improvement was due to increased revenue at Golden Triangle Storage, which we put into commercial operation in the third quarter of last year. For the fourth quarter of 2011, EBIT improved by $1 million mainly due to slightly higher operating margin.
We've not included a slide here for our new Cargo Shipping segment as there was no material EBIT contribution from the segment for the 22 days that we owned the business since 2011. For the full-year the business was also breakeven on an EBIT basis. The downward trend in earnings at Cargo Shipping since 2007 coincides with the global economic recession, which has had significant impact on tourism in the overall economic conditions in the Caribbean region.
In the past 2 years, the earnings decline in shipping has resulted from a combination of fewer TEUs or twenty-foot equivalent units being shipped and higher fuel costs that cannot always be easily passed along to customers. As with our Wholesale and Midstream businesses we do not anticipate a change in the market conditions in 2012, but we’ll be focused on controlling fixed-cost in the business and evaluating new customer opportunities.
Some balance sheet highlights are noted on slide 12. Our balance sheet now includes full funding of a Nicor merger with our long term debt now $3.6 billion and short-term debt at $1.3 billion. As I noted earlier our interest expenses was up $27 million for 2011 as compared to 2010. That increase was mainly driven by the pre-funding for the cash portion of the Nicor merger as well as fees associated with the bridge facility we put in place when we announced the merger.
On slide 12, I would also highlight our capital expenditures for 2011 and expectations for 2012. Utility CapEx including a full-year for Nicor Gas was $604 million in 2011. We anticipate spending about $725 million of utility CapEx in 2012, more than $300 million or over 40% of those expenditures are on writer base programs with minimal regulatory lag compared to about $200 million of writers related to spending in 2011.
Our non-utility capital spending will be around $100 million primarily reflecting the build-out of the second cavern Golden Triangle Storage and the completion of Central Valley Gas storage projects, both of which we expect to be completed in the first half of this year.
I won't go into detail on slide 13, but for reference you can see what our debt maturity schedule looks like following the merger closing. Relative to post merger size of our balance sheet we've no significant maturities until 2016 and even then at very manageable levels.
Thanks for your time today, and I’ll now turn the call over to John."
252517,170182989,270884,"AGL Resources Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 22, 2012",2012-02-22,"Earnings Calls","Southern Company Gas","Executives","Thanks, Drew and good morning.

As Drew mentioned, we saw very strong performance in our utility business. And that is the result of a number of things we said in notion over the past couple of years on the regulatory front. To achieve reasonable rate outcomes and to pursue innovative programs such as our infrastructure investment programs where we deploy capital and see returns very quickly rather than waiting on traditional rate based adjustments.
Our retail business continues to generate stable earnings results despite some of the competitive pressures we face, particularly in the Georgia market. In a year where we had significant financing needs related to the Nicor merger we benefited from historically low interest rates. So while we have interest expense that is higher year-over-year because of the merger, we were able to finance the transaction at levels far below what we -- what we would have expected in a more normal rate environment.
We add to these successes the fact that we closed the Nicor merger, the most transformational event in the company’s long history and made substantial progress in the integration of our 2 companies.
All of those things were positive for us in 2011 and set us up for well for achieving results in 2012. However, as we discussed with you on previous occasions, we clearly have challenges in certain of our businesses, which we saw on 2011, and we expect will continue in 2012.
We have 3 non-utility businesses that face significant headwinds, our Wholesale Services business, our Natural Gas Storage business and the Cargo Shipping unit that we acquired as part of the Nicor merger. Each of these businesses operates in a market, or in markets where the fundamentals have changed dramatically over the past couple of years, and those fundamental shifts in the market and economic forces meaning those businesses have seen and will likely continue to see weaker results than we expected. Those weaker results impacted our earnings in 2011 and resulted in the revised guidance range we issued during the third quarter of the year.
Unfortunately, market fundamentals have degraded even further in those businesses since our last call in October, as a result of mild weather, unseasonably high storage levels and other factors. These circumstances have impacted the guidance range we established for 2012 relative to our long-term plan.
I do want to note that we still do the Nicor transaction as neutral to earnings for 2012 and accretive thereafter. Admittedly our forecast for the business has changed in response to market fundamentals. But the negative impacts are proportional across both AGL’s and Nicor’s legacy non-utility businesses.
And importantly, at our regulated businesses, we continue to operate with a backdrop of fair rate case outcomes from recent years over 40% of regulated capital expenditures under writer programs, constructive regulatory relationships in all of our jurisdictions and the recent approval of Illinois Commerce Commission for this transformative merger.
Turning to slide 14, as Drew mentioned, we expect to earn within the range of $2.80 to $2.95 per diluted share in 2012, excluding mark-to-market impacts and any additional Nicor merger-related costs.
Our guidance assumes several factors that we achieved appropriate progress towards 2012 or during 2012 towards the run-rate efficiencies we expect from the Nicor merger, that we’ve no rate case activity in 2012 from our regulated utilities, that we experienced minimal growth in our retail businesses and that the challenging market conditions I described for our Wholesale, Midstream, and Cargo Shipping businesses persist throughout the year.
Specifically our guidance includes achievement of anticipated efficiencies related to corporate overhead and non-utility businesses as a result of the Nicor merger, the persistence of a low natural gas price and volatility environment for the foreseeable future, pension expense for 2012 that is expected to be significantly higher than 2011 due to lower discount rates. This issue alone is expected to impact earnings by about $0.07 per share, increased expenses related to pipeline integrity and maintenance and an outstanding diluted share count of approximately 117.5 million reflecting the full effect of the shares we issued as part of the Nicor purchase price. We plan to provide greater detail related to these issues as well as segments specific guidance at our Analyst Day in March.
From a regulatory perspective, as I mentioned, we have no pending rate cases and do not expect to file for new rate -- case rates in any our jurisdictions this year. However, we’ll be working to put new writer-based capital expenditure programs in place as well as to extend some of the existing programs. For example, earlier this year, we filed for a new pipeline replacement program in Virginia under the State’s Save Program. We’re proposing a 5-year modernization plan under which we plan to replace over 200 miles of aging pipeline.
This would be a $100 million program aimed at enhancing the reliability and integrity of the natural gas distribution system in Virginia, while supporting the local economy by providing jobs. Our filing has been deemed complete and we expect to begin the program in August. We also are evaluating options to extend our existing program in New Jersey and may file with the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities later this year. On the regulatory front, I also want to mention a recent development in the long running performance-based rates or PBR case in Illinois.
Turning to slide 15, we’ve highlighted key aspects of the stipulation resolution that we reached with the Illinois Commerce Commission staff. Under this stipulation, Nicor Gas would credit $64 million to customers. The stipulation must still be approved by the ICC, and I would note that other parties in the case such as The Illinois Attorney General’s Office and The Citizens Utility Board have not signed on to the stipulation at this point.
Some of the accounting impacts are listed here, but on the whole the settlement is consisted with what we have reserved for this issue. We anticipate a ruling from the ICC later this year, and we’ll keep you apprised of any substantial developments in the case.
Turning to slide 16, you’ll find our priorities and objectives for 2012. In many ways, our objectives remain the same as they’ve over the past few years. For our utility businesses, we will continue to prudently invest in our operating infrastructure, so that we continue to provide safe and reliable systems to our customers at the lowest possible rates.
For retail and Wholesale, we will focus on maintaining market share in our core service territories and expand into new markets. For storage, our primary goal is to bring our storage facilities online -- that the ones that are currently under construction and contract them at the best -- the combination of the best available rates and duration to optimize a portfolio in a very challenging market. At Cargo shipping, we will continue to focus on managing costs and maintaining a strong brand in the region and across all of our businesses we’ll focus on effectively controlling expenses.
Importantly, in 2012 we will continue to build on the work we began in 2011 to integrate the legacy AGL Resources businesses with Nicor across each segment and to generate the efficiencies we‘ve discussed that are central to the success of the transaction. We’re excited to bring so many talented employees from Nicor into the AGL family and look forward to continuing strong tradition of safety, reliability and customer service that both companies have built for decades.
On behalf of the employees of AGL Resources, we also welcome our new shareholders and we’d like to thank each of you for your continued interest in and support of our company.

The main adjustment is related to the discount rate of the liability. The last 3 weeks of the year saw pretty decent depression of long-term treasury rates, which is the principal benchmark -- the principal underlying benchmark. What that does is just increase the size of the liability. And so this is something that actually -- it’s about $13 million increase and that expense moves it out over a period of time. It’s a prudently incurred expense. It is related principally to distribution operations. We don’t anticipate going into a rate case to seek recovery of it because generally it’s like any other expense that we battle. And so, the goal really is to just remain as efficient and combat the inflations that we’ve in the business. This is sort of a typical corporate issue with the extent that the discount rates starts to move back out if we saw increases in rates over the next couple of years. It actually would start to produce -- we’ll see a reduction in the expense naturally, ultimately a generation of income. We don’t have a real material change in sort of our unfunded status. I mean, the discount rate does in fact influence that, but it doesn’t really change our requirements for investment materially from what we would have expected normally and our goal there is just to make sure that the plans are healthy and funded to reasonable levels in the short-term. It’s a headwind, it’s -- this is different than what you’re seeing reported by most other companies, principally the ones that reported in the September year-end because they didn’t have the sort of the detriment of the rate reductions that we saw through the fourth quarter."

The margins are still constrained due to the lower volatility, but we’re seeing the utilization of gas by that market share increase in the services we’re providing there.

And what it allows us to do is capture the upside of the colder weather and then prevents a lot of the degradation on the downside. So really a lot of what you’re looking at in terms of the variants is the significantly colder than normal weather in 2010, which gave us uplift and then in 2011, it was actually relatively flat.

We’re focused today or have over the last 60 days on things like staffing, but really principally, our focus has been getting consolidated financial statements out and we’re very pleased with the way that we were able to close the books in an accurate and timely fashion.

So we did factor that into our assumptions around our Wholesale business and some of those things.

So we've had some negative impact already this year from the midpoint of that range because of the milder weather.

We will continue to rollout what now has been more than a decade long pipeline replacement program in Georgia and that program is coming to -- it’s at the final stages, the next year or 2 we’ll largely have finished our program of replacement of pipe, but you recall we did expand into other infrastructure enhancements more than a year-ago with our STRIDE program, that took the PRP and added to that system reliability enhancement and expansion into new communities and towns. And we have expanded into some new areas of the state where we see opportunity over time to grow our service territory and add to our customer base. And we're seeing significant improvements in our reliability where we’ve had growth outside the -- or urban core to improve our deliverability of natural gas to our increasing customer base over a period of many year. Those will continue. We're on a cycle to review with the Georgia Public Service Commission the next stage of those infrastructure enhancement programs later this year probably, towards the end of the year and we’ll propose to them what we think is appropriate for infrastructure for the next few years. And our commitments around those programs have gone very well, the commission is I think fairly well satisfied that the program is delivering what they envisioned and shared. In Illinois, we really do like the idea of deploying capital as appropriate in that area. There are some areas we could expand infrastructure to sort of new markets in the Illinois area. There are some infrastructure needs for replacement of not only the traditional utility pipeline infrastructure, but some gathering lines in the storage field that the utility owns there. And that will be a normal course of capital deployment, but we think that will be recognized and valued by the regulators in Illinois over time. We released that right now, but we think those investments will pay-off in system enhancement and reliability that we’ll get recovery of in a future case."

Starting on slide three of our presentation, we reported 2012 GAAP earnings per share of $1.11 per diluted share for the combined enterprises, which now includes a full quarter of contribution from the legacy Nico",1567,"Thanks Sarah and good afternoon everyone. Starting on slide three of our presentation, we reported 2012 GAAP earnings per share of $1.11 per diluted share for the combined enterprises, which now includes a full quarter of contribution from the legacy Nicor businesses. On an adjusted basis which excludes $6 million of after tax costs incurred during the quarter related to the Nicor merger, earnings per share were $1.16 which compares to $1.63 for the first quarter of 2011.
The primary year-over-year driver of our first quarter earnings is the addition of the Nicor businesses, the results of which are not reflected in the first quarter of 2001 GAAP comparisons. As you update your models to include the addition of the Nicor business, you should keep in mind that historically more than 50% of the legacy AGL Resources EBIT came in the first quarter of the year. With the addition of Nicor, however, the first quarter percentage is likely to be lower as Illinois winters typically start earlier and end later resulting in two quarters of strong heating demand, the first and fourth quarters.
Further, our Illinois fixed price retail business - business results are not as heavily weighted toward first quarter as SouthStar’s preferred business in Georgia is. Finally, also keep in mind that cargo shipping has historically experienced its strongest results in the fourth quarter. It will take a full-year to get a better sense of actual quarterly contribution, but I did want to point out that out to you with Nicor now in the fold, our quarterly EBIT profile will be more evenly weighted than AGL’s on a stand-alone basis over the past few years.
On an operating basis, the key drivers of performance during the first quarter of 2012 was historically warm weather experienced across our service territories. Had we experienced normal 10-year average weather at our distribution and retail segments, we estimate our diluted EPS would have been higher by approximately $0.11.
There are also some temporal effects resulting from the warm weather that impact our business that will reverse themselves overtime, some in 2012 and some in 2013. Most of these effects can be seen in our lower of cost per market for LOCOM inventory adjustments, which are a function of declining natural gas prices during the period.
The LOCOM impacts were $3 million at the Retail segment, $18 million at the Wholesale segment and $1 million at the Midstream segment. I also want to remind you that year- over-year EPS dilution on a GAAP basis is affected by the increase in our weighted average shares outstanding due to the merger.
Our weighted average share count for the quarter was $117.3 million. Our interest expense was also higher, though in line with our expectations reflecting the additional debt we issued last year in connection with the merger.
From an operating segment contribution standpoint, our distribution segment continues to be the largest segment contributor to EBIT, representing approximately 70% of total operating EBIT in the first quarter of 2012. With the exception of 2011 when we had a much lower than normal contribution from our Wholesale segment, this percentage of regulated utility earnings contribution is consistent with prior years and consistent with our desire to derive approximately 70% EBIT from our regulated businesses.
Retail Operations accounted for 22% during the quarter, Wholesale Services 7% and Midstream Operations 1%. I will cover some of the major segment variances starting with our distribution business on slide four.
EBIT was up $53 million, compared to the first quarter of 2011. This includes an EBIT contribution of $51 million from Nicor Gas. As I mentioned, the warm weather had a negative effect on Nicor Gas’ EBIT, primarily because we do not have weather normalization mechanisms in Illinois. Weather in the state was 19% warmer than normal and 26% warmer than the first quarter of 2011. We believe that normal weather would have resulted in a $13 million improvement in EBIT.
You can see the month-by-month heating degree day variances for Illinois in the bottom left of the page and more detailed information for each of our service territories can be found in our 10-Q that we filed this morning. I would note that EBIT at the legacy AGL Resources utilities was up $2 million year-over-year despite the warm weather and largely due to our continued focus on effective expense management.
Turning to the Retail segment on slide five, we recorded EBIT for the first quarter of $60 million, an $8 million decline compared to the first quarter of last year. Results were down primarily due to weather in Georgia that was 32% warmer than normal, resulting in lower customer usage.
In addition, as gas prices continued their decline during the first quarter of 2012, we recorded a LOCOM adjustment that was $3 million higher than in the prior year. The addition of Nicor’s retail business reduced EBIT by $1 million during the first quarter, but we expect this loss to reverse in the summer period due to the revenue recognition accounting used for our fixed bill contracts.
While operating expenses for the segment were higher reflecting the addition of Nicor’s retail businesses, operating expenses for AGL R’s legacy retail business were flat year-over-year. For the first quarter, market share in our largest market, Georgia, was 32%, which equals our market share position at the end of last year’s first quarter and our customer count declined just slightly compared with the prior year.
You’ll find first quarter 2012 results for our Wholesale Services segment on slide six. As expected, Sequent continues to face headwinds due to challenging market fundamentals, though we are seeing some improvement versus market conditions at the end of 2011. Our EBIT contribution for the quarter was $19 million, a decline of $14 million from last year’s first quarter. The largest component of the EBIT decline came from a $21 million reduction in commercial activity versus the first quarter of 2011 due to ongoing low volatility and tight storage and transportation spreads, and John will talk about this further in his remarks.
As most of you know, due to the warmer than normal weather and continued robust supply, natural gas prices continued their decline in the first quarter and hovered around the $2 mark. This price reduction resulted in a LOCOM adjustment Sequent that was $18 million higher than the last year’s first quarter.
Offsetting the lower commercial activity and LOCOM adjustments were storage and transportation hedge gains that were $23 million higher than the prior year. And just to remind you, transportation and storage hedge gains or losses and LOCOM are non-cash items, but impact the timing of reported income.
At the end of the first quarter, the value of our storage rollout schedule was $19 million, which compares favorably to a rollout schedule of $11 million at the same time last year and $3 million at the end of 2011. The seasonal storage spread has widened over the past several months and we expect to realize about half of the benefit of our rollout schedule as we progress through the year, with the remainder expected to be realized in 2013.
Looking briefly at expenses for the first quarter in our wholesale business. They were down 12% compared to the prior year, even after adding Nicor’s Enerchange business. The decline is due mainly to staffing reductions, as well as lower incentive compensation accruals compared to the first quarter of 2011.
Now, through to slide 7. EBIT at our Midstream segment improved by $1 million in the first quarter compared to the same period in 2011. The improvement was due primarily to hedge gains, net of low comp adjustments at Central Valley Gas Storage for volumes of natural gas related to bringing the facility in to service later this year.
Briefly, the Cargo Shipping segment reported EBIT of $1 million during the first quarter of 2012. Cargo Shipping continues to face challenges due to a weak U. S. economy and little or no growth in tourism in the regions that we serve. While revenues per unit are down, TEU or 20-foot equivalent unit shipments and market share are up relative to the same period last year, reflecting tropical strong profile in the region and strong management of its business.
Some balance sheet highlights are noted on slide 8. Our long-term debt was at $3.6 billion, which reflects the additional debt issued to finance the Nicor transaction and the additional Nicor debt we assume when we close the transaction.
Interest expense was up $18 million for the quarter, compared to the same period in 2011, mainly driven by the increased debt associated with the merger. As noted on the slide, we anticipate spending regulated utility capital of about $725 million in 2012, but importantly nearly half of that is being invested in programs that have minimal or no regulatory lag associated with them. We’ll continue to look for opportunities to deploy capital in this manner across our utility franchises.
Finally, as a reminder, we provide earnings per share guidance estimates based on normal weather among other assumptions. So the historically warm weather experienced during the first quarter of 2012, may lead the EPS results for the full year that are below our previously indicated guidance range of $2.80 to $2.95 per diluted share.
Thanks for your time today. And now I’ll turn it over to John.

As Drew noted the real driver behind our first quarter performance was weather. As I mentioned at our Analyst Day in March, our Distribution, Retail and Wholesale operations can’t be affected by weather trends. And the record warmth during the first quarter certainly had an impact.
On slide 9, you can see the first quarter weather anomalies and with the exception of the Pacific Northwest, the entire country was well above the 30-year averages. In aggregate, weather was 21% warmer than normal across our jurisdictions and our Illinois service territory experienced some of the greatest anomalies. While, we have limited ability to influence the operating margin side of the equation in a single quarter, we did have the ability to control the cost side of the equation. Even though we’re still implementing some of our integration plans, we are tracking in line with our costs and synergy expectations for the year.
As you know, we do have a weather normalization mechanism at Nicor Gas, which is now our largest utility. The ten year norm, or PE degrees days in Illinois for the first quarter was actually 29.02 and the actual, that was for normal ten year and the actual was 23.58. That represented a 19% departure from normal and that impacted our EBIT - as Drew indicated earlier by $13 million.
Retail was also impacted by the warm weather, primarily in Georgia where we generate the bulk of our earnings in that segment. Mike and his team had weather hedges in place that helped to significantly offset the weather impact. But when we are seeing temperatures over 30% warmer than normal, it is difficult to mitigate the entire impact. In 117 years of recorded history, this was the warmest weather we’ve seen across the U.S. and the some impact to our earnings was $0.11 per share.
I want to take a few minutes to talk about performance of the Wholesale segment, which has actually improved sequentially over the past several quarters. Turning to slide 10. This chart really tells the story of why our Commercial activity has declined year-over-year. The bars show monthly transportation spreads between Henry Hub and Transco Zone 6 in New York, and between and Henry Hub and Texas Eastern’s M3 New York delivery point.
Sequent has historically been active in the transportation market along the east coast, due to various asset management and supply arrangements we have in place with our utilities and with third party customers. Dramatic collapse in basis resulted in far fewer commercial opportunities for Sequent. Though we did have hedges in place during the first quarter that inflated us from the full impact of the basis decline.
The warm weather and oversupply, partly from shale gas in the north-east region, were prime drivers of the year-to-year change. As we discussed in March however, we do have legacy higher cost demand charges related to transportation that will be rolling off over the next several years. So even if basis remains compressed, we should be able to improve our performance as we renegotiate certain agreements at lower rates.
There are other positive signs as well. If you turn to slide 11, you’ll see that the storage spreads have been widening over the past few months. This is due in part to the fact that the market needs an outlet for the natural gas over supply. Storage in the U.S. is now around 59% full and is running about 50% above the five year average. Given that we are seeing these levels at the very beginning of the injection season, even strong natural gas demand from power plants over the summer will have a hard time putting a dent in the storage overhang.
Sequent has been systematically entering into new storage contracts and renewed contracts are being signed at costs that are in many cases 50% of where they were just one to three years ago. As Drew mentioned our storage roll-out schedule has significantly improved since the end of the year and we are optimistic that we will be able to lock-in additional value as we move ahead in 2012.
We continue to maintain and build strong working relationships with regulatory commissions and their staff members across our service territories. These relationships, built upon consistent track records of efficient execution, have resulted in fair rate case outcomes for the company over the past several years. We are working with the Nicor team to extend these positive relationships to the Illinois Commission and we are off to a very good start including the stipulated resolution that we signed with the ICC staff earlier this year in the long-running PBR case.
As a reminder, we have reached an agreement with ICC staff to credit $64 million to customers and this amount is already reflected on our balance sheet. The Illinois Attorney General and Citizens Utility Board, CUB remain parties to the case but have not signed the stipulation agreement. Hearings were held during April and the parties restated their cases. We continue to expect a ruling from the ICC on this case later this year.
Turning to slide 12, you will find our priorities and objectives for 2012. These have not changed from our prior discussions and we continue to make solid progress in all areas. While we had just one quarter under our belt with the exception of weather, our businesses are performing well and are in-line with our expectations year to date. On behalf of the employees of AGL Resources we would like to thank each of you for your continued interest and support of our company.

My question is really on the improving storage spreads, and recognizing that the April to January spread is more of a single cycle, seasonal spread versus sort of a high cycle kind of salt dome. Is that something where that improving spread you think is going to be captured more in wholesale rather than it’s something like the open season of Golden Triangle? Or as that seasonal spread widens, is there an opportunity to see demand for the salt dome increase as well?

But you are correct that the single cycle spread improvement does benefit all storage, even the lower return storage. But because our facilities can be used for that cycle it does add value. But you are correct, additional value for salt dome is inherent in the fact that you can turn those facilities, as an example at Jefferson Island, close to nine times GTS in the range of six times, and with the low volatility that part of the value we have not seen come back as strong for those facilities. So this does help our ability to recontract, but it’s only part of the value for the salt dome facilities.
However, with Central Valley, because we have seen, in California we’ve seen lower hydro availability this year, we’ve seen additional outages on nuclear units there and we’ve seen increased plans for pipeline maintenance. There, we’re seeing higher prices and a little higher volatility that could result in opportunities for the higher turns of service. So you’re right. We’ve seen fundamentals that have helped us with our salt dome storage, just related to the simple cycle spread, we’ve seen fundamentals in California, that are heading in a positive direction, but we do need to see longer-term, a more balanced market to drive the additional value that we should be able to achieve out of the salt dome and I’ll add - I’ll look to Pete to add any additional.

We’ve seen that several years in the past, I think as for example in 2006 we saw some similar results and I think it was either 2008 or 2009. So that is an opportunity we’ve seen in the past and potentially could be an opportunity in the future.
However, what we see is we have a large amount of gas in storage, we see a large number of power plants using natural gas, running the coal plants at lower load factors, the gas plants at higher load factors. And we see the rig count materially reduced as we’ve started this year, because of the price environment. So we see that overtime, the more probable scenario is the market more back in balance where we don’t have this storage overhang. And then we get back to more normal conditions around storage.

Starting on slide 3 of our presentation, we reported 2012 GAAP earnings per share of $1.11 per diluted share for the combined enterprises, which now includes a full quarter of contribution from the legacy Nicor bu",1565,"Thanks Sarah and good afternoon everyone. Starting on slide 3 of our presentation, we reported 2012 GAAP earnings per share of $1.11 per diluted share for the combined enterprises, which now includes a full quarter of contribution from the legacy Nicor businesses. On an adjusted basis which excludes $6 million of after tax costs incurred during the quarter related to the Nicor merger, earnings per share were $1.16 which compares to $1.63 for the first quarter of 2011.
The primary year-over-year driver of our first quarter earnings is the addition of the Nicor businesses, the results of which are not reflected in the first quarter of 2001 GAAP comparisons. As you update your models to include the addition of the Nicor business, you should keep in mind that historically more than 50% of the legacy AGL Resources EBIT came in the first quarter of the year. With the addition of Nicor, however, the first quarter percentage is likely to be lower as Illinois winters typically start earlier and end later resulting in 2 quarters of strong heating demand, the first and fourth quarters.
Further, our Illinois fixed price retail business -- business results are not as heavily weighted toward first quarter as SouthStar’s preferred business in Georgia is. Finally, also keep in mind that cargo shipping has historically experienced its strongest results in the fourth quarter. It will take a full-year to get a better sense of actual quarterly contribution, but I did want to point out that out to you with Nicor now in the fold, our quarterly EBIT profile will be more evenly weighted than AGL’s on a stand-alone basis over the past few years.
On an operating basis, the key drivers of performance during the first quarter of 2012 was historically warm weather experienced across our service territories. Had we experienced normal 10-year average weather at our distribution and retail segments, we estimate our diluted EPS would have been higher by approximately $0.11.
There are also some temporal effects resulting from the warm weather that impact our business that will reverse themselves overtime, some in 2012 and some in 2013. Most of these effects can be seen in our lower of cost per market for LOCOM inventory adjustments, which are a function of declining natural gas prices during the period.
The LOCOM impacts were $3 million at the Retail segment, $18 million at the Wholesale segment and $1 million at the Midstream segment. I also want to remind you that year-over-year EPS dilution on a GAAP basis is affected by the increase in our weighted average shares outstanding due to the merger.
Our weighted average share count for the quarter was $117.3 million. Our interest expense was also higher, though in line with our expectations reflecting the additional debt we issued last year in connection with the merger.
From an operating segment contribution standpoint, our distribution segment continues to be the largest segment contributor to EBIT, representing approximately 70% of total operating EBIT in the first quarter of 2012. With the exception of 2011 when we had a much lower than normal contribution from our Wholesale segment, this percentage of regulated utility earnings contribution is consistent with prior years and consistent with our desire to derive approximately 70% EBIT from our regulated businesses.
Retail Operations accounted for 22% during the quarter, Wholesale Services 7% and Midstream Operations 1%. I will cover some of the major segment variances starting with our distribution business on Slide 4.
EBIT was up $53 million, compared to the first quarter of 2011. This includes an EBIT contribution of $51 million from Nicor Gas. As I mentioned, the warm weather had a negative effect on Nicor Gas’ EBIT, primarily because we do not have weather normalization mechanisms in Illinois. Weather in the state was 19% warmer than normal and 26% warmer than the first quarter of 2011. We believe that normal weather would have resulted in a $13 million improvement in EBIT.
You can see the month-by-month heating degree day variances for Illinois in the bottom left of the page and more detailed information for each of our service territories can be found in our 10-Q that we filed this morning. I would note that EBIT at the legacy AGL Resources utilities was up $2 million year-over-year despite the warm weather and largely due to our continued focus on effective expense management.
Turning to the Retail segment on Slide 5, we recorded EBIT for the first quarter of $60 million, an $8 million decline compared to the first quarter of last year. Results were down primarily due to weather in Georgia that was 32% warmer than normal, resulting in lower customer usage.
In addition, as gas prices continued their decline during the first quarter of 2012, we recorded a LOCOM adjustment that was $3 million higher than in the prior year. The addition of Nicor’s retail business reduced EBIT by $1 million during the first quarter, but we expect this loss to reverse in the summer period due to the revenue recognition accounting used for our fixed bill contracts.
While operating expenses for the segment were higher reflecting the addition of Nicor’s retail businesses, operating expenses for AGL R’s legacy retail business were flat year-over-year. For the first quarter, market share in our largest market, Georgia, was 32%, which equals our market share position at the end of last year’s first quarter and our customer count declined just slightly compared with the prior year.
You’ll find first quarter 2012 results for our Wholesale Services segment on Slide 6. As expected, Sequent continues to face headwinds due to challenging market fundamentals, though we are seeing some improvement versus market conditions at the end of 2011. Our EBIT contribution for the quarter was $19 million, a decline of $14 million from last year’s first quarter. The largest component of the EBIT decline came from a $21 million reduction in commercial activity versus the first quarter of 2011 due to ongoing low volatility and tight storage and transportation spreads, and John will talk about this further in his remarks.
As most of you know, due to the warmer than normal weather and continued robust supply, natural gas prices continued their decline in the first quarter and hovered around the $2 mark. This price reduction resulted in a LOCOM adjustment Sequent that was $18 million higher than the last year’s first quarter.
Offsetting the lower commercial activity and LOCOM adjustments were storage and transportation hedge gains that were $23 million higher than the prior year. And just to remind you, transportation and storage hedge gains or losses and LOCOM are non-cash items, but impact the timing of reported income.
At the end of the first quarter, the value of our storage rollout schedule was $19 million, which compares favorably to a rollout schedule of $11 million at the same time last year and $3 million at the end of 2011. The seasonal storage spread has widened over the past several months and we expect to realize about half of the benefit of our rollout schedule as we progress through the year, with the remainder expected to be realized in 2013.
Looking briefly at expenses for the first quarter in our wholesale business. They were down 12% compared to the prior year, even after adding Nicor’s Enerchange business. The decline is due mainly to staffing reductions, as well as lower incentive compensation accruals compared to the first quarter of 2011.
Now, through to Slide 7. EBIT at our Midstream segment improved by $1 million in the first quarter compared to the same period in 2011. The improvement was due primarily to hedge gains, net of low comp adjustments at Central Valley Gas Storage for volumes of natural gas related to bringing the facility into service later this year.
Briefly, the Cargo Shipping segment reported EBIT of $1 million during the first quarter of 2012. Cargo Shipping continues to face challenges due to a weak U. S. economy and little or no growth in tourism in the regions that we serve. While revenues per unit are down, TEU or 20-foot equivalent unit shipments and market share are up relative to the same period last year, reflecting tropical strong profile in the region and strong management of its business.
Some balance sheet highlights are noted on Slide 8. Our long-term debt was at $3.6 billion, which reflects the additional debt issued to finance the Nicor transaction and the additional Nicor debt we assume when we close the transaction.
Interest expense was up $18 million for the quarter, compared to the same period in 2011, mainly driven by the increased debt associated with the merger. As noted on the slide, we anticipate spending regulated utility capital of about $725 million in 2012, but importantly nearly half of that is being invested in programs that have minimal or no regulatory lag associated with them. We’ll continue to look for opportunities to deploy capital in this manner across our utility franchises.
Finally, as a reminder, we provide earnings per share guidance estimates based on normal weather among other assumptions. So the historically warm weather experienced during the first quarter of 2012, may lead the EPS results for the full year that are below our previously indicated guidance range of $2.80 to $2.95 per diluted share.
Thanks for your time today. And now I’ll turn it over to John."

As Drew noted the real driver behind our first quarter performance was weather. As I mentioned at our Analyst Day in March, our Distribution, Retail and Wholesale operations can’t be affected by weather trends. And the",948,"Thanks, Drew, and good afternoon. As Drew noted the real driver behind our first quarter performance was weather. As I mentioned at our Analyst Day in March, our Distribution, Retail and Wholesale operations can’t be affected by weather trends. And the record warmth during the first quarter certainly had an impact.
On Slide 9, you can see the first quarter weather anomalies and with the exception of the Pacific Northwest, the entire country was well above the 30-year averages. In aggregate, weather was 21% warmer than normal across our jurisdictions and our Illinois service territory experienced some of the greatest anomalies. While, we have limited ability to influence the operating margin side of the equation in a single quarter, we did have the ability to control the cost side of the equation. Even though we’re still implementing some of our integration plans, we are tracking in line with our costs and synergy expectations for the year.
As you know, we do have a weather normalization mechanism at Nicor Gas, which is now our largest utility. The 10-year normal for heating degree days in Illinois for the first quarter was actually 29.02 and the actual, that was for normal 10-year and the actual was 23.58. That represented a 19% departure from normal and that impacted our EBIT as Drew indicated earlier by $13 million.
Retail was also impacted by the warm weather, primarily in Georgia where we generate the bulk of our earnings in that segment. Mike and his team had weather hedges in place that helped to significantly offset the weather impact. But when we are seeing temperatures over 30% warmer than normal, it is difficult to mitigate the entire impact. In 117 years of recorded history, this was the warmest weather we’ve seen across the U.S. and the sum impact to our earnings was $0.11 per share.
I want to take a few minutes to talk about performance of the Wholesale segment, which has actually improved sequentially over the past several quarters. Turning to Slide 10. This chart really tells the story of why our Commercial activity has declined year-over-year. The bars show monthly transportation spreads between Henry Hub and Transco Zone 6 in New York, and between and Henry Hub and Texas Eastern’s M3 New York delivery point.
Sequent has historically been active in the transportation market along the east coast, due to various asset management and supply arrangements we have in place with our utilities and with third party customers. Dramatic collapse in basis resulted in far fewer commercial opportunities for Sequent. Though we did have hedges in place during the first quarter that insulated us from the full impact of the basis decline.
The warm weather and oversupply, partly from shale gas in the north-east region, were prime drivers of the year-to-year change. As we discussed in March however, we do have legacy higher cost demand charges related to transportation that will be rolling off over the next several years. So even if basis remains compressed, we should be able to improve our performance as we renegotiate certain agreements at lower rates.
There are other positive signs as well. If you turn to Slide 11, you’ll see that the storage spreads have been widening over the past few months. This is due in part to the fact that the market needs an outlet for the natural gas over supply. Storage in the U.S. is now around 59% full and is running about 50% above the 5-year average. Given that we are seeing these levels at the very beginning of the injection season, even strong natural gas demand from power plants over the summer will have a hard time putting a dent in the storage overhang.
Sequent has been systematically entering into new storage contracts and renewed contracts are being signed at costs that are in many cases 50% of where they were just 1 to 3 years ago. As Drew mentioned our storage roll-out schedule has significantly improved since the end of the year and we are optimistic that we will be able to lock-in additional value as we move ahead in 2012.
We continue to maintain and build strong working relationships with regulatory commissions and their staff members across our service territories. These relationships, built upon consistent track records of efficient execution, have resulted in fair rate case outcomes for the company over the past several years. We are working with the Nicor team to extend these positive relationships to the Illinois Commission and we are off to a very good start including the stipulated resolution that we signed with the ICC staff earlier this year in the long-running PBR case.
As a reminder, we have reached an agreement with ICC staff to credit $64 million to customers and this amount is already reflected on our balance sheet. The Illinois Attorney General and Citizens Utility Board, CUB remain parties to the case but have not signed the stipulation agreement. Hearings were held during April and the parties restated their cases. We continue to expect a ruling from the ICC on this case later this year.
Turning to Slide 12, you will find our priorities and objectives for 2012. These have not changed from our prior discussions and we continue to make solid progress in all areas. While we had just one quarter under our belt with the exception of weather, our businesses are performing well and are in-line with our expectations year to date. On behalf of the employees of AGL Resources we would like to thank each of you for your continued interest and support of our company.

And I very much appreciate all the color with respect to weather as well as the quarterly distribution through the year. My question is really on the improving storage spreads, and recognizing that the April to January spread is more of a single cycle, seasonal spread versus sort of a high cycle kind of salt dome. Is that something where that improving spread you think is going to be captured more in wholesale rather than it’s something like the open seasons of Golden Triangle? Or as that seasonal spread widens, is there an opportunity to see demand for the salt dome increase as well?"

But you are correct that the single cycle spread improvement does benefit all storage, even the lower return storage. But because our facilities can be used for that cycle it does add value. But you are correct, additional value for salt dome is inherent in the fact that you can turn those facilities, as an example at Jefferson Island, close to 9x or GTS in the range of 6x, and with the low volatility that part of the value we have not seen come back as strong for those facilities. So this does help our ability to recontract, but it’s only part of the value for the salt dome facilities.
However, with Central Valley, because we have seen, in California we’ve seen lower hydro availability this year, we’ve seen additional outages on nuclear units there and we’ve seen increased plans for pipeline maintenance. There, we’re seeing higher prices and a little higher volatility that could result in opportunities for the higher turns of service. So you’re right. We’ve seen fundamentals that have helped us with our salt dome storage, just related to the simple cycle spread, we’ve seen fundamentals in California, that are heading in a positive direction, but we do need to see longer-term, a more balanced market to drive the additional value that we should be able to achieve out of the salt dome and I’ll add - I’ll look to Pete to add any additional."

Predominantly the largest difference between us staff and then where AG and CUB were is on the storage cycling.

So the largest piece of that differential, staff didn’t take that position at all and as well we took the position that didn’t have that bearing, so that’s the main difference I think will go -- the ALJ will come out in July with a proposed order, so you can see what the ALJ is going to recommend to the Commission and then you will probably will be September before they actually vote on the proposed order."

Even though this is an extreme event where we see so much gas in storage, almost 60% full just after we finish the withdrawal season. And that has obviously depressed current prices more than future prices. But that’s not the first time we’ve seen that and had opportunities related to that. We’ve seen that several years in the past, I think as for example in 2006 we saw some similar results and I think it was either 2008 or 2009. So that is an opportunity we’ve seen in the past and potentially could be an opportunity in the future.
However, what we see is we have a large amount of gas in storage, we see a large number of power plants using natural gas, running the coal plants at lower load factors, the gas plants at higher load factors. And we see the rig count materially reduced as we’ve started this year, because of the price environment. So we see that over time, the more probable scenario is the market more back in balance where we don’t have this storage overhang. And then we get back to more normal conditions around storage."

And those revenues synergies although not a big part of our total number are ones that we realize would take a time period to realize and that’s what we are seeing. It won’t occur immediately, it will not be a significant impact on this year we don’t believe, but it’s something over time, we’ll start to see some of those benefits.

Starting on slide 3 of our presentation, we reported 2012 GAAP earnings per share of $1.11 per diluted share for the combined enterprises, which now includes a full quarter of contribution from the legacy Nicor bu",1565,"Thanks Sarah and good afternoon everyone. Starting on slide 3 of our presentation, we reported 2012 GAAP earnings per share of $1.11 per diluted share for the combined enterprises, which now includes a full quarter of contribution from the legacy Nicor businesses. On an adjusted basis which excludes $6 million of after tax costs incurred during the quarter related to the Nicor merger, earnings per share were $1.16 which compares to $1.63 for the first quarter of 2011.
The primary year-over-year driver of our first quarter earnings is the addition of the Nicor businesses, the results of which are not reflected in the first quarter of 2001 GAAP comparisons. As you update your models to include the addition of the Nicor business, you should keep in mind that historically more than 50% of the legacy AGL Resources EBIT came in the first quarter of the year. With the addition of Nicor, however, the first quarter percentage is likely to be lower as Illinois winters typically start earlier and end later resulting in 2 quarters of strong heating demand, the first and fourth quarters.
Further, our Illinois fixed price retail business -- business results are not as heavily weighted toward first quarter as SouthStar’s preferred business in Georgia is. Finally, also keep in mind that cargo shipping has historically experienced its strongest results in the fourth quarter. It will take a full-year to get a better sense of actual quarterly contribution, but I did want to point out that out to you with Nicor now in the fold, our quarterly EBIT profile will be more evenly weighted than AGL’s on a stand-alone basis over the past few years.
On an operating basis, the key drivers of performance during the first quarter of 2012 was historically warm weather experienced across our service territories. Had we experienced normal 10-year average weather at our distribution and retail segments, we estimate our diluted EPS would have been higher by approximately $0.11.
There are also some temporal effects resulting from the warm weather that impact our business that will reverse themselves overtime, some in 2012 and some in 2013. Most of these effects can be seen in our lower of cost per market for LOCOM inventory adjustments, which are a function of declining natural gas prices during the period.
The LOCOM impacts were $3 million at the Retail segment, $18 million at the Wholesale segment and $1 million at the Midstream segment. I also want to remind you that year-over-year EPS dilution on a GAAP basis is affected by the increase in our weighted average shares outstanding due to the merger.
Our weighted average share count for the quarter was $117.3 million. Our interest expense was also higher, though in line with our expectations reflecting the additional debt we issued last year in connection with the merger.
From an operating segment contribution standpoint, our distribution segment continues to be the largest segment contributor to EBIT, representing approximately 70% of total operating EBIT in the first quarter of 2012. With the exception of 2011 when we had a much lower than normal contribution from our Wholesale segment, this percentage of regulated utility earnings contribution is consistent with prior years and consistent with our desire to derive approximately 70% EBIT from our regulated businesses.
Retail Operations accounted for 22% during the quarter, Wholesale Services 7% and Midstream Operations 1%. I will cover some of the major segment variances starting with our distribution business on Slide 4.
EBIT was up $53 million, compared to the first quarter of 2011. This includes an EBIT contribution of $51 million from Nicor Gas. As I mentioned, the warm weather had a negative effect on Nicor Gas’ EBIT, primarily because we do not have weather normalization mechanisms in Illinois. Weather in the state was 19% warmer than normal and 26% warmer than the first quarter of 2011. We believe that normal weather would have resulted in a $13 million improvement in EBIT.
You can see the month-by-month heating degree day variances for Illinois in the bottom left of the page and more detailed information for each of our service territories can be found in our 10-Q that we filed this morning. I would note that EBIT at the legacy AGL Resources utilities was up $2 million year-over-year despite the warm weather and largely due to our continued focus on effective expense management.
Turning to the Retail segment on Slide 5, we recorded EBIT for the first quarter of $60 million, an $8 million decline compared to the first quarter of last year. Results were down primarily due to weather in Georgia that was 32% warmer than normal, resulting in lower customer usage.
In addition, as gas prices continued their decline during the first quarter of 2012, we recorded a LOCOM adjustment that was $3 million higher than in the prior year. The addition of Nicor’s retail business reduced EBIT by $1 million during the first quarter, but we expect this loss to reverse in the summer period due to the revenue recognition accounting used for our fixed bill contracts.
While operating expenses for the segment were higher reflecting the addition of Nicor’s retail businesses, operating expenses for AGL R’s legacy retail business were flat year-over-year. For the first quarter, market share in our largest market, Georgia, was 32%, which equals our market share position at the end of last year’s first quarter and our customer count declined just slightly compared with the prior year.
You’ll find first quarter 2012 results for our Wholesale Services segment on Slide 6. As expected, Sequent continues to face headwinds due to challenging market fundamentals, though we are seeing some improvement versus market conditions at the end of 2011. Our EBIT contribution for the quarter was $19 million, a decline of $14 million from last year’s first quarter. The largest component of the EBIT decline came from a $21 million reduction in commercial activity versus the first quarter of 2011 due to ongoing low volatility and tight storage and transportation spreads, and John will talk about this further in his remarks.
As most of you know, due to the warmer than normal weather and continued robust supply, natural gas prices continued their decline in the first quarter and hovered around the $2 mark. This price reduction resulted in a LOCOM adjustment Sequent that was $18 million higher than the last year’s first quarter.
Offsetting the lower commercial activity and LOCOM adjustments were storage and transportation hedge gains that were $23 million higher than the prior year. And just to remind you, transportation and storage hedge gains or losses and LOCOM are non-cash items, but impact the timing of reported income.
At the end of the first quarter, the value of our storage rollout schedule was $19 million, which compares favorably to a rollout schedule of $11 million at the same time last year and $3 million at the end of 2011. The seasonal storage spread has widened over the past several months and we expect to realize about half of the benefit of our rollout schedule as we progress through the year, with the remainder expected to be realized in 2013.
Looking briefly at expenses for the first quarter in our wholesale business. They were down 12% compared to the prior year, even after adding Nicor’s Enerchange business. The decline is due mainly to staffing reductions, as well as lower incentive compensation accruals compared to the first quarter of 2011.
Now, through to Slide 7. EBIT at our Midstream segment improved by $1 million in the first quarter compared to the same period in 2011. The improvement was due primarily to hedge gains, net of low comp adjustments at Central Valley Gas Storage for volumes of natural gas related to bringing the facility into service later this year.
Briefly, the Cargo Shipping segment reported EBIT of $1 million during the first quarter of 2012. Cargo Shipping continues to face challenges due to a weak U. S. economy and little or no growth in tourism in the regions that we serve. While revenues per unit are down, TEU or 20-foot equivalent unit shipments and market share are up relative to the same period last year, reflecting tropical strong profile in the region and strong management of its business.
Some balance sheet highlights are noted on Slide 8. Our long-term debt was at $3.6 billion, which reflects the additional debt issued to finance the Nicor transaction and the additional Nicor debt we assume when we close the transaction.
Interest expense was up $18 million for the quarter, compared to the same period in 2011, mainly driven by the increased debt associated with the merger. As noted on the slide, we anticipate spending regulated utility capital of about $725 million in 2012, but importantly nearly half of that is being invested in programs that have minimal or no regulatory lag associated with them. We’ll continue to look for opportunities to deploy capital in this manner across our utility franchises.
Finally, as a reminder, we provide earnings per share guidance estimates based on normal weather among other assumptions. So the historically warm weather experienced during the first quarter of 2012, may lead the EPS results for the full year that are below our previously indicated guidance range of $2.80 to $2.95 per diluted share.
Thanks for your time today. And now I’ll turn it over to John."

As Drew noted the real driver behind our first quarter performance was weather. As I mentioned at our Analyst Day in March, our Distribution, Retail and Wholesale operations can’t be affected by weather trends. And the",948,"Thanks, Drew, and good afternoon. As Drew noted the real driver behind our first quarter performance was weather. As I mentioned at our Analyst Day in March, our Distribution, Retail and Wholesale operations can’t be affected by weather trends. And the record warmth during the first quarter certainly had an impact.
On Slide 9, you can see the first quarter weather anomalies and with the exception of the Pacific Northwest, the entire country was well above the 30-year averages. In aggregate, weather was 21% warmer than normal across our jurisdictions and our Illinois service territory experienced some of the greatest anomalies. While, we have limited ability to influence the operating margin side of the equation in a single quarter, we did have the ability to control the cost side of the equation. Even though we’re still implementing some of our integration plans, we are tracking in line with our costs and synergy expectations for the year.
As you know, we do have a weather normalization mechanism at Nicor Gas, which is now our largest utility. The 10-year normal for heating degree days in Illinois for the first quarter was actually 29.02 and the actual, that was for normal 10-year and the actual was 23.58. That represented a 19% departure from normal and that impacted our EBIT as Drew indicated earlier by $13 million.
Retail was also impacted by the warm weather, primarily in Georgia where we generate the bulk of our earnings in that segment. Mike and his team had weather hedges in place that helped to significantly offset the weather impact. But when we are seeing temperatures over 30% warmer than normal, it is difficult to mitigate the entire impact. In 117 years of recorded history, this was the warmest weather we’ve seen across the U.S. and the sum impact to our earnings was $0.11 per share.
I want to take a few minutes to talk about performance of the Wholesale segment, which has actually improved sequentially over the past several quarters. Turning to Slide 10. This chart really tells the story of why our Commercial activity has declined year-over-year. The bars show monthly transportation spreads between Henry Hub and Transco Zone 6 in New York, and between and Henry Hub and Texas Eastern’s M3 New York delivery point.
Sequent has historically been active in the transportation market along the east coast, due to various asset management and supply arrangements we have in place with our utilities and with third party customers. Dramatic collapse in basis resulted in far fewer commercial opportunities for Sequent. Though we did have hedges in place during the first quarter that insulated us from the full impact of the basis decline.
The warm weather and oversupply, partly from shale gas in the north-east region, were prime drivers of the year-to-year change. As we discussed in March however, we do have legacy higher cost demand charges related to transportation that will be rolling off over the next several years. So even if basis remains compressed, we should be able to improve our performance as we renegotiate certain agreements at lower rates.
There are other positive signs as well. If you turn to Slide 11, you’ll see that the storage spreads have been widening over the past few months. This is due in part to the fact that the market needs an outlet for the natural gas over supply. Storage in the U.S. is now around 59% full and is running about 50% above the 5-year average. Given that we are seeing these levels at the very beginning of the injection season, even strong natural gas demand from power plants over the summer will have a hard time putting a dent in the storage overhang.
Sequent has been systematically entering into new storage contracts and renewed contracts are being signed at costs that are in many cases 50% of where they were just 1 to 3 years ago. As Drew mentioned our storage roll-out schedule has significantly improved since the end of the year and we are optimistic that we will be able to lock-in additional value as we move ahead in 2012.
We continue to maintain and build strong working relationships with regulatory commissions and their staff members across our service territories. These relationships, built upon consistent track records of efficient execution, have resulted in fair rate case outcomes for the company over the past several years. We are working with the Nicor team to extend these positive relationships to the Illinois Commission and we are off to a very good start including the stipulated resolution that we signed with the ICC staff earlier this year in the long-running PBR case.
As a reminder, we have reached an agreement with ICC staff to credit $64 million to customers and this amount is already reflected on our balance sheet. The Illinois Attorney General and Citizens Utility Board, CUB remain parties to the case but have not signed the stipulation agreement. Hearings were held during April and the parties restated their cases. We continue to expect a ruling from the ICC on this case later this year.
Turning to Slide 12, you will find our priorities and objectives for 2012. These have not changed from our prior discussions and we continue to make solid progress in all areas. While we had just one quarter under our belt with the exception of weather, our businesses are performing well and are in-line with our expectations year to date. On behalf of the employees of AGL Resources we would like to thank each of you for your continued interest and support of our company.

But you are correct that the single cycle spread improvement does benefit all storage, even the lower return storage. But because our facilities can be used for that cycle it does add value. But you are correct, additional value for salt dome is inherent in the fact that you can turn those facilities, as an example at Jefferson Island, close to 9x or GTS in the range of 6x, and with the low volatility that part of the value we have not seen come back as strong for those facilities. So this does help our ability to recontract, but it’s only part of the value for the salt dome facilities.
However, with Central Valley, because we have seen, in California we’ve seen lower hydro availability this year, we’ve seen additional outages on nuclear units there and we’ve seen increased plans for pipeline maintenance. There, we’re seeing higher prices and a little higher volatility that could result in opportunities for the higher turns of service. So you’re right. We’ve seen fundamentals that have helped us with our salt dome storage, just related to the simple cycle spread, we’ve seen fundamentals in California, that are heading in a positive direction, but we do need to see longer-term, a more balanced market to drive the additional value that we should be able to achieve out of the salt dome and I’ll add - I’ll look to Pete to add any additional."

We’ve seen that several years in the past, I think as for example in 2006 we saw some similar results and I think it was either 2008 or 2009. So that is an opportunity we’ve seen in the past and potentially could be an opportunity in the future.
However, what we see is we have a large amount of gas in storage, we see a large number of power plants using natural gas, running the coal plants at lower load factors, the gas plants at higher load factors. And we see the rig count materially reduced as we’ve started this year, because of the price environment. So we see that over time, the more probable scenario is the market more back in balance where we don’t have this storage overhang. And then we get back to more normal conditions around storage."

Good morning, everyone.Starting on slide three of our presentation, we reported GAAP earnings per diluted share for the second quarter of $0.28 for the combined enterprise, including the legacy Nicor Gas businesses",1034,"Thanks, Steve. Congratulations, Sarah. Good morning, everyone.
Starting on slide three of our presentation, we reported GAAP earnings per diluted share for the second quarter of $0.28 for the combined enterprise, including the legacy Nicor Gas businesses.
On an adjusted basis, which excludes $2 million of after-tax costs incurred during the quarter related to the Nicor merger, diluted earnings per share were $0.30 which compares to $0.33 in the second quarter of 2011.
The primary year-over-year driver of our second quarter earnings is the addition of the Nicor businesses, the results of which are not reflected in the second quarter of 2011 GAAP comparisons. Our business performed well during the quarter, but did reflect a $0.02 per share negative impact during the quarter due to continued warmer than normal weather.
Turning briefly to slide four, you can see that our year-to-date financial results for the first two quarters. Diluted EPS adjusted for Nicor expenses was $1.47, down from $1.96 for the same period last year. The primary reason for the declines are again, the unprecedented warmer than normal weather which had a $0.13 impact on our earnings results year-to-date.
Weaker results at the wholesale business and increases in the number of shares outstanding following the completion of merger, these were partially offset by the addition of the Nicor businesses.
On slide five, you can see that approximately 77% of the total consolidated operating EBIT for the first six-month of 2012 was generated by our distribution operations segment. Retail operations account for 19% year-to-date, wholesale services 3% and mid stream moderations, 1%.
I will cover some of the major segment variances starting with out distribution business on slide six. EBIT was $26 million, compared to the second quarter of 2011. This includes an EBIT contribution of $20 million from Nicor Gas. The warm weather had a negative EBIT effect of approximately $4 million during the quarter built across our distribution business.
We are starting to see benefits from our shared service model accrue across our entire business and one of the key metrics that we used to gauge this is O&M expense per customer. For the first six months of 2012, O&M per customer was $69, down from $75 per customer for the same period in 2011.
These numbers are adjusted to exclude rider investment programs where there is a corresponding revenue offset to associated expense. We are also seeing additional improvement for our non-regulated businesses.
Turning to the retail segment on slide seven, we reported EBIT for the second quarter of $14 million, a $13 million increase compared to the second quarter of last year. This large increase mainly reflects the addition of Nicor's retail business to our portfolio. Those businesses are less seasonal than the SouthStar business that historically was the company's entire retail operating segment.
You will find second quarter 2012 results for our wholesale service segment on slide eight. EBIT was down $4 million year-over-year for the second quarter. The largest component of the EBIT decline came from a $6 million reduction in commercial activity versus the second quarter of 2011 due to ongoing low volatility in the storage and transportation spreads.
We also recorded transportation hedge gains of $18 million during the quarter, a $14 million increase over the last year and storage hedge losses of $9 million as compared to $4 million of storage hedge gains last year, a $13 million negative year-over-year impact.
These two factors played a role in our expectations for the remainder of the year for the wholesale segment, and John will talk in greater detail about these items in just a few minutes.
As you can see, we have a significant storage rollout schedule of $47 million that we expect to recognize in operating revenues about equally between the remainder of 2012 to 2013. This is an increase of $28 million over the rollout scheduled at the end of the first quarter of 2012 and $36 million improvement, as compared to this time last year.
Now let's move to slide nine. EBIT of our midstream segment was $2 million during the second quarter of 2012, flat compared to the prior year.
As a reminder, we re-contracted 3 Bcf of capacity at Jefferson Island starting April 1. Due to the continued challenging market conditions and pressure on storage pricing disrupt our average rate for the facility from $0.19 to $0.14. You can see the blended rates for Golden Triangle and Central Valley on the chart at the bottom right side of the page.
Though we have seen a slight improvement in storage rates for shorter duration contracts, we continue to evaluate options for locking in additional capacity in Central Valley and Golden Triangle Cavern 2.
Briefly, the cargo shipping segment reported an EBIT loss of $1 million during the second quarter of 2012. Our revenues per unit were down. TEU or 20-foot equivalent unit shipments and market share are up relative to the same period last year, reflecting tropical strong profile in the region and efficient management of its business.
We were breakeven for the year-to-date period on an EBIT basis for that segment as a result of higher depreciation and amortization expense resulting from purchase accounting fair value adjustments that were required as part of the merger.
Some balance sheet highlights are noted on slide 10. Our long-term debt was at $3.3 billion, which reflects the additional debt issued to finance the Nicor transaction and additional Nicor debt we assumed upon closing the transaction.
Those factors were the main drivers of the year-over-year increase in interest expense. We are generally on plan for capital expenditures this year with a significant portion of our utility capital investment dedicated to rider or surcharge programs with minimum regulatory lag. We continue to look for similar opportunities to deploy capital of property utility franchises.
Finally, as a reminder we provide earnings per share guidance estimated based on normal weather among other assumptions. As noted in the earnings release on a reported EPS basis, our earnings could fall below our guidance range, which is $2.80 to $2.95 per share, as a result of weather and tax year-to-date.
Thanks for your time. I will turn the call over to John.

As Drew noted, we reported solid operating results during the second quarter despite some continued impact of warmer than normal weather into the early part of the second quarter.
On slide 11, you can see the weather anomalies that have affected our utilities year-to-date with Illinois and Georgia highlighted, as these are the two service territories where we have the most weather exposure. With the unprecedented warm weather that impacted us in the first quarter and the lesser negative weather impact into the second quarter, we have a negative year-to-date weather impact of $0.13 per share. We remain focused on controlling expenses across the corporation and we are seeing positive trends in that regard in several of our businesses.
Moving to slide 12, let me briefly update you on a regulatory filing that we made in New Jersey last week related to infrastructure improvements at Elizabethtown Gas. As you may recall, our utility infrastructure enhancement or UIE program is set to expire at the end of October.
We have requested approval for a new accelerated capital investment plan called AIR, accelerated infrastructure replacement, where we propose to spend up to $135 million over a five-year period beginning in November of this year. Under the proposed plan, we would replace nearly 150 miles of pipe that is predominantly aging cast iron.
Several of peers at New Jersey have requested infrastructure programs of similar duration. However, it is uncertain at this time how the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities will view our proposal.
The program we have proposed is consistent with our commitment to prudently invest capital on infrastructure programs that have minimum regulatory lag and enhance the reliability and integrity of our distribution system.
I want to take a few minutes to talk about the performance of the wholesale segment. Turning to slides 13 and 14, you can see historical look at our storage rollout schedule along with the chart of current and historic storage spreads, reflecting the year-over-year wider storage spreads, in part due to the market needing an outlet for natural gas supply.
We have continued to improve the locked-in value of our storage rollout by capturing the year-over-year higher storage spreads by injecting gas and by rolling our storage positions to later periods. The storage hedge losses we experienced in the second quarter added to the locked in storage rollout value at the end of the quarter.
As Drew noted, our storage rollout value has improved to $47 million on about 55 Bcf of natural gas inventory. Currently, we expect to recognize about half of these operating revenues in 2012, with the remainder expected to be recognized in 2013. As you can see on the chart, this is one of the strongest rollout schedules we have had in Sequent's history.
In our 10-Q filed this morning we have provided information about the impact of forward natural gas price changes on our storage portfolio. Based on Sequent's current projection of year-end storage positions at December 31, 2012 of about 25 Bcf, a $1 increase in the 2013 forward NYMEX price could result in a $24 million reduction to Sequent's reported operating revenues for this year, but would increase the expected operating revenues to be realized in 2013 by a corresponding amount.
Conversely, a $1 decrease in the 2013 forward NYMEX price could result in $24 million increase to Sequent's reported operating revenues for this year. However, additional lower cost or market inventory valuation adjustments could potentially offset a portion of the positive impact.
I do want to point out that the situation with our transportation hedges is a bit different, however. Due to narrowing basis spreads we accelerated transportation hedge gains of approximately $20 million into the first half of this year, primarily from the second half of 2012 through 2013. As a result, our storage hedge gains were strong on a year-over-year basis, but the portfolio is likely to be challenged for the remainder of the year unless basis widens.
On the whole, Pete and his team have done an excellent job of managing the portfolio to create as much economic value as possible in a challenging market environment. They will continue to monitor market conditions and look for opportunities that capture additional margin.
With respect to our earnings guidance for 2012, as Drew noted, the weather impact we have seen year-to-date could move us below the low end of our guidance range for the year. Other than the weather impact, we see performance in the rest of our businesses that is in line with our expectations.
This is due to a number of positive indicators we have seen through the first half of the year including cost containment and managing our controllable expenses, achieving our merger savings targets and generating incremental economic value in our wholesale business.
Turning to slide 15, you will find our priorities and objectives for 2012. These have not changed from our prior discussion and we continue to make solid progress in all areas. Again, with the exceptional weather we are demonstrating solid results across our business units and we have reason for optimism as we look ahead to the remainder of 2012.
On behalf of the employees of AGL resources we want to thank each of you for your continued interest in and support of the Company.
Operator, I will turn the call back over to you to begin the Q&A session.

I don't know if Pete is online, but I understand that we have this really anomalous all-time record storage position that just cratered short-term gas prices and as we start to get our arms around that problem, the seasonal spreads and an anomalous condition really widened.
But the question always was, is this a reflection of any recurring opportunities that Sequent could have going forward or is it just kind of a one-time shot because we are still seeing going out of ways ongoing flat volatility compared to historical low regional basis differentials and really not significant seasonal basis differentials outside of what was just discussed.

You talk about a one-time event. We have actually seen this same type situation several years in the past where we have had the spread move out.
You are right, it doesn't move out in future years. It pretty much moves out right in front of you in the current year as you see high storage levels and the need to use storage to absorb some of the supply. Now, this year pushed out a little harder than many years in the past; but back in, I think it was 2008 or 2009, back in 2006, we saw similar situations.
That's kind of the counterbalance to our storage position compared to just having a warm summer weather or cold winter weather where the storage is more valuable just to balance the market. So, it's kind of the opposite.
So, we see the opportunity on either side and we have seen this opportunity in each of those areas multiple times in the past. But you are right; the forward curve usually doesn't pick that value up until you actually get to where you see a more immediate storage overhang or the opposite could occur if you see shortage of storage and volatility for that reason, and Pete has a more direct exposure to that.

That was great. The way I would just add to John's comment is that we have seen this every few years when you come out of a very warm winter and the way we look at it going into this winter if we have another warm winter, we could see even more extreme spreads next year due to the severe overhang of natural gas supply.
If we have a very cold winter, we are obviously hedged on that storage, we will take that out of the ground and realize those earnings and then our transport portfolio would benefit at that time. So, in a way, there is a little bit of an internal hedge in that. If there is a warm winter, we are going to benefit again next year with widening spreads and if there is a cold winter, we will benefit on transport.
The only other thing I will add is, this summer we are seeing the heat were dispersed throughout the country than last year where we saw it mainly in Oklahoma and Texas, and that storage is being able to return a little bit more this year as well, which isn't a rollout schedule issue that will show up more in our day-to-day cash values, but we are seeing some benefits this year relative to prior years as well.

The surprise has been that that's been even higher than what many of us and most people in the industry expected and on top of that the weather has been considerably hotter, which further added to that. So we have seen the storage spreads narrow more than what we had anticipated up to this point.
At the same time, we are getting ready to head into a time period where power generation is not as significant part of the load as we get to later September and October. So there are projections that say it could fill up again rather quickly.
Especially, since if you look at production, the other thing that's happened is production, even though the rig count has come off significantly, production hasn't fallen as quickly as some people had predicted. So that's a long way of saying, we really don't know, but there are dynamics where even though we have narrowed that storage overhang so far through this summer that it's possible we still could see pretty tight storage at the end of the year.

252517,213811803,336892,"AGL Resources Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Aug 01, 2012",2012-08-01,"Earnings Calls","Southern Company Gas","Executives","Thanks, Steve. Congratulations, Sarah. Good morning, everyone.Starting on slide 3 of our presentation, we reported GAAP earnings per diluted share for the second quarter of $0.28 for the combined enterprise, including the legacy Nicor Gas businesses.O",1033,"Thanks, Steve. Congratulations, Sarah. Good morning, everyone.
Starting on slide 3 of our presentation, we reported GAAP earnings per diluted share for the second quarter of $0.28 for the combined enterprise, including the legacy Nicor Gas businesses.
On an adjusted basis, which excludes $2 million of after-tax costs incurred during the quarter related to the Nicor merger, diluted earnings per share were $0.30 which compares to $0.33 in the second quarter of 2011.
The primary year-over-year driver of our second quarter earnings is the addition of the Nicor businesses, the results of which are not reflected in the second quarter of 2011 GAAP comparisons. Our business performed well during the quarter, but did reflect a $0.02 per share negative impact during the quarter due to continued warmer-than-normal weather.
Turning briefly to Slide 4, you can see that our year-to-date financial results for the first 2 quarters. Diluted EPS adjusted for Nicor expenses was $1.47, down from $1.96 for the same period last year. The primary reason for the declines are again, the unprecedented warmer-than normal-weather which had a $0.13 impact on our earnings results year-to-date.
Weaker results at the wholesale business and increases in the number of shares outstanding following the completion of merger, these were partially offset by the addition of the Nicor businesses.
On Slide 5, you can see that approximately 77% of the total consolidated operating EBIT for the first 6 months of 2012 was generated by our distribution operations segment. Retail operations accounted for 19% year-to-date, wholesale services, 3% and mid stream moderations, 1%.
I will cover some of the major segment variances starting with our distribution business on Slide 6. EBIT was up $26 million, compared to the second quarter of 2011. This includes an EBIT contribution of $20 million from Nicor Gas. The warm weather had a negative EBIT effect of approximately $4 million during the quarter across our distribution businesses.
We are starting to see benefits from our shared service model accrue across our entire business and one of the key metrics that we used to gauge this is O&M expense per customer. For the first 6 months of 2012, O&M per customer was $69, down from $75 per customer for the same period in 2011.
These numbers are adjusted to exclude rider investment programs where there is a corresponding revenue offset to associated expense. We are also seeing additional improvement for our non-regulated businesses.
Turning to the retail segment on Slide 7, we reported EBIT for the second quarter of $14 million, a $13 million increase compared to the second quarter of last year. This large increase mainly reflects the addition of Nicor's retail business to our portfolio. Those businesses are less seasonal than the SouthStar business that historically was the company's entire retail operating segment.
You will find second quarter 2012 results for our wholesale service segment on Slide 8. EBIT was down $4 million year-over-year for the second quarter. The largest component of the EBIT decline came from a $6 million reduction in commercial activity versus the second quarter of 2011 due to ongoing low volatility in the storage and transportation spreads.
We also recorded transportation hedge gains of $18 million during the quarter, a $14 million increase over the last year and storage hedge losses of $9 million as compared to $4 million of storage hedge gains last year, a $13 million negative year-over-year impact.
These 2 factors play a role in our expectations for the remainder of the year for the wholesale segment, and John will talk in greater detail about these items in just a few minutes.
As you can see, we have a significant storage rollout schedule of $47 million that we expect to recognize in operating revenues about equally between the remainder of 2012 and 2013. This is an increase of $28 million over the rollout scheduled at the end of the first quarter of 2012 and a $36 million improvement, as compared to this time last year.
Now let's move to Slide 9. EBIT at our midstream segment was $2 million during the second quarter of 2012, flat compared to the prior year.
As a reminder, we re-contracted 3 Bcf of capacity at Jefferson Island starting April 1. Due to the continued challenging market conditions and pressure on storage pricing, this dropped our average rate for the facility from $0.19 to $0.14. You can see the blended rates for Golden Triangle and Central Valley on the chart at the bottom right side of the page.
Though we have seen a slight improvement in storage rates for shorter duration contracts, we continue to evaluate options for locking in additional capacity at Central Valley and Golden Triangle Cavern 2.
Briefly, the cargo shipping segment reported an EBIT loss of $1 million during the second quarter of 2012. While revenues per unit were down, TEU, or 20-foot equivalent unit, shipments and market share are up relative to the same period last year, reflecting tropical strong profile in the region and efficient management of its business.
We were breakeven for the year-to-date period on an EBIT basis for that segment as a result of higher depreciation and amortization expense resulting from purchase accounting fair value adjustments that were required as part of the merger.
Some balance sheet highlights are noted on Slide 10. Our long-term debt was at $3.3 billion, which reflects the additional debt issued to finance the Nicor transaction and additional Nicor debt we assumed upon closing the transaction.
Those factors were the main drivers of the year-over-year increase in interest expense. We are generally on plan for capital expenditures this year with a significant portion of our utility capital investment dedicated to rider or surcharge programs with minimal regulatory lag. We continue to look for similar opportunities to deploy capital of property utility franchises.
Finally, as a reminder we provide earnings per share guidance estimated based on normal weather among other assumptions. As noted in the earnings release on a reported EPS basis, our earnings could fall below our guidance range, which is $2.80 to $2.95 per share, as a result of weather and tax year-to-date.
Thanks for your time. I will turn the call over to John."

As Drew noted, we reported solid operating results during the second quarter despite some continued impact of warmer-than-normal weather into the early part of the second quarter.On Slide 11, you can see the weather an",907,"Thank you, Drew, and good morning. As Drew noted, we reported solid operating results during the second quarter despite some continued impact of warmer-than-normal weather into the early part of the second quarter.
On Slide 11, you can see the weather anomalies that have affected our utilities year-to-date with Illinois and Georgia highlighted, as these are the 2 service territories where we have the most weather exposure. With the unprecedented warm weather that impacted us in the first quarter and the lesser negative weather impact into the second quarter, we have a negative year-to-date weather impact of $0.13 per share. We remain focused on controlling expenses across the corporation, and we are seeing positive trends in that regard in several of our businesses.
Moving to Slide 12, let me briefly update you on a regulatory filing that we made in New Jersey last week related to infrastructure improvements at Elizabethtown Gas. As you may recall, our utility infrastructure enhancement, or UIE program, is set to expire at the end of October.  We have requested approval for a new accelerated capital investment plan called AIR, accelerated infrastructure replacement, where we propose to spend up to $135 million over a 5-year period beginning in November of this year. Under the proposed plan, we would replace nearly 150 miles of pipe that is predominantly aging cast iron.
Several of peers in New Jersey have requested infrastructure programs of similar duration. However, it is uncertain at this time how the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities will view our proposal.
The program we have proposed is consistent with our commitment to prudently invest capital on infrastructure programs that have minimum regulatory lag and enhance the reliability and integrity of our distribution system.
I want to take a few minutes to talk about the performance of the wholesale segment. Turning to Slides 13 and 14, you can see an historical look at our storage rollout schedule along with the chart of current and historic storage spreads, reflecting the year-over-year wider storage spreads, in part due to the market needing an outlet for natural gas supply.
We have continued to improve the locked-in value of our storage rollout by capturing the year-over-year higher storage spreads by injecting gas and by rolling our storage positions to later periods. The storage hedge losses we experienced in the second quarter added to the locked in storage rollout value at the end of the quarter.
As Drew noted, our storage rollout value has improved to $47 million on about 55 Bcf of natural gas inventory. Currently, we expect to recognize about half of these operating revenues in 2012, with the remainder expected to be recognized in 2013. As you can see on the chart, this is one of the strongest rollout schedules we have had in Sequent's history.
In our 10-Q filed this morning we have provided information about the impact of forward natural gas price changes on our storage portfolio. Based on Sequent's current projection of year-end storage positions at December 31, 2012 of about 25 Bcf, a $1 increase in the 2013 forward NYMEX price could result in a $24 million reduction to Sequent's reported operating revenues for this year, but would increase the expected operating revenues to be realized in 2013 by a corresponding amount.
Conversely, a $1 decrease in the 2013 forward NYMEX price could result in $24 million increase to Sequent's reported operating revenues for this year. However, additional lower cost or market inventory valuation adjustments could potentially offset a portion of the positive impact.
I do want to point out that the situation with our transportation hedges is a bit different, however. Due to narrowing basis spreads, we accelerated transportation hedge gains of approximately $20 million into the first half of this year, primarily from the second half of 2012 through 2013. As a result, our storage hedge gains were strong on a year-over-year basis, but the portfolio is likely to be challenged for the remainder of the year unless basis widens.
On the whole, Pete and his team have done an excellent job of managing the portfolio to create as much economic value as possible in a challenging market environment. They will continue to monitor market conditions and look for opportunities that capture additional margin.
With respect to our earnings guidance for 2012, as Drew noted, the weather impact we have seen year-to-date could move us below the low end of our guidance range for the year. Other than the weather impact, we see performance in the rest of our businesses that is in line with our expectations.  This is due to a number of positive indicators we have seen through the first half of the year including cost containment and managing our controllable expenses, achieving our merger savings targets and generating incremental economic value in our wholesale business.
Turning to Slide 15, you will find our priorities and objectives for 2012. These have not changed from our prior discussion and we continue to make solid progress in all areas. Again, with the exception of weather, we are demonstrating solid results across our business units and we have reason for optimism as we look ahead to the remainder of 2012.
On behalf of the employees of AGL resources, we want to thank each of you for your continued interest in and support of the Company.

I don't know if Pete's on the line, but I understand that we have this really anomalous all-time record storage position that just cratered short-term gas prices and as we started to get our arms around that problem, the seasonal spreads and an anomalous condition really widened.  But the question always was, is this a reflection of any recurring opportunities that Sequent could have going forward? Or is it just kind of a one-time shot because we are still seeing, going out a ways, ongoing flat volatility compared to historical low regional basis differentials and really not significant seasonal basis differentials outside of what was just discussed."

We have actually seen this same type situation several years in the past where we have had the spread move out. And  you are right, it doesn't move out in future years. It pretty much moves out right in front of you in the current year as you see high storage levels and the need to use storage to absorb some of the supply. Now, this year pushed that a little harder than many years in the past; but back in, I think it was 2008 or 2009, back in 2006, we saw similar situations.  That's kind of the counterbalance to our storage position compared to just having a warm summer weather or cold winter weather where the storage is more valuable just to balance the market. So, it's kind of the opposite.  So, we see the opportunity on either side and we have seen this opportunity in each of those areas multiple times in the past. But you are right; the forward curve usually doesn't pick that value up until you actually get to where you see a more immediate storage overhang or the opposite could occur if you see shortage of storage and volatility for that reason, and Pete has a more direct exposure to that."

The way I would just add to John's comment is that we have seen this every few years when it is -- when you come out of a very warm winter and the way we look at it going into this winter if we have another warm winter, we could see even more extreme spreads next year due to the severe overhang of natural gas supply.  If we have a very cold winter, we are obviously hedged on that storage, we will take that out of the ground and realize those earnings and then our transport portfolio would benefit at that time. So, in a way, there is a little bit of an internal hedge in that. If there is a warm winter, we are going to benefit again next year with widening spreads and if there is a cold winter, we will benefit on transport.  The only other thing I will add is, this summer we are seeing the heat more dispersed throughout the country than last year where we saw it mainly in Oklahoma and Texas, and that storage is being able to return a little bit more this year as well, which isn't a rollout schedule issue. That will show up more in our day-to-day cash values, but we are seeing some benefits this year relative to prior years as well."

When you look at our employees out, you're actually taking care of the pipeline, taking care of our employees, those numbers are staying relatively flat.  So, we are reducing costs where we can through the efficiencies of shared services and some other areas and we are in line at this point, as Drew indicated, it's a good indicator that we are in line with what we talked about with the merger savings that we targeted.  Really moving forward though, and Drew's numbers represented a half year. So, you can kind of double that number and say that's kind of the run rate we expect, close to the run rate we expect to be on.  Really when you get past that, our real goal is to keep that in line with that or more flat to that so that, that will allow us to keep costs for our customers low and allow us to achieve allowed returns between rate cases.  So, not a big expectation of negative trend on that now that we have got it down to the level we want it.

So that’s still the one factor. We could have a positive or a negative from the weather in the fourth quarter, and we always point that out when we are talking about where we are relative to our guidance.

However, when you look at the Sequent business, you see the strong rollout schedule and you see the fact that we have seen so far this summer, some additional hot weather, other than certainly what was projected and across more of the country.  At the same time, we have got these transportation costs where we have had earlier hedge gain that we have got to cover now these transportation costs. So, we see in total with our wholesale business positive so far this year and the potential for positive the remaining part of the year.

I think  the surprise has been that that's been even higher than what many of us and most people in the industry expected and on top of that, the weather has been considerably hotter, which further added to that. So we have seen the storage spreads narrow more than what we had anticipated up to this point.  At the same time, we are getting ready to head into a time period where power generation is not as significant part of the load as we get to later September and October. So there are projections that say it could fill up again rather quickly especially since, if you look at production, the other thing that's happened is production, even though the rig count has come off significantly, production hasn't fallen as quickly as some people had predicted. So I think that's a long way of saying, we really don't know, but there are dynamics where even though we have narrowed that storage overhang, so far through this summer that it's possible we still could see pretty tight storage at the end of the year."

So the wild card is, as you hit September and October, whether or not that rate of build that has slowed, whether it will significantly accelerate or not and then you have got the wild card that’s regional.  You have issues in Western Canada where you are almost full already in storage and you are starting to see some bottlenecking of supplies out there versus the Gulf Coast.

Good morning, everyone.Starting on slide 3 of our presentation, we reported GAAP earnings per diluted share for the second quarter of $0.28 for the combined enterprise, including the legacy Nicor Gas businesses.O",1033,"Thanks, Steve. Congratulations, Sarah. Good morning, everyone.
Starting on slide 3 of our presentation, we reported GAAP earnings per diluted share for the second quarter of $0.28 for the combined enterprise, including the legacy Nicor Gas businesses.
On an adjusted basis, which excludes $2 million of after-tax costs incurred during the quarter related to the Nicor merger, diluted earnings per share were $0.30 which compares to $0.33 in the second quarter of 2011.
The primary year-over-year driver of our second quarter earnings is the addition of the Nicor businesses, the results of which are not reflected in the second quarter of 2011 GAAP comparisons. Our business performed well during the quarter, but did reflect a $0.02 per share negative impact during the quarter due to continued warmer-than-normal weather.
Turning briefly to Slide 4, you can see that our year-to-date financial results for the first 2 quarters. Diluted EPS adjusted for Nicor expenses was $1.47, down from $1.96 for the same period last year. The primary reason for the declines are again, the unprecedented warmer-than normal-weather which had a $0.13 impact on our earnings results year-to-date.
Weaker results at the wholesale business and increases in the number of shares outstanding following the completion of merger, these were partially offset by the addition of the Nicor businesses.
On Slide 5, you can see that approximately 77% of the total consolidated operating EBIT for the first 6 months of 2012 was generated by our distribution operations segment. Retail operations accounted for 19% year-to-date, wholesale services, 3% and mid stream moderations, 1%.
I will cover some of the major segment variances starting with our distribution business on Slide 6. EBIT was up $26 million, compared to the second quarter of 2011. This includes an EBIT contribution of $20 million from Nicor Gas. The warm weather had a negative EBIT effect of approximately $4 million during the quarter across our distribution businesses.
We are starting to see benefits from our shared service model accrue across our entire business and one of the key metrics that we used to gauge this is O&M expense per customer. For the first 6 months of 2012, O&M per customer was $69, down from $75 per customer for the same period in 2011.
These numbers are adjusted to exclude rider investment programs where there is a corresponding revenue offset to associated expense. We are also seeing additional improvement for our non-regulated businesses.
Turning to the retail segment on Slide 7, we reported EBIT for the second quarter of $14 million, a $13 million increase compared to the second quarter of last year. This large increase mainly reflects the addition of Nicor's retail business to our portfolio. Those businesses are less seasonal than the SouthStar business that historically was the company's entire retail operating segment.
You will find second quarter 2012 results for our wholesale service segment on Slide 8. EBIT was down $4 million year-over-year for the second quarter. The largest component of the EBIT decline came from a $6 million reduction in commercial activity versus the second quarter of 2011 due to ongoing low volatility in the storage and transportation spreads.
We also recorded transportation hedge gains of $18 million during the quarter, a $14 million increase over the last year and storage hedge losses of $9 million as compared to $4 million of storage hedge gains last year, a $13 million negative year-over-year impact.
These 2 factors play a role in our expectations for the remainder of the year for the wholesale segment, and John will talk in greater detail about these items in just a few minutes.
As you can see, we have a significant storage rollout schedule of $47 million that we expect to recognize in operating revenues about equally between the remainder of 2012 and 2013. This is an increase of $28 million over the rollout scheduled at the end of the first quarter of 2012 and a $36 million improvement, as compared to this time last year.
Now let's move to Slide 9. EBIT at our midstream segment was $2 million during the second quarter of 2012, flat compared to the prior year.
As a reminder, we re-contracted 3 Bcf of capacity at Jefferson Island starting April 1. Due to the continued challenging market conditions and pressure on storage pricing, this dropped our average rate for the facility from $0.19 to $0.14. You can see the blended rates for Golden Triangle and Central Valley on the chart at the bottom right side of the page.
Though we have seen a slight improvement in storage rates for shorter duration contracts, we continue to evaluate options for locking in additional capacity at Central Valley and Golden Triangle Cavern 2.
Briefly, the cargo shipping segment reported an EBIT loss of $1 million during the second quarter of 2012. While revenues per unit were down, TEU, or 20-foot equivalent unit, shipments and market share are up relative to the same period last year, reflecting tropical strong profile in the region and efficient management of its business.
We were breakeven for the year-to-date period on an EBIT basis for that segment as a result of higher depreciation and amortization expense resulting from purchase accounting fair value adjustments that were required as part of the merger.
Some balance sheet highlights are noted on Slide 10. Our long-term debt was at $3.3 billion, which reflects the additional debt issued to finance the Nicor transaction and additional Nicor debt we assumed upon closing the transaction.
Those factors were the main drivers of the year-over-year increase in interest expense. We are generally on plan for capital expenditures this year with a significant portion of our utility capital investment dedicated to rider or surcharge programs with minimal regulatory lag. We continue to look for similar opportunities to deploy capital of property utility franchises.
Finally, as a reminder we provide earnings per share guidance estimated based on normal weather among other assumptions. As noted in the earnings release on a reported EPS basis, our earnings could fall below our guidance range, which is $2.80 to $2.95 per share, as a result of weather and tax year-to-date.
Thanks for your time. I will turn the call over to John."

As Drew noted, we reported solid operating results during the second quarter despite some continued impact of warmer-than-normal weather into the early part of the second quarter.
On Slide 11, you can see the weather anomalies that have affected our utilities year-to-date with Illinois and Georgia highlighted, as these are the 2 service territories where we have the most weather exposure. With the unprecedented warm weather that impacted us in the first quarter and the lesser negative weather impact into the second quarter, we have a negative year-to-date weather impact of $0.13 per share. We remain focused on controlling expenses across the corporation, and we are seeing positive trends in that regard in several of our businesses.
Moving to Slide 12, let me briefly update you on a regulatory filing that we made in New Jersey last week related to infrastructure improvements at Elizabethtown Gas. As you may recall, our utility infrastructure enhancement, or UIE program, is set to expire at the end of October.  We have requested approval for a new accelerated capital investment plan called AIR, accelerated infrastructure replacement, where we propose to spend up to $135 million over a 5-year period beginning in November of this year. Under the proposed plan, we would replace nearly 150 miles of pipe that is predominantly aging cast iron.
Several of peers in New Jersey have requested infrastructure programs of similar duration. However, it is uncertain at this time how the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities will view our proposal.
The program we have proposed is consistent with our commitment to prudently invest capital on infrastructure programs that have minimum regulatory lag and enhance the reliability and integrity of our distribution system.
I want to take a few minutes to talk about the performance of the wholesale segment. Turning to Slides 13 and 14, you can see an historical look at our storage rollout schedule along with the chart of current and historic storage spreads, reflecting the year-over-year wider storage spreads, in part due to the market needing an outlet for natural gas supply.
We have continued to improve the locked-in value of our storage rollout by capturing the year-over-year higher storage spreads by injecting gas and by rolling our storage positions to later periods. The storage hedge losses we experienced in the second quarter added to the locked in storage rollout value at the end of the quarter.
As Drew noted, our storage rollout value has improved to $47 million on about 55 Bcf of natural gas inventory. Currently, we expect to recognize about half of these operating revenues in 2012, with the remainder expected to be recognized in 2013. As you can see on the chart, this is one of the strongest rollout schedules we have had in Sequent's history.
In our 10-Q filed this morning we have provided information about the impact of forward natural gas price changes on our storage portfolio. Based on Sequent's current projection of year-end storage positions at December 31, 2012 of about 25 Bcf, a $1 increase in the 2013 forward NYMEX price could result in a $24 million reduction to Sequent's reported operating revenues for this year, but would increase the expected operating revenues to be realized in 2013 by a corresponding amount.
Conversely, a $1 decrease in the 2013 forward NYMEX price could result in $24 million increase to Sequent's reported operating revenues for this year. However, additional lower cost or market inventory valuation adjustments could potentially offset a portion of the positive impact.
I do want to point out that the situation with our transportation hedges is a bit different, however. Due to narrowing basis spreads, we accelerated transportation hedge gains of approximately $20 million into the first half of this year, primarily from the second half of 2012 through 2013. As a result, our storage hedge gains were strong on a year-over-year basis, but the portfolio is likely to be challenged for the remainder of the year unless basis widens.
On the whole, Pete and his team have done an excellent job of managing the portfolio to create as much economic value as possible in a challenging market environment. They will continue to monitor market conditions and look for opportunities that capture additional margin.
With respect to our earnings guidance for 2012, as Drew noted, the weather impact we have seen year-to-date could move us below the low end of our guidance range for the year. Other than the weather impact, we see performance in the rest of our businesses that is in line with our expectations.  This is due to a number of positive indicators we have seen through the first half of the year including cost containment and managing our controllable expenses, achieving our merger savings targets and generating incremental economic value in our wholesale business.
Turning to Slide 15, you will find our priorities and objectives for 2012. These have not changed from our prior discussion and we continue to make solid progress in all areas. Again, with the exception of weather, we are demonstrating solid results across our business units and we have reason for optimism as we look ahead to the remainder of 2012.
On behalf of the employees of AGL resources, we want to thank each of you for your continued interest in and support of the Company.
Operator, I will turn the call back over to you to begin the Q&A session."

We have actually seen this same type situation several years in the past where we have had the spread move out. And  you are right, it doesn't move out in future years. It pretty much moves out right in front of you in the current year as you see high storage levels and the need to use storage to absorb some of the supply. Now, this year pushed that a little harder than many years in the past; but back in, I think it was 2008 or 2009, back in 2006, we saw similar situations.  That's kind of the counterbalance to our storage position compared to just having a warm summer weather or cold winter weather where the storage is more valuable just to balance the market. So, it's kind of the opposite.  So, we see the opportunity on either side and we have seen this opportunity in each of those areas multiple times in the past. But you are right; the forward curve usually doesn't pick that value up until you actually get to where you see a more immediate storage overhang or the opposite could occur if you see shortage of storage and volatility for that reason, and Pete has a more direct exposure to that."

The way I would just add to John's comment is that we have seen this every few years when it is -- when you come out of a very warm winter and the way we look at it going into this winter if we have another warm winter, we could see even more extreme spreads next year due to the severe overhang of natural gas supply.  If we have a very cold winter, we are obviously hedged on that storage, we will take that out of the ground and realize those earnings and then our transport portfolio would benefit at that time. So, in a way, there is a little bit of an internal hedge in that. If there is a warm winter, we are going to benefit again next year with widening spreads and if there is a cold winter, we will benefit on transport.  The only other thing I will add is, this summer we are seeing the heat more dispersed throughout the country than last year where we saw it mainly in Oklahoma and Texas, and that storage is being able to return a little bit more this year as well, which isn't a rollout schedule issue. That will show up more in our day-to-day cash values, but we are seeing some benefits this year relative to prior years as well."

Generally, looking out at the weekly storage data, obviously, it's still a pretty strong comps versus last year and historically, but the, I guess, the rate of builds is slowing down a little bit and I know some of that's coming from gas burn from generation.  Since you are out in the market so much, I mean do you expect, obviously, gas prices are low, there is still going to be a lot of gas churn during the third and probably the fourth quarter. I mean with the drilling pullback there is a little bit of the gas generation burn, do you think that that's a trend that's kind of flattening and the build is going to -- that's going to continue or is there a lot of gas kind of out there waiting for resolution of the infrastructure [indiscernible]?  I guess just how do you see that balance playing out over the kind of near- to medium- term?"

I will take a first crack at that and then the Pete will add more expertise to it. But what -- I think the surprise for the entire industry has been we all expected that there would be more power generation burn because of the lower gas prices. I think  the surprise has been that that's been even higher than what many of us and most people in the industry expected and on top of that, the weather has been considerably hotter, which further added to that. So we have seen the storage spreads narrow more than what we had anticipated up to this point.  At the same time, we are getting ready to head into a time period where power generation is not as significant part of the load as we get to later September and October. So there are projections that say it could fill up again rather quickly especially since, if you look at production, the other thing that's happened is production, even though the rig count has come off significantly, production hasn't fallen as quickly as some people had predicted. So I think that's a long way of saying, we really don't know, but there are dynamics where even though we have narrowed that storage overhang, so far through this summer that it's possible we still could see pretty tight storage at the end of the year."

So although prices kicked in significantly greater power generation, weather has had that impact too. So the wild card is, as you hit September and October, whether or not that rate of build that has slowed, whether it will significantly accelerate or not and then you have got the wild card that’s regional.  You have issues in Western Canada where you are almost full already in storage and you are starting to see some bottlenecking of supplies out there versus the Gulf Coast. We still have some room in that, reduced injection provides more flexibility in the system, but the wild card to me is going to be weather as we just go through the balance of the summer and we could get to the situation where we get full early if the weather pulls back some."

Starting on slide three of our presentation, we reported GAAP earnings per diluted share for the third quarter of $0.08. On an adjusted basis, excluding $2 million of merger related cost diluted earnings per share were $0.09, which compares to $0.02 in the third quarter of 2011.
The primary year-over-year driver of our third quarter earnings is the addition of the Nicor businesses, the results of which are not reflected in the third quarter of 2011 GAAP comparisons. Our quarterly results reflect an $0.08 per share negative impact due to $16 million of pre-tax mark-to-market hedge losses in our Wholesale Services segment consistent with the press release we issued on October 11th. Excluding that impact which is temporal, our business performed well during the quarter.
Turning briefly to slide four, you can see that our year-to-date financial results through the first three quarters. Diluted EPS adjusted for Nicor expenses was $1.56, down from $1.99 for the same period last year. The primary reason for the decline is the impact of the unprecedented warmer than normal weather in the first half of the year as well as mark-to-market storage hedge losses.
On slide five, you can see that more than 80% of our consolidated positive operating EBIT for the first nine months of 2012 was generated by our distribution operations segment. Retail operations accounted for 17% year-to-date and mid stream operations, 1%. Wholesale Services and cargo shipping are not represented here at the reported EBIT losses through the first nine months.
I will cover some of the major segment variances starting with our distribution business on slide six. EBIT was up $10 million, compared to the third quarter of 2011. This includes an EBIT contribution of $15 million from Nicor Gas. As I mentioned last quarter we are starting to see the benefits of our shared service model accrued across our entire business and one of the key metrics that we use to gauge this is O&M expense per utility customer. O&M per customer was a $102, down from $109 per customer for the same period in 2011.
For the first nine months of 2012 EBIT at the legacy AGL Resources Utilities was up $7 million year-over-year primarily due to our continued focus on effective expense management and higher contribution for regulatory infrastructure programs. In addition we have largely achieved expected cost savings related to integrating our non-utility business.
Turning to the retail segment on slide seven, we recorded EBIT for the third quarter of $5 million, a $10 million increase compared to the third quarter last year. The increase mainly reflects the addition of Nicor's retail businesses to our portfolio as well as a reduction in transportation and gas cost and lower bad debt expense of Southstar relative to last year.
You will find third quarter 2012 results for our wholesale services segment on slide eight. There are few moving pieces affecting our year-over-year results, so let me take you through them now. In total EBIT improved by $14 million year-over-year for the third quarter. You will recall that in the last year’s third quarter we recorded margin losses of $17 million due to transportation constraints in the Marcellus region as well as the impact of a credit default due to a customer bankruptcy.
We also recorded a lower cost of market adjustment for LOCOM of $9 million during the third quarter of 2011, and storage hedge gains of $14 million.
In the third quarter of this year, are Marcellus customer bankruptcy and the LOCOM factors were absent. However, we recorded storage hedge losses of $15 million due to rising natural gas prices, this is the primary driver of our EBIT loss for the quarter.
John will talk in greater detail about these items in just a few minutes. But it’s important to keep in mind that Sequent has generated higher economic value during the quarter and throughout the year. As a result we have a storage rollout scheduled of $65 million and we expect to realize that value in operating revenue during the remainder of 2012 and into 2013. This is an improvement of $18 million over the rollout schedule that we discussed at the end of the second quarter of 2012 and a $59 million improvement as compared to last year.
Now let’s move to slide nine. EBIT at our mid-stream segment was $1 million during the third quarter of 2012, down $1 million compared to the prior year. The decline is due primarily to lower revenue at Jefferson Island versus the prior year due to re-contracting at lower rates. You can see the blended rates for each storage facility on the chart at the bottom right side of the page.
Overall, the market for storage remains weak but we continue to focus on ways to optimize the value of our available capacity or not committing the long-term contracts in this low price environment.
Briefly, the cargo shipping segment reported an EBIT loss of $1 million during the third quarter of 2012. Factors impacting this business have remained consistent throughout the year. Revenue per unit is down but shipments are up relative to the same period last year.
Some balance sheet highlights are noted on slide 10. Our long-term debt was at $3.3 billion, which reflects the additional debt issued to finance the Nicor transaction, and additional Nicor debt we’ll assume in closing the transaction.
Interest expense was up $14 million for the quarter compared to the same period in 2011, mainly driven by the higher debt levels. We are trending favorably to expectation year-to-date by approximately $5 million due to the timing of some long-term financing activity and higher capitalized interest related to the timing of placing our storage assets into commercial service this year.
Turning to our capital expenditures, we now expect our spending to be down about $30 million relative to our earlier projections. This reduction is due primarily to the timing of infrastructure investment spending in Virginia and Georgia and we do expect those investments to be made in future periods. In addition, capital spending for some of our non-regulated efforts have come down, which also is partly a timing issue.
Finally, as a reminder, we provided an updated earnings per share guidance range in mid-October to reflect the warmer than normal weather in the first half of the year and the mark-to-market impacts on our wholesale services business in the third quarter.
Our new guidance range is $2.60 to $2.75 per share. Fourth quarter is typically one of our strongest quarters due to weather and customer usage patterns as well as the potential for higher natural gas price volatility. However, because these factors are difficult to predict with a higher degree of certainty let me remind you that we do have potential for variability in our fourth quarter earnings.
Thanks for your time today and now I will turn the call over to John.

Turning to slide 11, I will just recap the two major factors influencing our year-to-date earnings. First, as we discussed last quarter, you can see the weather anomalies that have affected our utilities at our Georgia retail business year-to-date. Second, Pete and the Sequent team have done an excellent job of creating economic value around our storage positions but this economic value largely remains in our storage rollout schedule and therefore has not yet shown up in our reported results in the wholesale segment.
The economic value of the storage rollout schedule is $65 million as of the end of the quarter, well above the $6 million storage rollout value at this time last year, and also well above the historical average storage rollout value at the end of the third quarter. In addition, the chart on the bottom left shows the increasing natural gas prices which have impacted our reported results in the wholesale segment.
The mark-to-market loss is associated with the increasing natural gas price, helped improve the rollout schedule in the quarter up to the $65 million, but resulted in a negative $15 million EBIT impact to Sequent for the quarter. In our 10Q filing, we provided more detail on our sensitivity to natural gas prices. And based on the current projection of year end storage positions of 33 BCF, a $1 increase in the 2013 forward NYMEX price could result in the $31 million reduction to wholesale services’ reported operating revenues for 2012, but would increase the expected operating revenues to be realized in 2013 by a corresponding amount.
A $1 decrease in forward NYMEX prices would result in the $31 million positive impact. However, additional low-comp adjustment could potentially offset a portion of that positive impact. Excluding additional low-comp adjustments, the dollar decrease in forward NYMEX prices would result in a corresponding decrease in the expected operating revenues to be realized in 2013.
Moving to slide 12, you can see our historical storage rollout schedule. This is the second strongest rollout schedule in Sequent’s history. Based on our current schedule, we expect to realize approximately $28 million of economic value for gross margin in the fourth quarter of this year with the remainder to be realized in 2013.
Importantly, we remain focused on managing controllable expenses and we have made significant progress towards achieving our efficiency initiatives related to the Nicor merger. We are earning close to our allowed rates of return at each utility and we have managed our non-regulated businesses in a way that optimizes their value despite challenging market fundamentals.
We thank you for your time today and for your continued interest in AGL Resources. Operator, I will go ahead now and turn the call back over to you to start the Q&A session.

If you look at our territory across Virginia, it could have been impacted and it largely was not impacted. New Jersey was, and we have all seen the news and the pictures from New Jersey. The good news for us is because we are a large multi-state, we have already moved resources into New Jersey to deal with recovery and we are in early assessment mode but we think about 1% to 2% of our customer base was significantly affected by flooding.
Of course a large percentage is without power still. Our field forces have taken care of all emergency orders blowing gas from ruptured pipelines, from trees falling and so forth. The flooding is the big issue going forward and the power outage. Of course the power outage you can still use the gas water heaters, so people are taking hot showers and you can cook, but you can't use your central furnace.
So, we will focus very heavily on restoring service to anyone who is out once power comes back on for their heating, if there is any work for us to do. We moved resources in from Georgia and from Virginia up there and now we are actually seeing if other utilities need some help in New Jersey. We have resources we can bring from our Illinois operations and more from the others.
With the 1% to 2% flooding that will require some serious work on our part but we think we have got that all assessed and we feel pretty good about our ability to get customers back on as soon as they are in their homes without flooding and that their equipment is in good shape and it’s been inspected. So, we will be prepared for all of that.
We also put resources on our call center, we lost connectivity in New Jersey. But we have a call center in Georgia to take the calls and we have restored connectivity now to our New Jersey call center, it’s up and running this morning. So, we feel about as good as we could given the devastation of things and it will be a modest impact on our operations there. But we’ve got - at this point we think we got it under control.

252517,222618043,376191,"AGL Resources Inc., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2012",2012-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Southern Company Gas","Executives","Welcome back Sarah and good morning everyone.Starting on Slide 3 of our presentation, we reported GAAP earnings per diluted share for the third quarter of $0.08. On an adjusted basis, excluding $2 million of merger related costs, diluted earnings per sh",1156,"Welcome back Sarah and good morning everyone.
Starting on Slide 3 of our presentation, we reported GAAP earnings per diluted share for the third quarter of $0.08. On an adjusted basis, excluding $2 million of merger related costs, diluted earnings per share were $0.09, which compares to $0.02 in the third quarter of 2011.
The primary year-over-year driver of our third quarter earnings is the addition of the Nicor businesses, the results of which are not reflected in the third quarter of 2011 GAAP comparisons. Our quarterly results reflect an $0.08 per share negative impact due to $16 million of pre-tax mark-to-market hedge losses in our Wholesale Services segment consistent with the press release we issued on October 11. Excluding that impact which is temporal, our business performed well during the quarter.
Turning briefly to Slide 4, you can see that our year-to-date financial results through the first 3 quarters. Diluted EPS adjusted for Nicor expenses was $1.56, down from $1.99 for the same period last year. The primary reason for the decline is the impact of the unprecedented warmer than normal weather in the first half of the year as well as mark-to-market storage hedge losses.
On Slide 5, you can see that more than 80% of our consolidated positive operating EBIT for the first 9 months of 2012 was generated by our distribution operations segment. Retail operations accounted for 17% year-to-date and midstream operations, 1%. Wholesale Services and cargo shipping are not represented here, as they reported EBIT losses through the first 9 months.
I will cover some of the major segment variances starting with our distribution business on Slide 6. EBIT was up $10 million, compared to the third quarter of 2011. This includes an EBIT contribution of $15 million from Nicor Gas. As I mentioned last quarter we are starting to see the benefits of our shared service model accrue across our entire business and one of the key metrics that we use to gauge this is O&M expense per utility customer. O&M per customer was a $102, down from $109 per customer for the same period in 2011.
For the first 9 months of 2012, EBIT at the legacy AGL Resources Utilities was up $7 million year-over-year primarily due to our continued focus on effective expense management and higher contribution for regulatory infrastructure programs. In addition, we have largely achieved expected cost savings related to integrating our non-utility business.
Turning to the retail segment on Slide 7, we recorded EBIT for the third quarter of $5 million, a $10 million increase compared to the third quarter last year. The increase mainly reflects the addition of Nicor's retail businesses to our portfolio as well as a reduction in transportation and gas cost and lower bad debt expense at Southstar relative to last year.
You will find third quarter 2012 results for our wholesale services segment on Slide 8. There are a few moving pieces affecting our year-over-year results, so let me take you through them now. In total, EBIT improved by $14 million year-over-year for the third quarter. You will recall that in the last year’s third quarter we recorded margin losses of $17 million due to transportation constraints in the Marcellus region as well as the impact of a credit default due to a customer bankruptcy.
We also recorded a lower cost of market adjustment for LOCOM of $9 million during the third quarter of 2011, and storage hedge gains of $14 million.
In the third quarter of this year, are Marcellus customer bankruptcy and the LOCOM factors were absent. However, we recorded storage hedge losses of $15 million due to rising natural gas prices. This is the primary driver of our EBIT loss for the quarter.
John will talk in greater detail about these items in just a few minutes. But it’s important to keep in mind that Sequent has generated higher economic value during the quarter and throughout the year. As a result we have a storage rollout scheduled of $65 million and we expect to realize that value in operating revenue during the remainder of 2012 and into 2013. This is an improvement of $18 million over the rollout schedule that we discussed at the end of the second quarter of 2012 and a $9 million improvement as compared to last year.
Now let’s move to Slide 9. EBIT at our mid-stream segment was $1 million during the third quarter of 2012, down $1 million compared to the prior year. The decline is due primarily to lower revenue at Jefferson Island versus the prior year due to re-contracting at lower rates. You can see the blended rates for each storage facility on the chart at the bottom right side of the page.
Overall, the market for storage remains weak but we continue to focus on ways to optimize the value of our available capacity while not committing the long-term contracts in this low price environment.
Briefly, the cargo shipping segment reported an EBIT loss of $1 million during the third quarter of 2012. Factors impacting this business have remained consistent throughout the year. Revenue per unit is down but shipments are up, relative to the same period last year.
Some balance sheet highlights are noted on Slide 10. Our long-term debt was at $3.3 billion, which reflects the additional debt issued to finance the Nicor transaction, and additional Nicor debt we’ll assume in closing the transaction.
Interest expense was up $14 million for the quarter compared to the same period in 2011, mainly driven by the higher debt levels. We are trending favorably to expectation year-to-date by approximately $5 million due to the timing of some long-term financing activity and higher capitalized interest related to the timing of placing our storage assets into commercial service this year.
Turning to our capital expenditures, we now expect our spending to be down about $30 million relative to our earlier projections. This reduction is due primarily to the timing of infrastructure investment spending in Virginia and Georgia and we do expect those investments to be made in future periods. In addition, capital spending for some of our non-regulated efforts have come down, which also is partly a timing issue.
Finally, as a reminder, we provided an updated earnings-per-share guidance range in mid-October to reflect the warmer than normal weather in the first half of the year and the mark-to-market impacts on our wholesale services business in the third quarter.
Our new guidance range is $2.60 to $2.75 per share. Fourth quarter is typically one of our strongest quarters due to weather and customer usage patterns as well as the potential for higher natural gas price volatility. However, because these factors are difficult to predict with a higher degree of certainty, let me remind you that we do have potential for variability in our fourth quarter earnings.
Thanks for your time today and now I will turn the call over to John."

Turning to Slide 11, I will just recap the 2 major factors influencing our year-to-date earnings. First, as we discussed last quarter, you can see the weather anomalies that have affected our utilities at our Georgia retail business year-to-date. Second, Pete and the Sequent team have done an excellent job of creating economic value around our storage positions but this economic value largely remains in our storage rollout schedule and therefore has not yet shown up in our reported results in the wholesale segment.
The economic value of the storage rollout schedule is $65 million as of the end of the quarter, well above the $6 million storage rollout value at this time last year, and also well above the historical average storage rollout value at the end of the third quarter. In addition, the chart on the bottom left shows the increasing natural gas prices which have impacted our reported results in the wholesale segment.
The mark-to-market losses associated with the increasing natural gas price, helped improve the rollout schedule in the quarter up to the $65 million, but resulted in a negative $15 million EBIT impact to Sequent for the quarter. In our 10-Q filing, we provided more detail on our sensitivity to natural gas prices. And based on the current projection of year end storage positions of 33 BCF, a $1 increase in the 2013 forward NYMEX price could result in the $31 million reduction to wholesale services’ reported operating revenues for 2012, but would increase the expected operating revenues to be realized in 2013 by a corresponding amount.
A $1 decrease in forward NYMEX prices would result in the $31 million positive impact. However, additional low-comp adjustment could potentially offset a portion of that positive impact. Excluding additional low-comp adjustments, the dollar decrease in forward NYMEX prices would result in a corresponding decrease in the expected operating revenues to be realized in 2013.
Moving to Slide 12, you can see our historical storage rollout schedule. This is the second strongest rollout schedule in Sequent’s history. Based on our current schedule, we expect to realize approximately $28 million of economic value for gross margins in the fourth quarter of this year with the remainder to be realized in 2013.
Importantly, we remain focused on managing controllable expenses and we have made significant progress towards achieving our efficiency initiatives related to the Nicor merger. We are earning close to our allowed rates of return at each utility and we have managed our non-regulated businesses in a way that optimizes their value despite challenging market fundamentals.

If you look at our territory across Virginia, it could have been impacted and it largely was not impacted. New Jersey was, and we have all seen the news and the pictures from New Jersey. The good news for us is because we are a large multi-state, we have already moved resources into New Jersey to deal with recovery and we are in early assessment mode but we think about 1% to 2% of our customer base was significantly affected by flooding.
Of course a large percentage is without power still. Our field forces have taken care of all emergency orders of blowing gas from ruptured pipelines, from trees falling and so forth. And the flooding is the big issue going forward and the power outage. Of course the power outage you can still use the gas water heaters, so people are taking hot showers and you can cook, but you can't use your central furnace.
So, we will focus very heavily on restoring service to anyone who is out once power comes back on for their heating, if there is any work for us to do. We moved resources in from Georgia and from Virginia up there and now we are actually seeing if other utilities need some help in New Jersey. We have resources we can bring from our Illinois operations and more from the others.
With the 1% to 2% flooding that will require some serious work on our part but we think we have got that all assessed and we feel pretty good about our ability to get customers back on as soon as they are in their homes without flooding and that their equipment is in good shape and it’s been inspected. So, we will be prepared for all of that.
We also put resources on our call center; we lost connectivity in New Jersey. But we have a call center in Georgia that took the calls and we have restored connectivity now to our New Jersey call center, it’s up and running this morning. So, we feel about as good as we could, given the devastation about things and it will be a modest impact on our operations there. But we’ve got -- at this point we think we got it under control."

Turning briefly to Slide 4, you can see that our year-to-date financial results through the first 3 quarters. Diluted EPS adjusted for Nicor expenses was $1.56, down from $1.99 for the same period last year. The primary reason for the decline is the impact of the unprecedented warmer than normal weather in the first half of the year as well as mark-to-market storage hedge losses.
On Slide 5, you can see that more than 80% of our consolidated positive operating EBIT for the first 9 months of 2012 was generated by our distribution operations segment. Retail operations accounted for 17% year-to-date and midstream operations, 1%. Wholesale Services and cargo shipping are not represented here, as they reported EBIT losses through the first 9 months.
I will cover some of the major segment variances starting with our distribution business on Slide 6. EBIT was up $10 million, compared to the third quarter of 2011. This includes an EBIT contribution of $15 million from Nicor Gas. As I mentioned last quarter we are starting to see the benefits of our shared service model accrue across our entire business and one of the key metrics that we use to gauge this is O&M expense per utility customer. O&M per customer was a $102, down from $109 per customer for the same period in 2011.
For the first 9 months of 2012, EBIT at the legacy AGL Resources Utilities was up $7 million year-over-year primarily due to our continued focus on effective expense management and higher contribution for regulatory infrastructure programs. In addition, we have largely achieved expected cost savings related to integrating our non-utility business.
Turning to the retail segment on Slide 7. We recorded EBIT for the third quarter of $5 million, a $10 million increase compared to the third quarter last year. The increase mainly reflects the addition of Nicor's retail businesses to our portfolio as well as a reduction in transportation and gas cost and lower bad debt expense at Southstar relative to last year.
You will find third quarter 2012 results for our wholesale services segment on Slide 8. There are a few moving pieces affecting our year-over-year results, so let me take you through them now. In total, EBIT improved by $14 million year-over-year for the third quarter. You will recall that in the last year’s third quarter we recorded margin losses of $17 million due to transportation constraints in the Marcellus region as well as the impact of a credit default due to a customer bankruptcy.
We also recorded a lower cost of market adjustment for LOCOM of $9 million during the third quarter of 2011, and storage hedge gains of $14 million. In the third quarter of this year, are Marcellus customer bankruptcy and the LOCOM factors were absent. However, we recorded storage hedge losses of $15 million due to rising natural gas prices. This is the primary driver of our EBIT loss for the quarter.
John will talk in greater detail about these items in just a few minutes. But it’s important to keep in mind that Sequent has generated higher economic value during the quarter and throughout the year. As a result we have a storage rollout scheduled of $65 million and we expect to realize that value in operating revenue during the remainder of 2012 and into 2013. This is an improvement of $18 million over the rollout schedule that we discussed at the end of the second quarter of 2012 and a $9 million improvement as compared to last year.
Now let’s move to Slide 9. EBIT at our mid-stream segment was $1 million during the third quarter of 2012, down $1 million compared to the prior year. The decline is due primarily to lower revenue at Jefferson Island versus the prior year due to re-contracting at lower rates. You can see the blended rates for each storage facility on the chart at the bottom right side of the page.
Overall, the market for storage remains weak but we continue to focus on ways to optimize the value of our available capacity while not committing the long-term contracts in this low price environment.
Briefly, the cargo shipping segment reported an EBIT loss of $1 million during the third quarter of 2012. Factors impacting this business have remained consistent throughout the year. Revenue per unit is down but shipments are up, relative to the same period last year.
Some balance sheet highlights are noted on Slide 10. Our long-term debt was at $3.3 billion, which reflects the additional debt issued to finance the Nicor transaction, and additional Nicor debt we’ll assume in closing the transaction.
Interest expense was up $14 million for the quarter compared to the same period in 2011, mainly driven by the higher debt levels. We are trending favorably to expectation year-to-date by approximately $5 million due to the timing of some long-term financing activity and higher capitalized interest related to the timing of placing our storage assets into commercial service this year.
Turning to our capital expenditures. We now expect our spending to be down about $30 million relative to our earlier projections. This reduction is due primarily to the timing of infrastructure investment spending in Virginia and Georgia and we do expect those investments to be made in future periods. In addition, capital spending for some of our non-regulated efforts have come down, which also is partly a timing issue.
Finally, as a reminder, we provided an updated earnings per share guidance range in mid-October to reflect the warmer than normal weather in the first half of the year and the mark-to-market impacts on our wholesale services business in the third quarter.
Our new guidance range is $2.60 to $2.75 per share. Fourth quarter is typically one of our strongest quarters due to weather and customer usage patterns as well as the potential for higher natural gas price volatility. However, because these factors are difficult to predict with a higher degree of certainty, let me remind you that we do have potential for variability in our fourth quarter earnings.
Thanks for your time today. And now, I will turn the call over to John."

I will just recap the 2 major factors influencing our year-to-date earnings. First, as we discussed last quarter, you can see the weather anomalies that have affected our utilities at our Georgia retail business year-to-date. Second, Pete and the Sequent team have done an excellent job of creating economic value around our storage positions but this economic value largely remains in our storage rollout schedule and therefore has not yet shown up in our reported results in the wholesale segment.
The economic value of the storage rollout schedule is $65 million as of the end of the quarter, well above the $6 million storage rollout value at this time last year, and also well above the historical average storage rollout value at the end of the third quarter. In addition, the chart on the bottom left shows the increasing natural gas prices which have impacted our reported results in the wholesale segment.
The mark-to-market losses associated with the increasing natural gas price, helped improve the rollout schedule in the quarter up to the $65 million, but resulted in a negative $15 million EBIT impact to Sequent for the quarter. In our 10-Q filing, we provided more detail on our sensitivity to natural gas prices. And based on the current projection of year end storage positions of 33 BCF, a $1 increase in the 2013 forward NYMEX price could result in the $31 million reduction to wholesale services’ reported operating revenues for 2012, but would increase the expected operating revenues to be realized in 2013 by a corresponding amount.
A $1 decrease in forward NYMEX prices would result in the $31 million positive impact. However, additional low-comp adjustment could potentially offset a portion of that positive impact. Excluding additional low-comp adjustments, the dollar decrease in forward NYMEX prices would result in a corresponding decrease in the expected operating revenues to be realized in 2013.
Moving to Slide 12. You can see our historical storage rollout schedule. This is the second strongest rollout schedule in Sequent’s history. Based on our current schedule, we expect to realize approximately $28 million of economic value for gross margins in the fourth quarter of this year with the remainder to be realized in 2013.
Importantly, we remain focused on managing controllable expenses and we have made significant progress towards achieving our efficiency initiatives related to the Nicor merger. We are earning close to our allowed rates of return at each utility and we have managed our non-regulated businesses in a way that optimizes their value despite challenging market fundamentals.
We thank you for your time today and for your continued interest in AGL Resources. Operator, I will go ahead now and turn the call back over to you to start the Q&A session."

If you look at our territory across Virginia, it could have been impacted and it largely was not impacted. New Jersey was, and we have all seen the news and the pictures from New Jersey. The good news for us is because we are a large multi-state, we have already moved resources into New Jersey to deal with recovery and we are in early assessment mode but we think about 1% to 2% of our customer base was significantly affected by flooding. Of course a large percentage is without power still. Our field forces have taken care of all emergency orders of blowing gas from ruptured pipelines, from trees falling and so forth. And the flooding is the big issue going forward and the power outage. Of course the power outage you can still use the gas water heaters, so people are taking hot showers and you can cook, but you can't use your central furnace. So we will focus very heavily on restoring service to anyone who is out once power comes back on for their heating, if there is any work for us to do. We moved resources in from Georgia and from Virginia up there and now we are actually seeing if other utilities need some help in New Jersey. We have resources we can bring from our Illinois operations and more from the others. With the 1% to 2% flooding that will require some serious work on our part but we think we have got that all assessed and we feel pretty good about our ability to get customers back on as soon as they are in their homes without flooding and that their equipment is in good shape and it’s been inspected. So we will be prepared for all of that. We also put resources on our call center; we lost connectivity in New Jersey. But we have a call center in Georgia that took the calls and we have restored connectivity now to our New Jersey call center, it’s up and running this morning. So we feel about as good as we could, given the devastation about things and it will be a modest impact on our operations there. But we’ve got -- at this point we think we got it under control."
