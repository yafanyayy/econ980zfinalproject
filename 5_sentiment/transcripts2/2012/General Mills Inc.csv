Thanks for joining us this morning. As you see from our press release, third quarter performance was consistent with the guidelines we provided on February 17. We delivered sales in each of our 3 operating segment",1385,"Thanks, Kris, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us this morning. As you see from our press release, third quarter performance was consistent with the guidelines we provided on February 17. We delivered sales in each of our 3 operating segments, with strong net price realization across our base business and good contributions from the International Yoplait business acquired last July. The quarter also include strong contributions from new products and an 8% increase in advertising investment. Earnings were generally in line with year-ago levels due to this year's significant input cost pressure. Slide 5 summarized our results for the quarter. Sales totaled $4.1 billion, up 13%. Segment operating profit increased 1%. Net earnings attributable to General Mills totaled $392 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.58 as recorded. These results include changes in the mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions, as well as integration expenses from the International Yoplait acquisition. Excluding these items, adjusted diluted earnings per share totaled $0.55 for the quarter, $0.01 below year-ago results.
Slide 6 shows the components of our net sales growth. On an as-reported basis including Yoplait International, net sales increased 13%. Pound volume contributed 10 percentage points growth in the quarter and net price realization and mix added 3 points to sales growth. Foreign exchange did not have material effect on sales growth rate this quarter. Excluding the Yoplait acquisition, net sales grew 5% and expected pound volume was lower in the quarter, down 3 percentage points. Price and mix contributed 8 points to sales growth. As I mentioned a moment ago, all 3 of our business segments contributed to this quarter's sales increase. U.S. Retail net sales grew 4%. International sales were up 51%, led by International Yoplait acquisition. But excluding Yoplait International sales still increased at a high single-digit rate and net sales for our Bakeries and Foodservice segment rose 6%. Slide 8 outlines our third quarter gross margin performance. On a reported basis, gross margins declined to 36.6%. This includes the impact of mark-to-market changes in the value of our grain inventories and commodity hedges used in future periods. Excluding mark-to-market gross margins 280 basis points in the quarter. The addition of Yoplait International to our business mix accounts for roughly 1/3 of that decline. The remainder reflects margin contraction of our base business primarily due to higher input costs and lower U.S. Retail volumes. With new for full year, our original plans for 2011 assumed a 100 basis points contraction in gross margin for the base business, with the addition of Yoplait International further reducing gross margin this year. We currently expect fiscal 2012 gross margins will be in total roughly 250 basis points below the prior year, excluding mark-to-market effects in both periods. Slide 9 summarizes our segment operating profit in the quarter. U.S. Retail profit declined 4% reflecting higher input costs, lower volumes and increased media investment. International profit increased 40% led by strong contributions from Yoplait. And Bakeries and Foodservice profit matched year-ago levels despite sharply higher input cost and a difficult comparison to strong grain merchandising a year ago. In total, segment operating profit rose 1% to reach $675 million. After-tax earnings from joint ventures rose sharply in the quarter, good net sales growth and a lapping of the tax restructuring charges, Cereal Partners Worldwide last year contributed to the earnings increase. On a constant currency basis, CPW sales were up 7% led by growth from the Nesquik and Chocapic brands. Cost of currency sales for Häagen-Dazs Japan increased 3%. In the fourth quarter, we expect joint venture profits will fall below stronger year-ago levels. And for the full year, we now expect after-tax earnings from joint ventures will be down from 2011 levels. Earnings for Häagen-Dazs Japan were below year-ago levels due to the difficult economic environment in Japan following the earthquake and tsunami a year ago. But that being said, recovery for this business is running a bit ahead of our plan. CPW earnings will also be below year-ago levels due to one-time adjustment of tax reserves related to prior years and earlier year phasing of expenses for new manufacturing capacity in emerging markets, including Malaysia, Turkey, South Africa and Brazil. CPW volume and sales growth in the underlying business remains strong. Completing our review of the income statement, corporate unallocated expenses, excluding mark-to-market effects were slightly lower in the quarter. This year's total includes $4 million of one-time integration costs for Yoplait. Last year's total included an $11 million charge to increase environmental reserves. Interest expense increased 13% in the quarter driven by increased level of overall debt with the addition of Yoplait and the pre-funding of our February bond maturity. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 32.7% as reported. Excluding items affecting comparability, the tax rate was 32.0% this year compared to 31.6% a year ago. We now expect our full year tax rate to be roughly 32%, excluding items affecting comparability. Turning to the balance sheet. Slide 12 shows the components of core working capital. In the quarter where net sales increased 13%, our core working capital declined 4% as a focus on inventory reduction drove improved working capital efficiency. Increased levels of accounts receivable and accounts payable primarily from the Yoplait acquisition were largely offsetting the quarter. Year-to-date cash flow from operations totaled roughly $1.7 million dollars, a 33% increase versus the first 9 months of 2011. Planned inventory reductions, changes in the market value of open grain contracts and foreign currency hedges and the timing of consumer marketing accruals all contributed to the increase. Slide 14 summarizes our financial performance through the first 9 months of the year. Net sales increased 12% as reported and grew 6%, excluding the Yoplait acquisition. Despite significantly higher input costs and an 8% increase in media expense, segment operating profit matched year-ago levels. This year to date results include solid contributions from the International Yoplait acquisition. And our adjusted diluted earnings per share totaled $1.96, in line with the year-ago performance year ago performance. As we communicated last month, our third quarter results reflected weak volumes, weak sales and volume trends across U.S. food categories in measured channels. Slide 15 shows that across the 25 categories that we compete, consumer retail sales growth in non-measured channels continued with a strong pace in the third quarter. However, consumer takeaway in measured channels moderated. We believe reduced trade merchandising activity was a key driver of the performance in measured outlets. In the third quarter, measured channels merchandise volume declined 7% across our categories as food manufacturers increased promoted price points. We expect volume trends to moderate across U.S. Food categories in the months ahead as consumers adjust to the new price points. Turning to the fourth quarter, we expect to achieve good sales and EPS growth. The sales growth will reflect strong net price realization across our base business and incremental sales for the Yoplait acquisition. We have a higher level of new product activity in the market and we have increased media support behind our brands. Our rate of gross margin decline is expected to moderate in the fourth quarter. Our tax rate will be lower and effective cost management is especially key the fourth quarter unallocated expenses below year-ago levels. And so for fiscal 2012 in total, we are tracking some behind our original profit target but the year is unfolding largely as we outlined last summer. We expect to deliver double-digit growth in net sales with significant contributions from Yoplait International, strong levels of product innovation and increased levels of consumer marketing support. Gross margin, as a percent of sales, will be below year-ago levels, reflecting higher year-over-year input cost and of excess mix shift to include Yoplait International. We expect segment operating profit will be above year-ago levels, including increased media investment. Operating profits will include solid contributions from Yoplait International. And we expect to deliver EPS of $2.53 to $2.55 per share As a reminder, this guidance excludes mark-to-market effects in Yoplait integration costs. In my remarks this morning, I've given some perspective on trends for U.S. Food at home. Now I'd like to turn the call over to John Machuzick who will discuss the trends for Food Away-from-Home and the performance of our Bakeries and Foodservice business. John?"

I'm pleased to be here to review our Bakery and Foodservice businesses. There are 3 key points I'd like to make this morning. First, while there are some bright spots in the U.S. foodservice industry, the overall environment remains challenging as we continue to deal with the cautious consumer. Second, we've been outperforming the industry in recent years and we're building stronger share positions for our brands. And third, we're driving this good performance by focusing on the channels that show the most promising growth and by innovating on many of our branded product lines. Let me say a bit more in each of these points. I'll start with the foodservice industry environment. I know some of you are wondering about a potential rebound in the restaurant industry given good calendar year-end results posted by a few of the major quick-service restaurants chains. The commercial restaurant channel has posted modest sales growth over the past several months but traffic growth is still quite low. And remember, these growth levels are off of historic lows. The fact remains that consumer is still cautious given a slow economy and rising gas prices, so the foodservice industry is still facing some headwinds. Economics projects that the foodservice industry will post nominal growth of an order less than 3% in calendar 2012. This will be a slight improvement over last year. The majority of this growth is expected to be price-driven. As you can see on Slide 21, real growth which strips away the impact of price inflation is expected to be essentially flat in 2012. However, there are channels that are expected to post growth, including quick-service restaurants, schools, lodging, hospitals and convenience stores. It's these channels where we've been focusing our efforts. As we discussed at the beginning of the fiscal year, our annual plan call for pricing driven net sales growth above our long-term model, which calls for low single-digit growth. And we targeted a mid-single-digit decline in segment operating profit because of significant cost inflation and the fact that we are comparing against record grain merchandising earnings last year. We remain broadly on track to meet these goals this year. Net sales for our Bakeries and Foodservice segment grew 6% in the third quarter, driven by pricing with volume essentially flat. For the year-to-date, our sales were up 10%, with volume matching year-ago levels. This performance is well ahead of the industry. And as you can see on Slide 23, we posted good growth in all 3 sectors of our business. Segments operating profits was essentially flat to last year in the quarter and was down 5% for the year-to-date due to increased input costs and the lapping of last year's higher grain merchandising earnings. Let me describe how we're leveraging our brands in some of the growing Foodservice channels. We worked with the number of the largest quick-service restaurant chains providing customized products from pizza crust to yogurt to cinnamon rolls. We're also partnering with key accounts to build their menus for breakfast, which continues to be the fastest-growing daypart for restaurants. We see this channel as a good growth opportunity for us because many national accounts are increasingly receptive to offering customers well-known consumer branded products. Breakfast programs in K-12 schools have been growing at a 5% compound rate over the past 3 calendar years. Our business in these channels is outpacing the growth. Recent legislation for the K-12 school nutrition program recommends more whole grains at breakfast. This new guideline doesn't go into effect until 2013 but it represents an opportunity for us to continue to expand our offerings in schools. We are already the cereal category leader in school breakfast programs. All of our Big G cereals contain more whole grain than any other single ingredient. In addition, our line of hot breakfast items has been a big hit in schools, with sales nearly doubling so far this year. These toast products are easy for the operators to prepare, they can be heated and served right in the package for the kids. And they contain between 16 and 24 grams of whole grain per serving. And we're also seeing good performance on Trix Yogurt in K-12 schools with reformulated product that contains no artificial colors or flavors. College enrollment in the U.S. has been increasing at a 4% compound rate over the past 3 years so this is another attractive channel for growth. College students like cereal and 4 out of the top 5 cereals in college and university cafeterias are General Mills products, with Lucky Charms having the highest cereal penetration on campuses. Yogurt also is a key business in this channel. This includes yogurt parfait, which has become increasingly popular in foodservice outlets. Our Yoplait ParfaitPro pouches give operators fast and easy way to make layered yogurt parfaits. This product has contributed double-digit compound growth on our bulk yogurt business over the past 3 years and we've got much more yogurt innovation coming this summer. In convenience stores, our Snacks sales had been increasing 13% rate over the past 4 years. We've been growing distribution on existing snack lines like Chex mix and we've developed unique items for these outlets, such as the line of Betty Crocker dessert snack bars and Wheaties Bars. We're working on new snack items to continue to leverage this growing food outlet. So across the fastest growing foodservice channels, we're focusing on a great portfolio of brands. For the year-to-date across all Foodservice channels, sales of our Big G cereals have grown at a 4% rate, yogurt sales were up 3% and our Snacks sales were up 13%. In addition to these strong brands, we also bring strong sales capabilities to our customers. Back in 2008, we began converting our foodservice salesforce from broker to direct. Today our national salesforce represents 90% of our sales in Away-from-Home channels. Our salespeople are bringing unique cost consumer insights and category management capabilities to our customers. We believe this business has strong competitive advantage, and our customers seem to agree. In 2011, we received Supplier Dealer awards from 13 of our customers. We are ranked #3 in the most recent ranking for foodservice sales. By focusing on growing channels and branded product innovation, we've been increasing the profitability of our business. Over the past 5 years, our operating profit has grown to the 19% compound growth rate. Our profit margin is expanded by 900 basis points to reach a level very near General Mills as corporate average. As I said earlier in fiscal 2012, our operating profit and margins will decline somewhat reflecting the impact of lower grain merchandising earnings and sharply higher input cost inflation. But over the long term, we expect sales to grow at a low-single digits compound rate and our operating profit should grow faster than sales. We like the long-term growth prospects we see for this business, while Technomic industry projections for 2015 show modest shift to more food eaten up home, U.S. Food-Away-From-Home will still generate over $0.5 trillion in total sales, and that's a good growth market for General Mills in our brands. In summary, the team of people in General Mills brands and the division is generating strong results. We're outperforming the foodservice industry on the strength of our products and execution in growing channels and with 9 months under our belt, we're on pace to deliver our full year sales and profit targets. The foodservice industry continues to be challenging but we're encouraged by current trends in the channels where we compete and we see good opportunities for future growth. As the U.S. economic outlook ripens, we expect foodservice industry sales trends to accelerate. I think we're well-positioned in the right channels with solid brands to leverage that growth. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ken Powell."

You just heard about the very good results that John Machuzick and his team are posting in our Bakeries and Foodservice segment. I'm going to review performance in our other 2 business segments beginning with International. As Chris O'Leary told you in the second quarter earnings call, our International segment is performing quite well this year. Slide 34 shows constant currency sales growth rates for the latest quarter. In total, International net sales were up 53%. Sales in Canada grew 37%, led by cereal, Old El Paso Mexican products and the addition of Liberté yogurt. In Latin America, sales were up 12%. Net sales more than doubled in the Europe, reflecting the addition of Yoplait yogurt and high single-digit sales growth on our base business. And in the Asia Pacific region, sales grew 15% with good contributions from China and Australia.
We're performing well in many of our established markets. Despite continued economic challenges in Western Europe, we're posting good growth across our base business. For example, in the U.K., sales in constant currency are up 7% year-to-date with particularly strong growth on Nature Valley granola bars. In France, constant currency sales are up 16% so far this year on the strength of Häagen-Dazs Secret Sensations and increased in-store marketing on Old El Paso dinner kits. In addition, Yoplait yogurt continues to perform well in both these markets. In the U.K., retail sales for Yoplait are up 2% year-to-date, with modest share gains. And in France, Yoplait sales are growing at an 11% pace, adding a point of share so far this year. We're doing well in emerging markets too. On a constant currency basis, our sales in China are up 19% so far this year, led by Häagen-Dazs and Wanchai Ferry. In India, our business is much smaller, but we'll open a total of 6 Häagen-Dazs shops in this market by year end. Multigrain and Nature Valley granola bars are also performing well contributing to 16% sales growth in India so far this year. In total, our International business is on track for another year of good growth in sales and operating profit. Our base business is doing well and the integration of Yoplait International has proceeded smoothly.
Turning to U.S. Retail. Net sales grew 4% in the third quarter, driven by net price realization and mix. Through 9 months, net sales are up 3% in total, with growth in 5 of 7 divisions. Slide 38 shows our consumer movement across measured and non-tracked channels combined. As you can see, we are generating good growth in the majority of our categories. We have driven this growth with a steady stream of product news and innovation across our brands. For example, our cereal business have posted share gains over the past several years as we continue to bring product needs to the category. And this year is no different. Our dollar share has increased, up 0.5 a share point in the third quarter alone. We're seeing good growth across our cereal portfolio, established brands such as Cinnamon Toast Crunch and Honey Nut Cheerios and the Chex franchise are posting solid retail sales growth so far this year. And we've had good contributions from new products too, including Fiber One 80 Calories cereal, a new flavor of Cascadian Farm Granola and Dulce de Leche Cheerios and Frosted Toast Crunch launched in January. And we launched the Peanut Butter MultiGrain Cheerios in January as well. This new cereal is off to a very strong start. In less than 3 months, it holds nearly 1 point of dollar share, making it the single biggest new cereal amongst 17 new launches in the category in January. Innovation is driving growth for our grain snacks too. Over the years, we've added new varieties to our snack bars, driving good sales and share gains. We've kept that growth momentum growing this year, with several distinctive new items. Nature Valley Thins contain just 90 calories or less per serving. Fiber One Brownies has been a terrific success. They're on track to reach $120 million in year 1 retail sales. And for consumers looking for added protein for energy or weight management, Nature Valley Protein Bars contain 10 grams of protein and 5 grams of fiber per serving. Innovation also contributed to a good soup season for Progresso. New flavors with strong advertising at 2% sales gain for Progresso in measured channels fiscal year-to-date, including 6% baseline growth. We've increased prices through a reduction in promotional spending and we'll work to keep the momentum going with more product news coming this summer.
We're bringing innovation to our yogurt business too. In the kids segment, we have new flavor combinations of Go-GURT value packs and a reformulated Trix yogurt with no artificial colors or flavors. In the adult segment, we launched Greek yogurt parfaits, new flavors of Greek multipacks and a 4-flavor line lactose-free Yoplait. We're bringing news to many different segments of the U.S. yogurt market and we're supporting these various initiatives with distinctive advertising messages. Our current TV campaigns are generating an 18% increase in gross rating point across our adult core cup lines so far this year. And we'll have lots more yogurt innovation to talk to consumers about this summer.
In total, it's been a very good year for product innovation across our U.S. Retail business. We're bringing new products to all parts of the store from the freezer case to the dairy section, to the Center aisles and several of our new introductions like Peanut Butter MultiGrain Cheerios, Fiber One Brownies and Yoplait Light Granola Parfaits are among the most successful new items in the industry this past year. Let me touch on one final U.S. Retail business. As you know, natural and organic foods are a fast-growing category. Net sales for our Small Planet Foods division have grown at a 14% compound rate over the past 5 years. And net sales are up double digits again so far this year. In calendar 2008, we added LÄRABAR to the Small Planet Foods portfolio. Sales for these all-natural fruit and nut bars have been growing by more than 30% over the past 2 years as we've added -- as we've expanded distribution beyond natural and organic stores to other retail outlets. In January, we added Hoover Bars to this line, they are in a phase launch and will be broadly available by this summer. And just last month, we added The Food Should Taste Good line to our portfolio. Sales for natural salty snacks are growing at a double-digit pace so we see great opportunities for this line of tortilla and sweet potato chips. Traditional grocery stores currently account for just 25% of retail distribution for this brand. So we're excited about the prospects for expanding availability for these great tasting snacks. We are continuing to support all of our brands with strong levels of consumer marketing investment. For the year-to-date, our media spending is up 5% across U.S. Retail. And we've been increasing the gross rating points for our TV ads as well, up 3% year-to-date. We'll finish up the year with another quarter of good brand building events. It's Pillsbury Bake-Off Season and this year, the winner of the 45th Pillsbury Bake-Off contest will be announced live next week on a special broadcast of the Martha Stewart show. recovery, one of the largest Hispanic marketing platforms in the U.S. is currently hosting a music giveaway event, including in-store and online promotions. Consumers get free music download codes when they purchase select General Mills products. This event culminates in the chance to win a trip to Univision's annual concert in New York City this May. And March Madness is in full swing again this year with Betty Bracket on bettycrocker.com and consumers can vote online for their favorite party food recipes. So for our U.S. Retail business in total, we've got good momentum on many of our established good businesses. Our new products are performing well and we're investing across the portfolio with increased marketing support. We expect this business segment to show continued good sales growth and improved profit performance in the final quarter of the year. So I'd wrap up this morning's General Mills update this way. Fiscal 2012 has presented a particularly challenging operating environment with commodity inflation the highest we've seen in 30 years and more than double the average annual rate we expect to see going forward. In addition, slow economic recovery has kept many consumer budgets under pressure. These factors caused us to plan fiscal 2012 with a rate of EPS growth below our long-term model. And as you know, last month, we revised our EPS guidance to a level behind our original targets. In this environment, we've made strategic choices that increased our worldwide sales base and strengthened our portfolio. We made acquisitions that expanded our participation in 2 fast-growing food categories, yogurt and natural and organic foods. We sustained a high level of new product activity across all 3 of our business segments, and we increased advertising and media investment along with sales.  As a result of these actions, General Mills is on pace to report record-level net sales and adjusted diluted EPS for 2012 in total. And we believe our actions have positioned the company well for continued growth in 2013 and beyond. So thanks to all of you for your interest in General Mills. We'd now be very happy to take your questions. Operator, would you please get us started?"

As far as Q3, there are a couple of dynamics at play. As you can imagine the volume as we said, came in a little lighter than we expected U.S. they had 2 impact on us. One is a bit of deleveraging in the plans but also from a mixed standpoint, U.S. from a segment standpoint, is our highest margin business so that ends up being a bit of a negative mix to us as well. And then lastly, we as I've noted in our working capital, we continue to work out our inventories and that had an impact on our gross margin's planned impact but that externally might not be fully modeled, probably up 30 basis points in the quarter. So I think those 3 factors were the ones that would have probably is vary from what may be previously model for gross margins."

So we're very, very diligent on all of that stuff for just the reasons that you highlighted.

I will tell you that, that is wonderfully a high-returning investments in all ways. We've got great new product innovation out of that investment. We get very creative HMM ideas and that's a very high returning spend for General Mills and we're very committed to sustaining growth in that area. The third area is the advertising area and here, over the last 4 or 5 years, we have grown at a rate higher than our rate of sales growth and we did that because it was clear that we really were behind our peer competitive set and we just wanted to get that spending level up to the right range. As we've said a few times now, we believe we're pretty much in that zone now and as we go forward, we would expect our rate of increase in ad spending to moderate and really to be more in line -- with much more in line with our rate of sales growth.

To Ken's point, if you look at last 2 or 3 years and if you strip out the market increase we have in our pension expense because of the drop in interest rates, our underlying admin expense has been essentially flat over those 3 years. It's been a focus of ours to ensure that we are putting our investment and we've taken a lot of internal actions HMM variety actions against admin just as we have done in our plans for a number of years. So I'd assure you we are getting focus. In terms of headcount itself, it has increased, it's increased because we've been building our International business. Our U.S. headcount actually over the last 3 years is essentially flat, and that includes some investments we've made in headcount in John for example, to build an internal sales force, we've added 300 people to move from a broker to internal sales force that not only do we think is more effective as John outlined for us this morning but we also know is cost beneficial to us versus the broker network that we had previously.

And as we see inflation come down, there's much less pricing coming through. We have stability, more or less, stability in consumer pricing stability in the promotional environment.

But I have to say, really if you look at us over the last 4 or 5 years, we've had steady increases in performance, very consistent increases in market share and we're driving that primarily through good innovation across a number of brands. and so whether it's the Cheerios franchise or the Chex franchise, which I think as you know appeals to folks are looking for good and products, that's growing at a higher rate, we have good performance in our kids brand.

And as you said, these are growing channels and we see very significant opportunities for continued growth. And so without attempting to go into the numbers, I think I can tell you that in most of those different sectors we have very solid growth rates and we are also because of the quality of our sales force and the kind of resources that we're putting in there, the important thing is that we're developing very strong insights about how their customer base might work, whether it's mass store or a dollar store or a drugstore, those consumers that go into those stores all have different behaviors and are looking for different things, particularly when they are looking for food products and we're getting very, very smart about what it is that the are looking for. And as a result, we're bringing them insight and we've become a very trusted partner in those channels and we're getting good growth there. So it's very important to us.

I guess I would add that the other opportunity that we have is there are a number of products today that start out in alternative or particularly in natural channels. And so we commented on this success of LÄRABAR in the natural channels sector, the very strong success of Food Should Taste Good and as those products gain scale in those channels, we don't have the opportunity to move them in the other direction, move them into the more mainstream channels and so you have products that developing different parts of the retail environment and then we can take them and study them and move them around into different places. And it's not just from the traditional to the alternative, can be from alternative to traditional.

Thanks for joining us this morning. As you see from our press release, third quarter performance was consistent with the guidelines we provided on February 17. We delivered sales growth in each of our 3 operating segment",1384,"Thanks, Kris, and hello, everyone. Thanks for joining us this morning. As you see from our press release, third quarter performance was consistent with the guidelines we provided on February 17. We delivered sales growth in each of our 3 operating segments with strong net price realization across our base business and good contributions from the international Yoplait business acquired last July. The quarter also includes strong contributions from new products and an 8% increase in advertising investment. Earnings were generally in line with year-ago levels due to this year's significant input cost pressure. 
Slide 5 summarize our results for the quarter. Sales totaled $4.1 billion, up 13%. Segment operating profit increased 1%. Net earnings attributable to General Mills totaled $392 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.58 as reported. These results include changes in the mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions as well as integration expenses from the international Yoplait acquisition. Excluding these items, adjusted diluted earnings per share totaled $0.55 for the quarter, $0.01 below year-ago results.
Slide 6 shows the components of our net sales growth. On an as-reported basis, including Yoplait International, net sales increased 13%. Pound volume contributed 10 percentage points of growth in the quarter, and net price realization and mix added 3 points of sales growth. Foreign exchange did not have a material effect on sales growth rate this quarter. Excluding the Yoplait acquisition, net sales grew 5% and expected pound volume was lower in the quarter, down 3 percentage points. Price and mix contributed 8 points of sales growth. 
As I mentioned a moment ago, all 3 of our business segments contributed to this quarter's sales increase. U.S. Retail net sales grew 4%. International sales were up 51%, led by international Yoplait acquisition. But excluding Yoplait, International sales still increased at a high single-digit rate and net sales for our Bakeries and Foodservice segment rose 6%. 
Slide 8 outlines our third quarter gross margin performance. On a reported basis, gross margins declined to 36.6%. This includes the impact of mark-to-market changes in the value of our grain inventories and commodity hedges we'll use in future periods. Excluding mark-to-market effects, our gross margins declined 280 basis points in the quarter. The addition of Yoplait International to our business mix accounts for roughly 1/3 of that decline. The remainder reflects margin contraction for our base business, primarily due to higher input costs and lower U.S. Retail volumes. Looking at the full year, our original plans for 2011 assumed a 100 basis point contraction in gross margin for the base business with the addition of Yoplait International further reducing gross margin this year. We currently expect fiscal 2012 gross margins will be, in total, roughly 250 basis points below the prior year excluding mark-to-market effects in both periods. 
Slide 9 summarizes our segment operating profit in the quarter. U.S. Retail profit declined 4% reflecting higher input costs, lower volumes and increased media investment. International profit increased 40% led by strong contributions from Yoplait. And Bakeries and Foodservice profit matched year-ago levels despite sharply higher input costs and a difficult comparison to strong grain merchandising earnings a year ago. In total, segment operating profit rose 1% to reach $675 million. After-tax earnings from joint ventures rose sharply in the quarter. Good net sales growth and a lapping of the tax restructuring charges, Cereal Partners Worldwide, last year contributed to the earnings increase. On a constant-currency basis, CPW sales were up 7% led by growth from the Nesquik and Chocapic brands. Constant-currency sales for Häagen-Dazs Japan increased 3%. 
In the fourth quarter, we expect joint venture profits will fall below stronger year-ago levels. And for the full year, we now expect after-tax earnings from joint ventures will be down from 2011 levels. Earnings for Häagen-Dazs Japan will be below year-ago levels due to the difficult economic environment in Japan following the earthquake and tsunami a year ago. That being said, recovery for this business is running a bit ahead of our plan. CPW earnings will also be below year-ago levels due to one-time adjustment to tax reserve related to prior years and earlier phasing of expenses for new manufacturing capacity in emerging markets, including Malaysia, Turkey, South Africa and Brazil. CPW volume and sales growth in the underlying business remain strong. 
Completing our review of the income statement, corporate unallocated expenses, excluding mark-to-market effects, were slightly lower in the quarter. This year's total includes $4 million of onetime integration costs for Yoplait. Last year's total included an $11 million charge to increase environmental reserves. Interest expense increased 13% in the quarter, driven by increased level of overall debt with the addition of Yoplait and the pre-funding of our February bond maturity. 
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 32.7% as reported. Excluding items affecting comparability, the tax rate was 32.0% this year compared to 31.6% a year ago. We now expect our full year tax rate to be roughly 32%, excluding items affecting comparability. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Slide 12 shows the components of core working capital. In the quarter where net sales increased 13%, our core working capital declined 4% as our focus on inventory reduction drove improved working capital efficiency. Increased levels of accounts receivable and accounts payable, primarily from the Yoplait acquisition, were largely offsetting the quarter. 
Year-to-date cash flow from operations totaled roughly $1.7 million dollars, a 33% increase versus the first 9 months of 2011. Planned inventory reductions, changes in the market value of open grain contracts and foreign currency hedges and the timing of consumer marketing accruals all contributed to the increase. 
Slide 14 summarizes our financial performance through the first 9 months of the year. Net sales increased 12% as reported and grew 6% excluding the Yoplait acquisition. Despite significantly higher input costs and an 8% increase in media expense, segment operating profit matched year-ago levels. This year-to-date results include solid contributions from our international Yoplait acquisition. And our adjusted diluted earnings per share totaled $1.96, in line with the year-ago performance. 
As we communicated last month, our third quarter results reflected weak volumes, weak sales and volume trends across U.S. food categories in measured channels. Slide 15 shows that across the 25 categories where we compete, consumer retail sales growth in non-measured channels continued at a strong pace in the third quarter. However, consumer takeaway in measured channels moderated. We believe reduced trade merchandising activity was a key driver of the performance in measured outlets. In the third quarter, measured channel merchandise volume declined 7% across our categories as food manufacturers increased promoted price points. We expect volume trends to moderate across U.S. food categories in the months ahead as consumers adjust to the new price points. 
Turning to the fourth quarter, we expect to achieve good sales and EPS growth. Sales growth will reflect strong net price realization across our base business and incremental sales for the Yoplait acquisition. We have a higher level of new product activity in the market and we have increased media support behind our brands. Our rate of gross margin decline is expected to moderate in the fourth quarter. Our tax rate will be lower and effective cost management is expected to keep fourth quarter corporate unallocated expenses below year-ago levels. 
And so for fiscal 2012 in total, we are tracking somewhat behind our original profit target, but the year is unfolding largely as we outlined last summer. We expect to deliver double-digit growth in net sales with significant contributions from Yoplait International, strong levels of product news and innovation and increased levels of consumer marketing support. Gross margin, as a percent of sales, will be below year-ago levels, reflecting higher year-on-year input costs and a business mix shift to include Yoplait International. We expect segment operating profit will be above year-ago levels, including increased media investment. Operating profits will include solid contributions from Yoplait International. And we expect to deliver EPS of $2.53 to $2.55 per share. As a reminder, this guidance excludes mark-to-market effects in Yoplait integration costs. 
In my remarks this morning, I've given some perspective on trends for U.S. food at home. Now I'd like to turn the call over to John Machuzick who will discuss the trends for Food-Away-From-Home and the performance of our Bakeries and Foodservice business. John?"

I know some of you are wondering about a potential rebound in the restaurant industry given good calendar year-end results posted by a few of the major quick-service restaurants chains. The commercial restaurant channel has posted modest sales growth over the past several months, but traffic growth is still quite low. And remember, these growth levels are off of historic lows. The fact remains that consumers are still cautious given a slow economy and rising gas prices, so the foodservice industry is still facing some headwinds. 
Technomics projects that the foodservice industry will post nominal growth of a little less than 3% in calendar 2012. This would be a slight improvement over last year. The majority of this growth is expected to be price-driven. As you can see on Slide 21, real growth, which strips away the impact of price inflation, is expected to be essentially flat in 2012. However, there are channels that are expected to post growth, including quick-serve restaurants, schools, lodging, hospitals and convenience stores. It's these channels where we've been focusing our efforts. 
As we discussed at the beginning of the fiscal year, our annual plan called for pricing-driven net sales growth above our long-term model, which calls for low single-digit growth. And we targeted a mid-single-digit decline in segment operating profit because of significant cost inflation and the fact that we are comparing against record grain merchandising earnings last year. We remain broadly on track to meet these goals this year. 
Net sales for our Bakeries and Foodservice segment grew 6% in the third quarter, driven by pricing, with volume essentially flat. For the year-to-date, our sales were up 10% with volume matching year-ago levels. This performance is well ahead of the industry. And as you can see on Slide 23, we posted good growth in all 3 sectors of our business. Segments operating profit was essentially flat to last year in the quarter and was down 5% for the year-to-date due to increased input costs and the lapping of last year's higher grain merchandising earnings. 
Let me describe how we're leveraging our brands in some of the growing foodservice channels. We work with a number of the largest quick-serve restaurant chains providing customized products from pizza crust to yogurt to cinnamon rolls. We're also partnering with key accounts to build their menus for breakfast, which continues to be the fastest-growing daypart for restaurants. We see this channel as a good growth opportunity for us because many national accounts are increasingly receptive to offering customers well-known consumer-branded products. 
Breakfast programs in K through 12 schools have been growing at a 5% compound rate over the past 3 calendar years. Our business in this channel is outpacing that growth. Recent legislation for the K through 12 school nutrition program recommends more whole grains at breakfast. This new guideline doesn't go into effect until 2013, but it represents an opportunity for us to continue to expand our offerings in schools. We are already the cereal category leader in school breakfast programs. All of our Big G cereals contain more whole grain than any other single ingredient. In addition, our line of hot breakfast items has been a big hit in schools, with sales nearly doubling so far this year. These Pillsbury-branded products are easy for the operators to prepare. They can be heated and served right in the package for the kids. And they contain between 16 and 24 grams of whole grain per serving. 
And we're also seeing good performance on Trix Yogurt in K through 12 schools with a reformulated product that contains no artificial colors or flavors. 
College enrollment in the U.S. has been increasing at a 4% compound rate over the past 3 years, so this is another attractive channel for growth. College students like cereal and 4 out of the top 5 cereals in college and university cafeterias are General Mills products, with Lucky Charms having the highest cereal penetration on campuses. Yogurt also is a key business driver in this channel. This includes yogurt parfaits, which have become increasingly popular in foodservice outlets. Our Yoplait ParfaitPro pouches give operators a fast and easy way to make layered yogurt parfaits. This product has contributed double-digit compound growth on our bulk yogurt business over the past 3 years and we got much more yogurt innovation coming this summer. 
In convenience stores, our snacks sales have been increasing at a 13% rate over the past 4 years. We've been growing distribution on existing snack lines like Chex Mix and we've developed unique items for these outlets such as our line of Betty Crocker dessert snack bars and Wheaties Fuel bars. We're working on more new snack items to continue to leverage this growing food outlet. 
So across the fastest growing foodservice channels, we're focusing on our great portfolio of brands. For the year-to-date across all Foodservice channels, sales of our Big G cereals have grown at a 4% rate, yogurt sales were up 3% and our snacks sales were up 13%. 
In addition to these strong brands, we also bring strong sales capabilities to our customers. Back in 2008, we began converting our foodservice sales force from broker to direct. Today, our national sales force represents 90% of our sales in away-from-home channels. Our salespeople are bringing unique consumer insights and category management capabilities to our customers. We believe this gives us a  strong competitive advantage, and our customers seem to agree. In 2011, we received supplier of the year awards from 13 of our customers. We're ranked #3 in the most recent Kantar PowerRanking for foodservice sales. 
By focusing on growing channels and branded product innovation, we've been increasing the profitability of our business. Over the past 5 years, our operating profit has grown at a 19% compound growth rate. Our profit margin has expanded by 900 basis points to reach a level very near General Mills' corporate average. As I said earlier, in fiscal 2012, our operating profit and margins will decline somewhat, reflecting the impact of lower grain merchandising earnings and sharply higher input cost inflation. But over the long term, we expect sales to grow at a low single-digit compound rate and our operating profit should grow faster than sales. 
We like the long-term growth prospects we see for this business. While Technomic industry projections to 2015 show a modest shift to more food eaten at home, U.S. Food-Away-From-Home will still generate over $0.5 trillion in total sales, and that's a good growth market for General Mills and our brands. 
In summary, the team of people in General Mills Brands on the Go division is generating strong results. We're outperforming the foodservice industry on the strength of our products and execution in growing channels, and with 9 months under our belt, we're on pace to deliver our full year sales and profit targets. The foodservice industry continues to be challenging, but we're encouraged by current trends in the channels where we compete and we see good opportunities for future growth. As the U.S. economic outlook brightens, we expect foodservice industry sales trends to accelerate. We think we're well positioned in the right channels with solid brands to leverage that growth. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Ken Powell."

You just heard about the very good results that John Machuzick and his team are posting in our Bakeries and Foodservice segment.

You just heard about the very good results that John Machuzick and his team are posting in our Bakeries and Foodservice segment. I'm going to review performance in our other 2 business segments beginning with International. As Chris O'Leary told you on the second quarter earnings call, our International segment is performing quite well this year. Slide 34 shows constant-currency sales growth rates for the latest quarter. In total, International net sales were up 53%. Sales in Canada grew 37%, led by cereal, Old El Paso Mexican products and the addition of Liberté yogurt. In Latin America, sales were up 12%. Net sales more than doubled in the Europe, reflecting the addition of Yoplait yogurt and high single-digit sales growth on our base business. And in the Asia Pacific region, sales grew 15% with good contributions from China and Australia.
We're performing well in many of our established markets. Despite continued economic challenges in Western Europe, we're posting good growth across our base business. For example, in the U.K., sales in constant currency are up 7% year-to-date with particularly strong growth on Nature Valley granola bars. In France, constant-currency sales are up 16% so far this year on the strength of Häagen-Dazs Secret Sensations and increased in-store marketing on Old El Paso dinner kits. In addition, Yoplait yogurt continues to perform well in both these markets. In the U.K., retail sales for Yoplait are up 2% year-to-date, with modest share gains. And in France, Yoplait sales are growing at an 11% pace, adding 1 point of share so far this year. 
We're doing well in emerging markets, too. On a constant-currency basis, our sales in China are up 19% so far this year, led by Häagen-Dazs and Wanchai Ferry. In India, our business is much smaller, but we'll open a total of 6 Häagen-Dazs shops in this market by year end. Multi-Grain Atta flour and Nature Valley granola bars are also performing well, contributing to 16% sales growth in India so far this year. 
In total, our International business is on track for another year of good growth in sales and operating profit. Our base business is doing well and the integration of Yoplait International has proceeded smoothly.
Turning to U.S. Retail. Net sales grew 4% in the third quarter, driven by net price realization and mix. Through 9 months, net sales are up 3% in total with growth in 5 of 7 divisions. Slide 38 shows our consumer movement across measured and non-tracked channels combined. As you can see, we are generating good growth in the majority of our categories. We've driven this growth with a steady stream of product news and innovation across our brands. For example, our cereal business has posted share gains over the past several years as we continue to bring product news to the category, and this year is no different. Our dollar share has increased up 0.5 a share point in the third quarter alone. We're seeing good growth across our cereal portfolio. Established brands such as Cinnamon Toast Crunch, Honey Nut Cheerios and the Chex franchise are posting solid retail sales growth so far this year. And we've had good contributions from new products, too, including Fiber One 80 Calories cereal, a new flavor of Cascadian Farm Granola and Dulce de Leche Cheerios and Frosted Toast Crunch launched in January. And we launched Peanut Butter MultiGrain Cheerios in January as well. This new cereal is off to a very strong start. In less than 3 months, it holds nearly 1 point of dollar share, making it the single biggest new cereal amongst 17 new launches in the category in January. 
Innovation is driving growth for our grain snacks, too. Over the years, we've added new varieties to our snack bars, driving good sales and share gains. We've kept that growth momentum going this year with several distinctive new items. Nature Valley Thins contain just 90 calories or less per serving. Fiber One Brownies have been a terrific success. They're on track to reach $120 million in year 1 retail sales. And for consumers looking for added protein for energy or weight management, Nature Valley Protein Bars contain 10 grams of protein and 5 grams of fiber per serving. 
Innovation also contributed to a good soup season for Progresso. New flavors and strong advertising have fueled a 2% sales gain for Progresso in measured channels fiscal year-to-date, including 6% baseline growth. We've increased prices through a reduction in promotional spending and we'll work to keep the momentum going with more product news coming this summer.
We're bringing innovation to our yogurt business, too. In the kids segment, we have new flavor combinations of Go-GURT value packs and a reformulated Trix yogurt with no artificial colors or flavors. In the adult segment, we've launched Greek yogurt parfaits, new flavors of Greek multipacks and a 4-flavor line of lactose-free Yoplait. 
We're bringing news to many different segments of the U.S. yogurt market and we're supporting these various initiatives with distinctive advertising messages. Our current TV campaigns are generating an 18% increase in gross rating points across our adult core cup lines so far this year. And we'll have lots more yogurt innovation to talk to consumers about this summer.
In total, it's been a very good year for product innovation across our U.S. Retail business. We're bringing new products to all parts of the store from the freezer case to the dairy section, to the center aisles and several of our new introductions like Peanut Butter MultiGrain Cheerios, Fiber One Brownies and Yoplait Light Granola Parfaits are among the most successful new items in the industry this past year. 
Let me touch on one final U.S. Retail business. As you know, natural and organic foods are a fast-growing category. Net sales for our Small Planet Foods division have grown at a 14% compound rate over the past 5 years. And net sales are up double digits again so far this year. In calendar 2008, we added LÄRABAR to the Small Planet Foods portfolio. Sales for these all-natural fruit and nut bars have been growing by more than 30% over the past 2 years as we've added -- as we've expanded distribution beyond natural and organic stores to other retail outlets. In January, we added Über bars to this line. They are in a phase launch and will be broadly available by this summer. And just last month, we added the Food Should Taste Good line to our portfolio. Sales for natural salty snacks are growing at a double-digit pace so we see great opportunities for this line of tortilla and sweet potato chips. Traditional grocery stores currently account for just 25% of retail distribution for this brand, so we're excited about the prospects for expanding availability for these great-tasting snacks. 
We are continuing to support all of our brands with strong levels of consumer marketing investment. For the year-to-date, our media spending is up 5% across U.S. Retail. And we've been increasing the gross rating points for our TV ads as well, up 3% year-to-date. We'll finish up the year with another quarter of good brand-building events. It's Pillsbury Bake-Off season and this year, the winner of the 45th Pillsbury Bake-Off contest will be announced live next week on a special broadcast of the Martha Stewart show. 
Qué Rica Vida, one of the largest Hispanic marketing platforms in the U.S., is currently hosting a music giveaway event, including in-store and online promotions. Consumers get free music download codes when they purchase select General Mills products. This event culminates in the chance to win a trip to Univision's annual concert in New York City this May. 
And March Madness is in full swing again this year with Betty Brackets on bettycrocker.com. Consumers can vote online for their favorite party food recipes. 
So for our U.S. Retail business in total, we've got good momentum on many of our established businesses. Our new products are performing well, and we're investing across the portfolio with increased marketing support. We expect this business segment to show continued good sales growth and improved profit performance in the final quarter of the year. 
So I'd wrap up this morning's General Mills update this way. Fiscal 2012 has presented a particularly challenging operating environment with commodity inflation the highest we've seen in 30 years and more than double the average annual rate we expect to see going forward. In addition, slow economic recovery has kept many consumer budgets under pressure. These factors caused us to plan fiscal 2012 with a rate of EPS growth below our long-term model. And as you know, last month, we revised our EPS guidance to a level behind our original target. In this environment, we've made strategic choices that increased our worldwide sales base and strengthened our portfolio. We made acquisitions that expanded our participation in 2 fast-growing food categories, yogurt and natural and organic foods. We sustained a high level of new product activity across all 3 of our business segments and we increased advertising and media investment along with sales.  As a result of these actions, General Mills is on pace to report record-level net sales and adjusted diluted EPS for 2012 in total. And we believe our actions have positioned the company well for continued growth in 2013 and beyond. So thanks to all of you for your interest in General Mills.

As the folks who have been so focused on HMM and CI and all those kind of disciplines for 5 or 6 years, I think the first thing I want to assure you is that -- you said it's time to take a look at these costs. I will tell you we are constantly looking at all of these costs and Don will comment here in just a minute, but we're very focused on admin expense, particularly in the U.S. That has grown and we'll talk about the detail that you need to understand on that, but sort of on a like-for-like basis, that has grown at less than the rate of sales in the last 3 or 4 years, and the last 2 years it's been flat. So we're very, very diligent on all of that stuff for just the reasons that you highlighted. And I think you also commented on R&D spending, which has varied for us over the last 5 or 6 years between kind of low and mid-single-digit rates of increase. I will tell you that, that is wonderfully high-returning investments in all ways. We get great new product innovation out of that investment. We get very creative HMM ideas, so that's a very high-returning spend for General Mills and we're very committed to sustaining growth in that area. I think the third area is the advertising area, and here, over the last 4 or 5 years, we've grown at a rate higher than our rate of sales growth and we did that because it was clear that we really were behind our peer competitive set and we just wanted to get that spending level up to the right range. As we've said a few times now, we believe we're pretty much in that zone now and as we go forward, we would expect our rate of increase in ad spending to moderate and really to be more in line with -- much more in line with our rate of sales growth.

And rob, first off, I think your piece was very good yesterday. We all read it with interest and I particularly appreciate when you looked at our SG&A, you commented that we're investing in the right things and I think that's very true. And I think Ken hit on some of those with R&D and our advertising. And we focused on our admin expenses, so the SG&A less those 2 items. To Ken's point, if you look over the last 3 years and you strip out the marked increase we've had in our pension expense because of the drop in interest rates, our underlying admin expense has been essentially flat over those 3 years. It's been a focus of ours to ensure that we are thinking about where we are putting our investment and we've taken a lot of internal actions, HMM-variety actions, against admin just as we have done in our plans for a number of years. So I'd assure you that is getting a focus. In terms of headcount itself, it has increased. It's increased because we've been building our International business. Our U.S. headcount actually over the last 3 years is essentially flat and that includes some investments we've made in headcount in John's area, for example, to build an internal sales force where we've added over 300 people to move from a broker to internal sales force that not only do we think is more effective as John outlined for us this morning, but we also know is cost beneficial to us versus the broker network that we had previously. So rest assured that is getting a focus and the results are coming through over the last couple of years."

I mean our belief is that we've -- I mean, clearly it's been a tough year. We've had very, very high inflation across the industry, which led to unusually high levels of price increases, which led to volume elasticities and declines that we've seen. And so it's been challenging. But this is the highest inflation that I've seen in my career at General Mills and our strong belief going forward is that it will moderate, clearly moderate from that. And as we see inflation come down, there's much less pricing coming through. We have stability in -- more or less stability in consumer prices, stability in the promotional environment. And we strongly believe that the volume will stabilize, their unit volume will stabilize and those will all be good things. And then as you said, we then -- it's up to us to make our own way by doing the things that grow our categories and we know what those are: it's good brand building, it's good innovation ideas that come out of our R&D teams, and that's how we grow categories and that's why we stayed so true to that course during a very volatile period of time."

So all things being equal, we feel pretty good about the way the category dynamics are unfolding. And as I said, we expect prices to stabilize here as we go forward. In this quarter, as I said, we had some very good new products that we shipped, which helped the units in volume, and that was good. But I have to say, really if you look at us over the last 4 or 5 years, we've had steady increases in performance, very consistent increases in market share and we're driving that primarily through good innovation across a number of brands. And so whether it's the Cheerios franchise or the Chex franchise, which I think, as you know, appeals to folks are for looking for gluten-free products. That's growing at a high rate. We have good performance on our kid brand. So we really have a very strong portfolio there. We've had very good innovation. Those brands continue to respond and we're quite positive on the outlook for the category because of all the brand news and the nutrition innovation that's we're bringing. So while the third quarter had a new product boost long term, we continue to feel very good about our innovation and what we can do in that category."

Thanks for joining us this morning. As you see from our press release, third quarter performance was consistent with the guidelines we provided on February 17. We delivered sales growth in each of our 3 operating segment",1384,"Thanks, Kris, and hello, everyone. Thanks for joining us this morning. As you see from our press release, third quarter performance was consistent with the guidelines we provided on February 17. We delivered sales growth in each of our 3 operating segments with strong net price realization across our base business and good contributions from the international Yoplait business acquired last July. The quarter also includes strong contributions from new products and an 8% increase in advertising investment. Earnings were generally in line with year-ago levels due to this year's significant input cost pressure. 
Slide 5 summarizes our results for the quarter. Sales totaled $4.1 billion, up 13%. Segment operating profit increased 1%. Net earnings attributable to General Mills totaled $392 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.58 as reported. These results include changes in the mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions as well as integration expenses from the international Yoplait acquisition. Excluding these items, adjusted diluted earnings per share totaled $0.55 for the quarter, $0.01 below year-ago results.
Slide 6 shows the components of our net sales growth. On an as-reported basis, including Yoplait International, net sales increased 13%. Pound volume contributed 10 percentage points of growth in the quarter, and net price realization and mix added 3 points of sales growth. Foreign exchange did not have a material effect on sales growth rate this quarter. Excluding the Yoplait acquisition, net sales grew 5% and expected pound volume was lower in the quarter, down 3 percentage points. Price and mix contributed 8 points of sales growth. 
As I mentioned a moment ago, all 3 of our business segments contributed to this quarter's sales increase. U.S. Retail net sales grew 4%. International sales were up 51%, led by international Yoplait acquisition. But excluding Yoplait, International sales still increased at a high single-digit rate and net sales for our Bakeries and Foodservice segment rose 6%. 
Slide 8 outlines our third quarter gross margin performance. On a reported basis, gross margins declined to 36.6%. This includes the impact of mark-to-market changes in the value of our grain inventories and commodity hedges we'll use in future periods. Excluding mark-to-market effects, our gross margins declined 280 basis points in the quarter. The addition of Yoplait International to our business mix accounts for roughly 1/3 of that decline. The remainder reflects margin contraction for our base business, primarily due to higher input costs and lower U.S. Retail volumes. Looking at the full year, our original plans for 2011 assumed a 100-basis-point contraction in gross margin for the base business with the addition of Yoplait International further reducing gross margin this year. We currently expect fiscal 2012 gross margins will be, in total, roughly 250 basis points below the prior year excluding mark-to-market effects in both periods. 
Slide 9 summarizes our segment operating profit in the quarter. U.S. Retail profit declined 4% reflecting higher input costs, lower volume and increased media investment. International profit increased 40% led by strong contributions from Yoplait. And Bakeries and Foodservice profit matched year-ago levels despite sharply higher input costs and a difficult comparison to strong grain merchandising earnings a year ago. In total, segment operating profit rose 1% to reach $675 million. After-tax earnings from joint ventures rose sharply in the quarter. Good net sales growth and the lapping of the tax restructuring charges, Cereal Partners Worldwide last year contributed to the earnings increase. On a constant-currency basis, CPW sales were up 7% led by growth from the Nesquik and Chocapic brands. Constant-currency sales for Häagen-Dazs Japan increased 3%. 
In the fourth quarter, we expect joint venture profits will fall below stronger year-ago levels. And for the full year, we now expect after-tax earnings from joint ventures will be down from 2011 levels. Earnings for Häagen-Dazs Japan will be below year-ago levels due to the difficult economic environment in Japan following the earthquake and tsunami a year ago. That being said, recovery for this business is running a bit ahead of our plan. CPW earnings will also be below year-ago levels due to a one-time adjustment to tax reserve related to prior years and earlier phasing of expenses for new manufacturing capacity in emerging markets, including Malaysia, Turkey, South Africa and Brazil. CPW volume and sales growth in the underlying business remains strong. 
Completing our review of the income statement, corporate unallocated expenses, excluding mark-to-market effects, were slightly lower in the quarter. This year's total includes $4 million of onetime integration costs for Yoplait. Last year's total included an $11 million charge to increase an environmental reserve. Interest expense increased 13% in the quarter, driven by increased level of overall debt with the addition of Yoplait and the pre-funding of our February bond maturity. 
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 32.7% as reported. Excluding items affecting comparability, the tax rate was 32.0% this year compared to 31.6% a year ago. We now expect our full year tax rate to be roughly 32%, excluding items affecting comparability. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Slide 12 shows the components of core working capital. In a quarter where net sales increased 13%, our core working capital declined 4% as our focus on inventory reduction drove improved working capital efficiency. Increased levels of accounts receivable and accounts payable, primarily from the Yoplait acquisition, were largely offsetting in the quarter. 
Year-to-date cash flow from operations totaled roughly $1.7 million, a 33% increase versus the first 9 months of 2011. Planned inventory reductions, changes in the market value of open grain contracts and foreign currency hedges and the timing of consumer marketing accruals all contributed to the increase. 
Slide 14 summarizes our financial performance through the first 9 months of the year. Net sales increased 12% as reported and grew 6% excluding the Yoplait acquisition. Despite significantly higher input costs and an 8% increase in media expense, segment operating profit matched year-ago levels. These year-to-date results include solid contributions from our international Yoplait acquisition. And our adjusted diluted earnings per share totaled $1.96, in line with the year-ago performance. 
As we communicated last month, our third quarter results reflected weak volumes, weak sales and volume trends across U.S. food categories in measured channels. Slide 15 shows that across the 25 categories where we compete, consumer retail sales growth in non-measured channels continued at a strong pace in the third quarter. However, consumer takeaway in measured channels moderated. We believe reduced trade merchandising activity was a key driver of the performance in measured outlets. In the third quarter, measured channel merchandise volume declined 7% across our categories as food manufacturers increased promoted price points. We expect volume trends to moderate across U.S. food categories in the months ahead as consumers adjust to the new price points. 
Turning to the fourth quarter, we expect to achieve good sales and EPS growth. Sales growth will reflect strong net price realization across our base business and incremental sales from the Yoplait acquisition. We have a higher level of new product activity in the market and we have increased media support behind our brands. Our rate of gross margin decline is expected to moderate in the fourth quarter. Our tax rate will be lower and effective cost management is expected to keep fourth quarter corporate unallocated expenses below year-ago levels. 
And so for fiscal 2012 in total, we are tracking somewhat behind our original profit target, but the year is unfolding largely as we outlined last summer. We expect to deliver double-digit growth in net sales with significant contributions from Yoplait International, strong levels of product news and innovation and increased levels of consumer marketing support. Gross margin, as a percent of sales, will be below year-ago levels, reflecting higher year-on-year input cost and the business mix shift to include Yoplait International. We expect segment operating profit will be above year-ago levels, including increased media investment. Operating profits will include solid contributions from Yoplait International. And we expect to deliver EPS of $2.53 to $2.55 per share. As a reminder, this guidance excludes mark-to-market effects in Yoplait integration costs. 
In my remarks this morning, I've given some perspective on trends for U.S. food at home. Now I'd like to turn the call over to John Machuzick who will discuss the trends for Food-Away-From-Home and the performance of our Bakeries and Foodservice business. John?"

I'm pleased to be here to review our Bakery and Foodservice businesses. There are 3 key points I'd like to make this morning. First, while there are some bright spots in the U.S. foodservice industry, the overall environment remains challenging as we continue to deal with a cautious consumer. Second, we've been outperforming the industry in recent years, and we're building stronger share positions for our brands. And third, we're driving this good performance by focusing on the channels that show the most promising growth and by innovating on many of our branded product lines. 
Let me say a bit more on each of these points. I'll start with the foodservice industry environment. I know some of you are wondering about a potential rebound in the restaurant industry given good calendar year-end results posted by a few of the major quick-service restaurants chains. The commercial restaurant channel has posted modest sales growth over the past several months, but traffic growth is still quite low. And remember, these growth levels are off of historic lows. The fact remains that consumers are still cautious given a slow economy and rising gas prices, so the foodservice industry is still facing some headwinds. 
Technomics projects that the foodservice industry will post nominal growth of a little less than 3% in calendar 2012. This would be a slight improvement over last year. The majority of this growth is expected to be price-driven. As you can see on Slide 21, real growth, which strips away the impact of price inflation, is expected to be essentially flat in 2012. However, there are channels that are expected to post growth, including quick-serve restaurants, schools, lodging, hospitals and convenience stores. It's these channels where we've been focusing our efforts. 
As we discussed at the beginning of the fiscal year, our annual plan called for pricing-driven net sales growth above our long-term model, which calls for low single-digit growth. And we targeted a mid-single-digit decline in segment operating profit because of significant cost inflation and the fact that we are comparing against record grain merchandising earnings last year. We remain broadly on track to meet these goals this year. 
Net sales for our Bakery and Foodservice segment grew 6% in the third quarter, driven by pricing, with volume essentially flat. For the year-to-date, our sales were up 10% with volume matching year-ago levels. This performance is well ahead of the industry. And as you can see on Slide 23, we posted good growth in all 3 sectors of our business. Segment operating profits was essentially flat to last year in the quarter and was down 5% for the year-to-date due to increased input costs and the lapping of last year's higher grain merchandising earnings. 
Let me describe how we're leveraging our brands in some of the growing foodservice channels. We work with a number of the largest quick-serve restaurant chains providing customized products from pizza crusts to yogurt to cinnamon rolls. We're also partnering with key accounts to build their menus for breakfast, which continues to be the fastest-growing daypart for restaurants. We see this channel as a good growth opportunity for us because many national accounts are increasingly receptive to offering customers well-known consumer-branded products. 
Breakfast programs in K-12 schools have been growing at a 5% compound rate over the past 3 calendar years. Our business in this channel is outpacing that growth. Recent legislation for the K-12 school nutrition program recommends more whole grains at breakfast. This new guideline doesn't go into effect until 2013, but it represents an opportunity for us to continue to expand our offerings in schools. We are already the cereal category leader in school breakfast programs. All of our Big G cereals contain more whole grain than any other single ingredient. In addition, our line of hot breakfast items has been a big hit in schools, with sales nearly doubling so far this year. These Pillsbury-branded products are easy for the operators to prepare. They can be heated and served right in the package for the kids. And they contain between 16 and 24 grams of whole grain per serving. And we're also seeing good performance on Trix Yogurt in K-12 schools with a reformulated product that contains no artificial colors or flavors. 
College enrollment in the U.S. has been increasing at a 4% compound rate over the past 3 years, so this is another attractive channel for growth. College students like cereal and 4 out of the top 5 cereals in college and university cafeterias are General Mills products, with Lucky Charms having the highest cereal penetration on campuses. Yogurt also is a key business driver in this channel. This includes yogurt parfaits, which have become increasingly popular in foodservice outlets. Our Yoplait ParfaitPro pouches give operators a fast and easy way to make layered yogurt parfaits. This product has contributed double-digit compound growth on our bulk yogurt business over the past 3 years and we've got much more yogurt innovation coming this summer. 
In convenience stores, our snacks sales have been increasing at a 13% rate over the past 4 years. We've been growing distribution on existing snack lines like Chex Mix and we've developed unique items for these outlets such as our line of Betty Crocker dessert snack bars and Wheaties Fuel bars. We're working on more new snack items to continue to leverage this growing food outlet. 
So across the fastest growing foodservice channels, we're focusing on our great portfolio of brands. For the year-to-date across all Foodservice channels, sales of our Big G cereals have grown at a 4% rate, yogurt sales are up 3% and our snacks sales are up 13%. 
In addition to these strong brands, we also bring strong sales capabilities to our customers. Back in 2008, we began converting our foodservice sales force from broker to direct. Today, our national sales force represents 90% of our sales in away-from-home channels. Our salespeople are bringing unique consumer insights and category management capabilities to our customers. We believe this gives us a strong competitive advantage, and our customers seem to agree. In 2011, we received supplier of the year awards from 13 of our customers. We're ranked #3 in the most recent Kantar PowerRanking for foodservice sales. 
By focusing on growing channels and branded product innovation, we've been increasing the profitability of our business. Over the past 5 years, our operating profit has grown at a 19% compound growth rate. Our profit margin has expanded by 900 basis points to reach a level very near General Mills' corporate average. As I said earlier, in fiscal 2012, our operating profit and margins will decline somewhat, reflecting the impact of lower grain merchandising earnings and sharply higher input cost inflation. But over the long term, we expect sales to grow at a low single-digit compound rate and our operating profit should grow faster than sales. 
We like the long-term growth prospects we see for this business. While Technomic industry projections to 2015 show a modest shift to more food eaten at home, U.S. Food-Away-From-Home will still generate over $0.5 trillion in total sales, and that's a good growth market for General Mills and our brands. 
In summary, the team of people in General Mills Brands on the Go division is generating strong results. We're outperforming the foodservice industry on the strength of our products and execution in growing channels, and with 9 months under our belt, we're on pace to deliver our full year sales and profit targets. The foodservice industry continues to be challenging, but we're encouraged by current trends in the channels where we compete and we see good opportunities for future growth. As the U.S. economic outlook brightens, we expect foodservice industry sales trends to accelerate. We think we're well positioned in the right channels with solid brands to leverage that growth. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Ken Powell."

You just heard about the very good results that John Machuzick and his team are posting in our Bakeries and Foodservice segment. I'm going to review performance in our other 2 business segments beginning with International. 
As Chris O'Leary told you on the second quarter earnings call, our International segment is performing quite well this year. Slide 34 shows constant-currency sales growth rates for the latest quarter. In total, International net sales were up 53%. Sales in Canada grew 37%, led by cereal, Old El Paso Mexican products and the addition of Liberté yogurt. In Latin America, sales were up 12%. Net sales more than doubled in Europe, reflecting the addition of Yoplait yogurt and high single-digit sales growth on our base business. And in the Asia Pacific region, sales grew 15% with good contributions from China and Australia.
We're performing well in many of our established markets. Despite continued economic challenges in Western Europe, we're posting good growth across our base business. For example, in the U.K., sales in constant currency are up 7% year-to-date with particularly strong growth on Nature Valley Granola Bars. In France, constant-currency sales are up 16% so far this year on the strength of Häagen-Dazs Secret Sensations and increased in-store marketing on Old El Paso dinner kits. In addition, Yoplait yogurt continues to perform well in both these markets. In the U.K., retail sales for Yoplait are up 2% year-to-date, with modest share gains. And in France, Yoplait sales are growing at an 11% pace, adding 1 point of share so far this year. 
We're doing well in emerging markets, too. On a constant-currency basis, our sales in China are up 19% so far this year, led by Häagen-Dazs and Wanchai Ferry. In India, our business is much smaller, but we'll open a total of 6 Häagen-Dazs shops in this market by year end. Multi-Grain Atta flour and Nature Valley Granola Bars are also performing well, contributing to 16% sales growth in India so far this year.  In total, our International business is on track for another year of good growth in sales and operating profit. Our base business is doing well and the integration of Yoplait International has proceeded smoothly.
Turning to U.S. Retail. Net sales grew 4% in the third quarter, driven by net price realization and mix. Through 9 months, net sales are up 3% in total with growth in 5 of 7 divisions. Slide 38 shows our consumer movement across measured and non-tracked channels combined. As you can see, we are generating good growth in the majority of our categories. We've driven this growth with a steady stream of product news and innovation across our brands. For example, our cereal business has posted share gains over the past several years as we continue to bring product news to the category, and this year is no different. Our dollar share has increased up 0.5 a share point in the third quarter alone. 
We're seeing good growth across our cereal portfolio. Established brands such as Cinnamon Toast Crunch, Honey Nut Cheerios and the Chex franchise are posting solid retail sales growth so far this year. And we've had good contributions from new products, too, including Fiber One 80 Calories cereal, a new flavor of Cascadian Farm Granola and Dulce de Leche Cheerios and Frosted Toast Crunch launched in January. And we launched Peanut Butter MultiGrain Cheerios in January as well. This new cereal is off to a very strong start. In less than 3 months, it holds nearly 1 point of dollar share, making it the single biggest new cereal amongst 17 new launches in the category in January. 
Innovation is driving growth for our grain snacks, too. Over the years, we've added new varieties to our snack bars, driving good sales and share gains. We've kept that growth momentum going this year with several distinctive new items. Nature Valley Thins contain just 90 calories or less per serving. Fiber One Brownies have been a terrific success. They're on track to reach $120 million in year one retail sales. And for consumers looking for added protein for energy or weight management, Nature Valley Protein Bars contain 10 grams of protein and 5 grams of fiber per serving. 
Innovation also contributed to a good soup season for Progresso. New flavors and strong advertising have fueled a 2% sales gain for Progresso in measured channels fiscal year-to-date, including 6% baseline growth. We've increased prices through a reduction in promotional spending and we'll work to keep the momentum going with more product news coming this summer.
We're bringing innovation to our yogurt business, too. In the kids segment, we have new flavor combinations of Go-GURT value packs and a reformulated Trix yogurt with no artificial colors or flavors. In the adult segment, we've launched Greek yogurt parfaits, new flavors of Greek multipacks and a 4-flavor line of lactose-free Yoplait. 
We're bringing news to many different segments of the U.S. yogurt market and we're supporting these various initiatives with distinctive advertising messages. Our current TV campaigns are generating an 18% increase in gross rating points across our adult core cup lines so far this year. And we'll have lots more yogurt innovation to talk to consumers about this summer.
In total, it's been a very good year for product innovation across our U.S. Retail business. We're bringing new products to all parts of the store from the freezer case to the dairy section, to the center aisles and several of our new introductions like Peanut Butter MultiGrain Cheerios, Fiber One Brownies and Yoplait Light Granola Parfaits are among the most successful new items in the industry this past year. 
Let me touch on one final U.S. Retail business. As you know, natural and organic foods are a fast-growing category. Net sales for our Small Planet Foods division have grown at a 14% compound rate over the past 5 years. And net sales are up double digits again so far this year. In calendar 2008, we added LÄRABAR to the Small Planet Foods portfolio. Sales for these all-natural fruit and nut bars have been growing by more than 30% over the past 2 years as we've added -- as we've expanded distribution beyond natural and organic stores to other retail outlets. In January, we added Über bars to this line. They are in a phased launch and will be broadly available by this summer. And just last month, we added the Food Should Taste Good line to our portfolio. Sales for natural salty snacks are growing at a double-digit pace so we see great opportunities for this line of tortilla and sweet potato chips. Traditional grocery stores currently account for just 25% of retail distribution for this brand, so we're excited about the prospects for expanding availability for these great-tasting snacks. 
We are continuing to support all of our brands with strong levels of consumer marketing investment. For the year-to-date, our media spending is up 5% across U.S. Retail. And we've been increasing the gross rating points for our TV ads as well, up 3% year-to-date. We'll finish up the year with another quarter of good brand-building events. It's Pillsbury Bake-Off season and this year, the winner of the 45th Pillsbury Bake-Off contest will be announced live next week on a special broadcast of the Martha Stewart show. 
Qué Rica Vida, one of the largest Hispanic marketing platforms in the U.S., is currently hosting a music giveaway event, including in-store and online promotions. Consumers get free music download codes when they purchase select General Mills products. This event culminates in the chance to win a trip to Univision's annual concert in New York City this May. And March Madness is in full swing again this year with Betty's Brackets on bettycrocker.com. Consumers can vote online for their favorite party food recipes. 
So for our U.S. Retail business in total, we've got good momentum on many of our established businesses. Our new products are performing well, and we're investing across the portfolio with increased marketing support. We expect this business segment to show continued good sales growth and improved profit performance in the final quarter of the year. 
So I'd wrap up this morning's General Mills update this way. Fiscal 2012 has presented a particularly challenging operating environment with commodity inflation the highest we've seen in 30 years and more than double the average annual rate we expect to see going forward. In addition, slow economic recovery has kept many consumer budgets under pressure. These factors caused us to plan fiscal 2012 with a rate of EPS growth below our long-term model. And as you know, last month, we revised our EPS guidance to a level behind our original target. In this environment, we've made strategic choices that increased our worldwide sales base and strengthened our portfolio. We made acquisitions that expanded our participation in 2 fast-growing food categories, yogurt and natural and organic foods. We sustained a high level of new product activity across all 3 of our business segments and we increased advertising and media investment along with sales.  As a result of these actions, General Mills is on pace to report record-level net sales and adjusted diluted EPS for 2012 in total. And we believe our actions have positioned the company well for continued growth in 2013 and beyond. So thanks to all of you for your interest in General Mills.

As far as Q3, there are a couple of dynamics at play. As you can imagine, the volume, as we said, came in a little lighter than we expected in U.S. RO that had 2 impacts on us. One is a bit of deleveraging in the plans, but also from a mix standpoint, U.S. are always -- are from a segment standpoint, is our highest-margin business, so that ends up being a bit of a negative mix to us as well. And then lastly, we -- as I noted in our working capital, we continue to work down our inventories and that had an impact on our gross margins; a planned impact, but one that externally may not be fully modeled, of probably about 30 basis points in the quarter.

As the folks who have been so focused on HMM and CI and all those kind of disciplines for 5 or 6 years, I think the first thing I want to assure you is that, you said is it time to take a look at these costs. I will tell you we are constantly looking at all of these costs, and Don will comment here in just a minute. But we're very focused on admin expense, particularly in the U.S. That has grown and we'll talk about the detail that you need to understand on that, but sort of on a like-for-like basis, that has grown at less than the rate of sales the last 3 or 4 years, and the last 2 years it's been flat. So we're very, very diligent on all of that stuff for just the reasons that you highlighted. I think you also commented on R&D spending, which has varied for us over the last 5 or 6 years between kind of low and mid-single-digit rates of increase. I will tell you that, that is a wonderfully high-returning investment in all ways. We get great new product innovation out of that investment. We get very creative HMM ideas, so that's a very high-returning spend for General Mills and we're very committed to sustaining growth in that area. I think the third area is the advertising area, and here, over the last 4 or 5 years, we've grown at a rate higher than our rate of sales growth. And we did that because it was clear that we really were behind our peer competitive set and we just wanted to get that spending level up to the right range. As we've said a few times now, we believe we're pretty much in that zone now and as we go forward, we would expect our rate of increase in ad spending to moderate and really to be more in line with -- much more in line with our rate of sales growth. So that's a few comments. I think, Don, you might want to jump with some more texture?"

And Rob, first off, I thought your piece was very good yesterday. We all read it with interest and I particularly appreciate when you looked at our SG&A, you commented that we're investing in the right things and I think that's very true. And I think Ken hit on some of those with R&D and our advertising. Let me focus on our admin expenses, so the SG&A less those 2 items. To Ken's point, if you look over the last 3 years and you strip out the marked increase we've had in our pension expense because of the drop in interest rates, our underlying admin expense has been essentially flat over those 3 years. It's been a focus of ours to ensure that we are thinking about where we're putting our investment and we've taken a lot of internal actions, HMM-variety actions, against admin just as we have done in our plans for a number of years. So I'd assure you that is getting a focus. In terms of headcount itself, it has increased. It's increased because we've been building our International business. Our U.S. headcount actually over the last 3 years is essentially flat. And that includes some investments we've made in headcount in John's area, for example, to build an internal sales force where we've added over 300 people to move from a broker to an internal sales force that not only do we think is more effective, as John outlined for us this morning, but we also know is cost beneficial to us versus the broker network that we had previously. So rest assured that it is getting a focus and the results are coming through over the last couple of years."

And so it's been challenging. But this is the highest inflation that I've seen in my career at General Mills and our strong belief going forward is that it will moderate, clearly moderate from that. And as we see inflation come down, there's much less pricing come through. We have stability in -- more or less stability in consumer prices, stability in the promotional environment. And we strongly believe, then, that volume will stabilize there, unit volume will stabilize and those will all be good things.

But I have to say, really if you look at us over the last 4 or 5 years, we've had steady increases in performance, very consistent increases in market share and we're driving that primarily through good innovation across a number of brands. And so whether it's the Cheerios franchise or the Chex franchise, which I think, as you know, it appeals to folks are for looking for gluten-free products. That's growing at a high rate. We had good performance on our kid brands. So we really have a very strong portfolio there. We've had very good innovation. Those brands continue to respond and we're quite positive on the outlook for the category because of all the brand news and the nutrition innovation that we're bringing.

And as we've seen, in most other categories, it's clearly related to the pricing and the increase in merch price points that we had to take this year. So we think that, that's a one-off situation. We -- as John commented in his remarks, while there is some growth in quick-serve restaurants, I mean, trust me, we calculate those numbers and we study those interactions and I will tell you that there's -- that's not where our volume is going. I think we're just suffering a little bit from the pricing that we saw this year and we're optimistic that as we see that stabilize and knowing the kind of innovation that we're going to bring going forward that we expect that category to continue to show good growth for us."

And we've got good opportunities to innovate and continue to expand within that range.

Whether it's a mass store or a dollar store or a drugstore, those – the consumers that go into those stores all have different behaviors and are looking for different things, particularly when they're looking for food products.

I guess I would add that the other opportunity that we have is there are a number of products today that start out in alternative or particularly in natural channels. And so we commented on the success of LÄRABAR in the natural channel sector, the very strong success of Food Should Taste Good and as those products gain scale in those channels, we then have the opportunity to move them in the other direction, move them into the more mainstream channels. And so you have products that develop in different parts of the retail environment and then we can take them and study them and move them around into different places.

Thanks for joining us this morning. As you see from our press release, third quarter performance was consistent with the guidelines we provided on February 17. We delivered sales growth in each of our 3 operating segment",1386,"Thanks, Kris, and hello, everyone. Thanks for joining us this morning. As you see from our press release, third quarter performance was consistent with the guidelines we provided on February 17. We delivered sales growth in each of our 3 operating segments with strong net price realization across our base business and good contributions from the international Yoplait business acquired last July. The quarter also includes strong contributions from new products and an 8% increase in advertising investment. Earnings were generally in line with year-ago levels due to this year's significant input cost pressure. 
Slide 5 summarizes our results for the quarter. Sales totaled $4.1 billion, up 13%. Segment operating profit increased 1%. Net earnings attributable to General Mills totaled $392 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.58 as reported. These results include changes in the mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions as well as integration expenses from the international Yoplait acquisition. Excluding these items, adjusted diluted earnings per share totaled $0.55 for the quarter, $0.01 below year-ago results.
Slide 6 shows the components of our net sales growth. On an as-reported basis, including Yoplait International, net sales increased 13%. Pound volume contributed 10 percentage points of growth in the quarter, and net price realization and mix added 3 points of sales growth. Foreign exchange did not have a material effect on sales growth rate this quarter. Excluding the Yoplait acquisition, net sales grew 5% and expected pound volume was lower in the quarter, down 3 percentage points. Price and mix contributed 8 points of sales growth. 
As I mentioned a moment ago, all 3 of our business segments contributed to this quarter's sales increase. U.S. Retail net sales grew 4%. International sales were up 51%, led by international Yoplait acquisition. But excluding Yoplait, International sales still increased at a high single-digit rate and net sales for our Bakeries and Foodservice segment rose 6%. 
Slide 8 outlines our third quarter gross margin performance. On a reported basis, gross margins declined to 36.6%. This includes the impact of mark-to-market changes in the value of our grain inventories and commodity hedges we'll use in future periods. Excluding mark-to-market effects, our gross margins declined 280 basis points in the quarter. The addition of Yoplait International to our business mix accounts for roughly 1/3 of that decline. The remainder reflects margin contraction for our base business, primarily due to higher input costs and lower U.S. Retail volumes. Looking at the full year, our original plans for 2011 assumed a 100 basis point contraction in gross margin for the base business with the addition of Yoplait International further reducing gross margin this year. We currently expect fiscal 2012 gross margins will be, in total, roughly 250 basis points below the prior year excluding mark-to-market effects in both periods. 
Slide 9 summarizes our segment operating profit in the quarter. U.S. Retail profit declined 4% reflecting higher input costs, lower volume and increased media investment. International profit increased 40% led by strong contributions from Yoplait. And Bakeries and Foodservice profit matched year-ago levels despite sharply higher input costs and a difficult comparison to strong grain merchandising earnings a year ago. In total, segment operating profit rose 1% to reach $675 million. After-tax earnings from joint ventures rose sharply in the quarter. Good net sales growth and the lapping of the tax restructuring charges, Cereal Partners Worldwide last year contributed to the earnings increase. On a constant-currency basis, CPW sales were up 7% led by growth from the Nesquik and Chocapic brands. Constant-currency sales for Häagen-Dazs Japan increased 3%. 
In the fourth quarter, we expect joint venture profits will fall below stronger year-ago levels. And for the full year, we now expect after-tax earnings from joint ventures will be down from 2011 levels. Earnings for Häagen-Dazs Japan will be below year-ago levels due to the difficult economic environment in Japan following the earthquake and tsunami a year ago. That being said, recovery for this business is running a bit ahead of our plan. CPW earnings will also be below year-ago levels due to a one-time adjustment to tax reserve related to prior years and earlier phasing of expenses for new manufacturing capacity in emerging markets, including Malaysia, Turkey, South Africa and Brazil. CPW volume and sales growth in the underlying business remains strong. 
Completing our review of the income statement, corporate unallocated expenses, excluding mark-to-market effects, were slightly lower in the quarter. This year's total includes $4 million of onetime integration costs for Yoplait. Last year's total included an $11 million charge to increase an environmental reserve. Interest expense increased 13% in the quarter, driven by increased level of overall debt with the addition of Yoplait and the pre-funding of our February bond maturity. 
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 32.7% as reported. Excluding items affecting comparability, the tax rate was 32.0% this year compared to 31.6% a year ago. We now expect our full year tax rate to be roughly 32%, excluding items affecting comparability. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Slide 12 shows the components of core working capital. In a quarter where net sales increased 13%, our core working capital declined 4% as our focus on inventory reduction drove improved working capital efficiency. Increased levels of accounts receivable and accounts payable, primarily from the Yoplait acquisition, were largely offsetting in the quarter. 
Year-to-date cash flow from operations totaled roughly $1.7 million, a 33% increase versus the first 9 months of 2011. Planned inventory reductions, changes in the market value of open grain contracts and foreign currency hedges and the timing of consumer marketing accruals all contributed to the increase. 
Slide 14 summarizes our financial performance through the first 9 months of the year. Net sales increased 12% as reported and grew 6% excluding the Yoplait acquisition. Despite significantly higher input costs and an 8% increase in media expense, segment operating profit matched year-ago levels. These year-to-date results include solid contributions from our international Yoplait acquisition. And our adjusted diluted earnings per share totaled $1.96, in line with the year-ago performance. 
As we communicated last month, our third quarter results reflected weak volumes, weak sales and volume trends across U.S. food categories in measured channels. Slide 15 shows that across the 25 categories where we compete, consumer retail sales growth in non-measured channels continued at a strong pace in the third quarter. However, consumer takeaway in measured channels moderated. We believe reduced trade merchandising activity was a key driver of the performance in measured outlets. In the third quarter, measured channel merchandise volume declined 7% across our categories as food manufacturers increased promoted price points. We expect volume trends to moderate across U.S. food categories in the months ahead as consumers adjust to the new price points. 
Turning to the fourth quarter, we expect to achieve good sales and EPS growth. Sales growth will reflect strong net price realization across our base business and incremental sales from the Yoplait acquisition. We have a higher level of new product activity in the market and we have increased media support behind our brands. Our rate of gross margin decline is expected to moderate in the fourth quarter. Our tax rate will be lower and effective cost management is expected to keep fourth quarter corporate unallocated expenses below year-ago levels. 
And so for fiscal 2012 in total, we are tracking somewhat behind our original profit target, but the year is unfolding largely as we outlined last summer. We expect to deliver double-digit growth in net sales with significant contributions from Yoplait International, strong levels of product news and innovation and increased levels of consumer marketing support. Gross margin, as a percent of sales, will be below year-ago levels, reflecting higher year-on-year input cost and the business mix shift to include Yoplait International. We expect segment operating profit will be above year-ago levels, including increased media investment. Operating profits will include solid contributions from Yoplait International. And we expect to deliver EPS of $2.53 to $2.55 per share. As a reminder, this guidance excludes mark-to-market effects in Yoplait integration costs. 
In my remarks this morning, I've given some perspective on trends for U.S. food at home. Now I'd like to turn the call over to John Machuzick who will discuss the trends for Food-Away-From-Home and the performance of our Bakeries and Foodservice business. John?"

I'm pleased to be here to review our Bakery and Foodservice businesses. There are 3 key points I'd like to make this morning. First, while there are some bright spots in the U.S. foodservice industry, the overall environment remains challenging as we continue to deal with a cautious consumer. Second, we've been outperforming the industry in recent years, and we're building stronger share positions for our brands. And third, we're driving this good performance by focusing on the channels that show the most promising growth and by innovating on many of our branded product lines. 
Let me say a bit more on each of these points. I'll start with the foodservice industry environment. I know some of you are wondering about a potential rebound in the restaurant industry given good calendar year-end results posted by a few of the major quick-service restaurants chains. The commercial restaurant channel has posted modest sales growth over the past several months, but traffic growth is still quite low. And remember, these growth levels are off of historic lows. The fact remains that consumers are still cautious given a slow economy and rising gas prices, so the foodservice industry is still facing some headwinds. 
Technomics projects that the foodservice industry will post nominal growth of a little less than 3% in calendar 2012. This would be a slight improvement over last year. The majority of this growth is expected to be price-driven. As you can see on Slide 21, real growth, which strips away the impact of price inflation, is expected to be essentially flat in 2012. However, there are channels that are expected to post growth, including quick-serve restaurants, schools, lodging, hospitals and convenience stores. It's these channels where we've been focusing our efforts. 
As we discussed at the beginning of the fiscal year, our annual plan called for pricing-driven net sales growth above our long-term model, which calls for low single-digit growth. And we targeted a mid-single-digit decline in segment operating profit because of significant cost inflation and the fact that we are comparing against record grain merchandising earnings last year. We remain broadly on track to meet these goals this year. 
Net sales for our Bakery and Foodservice segment grew 6% in the third quarter, driven by pricing, with volume essentially flat. For the year-to-date, our sales were up 10% with volume matching year-ago levels. This performance is well ahead of the industry. And as you can see on Slide 23, we posted good growth in all 3 sectors of our business. Segment operating profits was essentially flat to last year in the quarter and was down 5% for the year-to-date due to increased input costs and the lapping of last year's higher grain merchandising earnings. 
Let me describe how we're leveraging our brands in some of the growing foodservice channels. We work with a number of the largest quick-serve restaurant chains providing customized products from pizza crusts to yogurt to cinnamon rolls. We're also partnering with key accounts to build their menus for breakfast, which continues to be the fastest-growing daypart for restaurants. We see this channel as a good growth opportunity for us because many national accounts are increasingly receptive to offering customers well-known consumer-branded products. 
Breakfast programs in K-12 schools have been growing at a 5% compound rate over the past 3 calendar years. Our business in this channel is outpacing that growth. Recent legislation for the K-12 school nutrition program recommends more whole grains at breakfast. This new guideline doesn't go into effect until 2013, but it represents an opportunity for us to continue to expand our offerings in schools. We are already the cereal category leader in school breakfast programs. All of our Big G cereals contain more whole grain than any other single ingredient. In addition, our line of hot breakfast items has been a big hit in schools, with sales nearly doubling so far this year. These Pillsbury-branded products are easy for the operators to prepare. They can be heated and served right in the package for the kids. And they contain between 16 and 24 grams of whole grain per serving. And we're also seeing good performance on Trix Yogurt in K-12 schools with a reformulated product that contains no artificial colors or flavors. 
College enrollment in the U.S. has been increasing at a 4% compound rate over the past 3 years, so this is another attractive channel for growth. College students like cereal and 4 out of the top 5 cereals in college and university cafeterias are General Mills products, with Lucky Charms having the highest cereal penetration on campuses. Yogurt also is a key business driver in this channel. This includes yogurt parfaits, which have become increasingly popular in foodservice outlets. Our Yoplait ParfaitPro pouches give operators a fast and easy way to make layered yogurt parfaits. This product has contributed double-digit compound growth on our bulk yogurt business over the past 3 years and we've got much more yogurt innovation coming this summer. 
In convenience stores, our snacks sales have been increasing at a 13% rate over the past 4 years. We've been growing distribution on existing snack lines like Chex Mix and we've developed unique items for these outlets such as our line of Betty Crocker dessert snack bars and Wheaties Fuel bars. We're working on more new snack items to continue to leverage this growing food outlet. 
So across the fastest growing foodservice channels, we're focusing on our great portfolio of brands. For the year-to-date across all Foodservice channels, sales of our Big G cereals have grown at a 4% rate, yogurt sales are up 3% and our snacks sales are up 13%. 
In addition to these strong brands, we also bring strong sales capabilities to our customers. Back in 2008, we began converting our foodservice sales force from broker to direct. Today, our national sales force represents 90% of our sales in away-from-home channels. Our salespeople are bringing unique consumer insights and category management capabilities to our customers. We believe this gives us a strong competitive advantage, and our customers seem to agree. In 2011, we received supplier of the year awards from 13 of our customers. We're ranked #3 in the most recent Kantar PowerRanking for foodservice sales. 
By focusing on growing channels and branded product innovation, we've been increasing the profitability of our business. Over the past 5 years, our operating profit has grown at a 19% compound growth rate. Our profit margin has expanded by 900 basis points to reach a level very near General Mills' corporate average. As I said earlier, in fiscal 2012, our operating profit and margins will decline somewhat, reflecting the impact of lower grain merchandising earnings and sharply higher input cost inflation. But over the long term, we expect sales to grow at a low single-digit compound rate and our operating profit should grow faster than sales. 
We like the long-term growth prospects we see for this business. While Technomic industry projections to 2015 show a modest shift to more food eaten at home, U.S. Food-Away-From-Home will still generate over $0.5 trillion in total sales, and that's a good growth market for General Mills and our brands. 
In summary, the team of people in General Mills Brands on the Go division is generating strong results. We're outperforming the foodservice industry on the strength of our products and execution in growing channels, and with 9 months under our belt, we're on pace to deliver our full year sales and profit targets. The foodservice industry continues to be challenging, but we're encouraged by current trends in the channels where we compete and we see good opportunities for future growth. As the U.S. economic outlook brightens, we expect foodservice industry sales trends to accelerate. We think we're well positioned in the right channels with solid brands to leverage that growth. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Ken Powell."

As Chris O'Leary told you on the second quarter earnings call, our International segment is performing quite well this year. Slide 34 shows constant-currency sales growth rates for the latest quarter. In total, International net sales were up 53%. Sales in Canada grew 37%, led by cereal, Old El Paso Mexican products and the addition of Liberté yogurt. In Latin America, sales were up 12%. Net sales more than doubled in Europe, reflecting the addition of Yoplait yogurt and high single-digit sales growth on our base business. And in the Asia Pacific region, sales grew 15% with good contributions from China and Australia.
We're performing well in many of our established markets. Despite continued economic challenges in Western Europe, we're posting good growth across our base business. For example, in the U.K., sales in constant currency are up 7% year-to-date with particularly strong growth on Nature Valley Granola Bars. In France, constant-currency sales are up 16% so far this year on the strength of Häagen-Dazs Secret Sensations and increased in-store marketing on Old El Paso dinner kits. In addition, Yoplait yogurt continues to perform well in both these markets. In the U.K., retail sales for Yoplait are up 2% year-to-date, with modest share gains. And in France, Yoplait sales are growing at an 11% pace, adding 1 point of share so far this year. 
We're doing well in emerging markets, too. On a constant-currency basis, our sales in China are up 19% so far this year, led by Häagen-Dazs and Wanchai Ferry. In India, our business is much smaller, but we'll open a total of 6 Häagen-Dazs shops in this market by year end. Multi-Grain Atta flour and Nature Valley Granola Bars are also performing well, contributing to 16% sales growth in India so far this year. In total, our International business is on track for another year of good growth in sales and operating profit. Our base business is doing well and the integration of Yoplait International has proceeded smoothly.
Turning to U.S. Retail. Net sales grew 4% in the third quarter, driven by net price realization and mix. Through 9 months, net sales are up 3% in total with growth in 5 of 7 divisions. Slide 38 shows our consumer movement across measured and non-tracked channels combined. As you can see, we are generating good growth in the majority of our categories. We've driven this growth with a steady stream of product news and innovation across our brands. For example, our cereal business has posted share gains over the past several years as we continue to bring product news to the category, and this year is no different. Our dollar share has increased up 0.5 a share point in the third quarter alone. 
We're seeing good growth across our cereal portfolio. Established brands such as Cinnamon Toast Crunch, Honey Nut Cheerios and the Chex franchise are posting solid retail sales growth so far this year. And we've had good contributions from new products, too, including Fiber One 80 Calories cereal, a new flavor of Cascadian Farm Granola and Dulce de Leche Cheerios and Frosted Toast Crunch launched in January. And we launched Peanut Butter MultiGrain Cheerios in January as well. This new cereal is off to a very strong start. In less than 3 months, it holds nearly 1 point of dollar share, making it the single biggest new cereal amongst 17 new launches in the category in January. 
Innovation is driving growth for our grain snacks, too. Over the years, we've added new varieties to our snack bars, driving good sales and share gains. We've kept that growth momentum going this year with several distinctive new items. Nature Valley Thins contain just 90 calories or less per serving. Fiber One Brownies have been a terrific success. They're on track to reach $120 million in year one retail sales. And for consumers looking for added protein for energy or weight management, Nature Valley Protein Bars contain 10 grams of protein and 5 grams of fiber per serving. 
Innovation also contributed to a good soup season for Progresso. New flavors and strong advertising have fueled a 2% sales gain for Progresso in measured channels fiscal year-to-date, including 6% baseline growth. We've increased prices through a reduction in promotional spending and we'll work to keep the momentum going with more product news coming this summer.
We're bringing innovation to our yogurt business, too. In the kids segment, we have new flavor combinations of Go-GURT value packs and a reformulated Trix yogurt with no artificial colors or flavors. In the adult segment, we've launched Greek yogurt parfaits, new flavors of Greek multipacks and a 4-flavor line of lactose-free Yoplait. 
We're bringing news to many different segments of the U.S. yogurt market and we're supporting these various initiatives with distinctive advertising messages. Our current TV campaigns are generating an 18% increase in gross rating points across our adult core cup lines so far this year. And we'll have lots more yogurt innovation to talk to consumers about this summer.
In total, it's been a very good year for product innovation across our U.S. Retail business. We're bringing new products to all parts of the store from the freezer case to the dairy section, to the center aisles and several of our new introductions like Peanut Butter MultiGrain Cheerios, Fiber One Brownies and Yoplait Light Granola Parfaits are among the most successful new items in the industry this past year. 
Let me touch on one final U.S. Retail business. As you know, natural and organic foods are a fast-growing category. Net sales for our Small Planet Foods division have grown at a 14% compound rate over the past 5 years. And net sales are up double digits again so far this year. In calendar 2008, we added LÄRABAR to the Small Planet Foods portfolio. Sales for these all-natural fruit and nut bars have been growing by more than 30% over the past 2 years as we've added -- as we've expanded distribution beyond natural and organic stores to other retail outlets. In January, we added Über bars to this line. They are in a phased launch and will be broadly available by this summer. And just last month, we added the Food Should Taste Good line to our portfolio. Sales for natural salty snacks are growing at a double-digit pace so we see great opportunities for this line of tortilla and sweet potato chips. Traditional grocery stores currently account for just 25% of retail distribution for this brand, so we're excited about the prospects for expanding availability for these great-tasting snacks. 
We are continuing to support all of our brands with strong levels of consumer marketing investment. For the year-to-date, our media spending is up 5% across U.S. Retail. And we've been increasing the gross rating points for our TV ads as well, up 3% year-to-date. We'll finish up the year with another quarter of good brand-building events. It's Pillsbury Bake-Off season and this year, the winner of the 45th Pillsbury Bake-Off contest will be announced live next week on a special broadcast of the Martha Stewart show. 
Qué Rica Vida, one of the largest Hispanic marketing platforms in the U.S., is currently hosting a music giveaway event, including in-store and online promotions. Consumers get free music download codes when they purchase select General Mills products. This event culminates in the chance to win a trip to Univision's annual concert in New York City this May. And March Madness is in full swing again this year with Betty's Brackets on bettycrocker.com. Consumers can vote online for their favorite party food recipes. 
So for our U.S. Retail business in total, we've got good momentum on many of our established businesses. Our new products are performing well, and we're investing across the portfolio with increased marketing support. We expect this business segment to show continued good sales growth and improved profit performance in the final quarter of the year. 
So I'd wrap up this morning's General Mills update this way. Fiscal 2012 has presented a particularly challenging operating environment with commodity inflation the highest we've seen in 30 years and more than double the average annual rate we expect to see going forward. In addition, slow economic recovery has kept many consumer budgets under pressure. These factors caused us to plan fiscal 2012 with a rate of EPS growth below our long-term model. And as you know, last month, we revised our EPS guidance to a level behind our original target. In this environment, we've made strategic choices that increased our worldwide sales base and strengthened our portfolio. We made acquisitions that expanded our participation in 2 fast-growing food categories, yogurt and natural and organic foods. We sustained a high level of new product activity across all 3 of our business segments and we increased advertising and media investment along with sales. As a result of these actions, General Mills is on pace to report record-level net sales and adjusted diluted EPS for 2012 in total. And we believe our actions have positioned the company well for continued growth in 2013 and beyond. So thanks to all of you for your interest in General Mills.

As far as Q3, there are a couple of dynamics at play. As you can imagine, the volume, as we said, came in a little lighter than we expected in U.S. RO that had 2 impacts on us. One is a bit of deleveraging in the plans, but also from a mix standpoint, U.S. are always -- are from a segment standpoint, is our highest-margin business, so that ends up being a bit of a negative mix to us as well. And then lastly, we -- as I noted in our working capital, we continue to work down our inventories and that had an impact on our gross margins; a planned impact, but one that externally may not be fully modeled, of probably about 30 basis points in the quarter.

As the folks who have been so focused on HMM and CI and all those kind of disciplines for 5 or 6 years, I think the first thing I want to assure you is that, you said is it time to take a look at these costs. I will tell you we are constantly looking at all of these costs, and Don will comment here in just a minute. But we're very focused on admin expense, particularly in the U.S. That has grown and we'll talk about the detail that you need to understand on that, but sort of on a like-for-like basis, that has grown at less than the rate of sales the last 3 or 4 years, and the last 2 years it's been flat. So we're very, very diligent on all of that stuff for just the reasons that you highlighted. I think you also commented on R&D spending, which has varied for us over the last 5 or 6 years between kind of low and mid-single-digit rates of increase. I will tell you that, that is a wonderfully high-returning investment in all ways. We get great new product innovation out of that investment. We get very creative HMM ideas, so that's a very high-returning spend for General Mills and we're very committed to sustaining growth in that area. I think the third area is the advertising area, and here, over the last 4 or 5 years, we've grown at a rate higher than our rate of sales growth. And we did that because it was clear that we really were behind our peer competitive set and we just wanted to get that spending level up to the right range. As we've said a few times now, we believe we're pretty much in that zone now and as we go forward, we would expect our rate of increase in ad spending to moderate and really to be more in line with -- much more in line with our rate of sales growth. So that's a few comments. I think, Don, you might want to jump with some more texture?"

And Rob, first off, I thought your piece was very good yesterday. We all read it with interest and I particularly appreciate when you looked at our SG&A, you commented that we're investing in the right things and I think that's very true. And I think Ken hit on some of those with R&D and our advertising. Let me focus on our admin expenses, so the SG&A less those 2 items. To Ken's point, if you look over the last 3 years and you strip out the marked increase we've had in our pension expense because of the drop in interest rates, our underlying admin expense has been essentially flat over those 3 years. It's been a focus of ours to ensure that we are thinking about where we're putting our investment and we've taken a lot of internal actions, HMM-variety actions, against admin just as we have done in our plans for a number of years. So I'd assure you that is getting a focus. In terms of headcount itself, it has increased. It's increased because we've been building our International business. Our U.S. headcount actually over the last 3 years is essentially flat. And that includes some investments we've made in headcount in John's area, for example, to build an internal sales force where we've added over 300 people to move from a broker to an internal sales force that not only do we think is more effective, as John outlined for us this morning, but we also know is cost beneficial to us versus the broker network that we had previously. So rest assured that it is getting a focus and the results are coming through over the last couple of years."

And we strongly believe, then, that volume will stabilize there, unit volume will stabilize and those will all be good things.

In this quarter, as I said, we had some very good new products that we shipped, which helped the units in volume, and that was good. But I have to say, really if you look at us over the last 4 or 5 years, we've had steady increases in performance, very consistent increases in market share and we're driving that primarily through good innovation across a number of brands. And so whether it's the Cheerios franchise or the Chex franchise, which I think, as you know, it appeals to folks are for looking for gluten-free products. That's growing at a high rate. We had good performance on our kid brands. So we really have a very strong portfolio there. We've had very good innovation. Those brands continue to respond and we're quite positive on the outlook for the category because of all the brand news and the nutrition innovation that we're bringing.

What I will say is that we have a very comprehensive lineup of innovation across all segments of our yogurt business including our kid business, our core cup business, Greek product lines and other innovation as well and those innovations will come over the course of the full calendar year, but beginning this summer. So we've been very hard at work on obviously, for all the obvious reasons, on our yogurt innovation pipeline and we'll be very pleased to share it with you in June. And not just on the retail side of the business, but as we mentioned, we've got good ideas that are going to be going in the foodservice side as well. So it will be very comprehensive across all segments."

I mean, basically, the sectors that you mentioned, whether it's mass or dollar stores or convenience stores, what I will tell you is that we are highly focused on all those channels for growth and highly focused means that we dedicate a significant number of human resources to those channels. We build very strong relationships at the top of those companies and all the way down through of all their various buying and merchandising levels and we built those businesses strongly. And as you said, these are growing channels and we see very significant opportunities for continued growth. And so without attempting to go into the numbers, I mean I think I can tell you that in most of those different sectors we have very solid growth rates. And we are also, because of the quality of our sales force and the kind of resources that we're putting in there, the important thing is, is that we're developing very strong insights about how their customer base might work. Whether it's a mass store or a dollar store or a drugstore, those – the consumers that go into those stores all have different behaviors and are looking for different things, particularly when they're looking for food products. And we're getting very, very smart about what it is that they're looking for. And as a result, we're bringing them insight and we've become a very trusted partner in those channels and we're getting good growth there, so it's very important to us.

We've had 48 months consecutively of share growth and double-digit volume gains in that segment. And strengthening our sales organization, the capabilities that we bring to that sector of customers like we have done for years and years on the retail side is a big advantage for us. I think there's plenty of room in our existing categories to continue to grow there. I think there's new adjacencies that are opportunities in that segment. I think there's also a foodservice business that is a big opportunity that is growing in the convenience store channel that we can bring more innovation and growth to. On the foodservice side, all you have to do is look around and there's lots of places where our brands aren't yet in the foodservice space. We're growing our penetration with our customers. We have more control over the focused efforts that our sales organization have against our brands and there remains lots and lots of opportunity in that area.

So they're using food to drive traffic and they're very interested in expanding our portfolio and so we're helping them think through that whole assortment issue. But there are many opportunities for us to move into that. I guess I would add that the other opportunity that we have is there are a number of products today that start out in alternative or particularly in natural channels. And so we commented on the success of LÄRABAR in the natural channel sector, the very strong success of Food Should Taste Good and as those products gain scale in those channels, we then have the opportunity to move them in the other direction, move them into the more mainstream channels. And so you have products that develop in different parts of the retail environment and then we can take them and study them and move them around into different places. And it's not just from the traditional to the alternative. It can be from alternative to traditional.

Thanks for joining us this morning. As you've seen in our press release, we posted solid results in the fourth quarter. Slide 4 gives you a summary. Sales totaled $4.1 billion, up 12%. Segment operating profit was $737",1890,"Thanks, Chris, and hello, everyone. Thanks for joining us this morning. As you've seen in our press release, we posted solid results in the fourth quarter. Slide 4 gives you a summary. Sales totaled $4.1 billion, up 12%. Segment operating profit was $737 million, a 9% increase versus last year. Net earnings attributable to General Mills totaled $325 million, and diluted earnings per share were $0.49 as reported. Including change in mark to market evaluation of certain commodity positions, integration expenses from the International Yoplait acquisition and the restructuring charges we announced at the end of last month, adjusted diluted EPS totaled $0.60, up 15% year-over-year.
Slide 5 summarizes operating highlights for the quarter. Net sales increased 3%, excluding acquisitions, and all 3 of our business segments posted gains. Gross margin declined 140 basis points, excluding mark-to-market effects. This was an improvement from results to the first 9 months. The addition of Yoplait International to our business mix accounted for roughly half of the fourth quarter decline. Our media investment increased 11% in the quarter, and segment operating profit rose 9%, with strong contributions from our international businesses and a 4% gain for our U.S. Retail business.
With this good fourth quarter finish, our annual results were consistent with revised guidance we provided in February. Slide 6 summarizes our results for 2012 in total. Sales grew 12% to $16.7 billion, led by the addition of Yoplait International and strong net price realization on our base business. Segment operating profit increased 2%, exceeding $3 billion for the first time in company history. This included input cost inflation of more than 10% along with an 8% increase in worldwide advertising expense. Diluted earnings per share declined 13% as reported. Adjusted diluted EPS, excluding certain items affecting comparability, reached $2.56, up 3% from last year. Results for our U.S. Retail segment reflected the challenged operating environment for food manufacturers in 2012. U.S. Retail net sales increased 3%. Segment operating profit was 2% below year-ago levels due to inflation, volume declines and a 5% increase in media investment. Our Bakeries and Foodservice business posted another year of solid top line growth. Sales increased 8% in 2012, with modest volume growth and strong net price realization both contributing to this increase. This performance is well ahead of the industry and as you can see on Slide 8, we posted good growth across our key channels and brands. Operating profit for the segment declined as expected due to sharp input cost inflation and comparisons against record grain merchandising earnings last year.
Our International segment delivered another year of strong performance. Net sales and segment operating profit both increased nearly 50% reflecting good contributions of our international Yoplait acquisition and growth in our base business. These good results included balanced growth across both developed and emerging markets. For example, in Western Europe, net sales for our base business increased 6% in constant currency. And in China, constant currency sales grew 22% for the year to reach $550 million, led by Häagen-Dazs and our line of Wanchai Ferry frozen dimsum items. And we are very pleased with the results of the Yoplait International yogurt business acquired last July. In our 3 largest markets, France, the U.K. and Canada, we delivered sales growth and market share gains  including a full point share gain in France and nearly 3 points of share growth by our Liberté brand in Canada. 
In 2012, our global media expense increased 8% to exceed $900 million. This includes higher level of investments in our core developed markets in media support under international business, including Yoplait. We increased our investment in targeted media vehicles like digital and multicultural. Based on measured media spending track by Kantar, we ranked as the top U.S. advertiser among all food and beverage companies over the last 12 months.
Slide 11 summarizes our 2012 joint venture performance. Net sales for Cereal Partners Worldwide increased 5% in constant currency basis, led by mid single-digit growth in developed markets like the U.K. and Australia and double-digit growth in emerging markets in Asia and Latin America. For the year, we maintained our 23% value market share. 
CPW earnings declined in 2012, reflecting a onetime adjustment to tax reserve related to prior years, higher input costs and expenses for new manufacturing capacity in emerging markets,, including Malaysia, Turkey, South Africa and Brazil. In Japan, constant currency sales for Häagen-Dazs increased at a mid-single-digit rate, but earnings were below year-ago levels. This is expected given the difficult economic environment in Japan following the earthquake and tsunami a year ago. That being said, this business finished the year a bit ahead of our plans.
Turning to the balance sheet. Slide 12 shows the components of core working capital. In the year where net sales increased 12%, our core working capital declined 7% as our focus on inventory reduction will improve working capital efficiency. Increased levels of accounts receivable and accounts payable, primarily from the Yoplait acquisition, were largely offsetting. Cash flow from operations totaled $2.4 billion, and this was after a $200 million voluntary cash contribution to our pension plan. The strong cash flow funded $676 million in capital spending. We invested in new manufacturing capacity in our snacks, cereal and yogurt businesses, and we funded multiple cost savings projects across the company. We returned $1.1 billion of cash to shareholders, including a 9% increase in our dividend. Our strong profit growth and cash flow allowed us to fund 3 acquisitions and take on additional $544 million in debt, while maintaining our credit rating.
Last month we announced the restructuring program designed to improve our organizational effectiveness and alignment on our key growth strategies. We recorded a $101 million pretax charge in the fourth quarter, which we've excluded from adjusted diluted earnings per share. We expect to record an additional $19 million in pretax expense in fiscal 2013. We are estimating $75 million in annualized cost savings from this restructuring plan. 
In fiscal 2013, we realized the majority of these savings, roughly 80% of the full amount, which we reinvested to support our key good strategies and accelerate innovation across General Mills global business platforms. In our U.S. yogurt business, we're launching 35 new items the first half of 2013. That's 3x the number in last year's first half. We were supporting our 2013 product news with increased levels of marketing investment and merchandising support. We're also investing to accelerate development in certain international businesses, including support for the Canadian Yoplait yogurt business we acquired in September and investment in emerging markets, particularly in China.
So let me outline more fully our fiscal 2013 plans, which call for another year of good sales and earnings growth for General Mills. We are targeting mid-single-digit sales growth that includes good contributions from acquired business, Yoplait Canada, Yoplait Ireland, Food Should Taste Good, and 2 incremental months of Yoplait International. We also expect volume sales growth on our base business. Input cost inflation is expected to run at a 2% to 3% rate. We expect to offset this equation with supply chain productivity savings. We expect segment operating profit to grow slightly faster than sales, with advertising and media support at or above this year's $914 million level.
Our 2013 plan also includes reinvestments. As I mentioned earlier, the 3 key areas are our U.S. yogurt business, the Canadian Yoplait business will be assuming control September 1 and emerging market development. These investments totaled roughly $100 million pretax. In addition, we expect pension expense and tax rate to be headwinds for us in 2013.
The funded status of our qualified pension plans remains fairly healthy. Despite historic low interest and discount rates, we finished fiscal 2012 94% funded. In fiscal 2013, several changes will affect the calculation of our pension expenses. First, the discount we are required to use is 60 basis points below year-ago levels at historically low 4.85%. In addition, we are lowering our rate of return assumption from 9.6% to 8.6%. This reflection of the lower equity market performance over the last decade and our view of long-term future market prospects. Along with various other smaller factors, these changes impact pension expense by $0.06 per share.
Slide 17 provides a summary of our earnings guidance for 2013 before any contribution from the Yoki acquisition in Brazil. We expect mid-single-digit growth in net sales. We see sales and volume growth trends for the base business weighted towards the second half of the year. Underlying gross margins are projected to improve modestly from 2012 levels. We expect our media investment to at least match last year's strong level investment. We project our operating profit will grow at a mid-single-digit rate. We're assuming an effective tax rate of 33%. This is higher than 2012, which benefited primarily from a onetime adjustment our tax reserve. It is in line with recent years average rate. And we expect joint venture earnings to grow at a double-digit rate. 
In terms of phasing, we expect First Quarter Earnings per share to be below last year, with growth across the remaining 9 months of the year.
At the end of May, we signed a definitive agreement to acquire Yoki Alimentos, a family-owned business in Brazil. We expect the transaction will close in the first half of fiscal 2013. Yoki's 4 largest businesses, popcorn, basic foods, seasonings and side dishes are growing at a double-digit rate in recent years and leading share positions. 
In fiscal 2011, Yoki reported IFRS sales of roughly $550 million, with EBIT margins in the low double-digit rates. We expect Yoki to contribute nicely to sales and operating profit in 2013. That will be offset by onetime transaction cost, incremental amortization expense and funding cost. So we're estimating roughly $0.02 to $0.03 drag to adjusted diluted EPS in 2013 from the partial year impacted Yoki. On an annualized basis, the addition of Yoki will roughly double our sales in Latin America and significantly increase our sales in Brazil. We will gain an extensive supply chain network and a national sales force. We're very excited to add Yoki people and products to our company.
As you can see on Slide 19, we expect adjusted diluted earnings per share of roughly $2.65 in fiscal 2013. This includes the $0.06 of additional pension expense, a $0.02 hit from the higher tax rate and a $0.02 to $0.03 drag from the anticipated Yoki acquisition. Our adjusted EPS excludes onetime integration costs, mark-to-market effects and restructuring charges.
We expect a couple of good sales and profit growth in 2013 would increase cash return to shareholders inclusive of the Yoki acquisition. Yesterday, we announced an 8% dividend increase to a new annualized rate of $1.32 per share. This represents a roughly 3.5% yield at recent stock prices. We are planning a  higher level of share repurchase activity than in 2012. The share repurchases are expected to contribute to EPS growth in fiscal 2013. We believe our operating plans for 2013 are quite strong. We have high levels of innovation planned across our product portfolio. We'll have good contributions from recently acquired businesses. Sales and operating profits are expected to grow at mid single-digit rates, and that's before any contribution from Yoki. The any more about our plans for next year, I'll now turn the call over to Ken."

As you all know, the last 12 months was a challenging period for the food industry. Input costs increased at the highest rate in over 3 decades, and the pace of economic recovery around the world remains slow at best. As we move into fiscal 2013, we expect slow economic growth to continue, and we think the packaged foods business will remain very competitive. The restructuring program we announced last month will better align and focus resources against our best opportunities for growth, accelerate our innovation efforts and make General Mills a more efficient organization. It will generate savings we will invest back in our businesses and enable us to deliver a balanced plan for growth across our global platforms. And I want to tell you a bit more about this initiative.
In our U.S. Retail segment that reports to Ian Friendly, we are strengthening our alignment and focus by creating 3 new divisions. Our new Meals Division will be solely focused on our key center store meal items, Progresso soup, Helper dinner mixes, Old El Paso Mexican foods and Betty Crocker side dishes issues. This alignment allows us to increase our emphasis on these important brands and to strengthen their growth. 
The new Frozen Foods division combines our frozen entrées, Totino's pizza, Totino's hot snacks, Pillsbury breakfast pastries and Green Giant items. This division focus will better leverage our Frozen Foods scale and consumer insights in order to increase our executional capability, and it will allow us to more effectively partner with our customers in this important and growing section of the grocery store. 
And finally, we've combined our baking expertise across Pillsbury Refrigerated Dough and Betty Crocker dessert mixes to create a new Baking Products division. With many complementary products from shelf stable mixes to refrigerated ready to bake items, we will more efficiently serve the baking consumer moving forward.
Now our Big G snacks, Yoplait and Small Planet Foods division already have good category focus, and they remain unchanged. Jim Murphy has assumed the leadership of Big G, as Jeff Harmoning has moved to become CEO of Cereal Partners Worldwide. Christi Strauss, who led CPW for the last 6 years, is currently on sabbatical. 
In our International segment that reports to Chris O'Leary, we are creating a new regional operating structure to maximize growth in developed markets and drive differential growth in emerging markets. We're creating a new Europe Australasia region, focused on driving developed market growth. The other regions are Canada, the Latin America region, the Greater China Region and a region combining Asia, the Middle East and Africa. And we'll also have 2 strategic business units designed to centralize and coordinate growth strategies for our 2 biggest global brands, Yoplait and Häagen-Dazs.
This new structure will allow us to generate cost efficiencies across our international operations that will help fund business development around the world. 
In Bakeries and Foodservice, our business realignment began several years ago. By focusing on the fastest-growing customer segments and higher-margin product lines, we've grown sales and profits, and we've expanded operating margins by several hundred basis points. So we're going to stick with this strategic approach moving forward. John Machuzick, who led the transformation of this business, is retiring in August after a highly distinguished 34-year career with General Mills. He will be succeeded by Dave Dudick, who most recently led our U.S. channel sales team focused on supercenter club and alternate format customers. 
Our restructuring program is truly a companywide initiative. Across every function we've identified opportunities to reduce duplication and centralize capabilities, making us a more efficient and a more cost-effective organization. Savings from these restructuring actions will accelerate our investment and strategies to drive future growth, and I'm very confident that these changes will lead to continued strong operating results for General Mills.
Our strategies for growth are focused on 5 global categories: Ready-to-eat cereal, superpremium ice cream, convenient meals, wholesome snack bars and yogurt. Euromonitor data shows that these are big categories, projected to grow at mid- to single-digit rates in the years ahead, and innovation plays a key role in driving global category growth. So I want to share our plans for growth on each of these platforms, beginning with our newest global business, Yogurt. 
The international Yoplait business we acquired last July delivered strong results in 2012, and we've got plans for continued international yogurt growth in 2013. In France, we are launching new varieties of Calin, a functional yogurt high in calcium. We're expanding Calin to the U.K. market with a 3-item launch. We're supporting both new and established yogurt products with higher levels of advertising, and we've expanded our European yogurt business by reacquiring the Ireland Yoplait license. Retail sales of Yoplait in Ireland totaled $65 million in the last 12 months.
In Canada, we expect to increase household penetration for our Liberté brand through distribution gains and new flavors of core Greek and Mediterranean product lines and expansion into drinkable and kid varieties. And reacquiring control of the Yoplait business this fall will also significantly increase our scale. Together, Liberté and Yoplait account for roughly 35% of total Canadian yogurt market sales. 
In the U.S., we are innovating across multiple segments of the yogurt category. We are the market leader in the light segment, and we are launching a lower-calorie Greek offering, new Yoplait Greek 100-calorie yogurt, and we're bringing product news to Yoplait light, it's now just 90 calories per cup, and both of these items are the only weight watchers endorsed products in the category. We have increased levels of advertising plan on our kid yogurt business. We are expanding our regional Mountain High large sized business to a national offering. And today, large size yogurt represents 9% of category sales. We are launching Yoplait Simplait, a line of great tasting all-natural yogurts with just 6 simple ingredients. And we're also launching Yoplait Fruplait, with twice the fruit. 
And our U.S. yogurt innovation extends beyond the Yoplait brand. Liberté is a leading player in Canada's fast emerging Greek segments. We're bringing this great tasting product in the U.S. with a 6-item launch. The regional rollout begins this summer. We're also increasing distribution of Liberté Mediterranee, a highly indulging yogurt available in 7 varieties, including coconut and French vanilla. We believe this strong innovation lineup will renew sales growth for our U.S. yogurt business in fiscal 2013. And we will share more details of our yogurt plan at our New York meeting on July 10.
Let me turn to ice cream. Our Häagen-Dazs business had a terrific year in 2012, with constant currency sales up 16%, and we look to continue that momentum in 2013. We are planning to open roughly 80 additional shops this year, including 50 in China. The launch of Secret Sensations was a big success last year, and in 2013 we're adding a new meringue and raspberry flavor, and we're launching this line to additional markets in Europe, Asia and South America. We're also adding flavors to our core Häagen-Dazs product line and rolling out a new package design, and we expect to increase our media investments at a double-digit pace behind our global advertising campaign.
Convenient meals are important for today's busy consumers, and we have strong growth plans in place for our brands in 2013. In the U.S., our Progresso recipe starters are easy base sauces to use in a wide range of recipes. We're expanding our Hamburger Helper business with new package sizes that are perfect for club stores and dollar stores. 
In Europe, we drive growth on our Old El Paso business through improved advertising, in-store displays and the expansion of recent new products to new markets, and we will continue to add new products in new cities for our Wanchai Ferry business in Greater China.
Now let's turn to wholesome snack bars. In the U.S., we've led the growth of the grain bar category for several years, including nearly 5 points of share growth in 2012 alone. And we've got a strong lineup of new items in 2013. We are expanding our Fiber One franchise with the launch of Fiber One Chewy Bars, and we're building on our last year's highly successful Fiber One Brownies with a new flavor and a new package size. We expect the continued growth for Nature Valley Protein Bars launched last January, and we're adding a dark chocolate in peanut butter crunchy bar variety. We are targeting another year of growth for LÄRABAR, and we are launching uber bars in away from home channels, along with new Gardetto's snack crackers and additional varieties of Betty Crocker sweet rewards bars.
Wholesome snack bars are a hit in markets around the world, and we've got strong plans for international growth in 2013. In Canada, we're bringing innovation to the category with Fiber One 110-calorie brownies and Nature Valley granola thin. In Europe, we're expanding our Nature Valley franchise with the launch of a new sweet and nutty product line. Nature Valley also will be an official product sponsor of the Olympic Games in London next month. 
Our largest global business is cereal. In the U.S., we posted market share gains in each of the last 5 years, exceeding a 31% dollar share across all channels in 2012. And we have a strong growth plan for our U.S. cereal business in 2013.
Peanut Butter MultiGrain Cheerios launched in January continues to perform very well. It's the biggest new cereal among the 25 items launched in the category since January. We've just introduced gluten-free Apple Cinnamon Chex, new Fiber One Nutty Clusters and Almonds is a great tasting cereal that delivers 40% of the consumers daily value for fiber. And we've added Cascadian Farm ancient grains granola to our line of Cascadian Farm organic cereals. 
We've also got news on established cereal brands. We'll remind consumers that all Big G cereals contain more whole grain than any other single ingredient. Better regional Cheerios provide heart health benefits and that several varieties of Chex cereals are gluten-free. 
We are bringing innovation to our international cereal businesses as well. In Canada, we've increased our cereal market share by 5.5 points over the last 5 years, reaching nearly a 30% share of the category in 2012. Outside North America, Cereal Partners Worldwide will increase marketing investment against each of its core brands, Cheerios, Nesquik, Chocapic and Fitness. CPW has some great tasting new products too, including Fitness white chocolate and Chocapic pillows. 
So as we look to fiscal 2013 and beyond, we see the prospects for General Mills as very bright. Our 5 global product categories deliver food that are convenient, nutritious, and it tastes great, all at good value. These 5 platforms account for over 60% of our worldwide sales, and they have terrific growth prospects. And our brands hold leading positions in these large growing global categories, so we really like the prospects for increasing our sales, earnings and market share positions in these categories in the years ahead. 
We are continuing our evolution into a truly global food company. 10 years ago, just 5% of General Mills sales were generated outside of the U.S. and most of that business was in Canada. Today, half of all General Mills' employees work outside the U.S., and we sell our products in over 100 countries, including our proportionate share of joint ventures, international net sales now exceed $5 billion and represent over 30% of General Mills' total worldwide sales. 
Now, while we are pleased with our progress in international markets, we remain very committed to driving growth in our core U.S. market. And with increased levels of investments in our U.S. yogurt business and a very strong lineup of product news and innovation across our domestic portfolio, we like our U.S. growth prospects moving forward. 
We enter 2013 confident that we are positioned for another year of balanced growth at General Mills. We are investing to keep our established brands healthy and to launch new products in both developed and emerging markets. We'll make investments to ensure our products are competitive and investments to fuel our global growth. We believe our 2013 target strikes the right balance between sales and profit growth in the current year and reinvestment to support our longer-term progress. 
I'll wrap this up -- I'll wrap up this morning by reminding you about our investor meeting in New York on Tuesday, July 10, where we will discuss our plans for 2013 in more detail. Presentations will begin at 10 AM Eastern Time, and they will also be webcast. 
So I'd like to thank all of you for joining us on the call today and for your interest in General Mills. With that, we will open the call for questions. Operator, would you please get us the first question."

And so that's always job one is to make sure that we have a very vibrant base business. Then we will see incremental opportunities is in international, particularly in emerging markets. That was business in China that's growing over 20% this year. We are augmenting that with obviously in a acquisition in Brazil. But also on an organic basis, we're applying back several earnings growth to show you even faster in China, for example, and we've done that for the last 3 to 4 years. And while we've done that, you still see the international has grown quite nicely on both the top and bottom line. So this is a change of direction we've been trying to be pretty transparent about that over the last few years that We've been putting additional money back into those markets, because we see long-term growth potential."

First of all, our volume growth assumption in -- we are confident about our volume growth assumption in U.S. Retail, which basically assumes continuing good level of volume growth in all of our snack businesses, which have been very strong and would include products like LÄRABAR, Nature Valley, Fiber One. So those products are very strong momentum and they're going to continue to growth. We also have very strong initiatives in our yogurt businesses, and that will contribute as well to units. And then we have we think very, very prudent and reasonable volume assumptions on our some of our more bigger, more established categories like cereal. And we think the mix all in is very prudent. On the merchandising side, as we've said, we took a lot of pricing last year. We've got it mostly right. Going forward, we're going to be adding some merchandising selectively and selective categories and product lines just to make sure that they are competitive and as we say in the zone. We typically do that anyway and following very substantial amount of price increases this year, we're going to doing that again as we go into 2013 just to make sure that we have that value equation right everywhere. And it's important for us to do that. We constantly monitor the value. We're not looking at necessarily a price point, we are looking to be in a zone that will allow our marketing programs and our consumer promotion programs to be as effective as they can be. So we will be doing some of that as well."

So I made some comments on U.S. Retail and International and Foodservice. There were other elements to the restructuring that we did that I didn't comment on. I mean, I commented on it generically but -- so for instance, we did some very good work in our R&D organization that really just accelerated a path that we were already on, which was to centralize more of our R&D capability around platforms, and which is going to generate, we think, a higher level of innovation in a very efficient way. So for instance, we used to have 4 different R&D groups working on snack bars depending on the division, and we said that didn't really make -- we can do better than that, let's put them all together and have one group focusing on that big platform. So we've done other things like that and altogether, that would be the bigger number. And this is all incremental to our ongoing level of HMM across our supply chain and -- which will be very, very strong. We're going to generate very strong base core HMM in the plan for F '13."

But Don, maybe you can just help me clear up any of this.

The big one and the main one and we put a lot of effort into this is making sure our retail partners understand how dynamic and how exciting this category is. And the intent of that is to help them and make sure that they are planning to expand the case. And we had very good success doing that over the last -- over the last several years, and so we are depending on the retailer, we can go and recommend another 2 feet, another 4 feet, another 6 feet. So we've done, I think, a very good job of playing a leadership role in that area and you are seeing across many of our large retail partners, we are seeing them expand the footage. And so then within that, our goal is to increase our distribution. We held it basically stable in 2012. We lost a little bit as we got to the end of the year, I mean very small amounts. But as we go in with all of these new items, we have the retailer very optimistic about the category and inclined to expand shelf space, we think we'll be able to hold our core distribution and add incrementally with new products that we think are quite exciting and quite incremental.

Slide 4 gives you a summary. Sales totaled $4.1 billion, up 12%. Segment operating profit was $737 million, a 9% increase versus last year. Net earnings attributable to General Mills totaled $325 million. And diluted earnings per share were $0.49, as reported. Including changes in the mark-to-market valuations of certain commodity positions, integration expenses from the international Yoplait acquisition and the restructuring charges we announced at the end of last month, adjusted diluted EPS totaled $0.60, up 15% year-over-year.
Slide 5 summarizes operating highlights for the quarter. Net sales increased 3% excluding acquisitions, and all 3 of our business segments posted gains. Gross margin declined 140 basis points excluding mark-to-market effects. This was an improvement from results through the first 9 months. The addition of Yoplait International to our business mix accounted for roughly 1/2 of the fourth quarter decline. Our media investment increased 11% in the quarter. And segment operating profit rose 9% with strong contributions from our International businesses and a 4% gain for our U.S. Retail business.
With this good fourth quarter finish, our annual results were consistent with revised guidance we provided in February. Slide 6 summarizes our results for 2012 in total. Sales grew 12% to $16.7 billion, led by the addition of Yoplait International and strong net price realization on our base business. Segment operating profit increased 2%, exceeding $3 billion for the first time in company history. This included input cost inflation of more than 10% along with an 8% increase in worldwide advertising expense. Diluted earnings per share declined 13% as reported. Adjusted diluted EPS, excluding certain items affecting comparability, reached $2.56, up 3% from last year. 
Results for our U.S. Retail segment reflected the challenged operating environment for food manufacturers in 2012. U.S. Retail net sales increased 3%, but segment operating profit was 2% below year-ago levels due to inflation, volume declines and a 5% increase in media investment. 
Our Bakeries and Foodservice business posted another year of solid top line growth. Sales increased 8% in 2012 with modest volume growth and strong net price realization both contributing to this increase. This performance is well ahead of the industry. And as you can see on Slide 8, we posted good growth across our key channels and brands. Operating profit for this segment declined as expected due to sharp input cost inflation and comparisons against record grain merchandising earnings last year.
Our International segment delivered another year of strong performance. Net sales and segment operating profit both increased nearly 50% reflecting good contributions from our international Yoplait acquisition and growth in our base business. These good results included balanced growth across both developed and emerging markets. For example, in Western Europe, net sales for our base business increased 6% in constant currency. And in China, constant currency sales grew 22% for the year to reach $550 million, led by Häagen-Dazs and our line of Wanchai Ferry frozen dim sum items. And we are very pleased with the results of the Yoplait International yogurt business acquired last July. In our 3 largest markets, France, the U.K. and Canada, we delivered sales growth and market share gains  including a full point of share gain in France and nearly 3 points of share growth by our Liberté brand in Canada. 
In 2012, our global media expense increased 8% to exceed $900 million. This includes higher level of investments in our core developed markets in media support under International businesses, including Yoplait. We increased our investment in targeted media vehicles like digital and multicultural. Based on measured media spending tracked by Kantar, we ranked as the top U.S. advertiser among all food and beverage companies over the last 12 months.
Slide 11 summarizes our 2012 joint venture performance. Net sales for Cereal Partners Worldwide increased 5% in constant currency basis, led by mid-single-digit growth in developed markets like the U.K. and Australia and double-digit growth in emerging markets in Asia and Latin America. For the year, we maintained our 23% value market share. 
CPW earnings declined in 2012, reflecting a onetime adjustment to tax reserve related to prior years, higher input costs and expenses for new manufacturing capacity in emerging markets including Malaysia, Turkey, South Africa and Brazil. 
In Japan, constant currency sales for Häagen-Dazs increased at a mid-single-digit rate, but earnings were below year-ago levels. This is expected given the difficult economic environment in Japan following the earthquake and tsunami a year ago. That being said, this business finished the year a bit ahead of our plans.
Turning to the balance sheet. Slide 12 shows the components of core working capital. In a year where net sales increased 12%, our core working capital declined 7% as our focus on inventory reduction will improve working capital efficiency. Increased levels of accounts receivable and accounts payable, primarily from the Yoplait acquisition, were largely offsetting. 
Cash flow from operations totaled $2.4 billion and this was after a $200 million voluntary cash contribution to our pension plan. This strong cash flow funded $676 million in capital spending. We invested in new manufacturing capacity in our snacks, cereal and yogurt businesses and we funded multiple cost-savings projects across the company. We returned $1.1 billion of cash to shareholders, including a 9% increase in our dividend. And our strong profit growth and cash flow allowed us to fund 3 acquisitions and take on additional $544 million in debt while maintaining our credit rating.
Last month, we announced the restructuring program designed to improve our organizational effectiveness and alignment on our key growth strategies. We recorded a $101 million pretax charge in the fourth quarter, which we've excluded from adjusted diluted earnings per share. We expect to record an additional $19 million in pretax expense in fiscal 2013. We're estimating $75 million in annualized cost savings from this restructuring plan. 
In fiscal 2013, we realized the majority of these savings, roughly 80% of the full amount, which we reinvested to support our key growth strategies and to accelerate innovation across General Mills' global business platforms. In our U.S. yogurt business, we're launching 35 new items the first half of 2013. That's 3x the number in last year's first half. We were supporting our 2013 product news with increased levels of marketing investment and merchandising support. We're also investing to accelerate development for certain international businesses, including support for the Canadian Yoplait yogurt business we'll acquire in September and investment in emerging markets, particularly in China.
So let me outline more fully our fiscal 2013 plans, which call for another year of good sales and earnings growth for General Mills. We're targeting mid-single-digit sales growth that includes good contributions from acquired business: Yoplait Canada, Yoplait Ireland, Food Should Taste Good, Parampara food products and 2 incremental months of Yoplait International. 
We also expect volume and sales growth on our base business. Input cost inflation is expected to run at a 2% to 3% rate. We expect to offset this equation with supply chain productivity savings. We expect segment operating profit to grow slightly faster than sales with advertising and media support at or above this year's $914 million level. Our 2013 plan also includes reinvestments. As I mentioned earlier, the 3 key areas are our U.S. yogurt business; the Canadian Yoplait business we'll be assuming control about September 1; and emerging market development. These investments totaled roughly $100 million pretax. In addition, we expect pension expense and tax rate to be headwinds for us in 2013.
The funded status of our qualified pension plans remains fairly healthy. Despite historically low interest and discount rates, we finished fiscal 2012 94% funded. In fiscal 2013, several changes will affect the calculation of our pension expenses: first, the discount we're required to use is 60 basis points below year-ago levels at an historically low 4.85%. In addition, we are lowering a rate of return assumption from 9.6% to 8.6%. This is a reflection of the lower equity market performance over the last decade and our view of long-term future market prospects. Along with various other smaller factors, these changes impact pension expense by $0.06 per share.
Slide 17 provides a summary of our earnings guidance for 2013 before any contribution from the Yoki acquisition in Brazil. We expect mid-single-digit growth in net sales. We see sales and volume growth trends for the base business weighted towards the second half of the year. Underlying gross margins are projected to improve modestly from 2012 levels. We expect our media investment to at least match last year's strong level of investments. We project our operating profit will grow at a mid-single-digit rate. We're assuming an effective tax rate of 33%. This is higher than 2012, which benefited primarily from a onetime adjustment in our tax reserve, but is in line with recent years' average rate. And we expect joint venture earnings to grow at a double-digit rate. In terms of phasing, we expect first quarter earnings per share to be below last year with growth across the remaining 9 months of the year.
At the end of May, we signed a definitive agreement to acquire Yoki Alimentos, a family-owned food business in Brazil. We expect the transaction will close during the first half of fiscal 2013. Yoki's 4 largest businesses, popcorn, basic foods, seasonings and side dishes, are growing at a double-digit rate in recent years and hold leading share positions. In fiscal 2011, Yoki reported IFRS sales of roughly $550 million with EBIT margins in the low double-digit rate. We expect Yoki to contribute nicely to sales and operating profit in 2013. That will be offset by onetime transaction costs, incremental amortization expense and funding costs, so we're estimating a roughly $0.02 to $0.03 drag to adjusted diluted EPS in 2013 from the partial-year impact of Yoki. On an annualized basis, the addition of Yoki will roughly double our sales in Latin America and significantly increase our scale in Brazil. We'll gain an extensive supply chain network and a national sales force. We're very excited to add Yoki's people and products to our company.
As you can see on Slide 19, we expect adjusted diluted earnings per share of roughly $2.65 in fiscal 2013. This includes the $0.06 of additional pension expense, a $0.02 hit from the higher tax rate and a $0.02 to $0.03 drag from the anticipated Yoki acquisition. Our adjusted EPS excludes onetime integration costs, mark-to-market effects and restructuring charges.
We expect a couple of good sales and profit growth in 2013  with increased cash return to shareholders inclusive of the Yoki acquisition. Yesterday, we announced an 8% dividend increase to a new annualized rate of $1.32 per share. This represents a roughly 3.5% yield at recent stock prices. And we're planning a higher level of share repurchase activity than in 2012. The share repurchases are expected to contribute to EPS growth in fiscal 2013. 
We believe our operating plans for 2013 are quite strong. We have high levels of innovation planned across our core product portfolio. We'll have good contributions from recently acquired businesses. Sales and operating profits are expected to grow at mid-single-digit rate and that's before any contribution from Yoki. 
To tell you more about our plans for next year, I'll now turn the call over to Ken."

As you all know, the last 12 months was a challenging period for the food industry. Input costs increased at the highest rate in over 3 decades and the pace of economic recovery around the world remains slow at best. As we move into fiscal 2013, we expect slow economic growth to continue, and we think the packaged foods business will remain very competitive. The restructuring program we announced last month will better align and focus resources against our best opportunities for growth, accelerate our innovation efforts and make General Mills a more efficient organization. It will generate savings we will invest back in our businesses and enable us to deliver a balanced plan for growth across our global platforms. And I want to tell you a bit more about this initiative.
In our U.S. Retail segment that reports to Ian Friendly, we're strengthening our alignment and focus by creating 3 new divisions. Our new Meals division will be solely focused on our key center store meal items: Progresso soup, Helper dinner mixes, Old El Paso Mexican foods and Betty Crocker side dishes issues. This alignment allows us to increase our emphasis on these important brands and to strengthen their growth. 
The new Frozen Foods division combines our frozen entrées, Totino's pizza, Totino's hot snacks, Pillsbury breakfast pastries and Green Giant items. This division focus will better leverage our frozen foods' scale and consumer insights in order to increase our executional capability and it will allow us to more effectively partner with our customers in this important and growing section of the grocery store. 
And finally, we've combined our baking expertise across Pillsbury refrigerated dough and Betty Crocker dessert mixes to create a new Baking Products division. With many complementary products from shelf-stable mixes to refrigerated ready-to-bake items, we will more efficiently serve the baking consumer moving forward.
Now our Big G snacks, Yoplait and Small Planet Foods division already have good category focus and they remain unchanged. Jim Murphy has assumed the leadership of Big G as Jeff Harmening has moved to become CEO of Cereal Partners Worldwide. Christi Strauss, who led CPW for the last 6 years, is currently on sabbatical. 
In our International segment that reports to Chris O'Leary, we are creating a new regional operating structure to maximize growth in developed markets and drive differential growth in emerging markets. We're creating a new Europe Australasia region focused on driving developed market growth. The other regions are Canada, the Latin America region, the Greater China Region and a region combining Asia, the Middle East and Africa. And we'll also have 2 strategic business units designed to centralize and coordinate growth strategies for our 2 biggest global brands: Yoplait and Häagen-Dazs.
This new structure will allow us to generate cost efficiencies across our international operations that will help fund business development around the world. 
In Bakeries and Foodservice, our business realignment began several years ago. By focusing on the fastest-growing customer segments and higher-margin product lines, we've grown sales and profits and we've expanded operating margins by several hundred basis points. So we're going to stick with this strategic approach moving forward. John Machuzick, who led the transformation of this business, is retiring in August after a highly distinguished 34-year career with General Mills. He will be succeeded by Dave Dudick who most recently led our U.S. channel sales team focused on supercenter, club and alternate format customers. 
Our restructuring program is truly a company-wide initiative. Across every function, we've identified opportunities to reduce duplication and centralize capabilities, making us a more efficient and a more cost-effective organization. Savings from these restructuring actions will accelerate our investment and strategies to drive future growth and I'm very confident that these changes will lead to continued strong operating results for General Mills.
Our strategies for growth are focused on 5 global categories: ready-to-eat cereal, superpremium ice cream, convenient meals, wholesome snack bars and yogurt. Euromonitor data shows that these are big categories projected to grow at mid- to single-digit rates in the years ahead, and innovation plays a key role in driving global category growth. So I want to share our plans for growth on each of these platforms beginning with our newest global business, yogurt. 
The international Yoplait business we acquired last July delivered strong results in 2012, and we've got plans for continued international yogurt growth in 2013. In France, we're launching new varieties of Calin, a functional yogurt high in calcium. We're expanding Calin to the U.K. market with a 3-item launch. We're supporting both new and established yogurt products with higher levels of advertising. And we've expanded our European yogurt business by reacquiring the Ireland Yoplait license. Retail sales of Yoplait in Ireland totaled $65 million in the last 12 months.
In Canada, we expect to increase household penetration for our Liberté brand through distribution gains and new flavors of core Greek and Mediterranean product lines and expansion into drinkable and kid varieties. And reacquiring control of the Yoplait business this fall will also significantly increase our scale. Together, Liberté and Yoplait account for roughly 35% of total Canadian yogurt market sales. 
In the U.S., we are innovating across multiple segments of the yogurt category. We are the market leader in the light segment. And we're launching a lower-calorie Greek offering, new Yoplait Greek 100-calorie yogurt. And we're bringing product news to Yoplait Light, it's now just 90 calories per cup. And both of these items are the only Weight Watchers' endorsed products in the category. We have increased levels of advertising planned on our kid yogurt business. We're expanding our regional Mountain High large-size business to a national offering. And today, large-size yogurt represents 9% of category sales. We are launching Yoplait Simplait, a line of great-tasting, all-natural yogurts with just 6 simple ingredients. And we're also launching Yoplait Fruplait with twice the fruit. And our U.S. yogurt innovation extends beyond the Yoplait brand. Liberté is a leading player in Canada's fast-emerging Greek segment. We're bringing this great-tasting product in the U.S. with a 6-item launch. The regional rollout begins this summer. We're also increasing distribution of Liberté Méditerranée, a highly indulgent yogurt available in 7 varieties including coconut and French vanilla. We believe this strong innovation lineup will renew sales growth for our U.S. yogurt business in fiscal 2013. And we will share more details of our yogurt plan at our New York meeting on July 10.
Let me turn to ice cream. Our Häagen-Dazs business had a terrific year in 2012 with constant currency sales up 16% and we look to continue that momentum in 2013. We are planning to open roughly 80 additional shops this year, including 50 in China. The launch of Secret Sensations was a big success last year, and in 2013 we're adding a new meringue and raspberry flavor and we're launching this line to additional markets in Europe, Asia and South America. We're also adding flavors to our core Häagen-Dazs product line and rolling out a new package design. And we expect to increase our media investments at a double-digit pace behind our global advertising campaign.
Convenient meals are important for today's busy consumers, and we have strong growth plans in place for our brands in 2013. In the U.S., our Progresso Recipe Starters are easy base sauces to use in a wide range of recipes. We're expanding our Hamburger Helper business with new package sizes that are perfect for club stores and dollar stores. In Europe, we'll drive growth on our Old El Paso business through improved advertising, in-store displays and the expansion of recent new products to new markets. And we'll continue to add new products in new cities for our Wanchai Ferry business in Greater China.
Now let's turn to wholesome snack bars. In the U.S., we've led the growth of the grain bar category for several years including nearly 5 points of share growth in 2012 alone. And we've got a strong lineup of new items in 2013. We are expanding our Fiber One franchise with the launch of Fiber One Chewy Bars, and we're building on last year's highly successful Fiber One Brownies with a new flavor and a new package size. We expect continued growth for Nature Valley Protein Bars launched last January and we're adding a dark chocolate and peanut butter crunchy bar variety. We are targeting another year of growth for LÄRABAR, and we are launching Über bars in away-from-home channels along with new Gardetto's snack crackers and additional varieties of Betty Crocker Sweet Rewards bars.
Wholesome snack bars are a hit in markets around the world, and we've got strong plans for international growth in 2013. In Canada, we're bringing innovation to the category with Fiber One 110 Calorie Brownies and Nature Valley granola Thins. In Europe, we're expanding our Nature Valley franchise with the launch of a new Sweet & Nutty product line. Nature Valley also will be an official product sponsor of the Olympic Games in London next month. 
Our largest global business is cereal. In the U.S., we posted market share gains in each of the last 5 years, exceeding a 31% dollar share across all channels in 2012. And we have a strong growth plan for our U.S. cereal business in 2013. Peanut Butter MultiGrain Cheerios, launched in January, continues to perform very well. It's the biggest new cereal among the 25 items launched in the category since January. We've just introduced gluten-free Apple Cinnamon Chex, new Fiber One Nutty Clusters & Almonds is a great-tasting cereal that delivers 40% of a consumer's daily value for fiber. And we've added Cascadian Farm Ancient Grains Granola to our line of Cascadian Farm organic cereals. 
We've also got news on established cereal brands. We'll remind consumers that all Big G cereals contain more whole grain than any other single ingredient, that original Cheerios provide heart health benefit and that several varieties of Chex cereals are gluten-free. 
We're bringing innovation to our international cereal businesses as well. In Canada, we've increased our cereal market share by 5.5 points over the last 5 years, reaching nearly a 30% share of the category in 2012. Outside North America, Cereal Partners Worldwide will increase marketing investment against each of its core brands: Cheerios, Nesquik, Chocapic and Fitness. CPW has some great-tasting new products, too, including Fitness White Chocolate and Chocapic Pillows. 
So as we look to fiscal 2013 and beyond, we see the prospects for General Mills as very bright. Our 5 global product categories deliver food that are convenient, nutritious and it tastes great, all at good value. These 5 platforms account for over 60% of our worldwide sales and they have terrific growth prospects. And our brands hold leading positions in these large growing global categories. So we really like the prospects for increasing our sales, earnings and market share positions in these categories in the years ahead. 
We are continuing our evolution into a truly global food company. 10 years ago, just 5% of General Mills' sales were generated outside of the U.S. and most of that business was in Canada. Today, half of all General Mills' employees work outside the U.S., and we sell our products in over 100 countries. Including our proportionate share of joint ventures, international net sales now exceed $5 billion and represent over 30% of General Mills' total worldwide sales. 
Now, while we are pleased with our progress in international markets, we remain very committed to driving growth in our core U.S. market. And with increased levels of investments in our U.S. yogurt business and a very strong lineup of product news and innovation across our domestic portfolio, we like our U.S. growth prospects moving forward. 
We enter 2013 confident that we are positioned for another year of balanced growth at General Mills. We're investing to keep our established brands healthy and to launch new products in both developed and emerging markets. We'll make investments to ensure our products are competitive and investments to fuel our global growth. We believe our 2013 targets strike the right balance between sales and profit growth in the current year and reinvestment to support our longer-term progress. 
I'll wrap this up -- I'll wrap up this morning by reminding you about our investor meeting in New York on Tuesday, July 10, where we will discuss our plans for 2013 in more detail. Presentations will begin at 10 a.m. Eastern Time and they will also be webcast. 
So I'd like to thank all of you for joining us on the call today and for your interest in General Mills. With that, we will open the call for questions. Operator, would you please get us the first question."

And you saw those results this year with Europe, for example, showing mid-single-digit base business sales growth. And so that's always job one, it's to make sure that we have a very vibrant base business. Then we will see incremental opportunities is in international, particularly in emerging markets. We have a fabulous business in China that's growing over 20% this year. We're augmenting that with obviously an acquisition -- soon with acquisition in Brazil. But also on an organic basis, we're plowing back several earnings growth to accelerate even faster in China, for example, and we've done that for the last 3 to 4 years. And while we've done that, you still see that International has grown quite nicely on both the top and bottom line. So this isn't a change of direction. We've been trying to be pretty transparent about that over the last few years that we've been putting additional money back into those markets because we see a long-term growth potential."

First of all, our volume growth assumption in -- we're confident about our volume growth assumption in U.S. Retail, which basically assumes continuing good level of volume growth in our -- in all of our snack businesses, which have been very strong and would include products like LÄRABAR, Nature Valley, Fiber One. So those products have very strong momentum and they're going to contribute to growth. We also have very strong initiatives in our yogurt businesses, and that will contribute as well to units. And then we have, we think, very, very prudent and reasonable volume assumptions on some of our bigger, more established categories like cereal and we think the mix, all-in, is very prudent. On the merchandising side, as we said, we took a lot of pricing last year. We've got it mostly right. Going forward, we're going to be adding some merchandising selectively in selective categories and product lines just to make sure that they are competitive, and as we say, in the zone. We typically do that anyway and following very substantial amount of price increases this year, we're going to be doing that again as we go into 2013 just to make sure that we have that value equation right everywhere. And it's important for us to do that. We constantly monitor the value. We're not looking at necessarily a price point. We're looking to be in a zone and -- that will allow our marketing programs and our consumer promotion programs to be as effective as they can be. So we'll be doing some of that as well."

So for instance, we used to have 4 different R&D groups working on snack bars depending on the division and we said that didn't really make -- we can do better than that.

And we've had very good success doing that over the last -- over the last several years and so we -- depending on the retailer, I mean we can go in and recommend another 2 feet, another 4 feet, another 6 feet. So we've done, I think, a very good job of playing a leadership role in that area and you are seeing across many of our large retail partners, we are seeing them expand the footage. And so then within that, our goal is to increase our distribution. We held it basically stable in 2012. We lost a little bit as we got to the end of the year, I mean very small amounts. But as we go in with all of these new items, we have the retailer very optimistic about the category and inclined to expand shelf space. We think we'll be able to hold our core distribution and add incrementally with new products that we think are quite exciting and quite incremental. So that's sort of the 1-2 punch to this."

Thanks for joining us this morning. As you’ve seen in our press release, we posted solid results in the fourth quarter. Slide 4 gives you a summary. Sales totaled $4.1 billion, up 12%. Segment operating profit was $737",1905,"Thanks, Kris, and hello, everyone. Thanks for joining us this morning. As you’ve seen in our press release, we posted solid results in the fourth quarter. Slide 4 gives you a summary. Sales totaled $4.1 billion, up 12%. Segment operating profit was $737 million, a 9% increase versus last year. Net earnings attributable to General Mills totaled $325 million. And diluted earnings per share were $0.49, as reported. Excluding changes in the mark-to-market valuations of certain commodity positions, integration expenses from the international Yoplait acquisition and the restructuring charges we announced at the end of last month, adjusted diluted EPS totaled $0.60, up 15% year-over-year.
Slide 5 summarizes operating highlights for the quarter. Net sales increased 3% excluding acquisitions, and all 3 of our business segments posted gains. Gross margin declined 140 basis points, excluding mark-to-market effects. This was an improvement from results through the first 9 months. The addition of Yoplait International to our business mix accounted for roughly 1/2 of the fourth quarter decline. Our media investment increased 11% in the quarter. And segment operating profit rose 9% with strong contributions from our International businesses and a 4% gain for our U.S. Retail business.
With this good fourth quarter finish, our annual results were consistent with revised guidance we provided in February. Slide 6 summarizes our results for 2012 in total. Sales grew 12% to $16.7 billion, led by the addition of Yoplait International and strong net price realization on our base business. Segment operating profit increased 2%, exceeding $3 billion for the first time in company history. This included input cost inflation of more than 10% along with an 8% increase in worldwide advertising expense. Diluted earnings per share declined 13% as reported. Adjusted diluted EPS, excluding certain items affecting comparability, reached $2.56, up 3% from last year. 
Results for our U.S. Retail segment reflected the challenged operating environment for food manufacturers in 2012. U.S. Retail net sales increased 3%, but segment operating profit was 2% below year-ago levels due to inflation, volume declines and a 5% increase in media investment. 
Our Bakeries and Foodservice business posted another year of solid top line growth. Sales increased 8% in 2012 with modest volume growth and strong net price realization both contributing to this increase. This performance is well ahead of the industry. And as you can see on Slide 8, we posted good growth across our key channels and brands. Operating profit for this segment declined as expected due to sharp input cost inflation and comparisons against record grain merchandising earnings last year.
Our International segment delivered another year of strong performance. Net sales and segment operating profit both increased nearly 50%, reflecting good contributions from our international Yoplait acquisition and growth in our base business. These good results included balanced growth across both developed and emerging markets. For example, in Western Europe, net sales for our base business increased 6% in constant currency. And in China, constant currency sales grew 22% for the year to reach $550 million, led by Häagen-Dazs and our line of Wanchai Ferry frozen dim sum items. And we are very pleased with the results of the Yoplait International yogurt business acquired last July. In our 3 largest markets, France, the U.K. and Canada, we delivered sales growth and market share gains, including 1 full point of share gain in France and nearly 3 points of share growth by our Liberté brand in Canada. 
In 2012, our global media expense increased 8% to exceed $900 million. This includes higher levels of investments in our core developed markets and media support behind our International businesses, including Yoplait. We increased our investment in targeted media vehicles like digital and multicultural. Based on measured media spending tracked by Kantar, we rank as the top U.S. advertiser among all food and beverage companies over the last 12 months.
Slide 11 summarizes our 2012 joint venture performance. Net sales for Cereal Partners Worldwide increased 5% in constant currency basis, led by mid-single-digit growth in developed markets like the U.K. and Australia and double-digit growth in the emerging markets in Asia and Latin America. For the year, we maintained our 23% value market share. 
CPW earnings declined in 2012, reflecting a onetime adjustment to tax reserve related to prior years, higher input cost and expenses for new manufacturing capacity in emerging markets, including Malaysia, Turkey, South Africa and Brazil. 
In Japan, constant currency sales for Häagen-Dazs increased at a mid-single-digit rate, but earnings were below year-ago levels. This is expected, given the difficult economic environment in Japan following the earthquakes and tsunami a year ago. That being said, this business finished the year a bit ahead of our plans.
Turning to the balance sheet. Slide 12 shows the components of core working capital. In a year where net sales increased 12%, our core working capital declined 7% as our focus on inventory reduction will improve working capital efficiency. Increased levels of accounts receivable and accounts payable, primarily from the Yoplait acquisition, were largely offsetting. 
Cash flow from operations totaled $2.4 billion, and this was after a $200 million voluntary cash contribution to our pension plan. This strong cash flow funded $676 million in capital spending. We invested in new manufacturing capacity in our snacks, cereal and yogurt businesses, and we funded multiple cost-savings projects across the company. We returned $1.1 billion of cash to shareholders, including a 9% increase in our dividend. And our strong profit growth and cash flow allowed us to fund 3 acquisitions and take on additional $544 million in debt while maintaining our credit rating.
Last month, we announced a restructuring program designed to improve our organizational effectiveness and alignment on our key growth strategies. We recorded a $101 million pretax charge in the fourth quarter, which we've excluded from adjusted diluted earnings per share. We expect to record an additional $19 million in pretax expense in fiscal 2013. We're estimating $75 million in annualized cost savings from this restructuring plan. 
In fiscal 2013, we realized the majority of these savings, roughly 80% of the full amount, which we reinvested to support our key growth strategies and to accelerate innovation across General Mills' global business platforms. In our U.S. yogurt business, we're launching 35 new items the first half of 2013. That's 3x the number in last year's first half. They were supporting our 2013 product news with increased levels of marketing investment and merchandising support. We're also investing to accelerate development for certain international businesses, including support for the Canadian Yoplait yogurt business we'll acquire in September and investment in emerging markets, particularly in China.
So let me outline more fully our fiscal 2013 plans, which call for another year of good sales and earnings growth for General Mills. We're targeting mid-single-digit sales growth. That includes good contributions from acquired business: Yoplait Canada, Yoplait Ireland, Food Should Taste Good, Parampara food products and 2 incremental months of Yoplait International. 
We also expect volume and sales growth on our base business. Input cost inflation is expected to run at a 2% to 3% rate. We expect to offset this inflation with supply chain productivity savings. We expect segment operating profit to grow slightly faster than sales with advertising and media support at or above this year's $914 million level. Our 2013 plan also includes reinvestments. As I mentioned earlier, the 3 key areas are our U.S. yogurt business; the Canadian Yoplait business we'll be assuming control of on September 1; and emerging market development. These investments total roughly $100 million pretax. In addition, we expect pension expense and tax rate to be headwinds for us in 2013.
The funded status of our qualified pension plans remains fairly healthy. Despite historically low interest and discount rates, we finished fiscal 2012 94% funded. In fiscal 2013, several changes will affect the calculation of our pension expenses: first, the discount rate we're required to use is 60 basis points below year-ago levels at a historically low 4.85%. In addition, we are lowering a rate of return assumption from 9.6% to 8.6%. This is a reflection of the lower equity market performance over the last decade and our view of long-term future market prospects. Along with various other smaller factors, these changes impact pension expense by $0.06 per share.
Slide 17 provides a summary of our earnings guidance for 2013 before any contribution from the Yoki acquisition in Brazil. We expect mid-single-digit growth in net sales. We see sales and volume growth trends for the base business weighted toward the second half of the year. Underlying gross margins are projected to improve modestly from 2012 levels. We expect our media investment to at least match last year's strong level of investments. We project our operating profit will grow at a mid-single-digit rate. We're assuming an effective tax rate of 33%. This is higher than 2012, which benefited primarily from a onetime adjustment in our tax reserve, but is in line with recent years' average rate. And we expect joint venture earnings to grow at a double-digit rate. In terms of phasing, we expect first quarter earnings per share to be below last year with growth across the remaining 9 months of the year.
At the end of May, we signed a definitive agreement to acquire Yoki Alimentos, a family-owned food business in Brazil. We expect the transaction will close during the first half of fiscal 2013. Yoki's 4 largest businesses, popcorn, basic foods, seasonings and side dishes, are growing at a double-digit rate in recent years and hold leading share positions. In fiscal 2011, Yoki reported IFRS sales of roughly $550 million with EBIT margins in the low double-digit range. We expect Yoki to contribute nicely to sales and operating profit in 2013. That will be offset by onetime transaction costs, incremental amortization expense and funding costs, so we're estimating a roughly $0.02 to $0.03 drag to adjusted diluted EPS in 2013 from the partial-year impact of Yoki. On an annualized basis, the addition of Yoki will roughly double our sales in Latin America and significantly increase our scale in Brazil. We'll gain an extensive supply chain network and a national sales force. We're very excited to add Yoki's people and products to our company.
As you can see on Slide 19, we expect adjusted diluted earnings per share of roughly $2.65 in fiscal 2013. This includes the $0.06 of additional pension expense, a $0.02 hit from the higher tax rate and a $0.02 to $0.03 drag from the anticipated Yoki acquisition. Our adjusted EPS excludes onetime integration costs, mark-to-market effects and restructuring charges.
We expect to couple good sales and profit growth in 2013 with increased cash return to shareholders, inclusive of the Yoki acquisition. Yesterday, we announced an 8% dividend increase to a new annualized rate of $1.32 per share. This represents a roughly 3.5% yield at recent stock prices. And we're planning a higher level of share repurchase activity than in 2012. So share repurchases are expected to contribute to EPS growth in fiscal 2013. 
We believe our operating plans for 2013 are quite strong. We have high levels of innovation planned across our core product portfolio. We'll have good contributions from recently acquired businesses. Sales and operating profits are expected to grow at mid-single-digit rate, and that's before any contribution from Yoki. 
To tell you more about our plans for next year, I'll now turn the call over to Ken."

As you all know, the last 12 months was a challenging period for the food industry. Input costs increased at the highest rate in over 3 decades, and the pace of economic recovery around the world remains slow at best. As we move into fiscal 2013, we expect slow economic growth to continue, and we think the packaged foods business will remain very competitive. The restructuring program we announced last month will better align and focus resources against our best opportunities for growth, accelerate our innovation efforts and make General Mills a more efficient organization. It will generate savings we will invest back in our businesses and enable us to deliver a balanced plan for growth across our global platforms. And I want to tell you a bit more about this initiative.
In our U.S. Retail segment that reports to Ian Friendly, we're strengthening our alignment and focus by creating 3 new divisions. Our new Meals division will be solely focused on our key center store meal items: Progresso soup, Helper dinner mixes, Old El Paso Mexican foods and Betty Crocker side dishes. This alignment allows us to increase our emphasis on these important brands and to strengthen their growth. 
The new Frozen Foods division combines our frozen entrées, Totino's pizza, Totino's hot snacks, Pillsbury breakfast pastries and Green Giant items. This division focus will better leverage our frozen foods' scale and consumer insights in order to increase our executional capability, and it will allow us to more effectively partner with our customers in this important and growing section of the grocery store. 
And finally, we've combined our baking expertise across Pillsbury refrigerated dough and Betty Crocker dessert mixes to create a new Baking Products division. With many complementary products from shelf-stable mixes to refrigerated ready-to-bake items, we will more efficiently serve the baking consumer moving forward.
Now our Big G snacks, Yoplait and Small Planet Foods division already have good category focus, and they remain unchanged. Jim Murphy has assumed leadership of Big G, as Jeff Harmening has moved to become CEO of Cereal Partners Worldwide. Christi Strauss, who led CPW for the last 6 years, is currently on sabbatical. 
In our International segment that reports to Chris O'Leary, we are creating a new regional operating structure to maximize growth in developed markets and drive differential growth in emerging markets. We're creating a new Europe Australasia region focused on driving developed market growth. The other regions are Canada, the Latin America region, the Greater China Region and a region combining Asia, the Middle East and Africa. And we'll also have 2 strategic business units designed to centralize and coordinate growth strategies for our 2 biggest global brands: Yoplait and Häagen-Dazs. This new structure will allow us to generate cost efficiencies across our international operations that will help fund business development around the world. 
In Bakeries and Foodservice, our business realignment began several years ago. By focusing on the fastest-growing customer segments and higher-margin product lines, we've grown sales and profits, and we've expanded operating margins by several hundred basis points. So we're going to stick with this strategic approach moving forward. John Machuzick, who led the transformation of this business, is retiring in August after a highly distinguished 34-year career with General Mills. He will be succeeded by Dave Dudick, who most recently led our U.S. channel sales team focused on supercenter, club and alternate format customers. 
Our restructuring program is truly a company-wide initiative. Across every function, we've identified opportunities to reduce duplication and centralize capabilities, making us a more efficient and a more cost-effective organization. Savings from these restructuring actions will accelerate our investment in strategies to drive future growth, and I'm very confident that these changes will lead to continued strong operating results for General Mills.
Our strategies for growth are focused on 5 global categories: ready-to-eat cereal, super-premium ice cream, convenient meals, wholesome snack bars and yogurt. Euromonitor data shows that these are big categories, projected to grow at mid- to single-digit rates in the years ahead, and innovation plays a key role in driving global category growth. So I want to share our plans for growth on each of these platforms, beginning with our newest global business, yogurt. 
The international Yoplait business we acquired last July delivered strong results in 2012, and we've got plans for continued international yogurt growth in 2013. In France, we're launching new varieties of Calin, a functional yogurt high in calcium. We're expanding Calin to the U.K. market with a 3-item launch. We're supporting both new and established yogurt products with higher levels of advertising. And we've expanded our European yogurt business by reacquiring the Ireland Yoplait license. Retail sales of Yoplait in Ireland totaled $65 million in the last 12 months.
In Canada, we expect to increase household penetration for our Liberté brand through distribution gains and new flavors of core Greek and Mediterranean product lines and expansion into drinkable and kid varieties. And reacquiring control of the Yoplait business this fall will also significantly increase our scale. Together, Liberté and Yoplait account for roughly 35% of total Canadian yogurt market sales. 
In the U.S., we are innovating across multiple segments of the yogurt category. We are the market leader in the light segment. And we're launching a lower-calorie Greek offering, new Yoplait Greek 100-calorie yogurt. And we're bringing product news to Yoplait Light. It's now just 90 calories per cup. And both of these items are the only Weight-Watchers-endorsed products in the category. We have increased levels of advertising planned on our kid yogurt business. We're expanding our regional Mountain High large-size business to a national offering. And today, large-size yogurt represents 9% of category sales. We are launching Yoplait Simplait, a line of great-tasting, all-natural yogurts with just 6 simple ingredients. And we're also launching Yoplait Fruplait with twice the fruit. And our U.S. yogurt innovation extends beyond the Yoplait brand. Liberté is a leading player in Canada's fast-emerging Greek segment. We're bringing this great-tasting product to the U.S. with a 6-item launch. The regional rollout begins this summer. We're also increasing distribution of Liberté Méditerranée, a highly indulgent yogurt available in 7 varieties, including coconut and French vanilla. We believe this strong innovation lineup will renew sales growth for our U.S. yogurt business in fiscal 2013. And we will share more details of our yogurt plan at our New York meeting on July 10.
Let me turn to ice cream. Our Häagen-Dazs business had a terrific year in 2012 with constant currency sales up 16%, and we look to continue that momentum in 2013. We are planning to open roughly 80 additional shops this year, including 50 in China. The launch of Secret Sensations was a big success last year, and in 2013, we're adding a new meringue and raspberry flavor, and we're launching this line to additional markets in Europe, Asia and South America. We're also adding flavors to our core Häagen-Dazs product line and rolling out a new package design. And we expect to increase our media investments at a double-digit pace behind our global advertising campaign.
Convenient meals are important for today's busy consumers, and we have strong growth plans in place for our brands in 2013. In the U.S., our Progresso Recipe Starters are easy base sauces to use in a wide range of recipes. We're expanding our Hamburger Helper business with new package sizes that are perfect for club stores and dollar stores. In Europe, we'll drive growth on our Old El Paso business through improved advertising, in-store displays and the expansion of recent new products to new markets. And we'll continue to add new products and new cities for our Wanchai Ferry business in Greater China.
Now let's turn to wholesome snack bars. In the U.S., we've led the growth of the grain bar category for several years, including nearly 5 points of share growth in 2012 alone. And we've got a strong lineup of new items in 2013. We are expanding our Fiber One franchise with the launch of Fiber One Chewy Bars, and we're building on last year's highly successful Fiber One Brownies with a new flavor and a new package size. We expect continued growth for Nature Valley Protein Bars launched last January, and we're adding a dark chocolate and peanut butter crunchy bar variety. We are targeting another year of growth for LÄRABAR, and we’re launching Über bars in away-from-home channels along with new Gardetto's snack crackers and additional varieties of Betty Crocker Sweet Rewards bars.
Wholesome snack bars are a hit in markets around the world, and we've got strong plans for international growth in 2013. In Canada, we're bringing innovation to the category with Fiber One 110 Calorie Brownies and Nature Valley granola Thins. In Europe, we're expanding our Nature Valley franchise with the launch of a new Sweet & Nutty product line. Nature Valley also will be an official product sponsor of the Olympic Games in London next month. 
Our largest global business is cereal. In the U.S., we posted market share gains in each of the last 5 years, exceeding a 31% dollar share across all channels in 2012. And we have a strong growth plan for our U.S. cereal business in 2013. Peanut Butter MultiGrain Cheerios, launched in January, continues to perform very well. It's the biggest new cereal among the 25 items launched in the category since January. We've just introduced gluten-free Apple Cinnamon Chex. New Fiber One Nutty Clusters & Almonds is a great-tasting cereal that delivers 40% of a consumer's daily value for fiber. And we've added Cascadian Farm Ancient Grains Granola to our line of Cascadian Farm organic cereals. 
We've also got news on established cereal brands. We'll remind consumers that all Big G cereals contain more whole grain than any other single ingredient, that original Cheerios provide heart health benefit and that several varieties of Chex cereals are gluten-free. 
We're bringing innovation to our international cereal businesses as well. In Canada, we've increased our cereal market share by 5.5 points over the last 5 years, reaching nearly a 30% share of the category in 2012. Outside North America, Cereal Partners Worldwide will increase marketing investment against each of its core brands: Cheerios, Nesquik, Chocapic and Fitness. CPW has some great-tasting new products, too, including Fitness White Chocolate and Chocapic Pillows. 
So as we look to fiscal 2013 and beyond, we see the prospects for General Mills as very bright. Our 5 global product categories deliver foods that are convenient, nutritious and they taste great, all at good value. These 5 platforms account for over 60% of our worldwide sales, and they have terrific growth prospects. And our brands hold leading positions in these large and growing global categories. So we really like the prospects for increasing our sales, earnings and market share positions in these categories in the years ahead. 
We’re continuing our evolution into a truly global food company. 10 years ago, just 5% of General Mills' sales were generated outside of the U.S., and most of that business was in Canada. Today, half of all General Mills' employees work outside the U.S., and we sell our products in over 100 countries. Including our proportionate share of joint ventures, international net sales now exceed $5 billion and represent over 30% of General Mills' total worldwide sales. 
Now, while we are pleased with our progress in international markets, we remain very committed to driving growth in our core U.S. market. And with increased levels of investments in our U.S. yogurt business and a very strong lineup of product news and innovation across our domestic portfolio, we like our U.S. growth prospects moving forward. 
We enter 2013 confident that we are positioned for another year of balanced growth at General Mills. We're investing to keep our established brands healthy and to launch new products in both developed and emerging markets. We'll make investments to ensure our products are competitive and investments to fuel our global growth. We believe our 2013 targets strike the right balance between sales and profit growth in the current year and reinvestment to support our longer-term progress. 
I'll wrap this up -- I'll wrap up this morning by reminding you about our investor meeting in New York on Tuesday, July 10, where we will discuss our plans for 2013 in more detail. Presentations will begin at 10 a.m. Eastern Time, and they will also be webcast.

First off, when we think about growing our business, first order of business is ensure that we have a very strong base business, whether that is here in the U.S., Canada, Europe. And you saw those results this year with Europe, for example, showing mid-single-digit base business sales growth. And so that's always job one, is to make sure that we have a very vibrant base business. Then where we see incremental opportunities is in international, particularly in emerging markets. We have a fabulous business in China that's growing over 20% this year. We're augmenting that with obviously an acquisition -- a soon-to-be acquisition in Brazil. But also on an organic basis, we're plotting back several earnings growth to accelerate even faster in China, for example, and we've done that for the last 3 to 4 years. And while we've done that, you still see that International has grown quite nicely on both the top and bottom line. So this isn't a change of direction. We've been trying to be pretty transparent about that over the last few years that we've been putting additional money back into those markets because we see a long-term growth potential."

And then we have, we think, very, very prudent and reasonable volume assumptions on some of our bigger, more established categories like cereal, and we think the mix, all-in, is very prudent. On the merchandising side, as we said, we took a lot of pricing last year. We got it mostly right. Going forward, we're going to be adding some merchandising selectively in selective categories and product lines, just to make sure that they are competitive and, as we say, in the zone. We typically do that anyway, and following very substantial amount of price increases this year, we're going to be doing that again as we go into 2013, just to make sure that we have that value equation right everywhere. And it's important for us to do that. We constantly monitor the value. We're not looking at necessarily a price point. We're looking to be in a zone and -- that will allow our marketing programs and our consumer promotion programs to be as effective as they can be. So we'll be doing some of that as well."

So for instance, we used to have 4 different R&D groups working on snack bars, depending on the division, and we said that didn't really make -- we can do better than that. Let's put them all together and have one group focusing on that big platform. So we've done other things like that, and altogether, that would be the bigger number.

But Don, maybe you can just help me clear up any of this.

So we've done, I think, a very good job of playing a leadership role in that area, and you are seeing -- across many of our large retail partners, we are seeing them expand the footage. And so then within that, our goal is to increase our distribution. We held it basically stable in 2012. We lost a little bit as we got to the end of the year, and I mean very small amounts. But as we go in with all of these new items, we have the retailer very optimistic about the category and inclined to expand shelf space.

Slide 4 summarizes our results for the quarter. Sales totaled $4.1 billion, up 5%, and segment operating profit increased 6% to $769 million. These results were led by International segment including contributions from acquired businesses. Net earnings totaled $549 million, and diluted earnings per share were $0.82 as reported. These results included net increase in the mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions in grain inventories, along with the onetime tax benefit and restructuring charges. Excluding these items affecting comparability, our adjusted diluted EPS would be $0.66. This was a bit better than we planned, thanks to strong international performance that benefited operating profit and contributed to lower underlying tax rate.
Slide 5 shows the component of our net sales growth. On an as-reported basis, net sales increased 5% with growth driven by acquisitions.  Pound volume contributed 9 points of growth in the quarter, sales mix and net price realization subtracted 2 points of sales growth, and foreign exchange also reduced net sales by 2 points. Excluding acquisitions, net sales were 1% below year-ago levels as reported and up 1% in constant currency. 
Slide 6 details net sales performance for our newly organized U.S. retail divisions. In total, net sales declined 1%, including the impact of merchandising spending to support new item launches and sharper price points on certain established products. Pound volume was 2% lower in the quarter. This was a sequential improvement from the previous quarter, and I think with the steady improvement through the last 3 months.
Sales for our Bakeries and Foodservice segment declined 2% in the first quarter. Pound volume was up 2%, but that growth was offset by negative price realization mix. Hot breakfast items, snacks and baking mixes lead our sales performance in the quarter. 
As shown on Slide 8, our first quarter international net sales grew 36% on a constant currency basis, with growth across all 4 regions. In Canada, sales increased 28% including the acquired Liberté yogurt business. Sales for the region combining Europe, Australia and New Zealand increased 51%. This top line performance reflects the addition of Yoplait International and good gains by Nature Valley in the U.K., Häagen-Dazs in France and Old El Paso in Australia. Sales in the Asia-Pacific region increased 20% led by China. And the Latin America, constant currency sales increased 20%. This was before Yoki, which began contributing to General Mills sales and operating profits in our second quarter. 
Excluding acquisitions, international constant currency sales increased at an 8% rate in Q1.
For the first quarter, our underlying gross margin declined 40 basis points to 38.2%. This excludes the impact of mark-to-market valuation for certain grain inventories and commodity hedges we'll use in future periods. In addition of Yoplait International accounts for the majority of the underlying gross margin decline. The remainder reflects higher input cost. The grain cost have gone up this summer, we're still estimating 2% to 3% inflation for General Mills in fiscal 2013, well below last year's 10% inflation rate and we're now roughly 75% covered on our commodity needs for the fiscal year.
Slide 10 shows our first quarter operating profit growth split up by segment. U.S. Retail profit was 2% below year-ago levels nearing the volume trend. Advertising expense was down 13% in the quarter as our marketing spending was weighted towards promotional activity this period. International profit increased 56%. That includes incremental contributions from Yoplait and a 17% increase in advertising spending. Excluding acquisitions, profit still increased at a double-digit rate. Bakeries and Foodservice profit grew 10% in the quarter reflecting pound volume growth and higher grain merchandising earnings.
After tax earnings from joint ventures were lower in the quarter, primarily reflecting input cost inflation and unfavorable foreign exchange for CPW. On a constant currency basis, CPW sales increased 1% with double-digit sales growth in emerging markets, largely offset by category weakness in Western Europe. 
Constant currency sales for Häagen-Dazs Japan grew 4%, led by new products in distribution gains. 
Completing our review of the income statement, corporate unallocated expenses excluding mark-to-market effects were up $11 million in the quarter, primarily due to higher pension expense. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 22.7% as reported, well below last year due to a onetime non-cash tax benefits from the restructuring of subsidiary, which resulted in a reduction of deferred tax liabilities. Excluding items affecting comparability, our tax rate was 31.4% this year compared to 32.4% a year ago. We still see our full year underlying tax rate running at about 33%. The average diluted shares outstanding were essentially flat in the quarter. For the full year, we continue to target a net reduction in average diluted shares outstanding.
Turning to the balance sheet. Let me first answer a likely question. The large increase in cash in our balance sheet is the funding for Yoki. We funded $851 million of the $940 million purchase price of cash. And since we report our Brazil business on a 1-month lag, this cash was still reflected in our balance sheet at the end of the quarter. With the Yoki acquisition closed and the maturity of a long-term debt note earlier this month, our cash balance today has returned to a more normalized level. Now in the quarter where net sales increased 5%, our core working capital declined 4%. Our working capital efficiency continues to trends improved operating cash flow. Over the last 5 years, our operating cash flow has increased at a 7% compound rate. And growth and operating cash flow accelerated to 11% this quarter.
So the first quarter completed, we're on track to achieve our 2013 targets. We expect to deliver mid-single-digit growth in net sales and segment operating profit on the base business, with Yoki Brazil and Yoplait Canada contributing 9 months of incremental sales and profit this year. We expect to generate adjusted diluted earnings per share of approximately $2.65. As a reminder, our EPS guidance excludes mark-to-market effects, restructure expense, acquisition integration cost and this quarter's onetime tax benefit. With that, I'll turn the microphone over to John for update on our U.S. business. Don?"

A lot of investors interest in snacks business and Yoplait I like to get an update on our U.S. snacks portfolio and the growth that we're seeing on our brands. U.S. consumers are snacking more than ever. Consumers Grapher quick refill. Instead of minus margin consumers increasingly looking for options to provide real nutritional benefits. So it's no wonder that better snacks and the fast-growing segment is the snacks category. We define the segment using a variety of needles and measure categories. And retail sales increased 6% fiscal 2012 to reach nearly $30 billion. We see plenty of room for continued growth in the segment.
Reported net sales for our Snacks division have grown in an 8% compound rate over the past 3 years and were up 15% in fiscal 2012. So we're gaining share in this better segment. Our snacks portfolio 3 distinct categories: Grain, fruit and savory snacks, as shown on Slide 18. 
Fiscal 2012, these 3 segments generated $1.6 billion of recorded net sales. We have a strong presence in traditional grocery stores, where our pound volume grew 3% last year. With the majority of our snacks volume sold in the faster growing nontraditional food outlets such as mass merchandisers, club and dollar stores. 
For example, club stores represent our largest nontraditional channel. Our pound volume grew 8% there last year as our larger represent valued club consumers. We continue to bring product strong innovation to this channel. 
Small-store formats like dollar stores are growth channels, too. Here we offer smaller packages and attractive dollar price point that introduces new consumers to our brands. Our regular package also sell well in these outlets, making us our fastest-growing channel pound volume up 9% last year. 
General Mills is the market leader in the $900 million fruit snacks category. Category sales are growing at a 3% pace in the latest 12 months, driven by increasing popularity of fruit snacks of all family appeal. Last year, we saw heightened competition from value players in this segment, resulting in a share decline for us. We expect to post renewed sales and share growth this year with the solid line of new products, including fruit snacks that appeal to kids and adults alike. 
Our made real fruit and juice and 100% of the daily vitamin C, which is 80 calories per serving. We just launched this line, it's off to a great start. The savory snacks category generates more than $2 billion in annual retail sales, has grown at a 9% rate over the past year. We just launched double new flavors of our very popular Chex Mix and introduced a new product line Pillsbury Baguette Chips. These are made from big bread and great by themselves or with your favorite dip. 
And of course, great snack bars are our largest and fastest growing business. We created this category back in 1975 with the launch of Nature Valley Granola Bars. Today, the category generates $3 billion in retail sales and it's growing at a 5% annual rate. Our sales are well outpacing the category, driving solid market share gains for us. As you could see on Slide 21, our dollar share of the categories increased 10 points over the past 5 years. And through the first quarter of fiscal 2013, we gained another full point of share. We're growing our sales and the category by innovating with the regional Nature Valley Crunchy bars growing and we got a new flavors in formats. in 2006 will is a very successful Fiber One snack bar line and not a whole level of market growth.
In fiscal 2012, we've tried to expanded the Fiber One line of introduction of 90-calorie brownies. In one year just 2 brownie flavors generated more than $100 million of retail sales. To put that into context, one industry benchmarks standard of $50 million for successful new product introduction. 
We're currently launching a 90-calorie chocolate chip cookie this off to a terrific start. We are also just launching new Fiber One Chewy Bars, available in kid flavors like chocolate and peanut butter and jelly, and just 100 calories per bar, they have the nutrition that moms love, reporting 20% of the daily value of fiber and 10% of the daily value of calcium. 
When it comes to grain snacks, Nature Valley contains to be our flagship brand. Our news variety Nature Valley Protein Bars which contain 10 grams of protein in each bar. They contribute double-digit retail sales growth for the brand in fiscal 2012, and they're on track to be the biggest Fiber One Brownies in year one retail sales. We have new flavors and formats in Nature Valley bars coming throughout the year. We expect the brand to continue to lead our snacks portfolio.
Now I've been talking specifically about our U.S. Snacks division, but of course General Mills snacks business is much broader than this. Small market Cascadian Farm organic granola bars along with lower bars and were bars, which are great tasting natural nutrition bar options. The retails growing at a double-digit rate. And Food Should Taste Good chips have been a great addition to our natural foods offerings. Our snacks are growing nicely at food-service outlets too. Net sales were up 11% in the first quarter, driven by new product introductions and distribution gains in convenience stores. And we are just beginning to tap into the possibilities for our snacks internationally. Our U.S. portfolio's innovation pipeline for international markets. For example, Nature Valley brand is available in nearly 80 markets around the world and we're seeing many opportunities to expand our other snacks brands in more international markets as the global middle class continues to expand, and we gain scale in more emerging markets worldwide.
So to summarize my comments this morning, the future is bright for General Mills U.S. snacks division, as consumers are snacking more, increasingly better options. We are building on our history of innovation, solid new product introductions across our 3 product platforms. We are also leveraging our strong brand of fast-growing natural food outlets, which should drive sales and profit growth in the U.S. and around the world in fiscal 2013 and beyond. Thank you for your time this morning. I'll now turn the call over to Ken Powell."
274715,216590041,359175,"General Mills, Inc., Q1 2013 Earnings Call, Sep 19, 2012",2012-09-19,"Earnings Calls","General Mills, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, John, and good morning, everybody. We just heard about the terrific innovation that John and his team have going in our U.S. Snacks business. So I'm going to give you a quick summary of the business trends and innovation that we're seeing elsewher",1885,"Thanks, John, and good morning, everybody. We just heard about the terrific innovation that John and his team have going in our U.S. Snacks business. So I'm going to give you a quick summary of the business trends and innovation that we're seeing elsewhere at General Mills. 
Across our U.S. Retail categories, we are seeing pricing moderate and volume improve as we begin to lap last year's significant price increases. As Don mentioned earlier, we still expect inflation in 2013, but at a rate well below the 10% we experienced in 2012. So we do anticipate a more stable good price environment for consumers as we go forward.
We're seeing improving trends for our business as well. In the first quarter, General Mills U.S. Retail pound volume declined 2% and demonstrated sequential improvement over last year. Underlying gross margin for General Mills showed sequential improvement as well, and we expect both our volume and gross margin trends to continue to improve in the remaining 9 months of the year. Our confidence reflects the fact that our categories are on trend with consumer demand for great tasting, healthy and convenient foods, all at a good value. Because they're on trend, our categories are growing. Each of our 10 largest categories generates at least $2 billion in annual retail sales, and with combined sales of over $40 billion, even low single-digit growth on this sales base is significant.
We are innovating to drive growth for our brands in our categories. Let me give you a few examples. The gluten-free benefit of our Chex cereals continues to resonate with consumers. Sales of new Apple Cinammon Chex are off to a strong start, and we are reaching consumers with both traditional and digital advertising. In combination, these activities drove a 23% retail sales gain for Chex in the first quarter. 
Multigrain Cheerios continues to post strong gains, including the new peanut butter variety. First quarter retail sales increased 19%. And Cascadian Farm is the #1 granola brand in America, organic or otherwise. We just added an ancient grains variety and increased marketing support helping to drive an 11% increase in retail sales this quarter. 
For our cereal business in total, we experienced a rare decline in sales this quarter as merchandising levels were below the year-ago period. But we expect our growth momentum to resume in the second quarter, and we continue to expect sales and earnings growth for Big G in 2013 in total.
The first quarter sales decline for our U.S. yogurt business overall masks some good progress made in this period. Our Greek yogurt business turned in a good performance led by our multipack items. Our Greek retail sales increased 85%, and we picked up nearly a full point of the market share in the Greek segment this quarter. As you know, our 2013 plans for Greek yogurt are just getting started. New Yoplait Greek 100-calorie yogurt is just starting to hit store shelves across the country. And while it's early days, we're very pleased with the initial reaction to this product. We're just now activating our fully integrated marketing campaign and dedicated advertising behind this new line.
We sharpen our merchandise price points on our core cup products. Customer feedback has been very positive, and broad-based execution is planned throughout the coming months. While it's still early, volume trends on this key business are improving. 
Across our U.S. yogurt business in total, we launched 35 new items in the first quarter. These new items have been well accepted by our customers and shipments are building. In addition to Yoplait Greek 100, this includes expanded distribution of our Mountain High brand and the beginning of a phase U.S. rollout of Liberté. So as we move into the second quarter, we are excited about our innovation and marketing plans in U.S. yogurt.
Other first quarter highlights included good growth from Progresso. We've launched new flavors of Progresso light and continue to focus our advertising on the great taste of our ready-to-serve soups. In our new recipe starter sauces have enjoyed good customer orders to date. In total, first quarter retail sales for Progresso increased 14%, and we added 3 points of market share in the ready-to-serve segment. 
On our Totino's hot snacks business, a significant increase in media investment and distribution gains drove growth across our product line. A combination of strong in-store merchandising support, digital media and contributions from new products drove market share gains in our Pillsbury refrigerated dough items. And Green Giant Seasoned Steamers are the latest addition to our frozen vegetable portfolio. We will begin to activate support for this seasonal business in the second quarter of the year.
In total, we launched over 70 U.S. Retail new products in the first quarter alone. Account acceptance of these new items is in total above our expectations, and we've got more innovation to come later in the year. As we told you in July, our plans call for points of distribution to decline through the first quarter of 2013, largely reflecting the timing of our new product launches. We expect improved distribution trends over the remaining 9 months of the year and look to achieve distribution growth for the year in total. 
As our new items reach good store level distribution, we'll be activating our media and marketing campaigns against these businesses. We are ramping up activity behind our seasonal items such as soup, baking products and frozen vegetables, and we continue to improve the efficiency and impact of our advertising dollars with targeted investments in digital and multicultural media.
We also have a variety of second quarter merchandising events planned to drive customer and consumer excitement. We're expanding our Save Lids to Save Lives program, which benefits breast cancer research. Starting this month, more than 20 General Mills brands will carry pink lids on over 400 million packages. This program extends to our Bakeries and Foodservice businesses too. We're partnering with sororities across the country to increase breast cancer awareness on-campus. 
In total, General Mills will donate $0.10 per every lid redeemed up to a maximum total donation of $2.5 million. We also continue to expand our successful Box Tops for Education program. Since the inception of this program, we've raised over $475 million for schools across the country.
These are just a few of the merchandising programs we have planned in the months ahead, and with continued strong levels of marketing support and product innovation, we're excited about our prospects for growth in U.S. Retail over the balance of 2013. 
Let me turn to our International segment. In the first quarter, we delivered good performance in Europe. Yogurt is our largest business there. Fueled by sales of new varieties of Calin, a functional yogurt high in calcium, and higher levels of advertising across our yogurt portfolio, retail sales increased at a mid- single-digit rate in the quarter, and we added roughly a half a point of market share. Our Europe yogurt results now include Ireland where we reacquired the Yoplait license in may.
Häagen-Dazs had a good quarter in Europe too. Retail sales increased at a double-digit rate. Our Secret Sensations product was a huge hit in 2012, so we've introduced it into new markets with the new flavor and a new package size in 2013. We've also launched new varieties of pints in many cups and integrated our marketing efforts across Häagen-Dazs shops and retail outlets. 
For our euro business in total, we are pleased with our performance. Our growth in this region continues to outpace results for many of our multinational food peers. We now have a great branded position in the important European yogurt market and our other key categories of superpremium ice cream, Mexican Mills and grain snacks are all in relatively early stages of development in Europe. So we have great opportunities ahead to increase household penetration of our brands to drive future top line growth.
In Canada, yogurt is a $1.4 billion category. And over the last 5 years, sales have been growing at a 7% rate. In our Canadian yogurt business, we are increasing household penetration on our Liberté brand with distribution gains, new products and television advertising for the first time in Liberté's history. And earlier this month, General Mills assumed the Canada Yoplait business from the previous licensee. We are planning significant levels of investment behind the Yoplait brand in Canada, including new product innovation, improvements on established products and increased advertising. Together, our Liberté and Yoplait brands hold a 35% share of category sales in Canada. 
With Yoplait added to our business, we are projecting well over $1 billion of retail sales in Canada this fiscal year, making us the fourth largest food manufacturer in the country.
As you know, we're also working to expand our business in emerging markets. We have a large business today in Greater China, and we continue to see robust growth there. First quarter sales in constant currency grew at a strong double-digit rate. This performance is being led by Häagen-Dazs and our line of Wanchai Ferry frozen dim sum items. And while the overall Chinese economy may be slowing a bit, the demand for branded consumer food products continues to expand. Increasing numbers of Chinese consumers want foods that offer quality, convenience, nutrition and taste, all at a good value. And for our business in China, we're seeing robust growth in both existing and new cities. So we expect demand for our products to remain strong in this important market.
Our growth in India is being driven by our new whole wheat and premium varieties of Pillsbury Atta flour, Häagen-Dazs Secret Sensations and contributions from our recent acquisition of Parampara foods branded meal starters. In Brazil, the acquisition of Yoki makes us very excited about our growth prospects. Yoki products are quite popular with Brazilian consumers and hold leading market share positions in growing categories. And our integration efforts are off to a great start. Given Yoki's terrific breadth and scale, we are integrating General Mills Brazilian employees, products and systems into the Yoki business. We're just 1 month in and we're already invoicing our customers as a combined company. And the combination of Yoki and General Mills makes us the 15th largest food company in Brazil, significantly expanding our scale in this important market. We look forward to reporting back to you on the growth of this business starting in the second quarter. 
So with that, let me summarize today's General Mills update. Our first quarter performance was broadly in line with our expectations. Volume and gross margin trends are improving, and we launched over 100 new products. In the second quarter, we'll support both our established and new items with strong levels of media and merchandising. In both Yoplait Canada and Yoki, we will begin to contribute to our net sales an operating profit. For the full year, we are on track to deliver our sales and profit targets. And more broadly, we see our business portfolio better positioned than ever to deliver balanced global growth for shareholders in the years ahead.
So thank you for your time this morning and for your interest in General Mills. With this, I'm going to open the call for questions. Operator, would you please get us started."

We close those out during the course of the year. We had some favorable audit closures in the first quarter that benefited the rate as well and that visibility until those are settled.

As Ken, as we said before, as Ken pointed to some data this morning, in the U.S. we see prices lap our increases in the industries increases from last year, we expect volume to stabilize as, we are starting to see that in the categories, and so that will benefit us as the year unfolds. Second is as you point to, we do expect some deceleration of inflation although I would caution that with the current drought and movement, there is some more pressure that we have anticipated coming into the year. And that will play through in the latter part of the year. We still are in that 2% to 3% range of inflation. But obviously, bit more pressure given where the markets have moved over the last couple of months. And then we expect to see continued strength in International as we alluded to the growth quite nicely in the first quarter on as-reported basis, you strip out acquisitions, top line grew 8% on a constant currency basis. And so that provides continued momentum as the year unfolds. And our bakers in Foodservice business started the year well 2% volume growth, 10% profit growth.

And that, combined with the difficult consumer backdrop. Based on what you're starting to see at least in some of your key categories, I mean it sounds like you're basically getting at that latter point which is it seems like it was primarily the pricing and as that moderates, volume sort of starts to come back.

And clearly, last year, with a very high inflation in the industry, over 10% for us and all the pricing, there's no doubt that, that was the biggest single factor and consumers responded as we predicted they would with lower unit volume sales. So I think we had a chart in our presentation this morning that demonstrated very clearly that as we begin to sequentially lap that period of time, we're seeing the price comparisons moderate and the unit volumes improve for our category. And we are seeing that as well in our business. Now it's not -- this is not a perfect science, and I think it will -- but our belief, our strong belief is that we're going to continue to see that sort of stabilization in consumer prices and recovery of demand as we progress throughout the year."

But it's a good question, and I understand the intent behind it. But let me make first comment, the sales increases over the last couple of years largely driven by that kind of inflation-driven pricing. So I just think that it's important to keep that in mind. But stepping back a bit, I think the larger context for us on advertising is that we've increased our levels very, very significantly over the last several years. I think we're up close to 50%. I think some of the tracking services have us now as the largest advertiser in the industry. And we have very, very solid shares of voice in the vast majority of our categories, in many cases they're increasing. So we are very committed to advertising that drives our business. But I think as we've said several times over last year, I mean, our goal at these levels is to kind of in line with sales or be roughly at this level. And you're right, as we enter a period where the merchandising environment is very dynamic, as we saw in the first quarter this year, we do want to make sure that we're paying very close attention to what we need to do to be in the right value zone in terms of price points and merchandising. I think it's really important for us to do that given the mindset of the consumer these days. So we are going to be making tactical trade-offs there. But I will tell you, having said that, our advertising is and will be at very, very high levels and very competitive, very strong share of voice. But we want to keep that value components -- we want to be focused on that as well and make sure that our products are in the right zone."

Thank you for joining us this morning. Slide 4 summarizes our results for the quarter. Sales totaled $4.1 billion, up 5%, and segment operating profit increased 6% to $769 million. These results were led by our Internat",1037,"Thanks, Kris and hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us this morning. 
Slide 4 summarizes our results for the quarter. Sales totaled $4.1 billion, up 5%, and segment operating profit increased 6% to $769 million. These results were led by our International segment, including contributions from acquired businesses. Net earnings totaled $549 million, and diluted earnings per share were $0.82 as reported. These results included net increase in the mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions in grain inventories, along with the one-time tax benefit and restructuring charges. Excluding these items affecting comparability, our adjusted diluted EPS would be $0.66. This was a bit better than we planned, thanks to strong international performance that benefited operating profit and contributed to lower underlying tax rate.
Slide 5 shows the components of our net sales growth. On an as-reported basis, net sales increased 5% with growth driven by acquisitions. Pound volume contributed 9 points of growth in the quarter, sales mix and net price realization subtracted 2 points of sales growth, and foreign exchange also reduced net sales by 2 points. Excluding acquisitions, net sales were 1% below year-ago levels as reported and up 1% in constant currency.
Slide 6 details net sales performance for our newly organized U.S. retail divisions. In total, net sales declined 1%, including the impact of merchandising spending to support new item launches and sharper price points on certain established products. Pound volume was 2% lower in the quarter. This was a sequential improvement from the previous quarter, and it included steady improvement through the last 3 months.
Sales for our Bakeries and Foodservice segment declined 2% in the first quarter. Pound volume was up 2%, but that growth was offset by negative price realization mix. Hot breakfast items, snacks and baking mixes lead our sales performance in the quarter.
As shown on Slide 8, our first quarter international net sales grew 36% on a constant currency basis, with growth across all 4 regions. In Canada, sales increased 28%, including the acquired Liberté yogurt business. Sales for the region combining Europe, Australia and New Zealand increased 51%. This top line performance reflects the addition of Yoplait International and good gains by Nature Valley in the U.K., Häagen-Dazs in France and Old El Paso in Australia. Sales in the Asia-Pacific region increased 20%, led by China. In the Latin America, constant currency sales increased 20%. This was before Yoki, which will begin contributing to General Mills' sales and operating profits in our second quarter. Excluding acquisitions, international constant currency sales increased at an 8% rate in Q1.
In the first quarter, our underlying gross margin declined 40 basis points to 38.2%. This excludes the impact of mark-to-market valuation for certain grain inventories and commodity hedges we'll use in future periods. The addition of Yoplait International accounts for the majority of the underlying gross margin decline. The remainder reflects higher input cost. And while grain costs have gone up this summer, we're still estimating 2% to 3% inflation for General Mills in fiscal 2013, well below last year's 10% inflation rate, and we're now roughly 75% covered on our commodity needs for the fiscal year.
Slide 10 shows our first quarter operating profit growth split up by segment. U.S. Retail profit was 2% below year-ago levels nearing the volume trend. Advertising expense was down 13% in the quarter as our marketing spending was weighted towards promotional activity this period. International profit increased 56%. That includes incremental contributions from Yoplait and a 17% increase in advertising spending. Excluding acquisitions, profit still increased at a double-digit rate. Bakeries & Foodservice profit grew 10% in the quarter, reflecting pound volume growth and higher grain merchandising earnings.
After tax earnings from joint ventures were lower in the quarter, primarily reflecting input cost inflation and unfavorable foreign exchange for CPW. On a constant currency basis, CPW sales increased 1% with double-digit sales growth in emerging markets, largely offset by category weakness in Western Europe. Constant currency sales for Häagen-Dazs Japan grew 4%, led by new products and distribution gains.
Completing our review of the income statement, corporate unallocated expenses, excluding mark-to-market effects, were up $11 million in the quarter, primarily due to higher pension expense. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 22.7% as reported, well below last year, due to a one-time non-cash tax benefit from the restructuring of a subsidiary, which resulted in a reduction of deferred tax liabilities. Excluding items affecting comparability, our tax rate was 31.4% this year compared to 32.4% a year ago. We still see our full year underlying tax rate running at about 33%, and average diluted shares outstanding were essentially flat in the quarter. For the full year, we continue to target a net reduction in average diluted shares outstanding.
Turning to the balance sheet. Let me first answer a likely question. The large increase in cash on our balance sheet is the funding for Yoki. We funded $851 million of the $940 million purchase price with cash. And since we report our Brazil business on a 1-month lag, this cash was still reflected on our balance sheet at the end of the quarter. With the Yoki acquisition closed and the maturity of a long term debt note earlier this month, our cash balance today has returned to a more normalized level. Now in a quarter where net sales increased 5%, our core working capital declined 4%. Our working capital efficiency continues to translate into improved operating cash flow. Over the last 5 years, our operating cash flow has increased at a 7% compound rate, and growth and operating cash flow accelerated to 11% this quarter.
So with the first quarter completed, we're on track to achieve our 2013 targets. We expect to deliver mid-single-digit growth in net sales and segment operating profit on the base business, with Yoki Brazil and Yoplait Canada contributing 9 months of incremental sales and profit this year. We expect to generate adjusted diluted earnings per share of approximately $2.65. As a reminder, our EPS guidance excludes mark-to-market effects, restructure expense, acquisition integration cost and this quarter's one-time tax benefit.

It seems that there's been a lot of investor interest in the Snacks business lately. So I'd like to give you an update on our U.S. Snacks portfolio and the growth that we're seeing on our brands.
U.S. consumers are snacking more than ever. And consumers have changed what to grab for a quick refuel. Instead of mindless munching, consumers are increasingly looking for options to provide real nutritional benefits. So it's no wonder that Better-for-you snacks is the fast-growing segment in the Snacks category. We define this segment using a variety of Nielsen-measured categories. And retail sales increased 6% fiscal 2012 to reach nearly $30 billion. We see plenty of room for continued growth in this segment.
Reported net sales for our Snacks division have grown at an 8% compound rate over the past 3 years and we're up 15% in fiscal 2012, so we're gaining share on this Better-for-you segment. Our Snacks portfolio is split into 3 distinct categories: Grain, Fruit and Savory snacks, as shown on Slide 18. In fiscal 2012, these 3 segments generated $1.6 billion of recorded net sales. We have a strong presence in traditional grocery stores, where our pound volume grew 3% last year, with the majority of our Snacks volume that's sold in the faster-growing nontraditional food outlets, such as mass merchandisers, club and dollar stores. For example, club stores represent our largest nontraditional channel. Our pound volume grew 8% there last year as our larger mega-packs represent value to clubs to our consumers. We continue to bring product news [ph] and strong innovation to this channel.
Small-store formats like dollar stores are a growth channel too. Here we offer smaller packages and attractive dollar price point that introduces new consumers to our brands. Our regular sized package also sell well in these outlets, making this our fastest-growing channel, with pound volume up 9% last year.
General Mills is the market leader in the $900 million Fruit snacks category. Category sales are growing at a 3% pace in the latest 12 months, driven by increasing popularity of fruit snacks with all family appeal. Last year, we saw heightened competition from value players in this segment, resulting in a share decline for us. We expect to post renewed sales and share growth this year with the solid line of new products, including Mott's fruit snacks that appeal to kids and adults alike. Our Mott's Medleys are made with real fruit and vegetable juice and provide 100% of the daily value vitamin C, which is 80 calories per serving. We just launched this line and it's off to a great start.
The Savory snacks category generates more than $2 billion in annual retail sales and has grown at a 9% rate over the past year. We've just launched [ph] double new flavors of our very popular Chex Mix and we introduced a new product line, Pillsbury Baguette Chips. These are made from baked bread. They're great by themselves or with your favorite dip.
And of course, Grain snack bars is our largest and fastest growing business. We created this category back in 1975 with the launch of Nature Valley Granola Bars. Today, the category generates $3 billion in retail sales and it's growing at a 5% annual rate. Our sales are well outpacing the category, driving solid market share gains for us. As you could see on Slide 21, our dollar share of the category has increased 10 points over the past 5 years. And through the first quarter of fiscal 2013, we've gained another full point of share. We're growing our sales and the category by innovating. We've kept the original Nature Valley Crunchy bars growing and we've added new flavors and formats. Then at 2006, we launched a very successful Fiber One snack bar line and that unlocked a whole new level of market growth.
In fiscal 2012, we've further expanded the Fiber One line with the introduction of 90-calorie brownies. In one year, just 2 brownie flavors generated more than $100 million of retail sales. To put that into context, one industry benchmarks at the standard of $50 million for a successful new product introduction. We're currently launching a 90-calorie chocolate chip cookie that's off to a terrific start. We're also just launching new Fiber One Chewy bars, available in kid-friendly flavors like chocolate and peanut butter and jelly. At just 100 calories per bar, they have the nutrition that moms love, including 20% of the daily value of fiber and 10% of the daily value of calcium.
When it comes to Grain snacks, Nature Valley continues to be our flagship brand. Our newest variety is the Nature Valley Protein bars, which contain 10 grams of protein in each bar. They contributed double-digit retail sales growth for the brand in fiscal 2012, and they're on track to be as big as Fiber One Brownies in year one retail sales. We have new flavors and formats in Nature Valley bars coming throughout the year, and we expect the brand to continue to lead our Snacks portfolio.
Now I've been talking specifically about our U.S. Snacks division, but of course General Mills' Snacks business is much broader than this. In small plant and fields [ph] in the market Cascadian Farm organic granola bars, along with Larabars and über bars, which are great tasting natural nutrition bar options. The retail has been [ph] growing at a double-digit rate, and Food Should Taste Good chips have been a great addition to our natural foods offerings. Our snacks are growing nicely in foodservice outlets too. Net sales were up 11% in the first quarter, driven by new product introductions and distribution gains in convenience stores. And we're just beginning to tap into the possibilities for our snacks internationally. Our U.S. portfolio has an innovation pipeline for our international markets. For example, Nature Valley brand is available in nearly 80 markets around the world, and we're seeing many opportunities to expand our other snacks brands into more international markets as the global middle class continues to expand, and we gain scale in more emerging markets worldwide.
So to summarize my comments this morning, the future is bright for General Mills' U.S. Snacks division, as consumers are snacking more and increasingly seek out Better-for-you options. We're building on our history of innovation, solid new product introductions across our 3 product platforms. We're also leveraging our strong brands at fast-growing natural food outlets, which should drive sales and profit growth in the U.S. and around the world in fiscal 2013 and beyond.

You've just heard about the terrific innovation that John and his team have going in our U.S. Snacks business. So I want to going to give you a quick summary of the business trends and the innovation that we're seeing elsewhere at General Mills.
Across our U.S. Retail categories, we are seeing pricing moderate and volume improve as we begin to lap last year's significant price increases. As Don mentioned earlier, we still expect inflation in 2013, but at a rate well below the 10% we experienced in 2012. So we do anticipate a more stable food price environment for consumers as we go forward.
We're seeing improving trends for our business as well. In the first quarter, General Mills U.S. Retail pound volume declined 2% and demonstrated sequential improvement over last year. Underlying gross margin for General Mills showed sequential improvement as well, and we expect both our volume and gross margin trends to continue to improve in the remaining 9 months of the year. Our confidence reflects the fact that our categories are on trend with consumer demand for our great-tasting, healthy and convenient foods, all at a good value. Because they're on trend, our categories are growing. Each of our 10 largest categories generates at least $2 billion in annual retail sales. And with combined sales of over $40 billion, even low single-digit growth on this sales base is significant.
We're innovating to drive growth for our brands in our categories. Let me give you a few examples. The gluten-free benefit of our Chex cereals continues to resonate with consumers. Sales of new Apple Cinammon Chex are off to a strong start, and we're reaching consumers with both traditional and digital advertising. In combination, these activities drove a 23% retail sales gain for Chex in the first quarter.
Multigrain Cheerios continues to post strong gains, including the new peanut butter variety. First quarter retail sales increased 19%. And the Cascadian Farm is the #1 granola brand in America, organic or otherwise. We've just added an ancient grains variety and increased marketing support, helping to drive an 11% increase in retail sales this quarter.
For our cereal business in total, we experienced a rare decline in sales this quarter as merchandising levels were below the year-ago period. But we expect our growth momentum to resume in the second quarter, and we continue to expect sales and earnings growth for Big G in 2013 in total.
The first quarter sales decline for our U.S. yogurt business overall masks some good progress made in this period. Our Greek yogurt business turned in a good performance, led by our multipack items. Our Greek retail sales increased 85%, and we picked up nearly a full point at the market share in the Greek segment this quarter. As you know, our 2013 plans for Greek yogurt are just getting started. New Yoplait Greek 100-calorie yogurt is just starting to hit store shelves across the country. And while it's early days, we're very pleased with the initial reaction to this product. We're just now activating our fully integrated marketing campaign and dedicated advertising behind this new line.
We've sharpened our merchandise price points on our core cup products. Customer feedback has been very positive, and broad-based execution is planned throughout the coming months. While it's still early, volume trends on this key business are improving.
Across our U.S. yogurt business in total, we launched 35 new items in the first quarter. These new items have been well accepted by our customers and shipments are building. In addition to Yoplait Greek 100, this includes expanded distribution of our Mountain High brand and the beginning of a phased U.S. rollout of Liberté. So as we move into the second quarter, we're excited about our innovation and marketing plans in U.S. yogurt.
Other first quarter highlights included good growth from Progresso. We've launched new flavors of Progresso Light and continue to focus our advertising on the great taste of our ready-to-serve soups, and our new Recipe Starters sauces have enjoyed good customer orders to date. In total, first quarter retail sales for Progresso increased 14%, and we added 3 points of market share in the ready-to-serve segment.
On our Totino's hot snacks business, a significant increase in media investment and distribution gains drove growth across our product line. A combination of strong in-store merchandising support, digital media and contributions from new products drove market share gains in our Pillsbury refrigerated dough items. And Green Giant Seasoned Steamers are the latest addition to our frozen vegetable portfolio. We'll begin to activate support for this seasonal business in the second quarter of the year.
In total, we launched over 70 U.S. Retail new products in the first quarter alone. Account acceptance of these new items is, in total, above our expectations, and we've got more innovation to come later in the year. As we told you in July, our plans call for points of distribution to decline through the first quarter of 2013, largely reflecting the timing of our new product launches. We expect the improved distribution trends over the remaining 9 months of the year and look to achieve distribution growth for the year in total.
As our new items reach good store-level distribution, we'll be activating our media and marketing campaigns against these businesses. We're ramping up activity behind our seasonal items such as soup, baking products and frozen vegetables, and we continue to improve the efficiency and impact of our advertising dollars with targeted investments in digital and multicultural media.
We also have a variety of second quarter merchandising events planned to drive customer and consumer excitement. We're expanding our Save Lids to Save Lives program, which benefits breast cancer research. Starting this month, more than 20 General Mills brands will carry pink lids on over 400 million packages. This program extends to our Bakeries & Foodservice businesses too. We're partnering with sororities across the country to increase breast cancer awareness on-campus. In total, General Mills will donate $0.10 per every lid redeemed up to a maximum total donation of $2.5 million. We also continued to expand our successful Box Tops for Education program. Since the inception of this program, we've raised over $475 million for schools across the country.
These are just a few of the merchandising programs we have planned in the months ahead, and with continued strong levels of marketing support and product innovation, we're excited about our prospects for growth in U.S. Retail over the balance of 2013.
Let me turn to our International segment. In the first quarter, we delivered good performance in Europe. Yogurt is our largest business there. Fueled by sales of new varieties of Calin, a functional yogurt high in calcium, and higher levels of advertising across our yogurt portfolio, retail sales increased at a mid-single-digit rate in the quarter, and we added roughly 0.5 point of market share. Our Europe yogurt results now include Ireland, where we reacquired the Yoplait license in May.
Häagen-Dazs had a good quarter in Europe too. Retail sales increased at a double-digit rate. Our Secret Sensations product was a huge hit in 2012, so we've introduced it into new markets with a new flavor and a new package size in 2013. We've also launched new varieties of pints in mini cups and integrated our marketing efforts across Häagen-Dazs shops and retail outlets.
For our Europe business in total, we're pleased with our performance. Our growth in this region continues to outpace results for many of our multinational food peers. We now have a great branded position in the important European yogurt market and our other key categories of superpremium ice cream, Mexican meals and grain snacks are all in relatively early stages of development in Europe. So we have great opportunities ahead to increase household penetration of our brands to drive future top line growth.
In Canada, yogurt is a $1.4 billion category. In over the last 5 years, sales have been growing at a 7% rate. In our Canadian yogurt business, we're increasing household penetration on our Liberté brand, with distribution gains, new products and television advertising for the first time in Liberté's history. And earlier this month, General Mills assumed the Canada Yoplait business from the previous licensee. We're planning significant levels of investment behind the Yoplait brand in Canada, including new product innovation, improvements on established products and increased advertising. Together, our Liberté and Yoplait brands hold a 35% share of category sales in Canada. With Yoplait added to our business, we're projecting well over $1 billion of retail sales in Canada this fiscal year, making us the fourth largest food manufacturer in the country.
As you know, we're also working to expand our business in emerging markets. We have a large business today in Greater China, and we continue to see robust growth there. First quarter sales in constant currency grew at a strong double-digit rate. This performance is being led by Häagen-Dazs and our line of Wanchai Ferry frozen dim sum items. And while the overall Chinese economy may be slowing a bit, the demand for branded consumer food products continues to expand. Increasing numbers of Chinese consumers want foods that offer quality, convenience, nutrition and taste, all at a good value. And for our business in China, we're seeing robust growth in both existing and new cities. So we expect demand for our products to remain strong in this important market.
Our growth in India is being driven by our new whole wheat and premium varieties of Pillsbury Atta flour, Häagen-Dazs Secret Sensations and contributions from our recent acquisition of Parampara foods branded meal starters.
In Brazil, the acquisition of Yoki makes us very excited about our growth prospects. Yoki products are quite popular with Brazilian consumers and hold leading market share positions in growing categories. And our integration efforts are off to a great start. Given Yoki's terrific breadth and scale, we're integrating General Mills' Brazilian employees, products and systems into the Yoki business. We're just one month in and we're already invoicing our customers as a combined company. And the combination of Yoki and General Mills makes us the 15th largest food company in Brazil, significantly expanding our scale in this important market. We look forward to reporting back to you on the growth of this business starting in the second quarter.
So with that, let me summarize today's General Mills update. Our first quarter performance was broadly in line with our expectations. Volume and gross margin trends are improving, and we launched over 100 new products. In the second quarter, we'll support both our established and new items with strong levels of media and merchandising. In both Yoplait Canada and Yoki, we'll begin to contribute to our net sales and operating profit. For the full year, we're on track to deliver our sales and profit targets. And more broadly, we see our business portfolio better positioned than ever to deliver balanced global growth for shareholders in the years ahead.
So thank you for your time this morning and for your interest in General Mills. With this, I'm going to open the call for questions. Operator, would you please get us started?"

But soup season is in front of us, but our customers certainly like that product, so we feel good about that one. The cereals, I think, went in very well. It got high levels of distribution, and we think that those will do well. And as we've said to you before, we'll have a number of other additional new cereals coming in January. So we feel pretty good about our new cereal lineup for the year. All the yogurt items went in, and it's early days for those. They're gaining distribution well. Early returns on Yoplait Greek 100 is that is developing very nicely. We're quite pleased with how that one is going. And that's really before the marketing impact really starts to hit on that new item, so we like what we're seeing on that one as well.

But as you can imagine, you're closing the books across 25 different markets, and if they all break a little favorable, it adds up, and that's really what happened in international. So the broad strengths of that business played through. And then the other piece is on the tax rate. Some of that was favorably impacted by international or from an earnings mix standpoint. But as you also understand, tax rate can be a little bit volatile just in terms of how you close out open audits and we have audits across states in different countries. We closed those out during the course of the year. We had some favorable audit closures in the first quarter that benefited the rate as well and again, you'll have visibility too until those are settled. So those are really the 2 big factors as you look at the first quarter. And those 2 together contributed $0.03 or $0.04 to the bottom line."

The reason that we see it accelerating during the year is a couple of things. As Ken -- as we said before and as Ken pointed to some data this morning, in the U.S., we see prices lap our increases and the industries increases from last year, we expect volume to stabilize and to solidify, and we're starting to see that in the categories, and so that will benefit us as the year unfolds. The second is, as you point to -- we do expect some deceleration of inflation, although I would caution [ph] it with the current drought and movement, there is some more pressure that we had originally anticipated coming into the year, and that will play through in the latter part of the year. We still are in that 2% to 3% range of inflation, but obviously, a bit more pressure given where the markets have moved over the last couple of months. And then we expect to see continued strength in International as we alluded to the -- now it did grow quite nicely in the first quarter on as-reported basis, you can strip out acquisitions. Top line grew 8% on a constant currency basis, and so that provides continued momentum as the year unfolds. And our Bakeries & Foodservice business started the year well with 2% volume growth, 10% profit growth, and that business has, again, has some really solid momentum in some key customer and product line segments that will benefit from as the year unfolds as well."

I mean, clearly, last year, with a very high inflation in the industry, over 10% for us and all the pricing, there's no doubt that, that was the biggest single factor and consumers responded as we predicted they would with lower unit volume sales. So I think we had a chart in our presentation this morning that demonstrated very clearly that as we begin to sequentially lap that period of time, we're seeing the price comparisons moderate and the unit volumes improve for our category. And we are seeing that as well in our business. Now it's not -- this is not a perfect science, and I think it will, but our belief, our strong belief is that we're going to continue to see that sort of stabilization in consumer prices and recovery of demand as we progress throughout the year."

And maybe I'm overstating the impact because I know your Grain is only 5% to 10% of your cost. I'm just trying to figure out if the drought will flow through into fiscal '14."

Thank you for joining us this morning. Slide 4 summarizes our results for the quarter. Sales totaled $4.1 billion, up 5%, and segment operating profit increased 6% to $769 million. These results were led by our Interna",1039,"Thanks, Kris, and hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us this morning. 
Slide 4 summarizes our results for the quarter. Sales totaled $4.1 billion, up 5%, and segment operating profit increased 6% to $769 million. These results were led by our International segment, including contributions from acquired businesses. Net earnings totaled $549 million, and diluted earnings per share were $0.82 as reported. These results include a net increase in the mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions in grain inventories, along with the one-time tax benefit and restructuring charges. Excluding these items affecting comparability, our adjusted diluted EPS would be $0.66. This was a bit better than we planned, thanks to strong international performance that benefited operating profit and contributed to a lower underlying tax rate.
Slide 5 shows the components of our net sales growth. On an as-reported basis, net sales increased 5%, with growth driven by acquisitions. Pound volume contributed 9 points of growth in the quarter, sales mix and net price realization subtracted 2 points of sales growth, and foreign exchange also reduced net sales by 2 points. Excluding acquisitions, net sales were 1% below year-ago levels as reported and up 1% in constant currency.
Slide 6 details net sales performance for our newly organized U.S. retail divisions. In total, net sales declined 1%, including the impact of merchandising spending to support new item launches and sharper price points on certain established products. Pound volume was 2% lower in the quarter. This was a sequential improvement from the previous quarter, and it included steady improvement through the last 3 months.
Sales for our Bakeries and Foodservice segment declined 2% in the first quarter. Pound volume was up 2%, but that growth was offset by negative price realization mix. Hot breakfast items, snacks and baking mixes led our sales performance in the quarter.
As shown on Slide 8, our first quarter international net sales grew 36% on a constant currency basis, with growth across all 4 regions. In Canada, sales increased 28%, including the acquired Liberté yogurt business. Sales for the region combining Europe, Australia and New Zealand increased 51%. This top line performance reflects the addition of Yoplait International and good gains by Nature Valley in the U.K., Häagen-Dazs in France and Old El Paso in Australia. Sales in the Asia-Pacific region increased 20%, led by China. In the Latin America, constant currency sales increased 20%. This was before Yoki, which will begin contributing to General Mills' sales and operating profits in our second quarter. Excluding acquisitions, international constant currency sales increased at an 8% rate in Q1.
In the first quarter, our underlying gross margin declined 40 basis points to 38.2%. This excludes the impact of mark-to-market valuation for certain grain inventories and commodity hedges we'll use in future periods. The addition of Yoplait International accounts for the majority of the underlying gross margin decline. The remainder reflects higher input cost. And while grain costs have gone up this summer, we're still estimating 2% to 3% inflation for General Mills in fiscal 2013, well below last year's 10% inflation rate, and we're now roughly 75% covered on our commodity needs for the fiscal year.
Slide 10 shows our first quarter operating profit growth split up by segment. U.S. Retail profit was 2% below year-ago levels, nearing the volume trend. Advertising expense was down 13% in the quarter as our marketing spending was weighted towards promotional activity this period. International profit increased 56%. That includes incremental contributions from Yoplait and a 17% increase in advertising spending. Excluding acquisitions, profit still increased at a double-digit rate. Bakeries & Foodservice profit grew 10% in the quarter, reflecting pound volume growth and higher grain merchandising earnings.
After tax earnings from joint ventures were lower in the quarter, primarily reflecting input cost inflation and unfavorable foreign exchange for CPW. On a constant currency basis, CPW sales increased 1% with double-digit sales growth in emerging markets, largely offset by category weakness in Western Europe. Constant currency sales for Häagen-Dazs Japan grew 4%, led by new products and distribution gains.
Completing our review of the income statement, corporate unallocated expenses, excluding mark-to-market effects, were up $11 million in the quarter, primarily due to higher pension expense. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 22.7% as reported, well below last year, due to a one-time non-cash tax benefit from the restructuring of a subsidiary, which resulted in a reduction of deferred tax liabilities. Excluding items affecting comparability, our tax rate was 31.4% this year compared to 32.4% a year ago. We still see our full year underlying tax rate running at about 33%, and average diluted shares outstanding were essentially flat in the quarter. For the full year, we continue to target a net reduction in average diluted shares outstanding.
Turning to the balance sheet. Let me first answer a likely question. The large increase in cash on our balance sheet is the funding for Yoki. We funded $851 million of the $940 million purchase price with cash. And since we report our Brazil business on a 1-month lag, this cash was still reflected on our balance sheet at the end of the quarter. With the Yoki acquisition closed and the maturity of a long term debt note earlier this month, our cash balance today has returned to a more normalized level. Now in a quarter where net sales increased 5%, our core working capital declined 4%. Our working capital efficiency continues to translate into improved operating cash flow. Over the last 5 years, our operating cash flow has increased at a 7% compound rate, and growth in operating cash flow accelerated to 11% this quarter.
So with the first quarter completed, we're on track to achieve our 2013 targets. We expect to deliver mid-single-digit growth in net sales and segment operating profit on the base business, with Yoki Brazil and Yoplait Canada contributing 9 months of incremental sales and profit this year. We expect to generate adjusted diluted earnings per share of approximately $2.65. As a reminder, our EPS guidance excludes mark-to-market effects, restructuring expense, acquisition integration cost and this quarter's one-time tax benefit.
With that, I'll turn the microphone over to Jon for an update on our U.S. Snacks business. Jon?"

It's a pleasure to be on the call this morning. It seems that there's been a lot of investor interest in snack businesses lately. So I'd like to give you an update on our U.S. Snacks portfolio and the growth that we're seein",1120,"Thanks, Don. Hello, everybody. It's a pleasure to be on the call this morning. It seems that there's been a lot of investor interest in snack businesses lately. So I'd like to give you an update on our U.S. Snacks portfolio and the growth that we're seeing on our brands.
U.S. consumers are snacking more than ever, and consumers have changed what to grab for a quick refuel. Instead of mindless munching, consumers are increasingly looking for options to provide real nutritional benefits. So it's no wonder that Better-for-you snacks is the fast-growing segment in the Snacks category. We define this segment using a variety of Nielsen-measured categories. And retail sales increased 6% fiscal 2012 to reach nearly $30 billion. We see plenty of room for continued growth in this segment.
Reported net sales for our Snacks division have grown at an 8% compound rate over the past 3 years and we're up 15% in fiscal 2012, so we're gaining share in this Better-for-you segment. Our Snacks portfolio is split into 3 distinct categories: Grain, Fruit and Savory snacks, as shown on Slide 18. In fiscal 2012, these 3 segments generated $1.6 billion of reported net sales. We have a strong presence in traditional grocery stores, where our pound volume grew 3% last year, with the majority of our Snacks volume that's sold in the faster-growing nontraditional food outlets, such as mass merchandisers, club and dollar stores. For example, club stores represent our largest nontraditional channel. Our pound volume grew 8% there last year as our larger mega-packs represent value to clubs through our consumers. We continue to bring product news [ph] and strong innovation to this channel.
Small-store formats like dollar stores are a growth channel too. Here we offer smaller packages and attractive dollar price point that introduces new consumers to our brands. Our regular sized packages also sell well in these outlets, making this our fastest-growing channel, with pound volume up 9% last year.
General Mills is the market leader in the $900 million Fruit snacks category. Category sales are growing at a 3% pace in the latest 12 months, driven by increasing popularity of fruit snacks with all family appeal. Last year, we saw heightened competition from value players in this segment, resulting in a share decline for us. We expect to post renewed sales and share growth this year with a solid line of new products, including Mott's fruit snacks that appeal to kids and adults alike. Our Mott's Medleys are made with real fruit and vegetable juice and provide 100% of the daily value of vitamin C, with just 80 calories per serving. We just launched this line and it's off to a great start.
The Savory snacks category generates more than $2 billion in annual retail sales and has grown at a 9% rate over the past year. We've just launched several new flavors of our very popular Chex Mix and we introduced a new product line, Pillsbury Baguette Chips. These are made from baked bread. They're great by themselves or with your favorite dip.
And of course, Grain snack bars is our largest and fastest growing business. We created this category back in 1975 with the launch of Nature Valley Granola Bars. Today, the category generates $3 billion in retail sales and it's growing at a 5% annual rate. Our sales are well outpacing the category, driving solid market share gains for us. As you can see on Slide 21, our dollar share of the category has increased 10 points over the past 5 years. And through the first quarter of fiscal 2013, we've gained another full point of share. We're growing our sales and the category by innovating. We've kept the original Nature Valley Crunchy bars growing and we've added new flavors and formats. Then at 2006, we launched a very successful Fiber One snack bar line and that unlocked a whole new level of market growth.
In fiscal 2012, we've further expanded the Fiber One line with the introduction of 90-calorie brownies. In one year, just 2 brownie flavors generated more than $100 million in retail sales. To put that into context, one industry benchmark set the standard of $50 million for a successful new product introduction. We're currently launching a 90-calorie chocolate chip cookie that's off to a terrific start. We're also just launching new Fiber One Chewy Bars, available in kid-friendly flavors like chocolate and peanut butter and jelly. At just 100 calories per bar, they have the nutrition that moms love, including 20% of the daily value of fiber and 10% of the daily value of calcium.
When it comes to Grain snacks, Nature Valley continues to be our flagship brand. Our newest variety is Nature Valley Protein Bars, which contain 10 grams of protein in each bar. They contributed double-digit retail sales growth for the brand in fiscal 2012, and they're on track to be as big as Fiber One Brownies in year one retail sales. We have new flavors and formats in Nature Valley bars coming throughout the year, and we expect the brand to continue to lead our Snacks portfolio.
Now I've been talking specifically about our U.S. Snacks division, but of course General Mills' Snacks business is much broader than this. In small plant and fields [ph], we market Cascadian Farm organic granola bars, along with Larabars and Über bars, which are great-tasting natural nutrition bar options. The retail sales have been growing at a double-digit rate, and Food Should Taste Good chips have been a great addition to our natural foods offerings. Our snacks are growing nicely in food service outlets too. Net sales were up 11% in the first quarter, driven by new product introductions and distribution gains in convenience stores. And we're just beginning to tap into the possibilities for our snacks internationally. Our U.S. portfolio is an innovation pipeline for our international markets. For example, Nature Valley brand is available in nearly 80 markets around the world, and we see many opportunities to expand our other snacks brands into more international markets as the global middle class continues to expand and we gain scale in more emerging markets worldwide.
So to summarize my comments this morning, the future is bright for General Mills' U.S. Snacks division, as consumers are snacking more and increasingly seek out Better-for-you options. We're building on our history of innovation, solid new product introductions across our 3 product platforms. We're also leveraging our strong brands at fast-growing non-traditional food outlets, which should drive sales and profit growth in the U.S. and around the world in fiscal 2013 and beyond.
Thank you for your time this morning. I'll now turn the call over to Ken Powell."

You just heard about the terrific innovation that John and his team have going in our U.S. Snacks business. So I want to going to give you a quick summary of the business trends and the innovation that we're seeing elsewhere at General Mills.
Across our U.S. Retail categories, we are seeing pricing moderate and volume improve as we begin to lap last year's significant price increases. As Don mentioned earlier, we still expect inflation in 2013, but at a rate well below the 10% we experienced in 2012. So we do anticipate a more stable food price environment for consumers as we go forward.
We're seeing improving trends for our business as well. In the first quarter, General Mills U.S. Retail pound volume declined 2% and demonstrated sequential improvement over last year. Underlying gross margin for General Mills showed sequential improvement as well, and we expect both our volume and gross margin trends to continue to improve in the remaining 9 months of the year. Our confidence reflects the fact that our categories are on trend with consumer demand for great-tasting, healthy and convenient foods, all at a good value. Because they're on trend, our categories are growing. Each of our 10 largest categories generates at least $2 billion in annual retail sales. And with combined sales of over $40 billion, even low single-digit growth on this sales base is significant.
We're innovating to drive growth for our brands and our categories. Let me give you a few examples. The gluten-free benefit of our Chex cereals continues to resonate with consumers. Sales of new Apple Cinammon Chex are off to a strong start, and we're reaching consumers with both traditional and digital advertising. In combination, these activities drove a 23% retail sales gain for Chex in the first quarter.
Multigrain Cheerios continues to post strong gains, including the new Peanut Butter variety. First quarter retail sales increased 19%. And Cascadian Farm is the #1 granola brand in America, organic or otherwise. We've just added an Ancient Grains variety and increased marketing support, helping to drive an 11% increase in retail sales this quarter.
For our cereal business in total, we experienced a rare decline in sales this quarter as merchandising levels were below the year-ago period. But we expect our growth momentum to resume in the second quarter, and we continue to expect sales and earnings growth for Big G in 2013 in total.
The first quarter sales decline for our U.S. yogurt business overall masks some good progress made in this period. Our Greek yogurt business turned in a good performance, led by our multipack items. Our Greek retail sales increased 85%, and we picked up nearly a full point in the market share in the Greek segment this quarter. As you know, our 2013 plans for Greek yogurt are just getting started. New Yoplait Greek 100-calorie yogurt is just starting to hit store shelves across the country. And while it's early days, we're very pleased with the initial reaction to this product. We're just now activating our fully integrated marketing campaign and dedicated advertising behind this new line.
We've sharpened our merchandise price points on our core cup products. Customer feedback has been very positive, and broad-based execution is planned throughout the coming months. While it's still early, volume trends on this key business are improving.
Across our U.S. yogurt business in total, we launched 35 new items in the first quarter. These new items have been well accepted by our customers and shipments are building. In addition to Yoplait Greek 100, this includes expanded distribution of our Mountain High brand and the beginning of a phased U.S. rollout of Liberté. So as we move into the second quarter, we're excited about our innovation and marketing plans in U.S. yogurt.
Other first quarter highlights included good growth from Progresso. We've launched new flavors of Progresso Light and continue to focus our advertising on the great taste of our ready-to-serve soups, and our new Recipe Starters sauces have enjoyed good customer orders to date. In total, first quarter retail sales for Progresso increased 14%, and we added 3 points of market share in the ready-to-serve segment.
On our Totino's hot snacks business, a significant increase in media investment and distribution gains drove growth across our product line. A combination of strong in-store merchandising support, digital media and contributions from new products drove market share gains on our Pillsbury refrigerated dough items. And Green Giant Seasoned Steamers are the latest addition to our frozen vegetable portfolio. We'll begin to activate the support for this seasonal business in the second quarter of the year.
In total, we launched over 70 U.S. Retail new products in the first quarter alone. Account acceptance of these new items is, in total, above our expectations, and we've got more innovation to come later in the year. As we told you in July, our plans call for points of distribution to decline through the first quarter of 2013, largely reflecting the timing of our new product launches. We expect improved distribution trends over the remaining 9 months of the year and look to achieve distribution growth for the year in total.
As our new items reach good store-level distribution, we'll be activating our media and marketing campaigns against these businesses. We're ramping up activity behind our seasonal items such as soup, baking products and frozen vegetables, and we continue to improve the efficiency and impact of our advertising dollars with targeted investments in digital and multicultural media.
We also have a variety of second quarter merchandising events planned to drive customer and consumer excitement. We're expanding our Save Lids to Save Lives program, which benefits breast cancer research. Starting this month, more than 20 General Mills brands will carry pink lids on over 400 million packages. This program extends to our Bakeries & Foodservice businesses too. We're partnering with sororities across the country to increase breast cancer awareness on-campus. In total, General Mills will donate $0.10 for every lid redeemed up to a maximum total donation of $2.5 million. We also continued to expand our successful Box Tops for Education program. Since the inception of this program, we've raised over $475 million for schools across the country.
These are just a few of the merchandising programs we have planned in the months ahead, and with continued strong levels of marketing support and product innovation, we're excited about our prospects for growth in U.S. Retail over the balance of 2013.
Let me turn to our International segment. In the first quarter, we delivered good performance in Europe. Yogurt is our largest business there. Fueled by sales of new varieties of Calin, a functional yogurt high in calcium, and higher levels of advertising across our yogurt portfolio, retail sales increased at a mid-single-digit rate in the quarter, and we added roughly 0.5 point of market share. Our Europe yogurt results now include Ireland, where we reacquired the Yoplait license in May.
Häagen-Dazs had a good quarter in Europe too. Retail sales increased at a double-digit rate. Our Secret Sensations product was a huge hit in 2012, so we've introduced it into new markets with a new flavor and a new package size in 2013. We've also launched new varieties of pints in mini cups and integrated our marketing efforts across Häagen-Dazs shops and retail outlets.
For our Europe business in total, we're pleased with our performance. Our growth in this region continues to outpace results for many of our multinational food peers. We now have a great branded position in the important European yogurt market and our other key categories of superpremium ice cream, Mexican meals and grain snacks are all in relatively early stages of development in Europe. So we have great opportunities ahead to increase household penetration of our brands to drive future top line growth.
In Canada, yogurt is a $1.4 billion category. And over the last 5 years, sales have been growing at a 7% rate. In our Canadian yogurt business, we're increasing household penetration on our Liberté brand, with distribution gains, new products and television advertising for the first time in Liberté's history. And earlier this month, General Mills assumed the Canada Yoplait business from the previous licensee. We're planning significant levels of investment behind the Yoplait brand in Canada, including new product innovation, improvements on established products and increased advertising. Together, our Liberté and Yoplait brands hold a 35% share of category sales in Canada. With Yoplait added to our business, we're projecting well over $1 billion of retail sales in Canada this fiscal year, making us the fourth largest food manufacturer in the country.
As you know, we're also working to expand our business in emerging markets. We have a large business today in Greater China, and we continue to see robust growth there. First quarter sales in constant currency grew at a strong double-digit rate. This performance is being led by Häagen-Dazs and our line of Wanchai Ferry frozen dim sum items. And while the overall Chinese economy may be slowing a bit, the demand for branded consumer food products continues to expand. Increasing numbers of Chinese consumers want foods that offer quality, convenience, nutrition and taste, all at a good value. And for our business in China, we're seeing robust growth in both existing and new cities. So we expect demand for our products to remain strong in this important market.
Our growth in India is being driven by our new whole wheat and premium varieties of Pillsbury Atta flour, Häagen-Dazs Secret Sensations and contributions from our recent acquisition of Parampara foods branded meal starters.
In Brazil, the acquisition of Yoki makes us very excited about our growth prospects. Yoki products are quite popular with Brazilian consumers and hold leading market share positions in growing categories. And our integration efforts are off to a great start. Given Yoki's terrific breadth and scale, we're integrating General Mills' Brazilian employees, products and systems into the Yoki business. We're just one month in and we're already invoicing our customers as a combined company. And the combination of Yoki and General Mills makes us the 15th largest food company in Brazil, significantly expanding our scale in this important market. We'll look forward to reporting back to you on the growth of this business starting in the second quarter.
So with that, let me summarize today's General Mills update. Our first quarter performance was broadly in line with our expectations. Volume and gross margin trends are improving, and we launched over 100 new products. In the second quarter, we'll support both our established and new items with strong levels of media and merchandising. In both Yoplait Canada and Yoki, we'll begin to contribute to our net sales and operating profit. For the full year, we're on track to deliver our sales and profit targets. And more broadly, we see our business portfolio better positioned than ever to deliver balanced global growth for shareholders in the years ahead.
So thank you for your time this morning and for your interest in General Mills. With this, I'm going to open the call for questions. Operator, would you please get us started?"

But it looks like, for instance, Progresso Recipe Starters, looks like that's going to be good. It's off to a good start, obviously. But soup season is in front of us, but our customers certainly like that product, so we feel good about that one. The cereals, I think, went in very well. It got high levels of distribution, and we think that those will do well. And as we've said to you before, we'll have a number of other and additional new cereals coming in January. So we feel pretty good about our new cereal lineup for the year. All the yogurt items went in, and it's early days for those, but they're gaining distribution well. Early returns on Yoplait Greek 100 is that, that is developing very nicely. We're quite pleased with how that one is going. And that's really before the marketing impact really starts to hit on that new item, so we like what we're seeing on that one as well. And then Liberté is just starting a regional role and so it's very early days on that, and we'll report -- we'll give you a more -- in Q2 on Liberté. But generally, we feel quite good about how our new products are going in."

International had a strong quarter across a number of markets. China was a significant contributor, for example. But as you can imagine, you're closing the books across 25 different markets, and if they all break a little favorable, it adds up, and that's really what happened in international. So the broad strengths of that business played through. And then the other piece you saw on the tax rate. Some of that was favorably impacted by international or from an earnings mix standpoint. But as you also understand, tax rate can be a little bit volatile just in terms of how you close out open audits, and we have audits across states in different countries. We closed those out during the course of the year. We had some favorable audit closures in the first quarter that benefited the rate as well that again had visibility too, until those are settled. So those are really the 2 big factors as you look at the first quarter. And those 2 together contributed $0.03 or $0.04 to the bottom line."

The reason that we see it accelerating during the year is a couple of things. As Ken -- as we've said before and as Ken pointed to some data this morning, in the U.S., as we see prices lap our increases and the industry's increases from the last year, we expect volume to stabilize and to solidify, and we're starting to see that in the categories, and so that will benefit us as the year unfolds. Second is, as you point to -- we do expect some deceleration of inflation, although I would caution that with the current drought and movement, there is some more pressure than we had originally anticipated coming into the year, and that will play through in the latter part of the year. We still are in that 2% to 3% range of inflation, but obviously, a bit more pressure given where the markets have moved over the last couple of months. And then we expect to see continued strength in International, as we alluded to the -- not only did it grow quite nicely in the first quarter on an as-reported basis, but if you strip out acquisitions, top line grew 8% on a constant currency basis, and so that provides continued momentum as the year unfolds. And our Bakeries & Foodservice business started the year well, 2% volume growth, 10% profit growth, and that business has -- again, has some really solid momentum in some key customer and product line segments that we'll benefit from as the year unfolds as well."

But the biggest one that most food companies talked about was just the pricing, right, and that combined with the difficult consumer backdrop. Based on what you're starting to see, at least in some of your key categories, I mean, it sounds like you're basically getting at that latter point, which is, it seems like it was primarily the pricing and as that moderates, the volume sort of starts to come back.

I mean, clearly, last year, with a very high inflation in the industry, over 10% for us and all the pricing, there's no doubt that, that was the biggest single factor and consumers responded as we predicted they would with lower unit volume sales. So I think we had a chart in our presentation this morning that demonstrated very clearly that as we begin to sequentially lap that period of time, we're seeing the price comparisons moderate and the unit volumes improve for our category. And we are seeing that as well in our business. Now it's not -- this is not a perfect science, and I think it will -- but our belief, our strong belief is that we're going to continue to see that sort of stabilization in consumer prices and recovery of demand as we progress throughout the year."

We saw that -- we saw sequential improvement in core movement over the course of the quarter, and we think that those core brands will continue to improve as we get uptake on that activity, and then we'll add new products to that. And we think that, that combination will lead to continued improvement in our yogurt business. In our cereal business, for instance, our merch -- as I said, our merchandising activity was light compared to year ago, and that led to merch volume declines. And so we'll see a more normal level of merchandising in cereal as we go over the -- into the second and third quarters, and that will, we believe, result in strengthening volume in that business. So it's really, Eric, in the first quarter, there were a number of moving parts on that -- on the merchandising front. As we move into the second quarter, we expect solid levels of merchandising, good levels of new products, and that, in combination, is going to lead to stronger unit volume."

Second question. Now that we have all outlet data, theoretically, that's supposed to be a bit better kind of indication on consumption, and yet the -- for, like, U.S. Retail, the IRI Nielsen data actually showed some pretty significant weakness in your business. I got a bunch of calls from investors worried about your results for the quarter based on that. And yet your volume was only down a little bit, a couple of points, much better than I think the IRI Nielsen data showed. What is the difference? Maybe this gets back to Bryan's question initially."

Now that is on a, if you will, on an operating basis, we will have some depreciation, a step-up -- inventory step-up, some transaction costs this year, some intangible -- a small bit of intangible amortization as well that will be a drag on the results, non-cash drag, but a drag on the reported results. So -- and that, combined with, obviously, the acquisition costs, is what leads to the EPS dilution expectation of $0.02 to $0.03. But from an operating standpoint, you can think about it as a $500 million business that drives low double-digit cash margins for us. As far as kind of within the P&L, as you can imagine, it's the emerging market business, it's delivered margin -- gross margin, excuse me, is lower than our company average, and so you will see some dilution again. We'll give more quantification to that when we release Q2."

Having said that, we love those typically over $1.00 price points on average for Greek. They look really good to us, especially compared to many other yogurt prices, which are kind of $0.50, $0.60, $0.70. So we like the price point.

But look, so let me -- let -- well, but let me -- it's a good question, and I understand the intent behind it. But let me sort of -- let me make a first comment. The sales increases over the last couple of years are largely driven by that kind of inflation-driven pricing. So I just think that it's important to keep that in mind. But stepping back a bit, I think the larger context for us on advertising is that we've increased our levels very, very significantly over the last several years. I think we're up close to 50%. I think some of the tracking services have us now as the largest advertiser in the industry. And we have very, very solid shares of voice in the vast majority of our categories. In many cases, they're increasing. So we're very committed to advertising. It drives our business. But I think, as we've said several times over the last year, I mean, we're -- our goal at these levels is to kind of in line with sales or to be roughly at this level. And you're right. As we enter a period where there's -- the merchandising environment is very dynamic, as we saw in the first quarter this year, we do want to make sure that we're paying very close attention to what we need to do to be in the right value zone in terms of price points and merchandising. I think it's really important for us to do that given the mindset of the consumer these days. So we are going to be making tactical trade-offs there. But I will tell you, having said that, our advertising is and will be at very, very high levels and at very competitive, very strong share of voice. But we want to keep that value component. We want to be focused on that as well and make sure that our products are in the right zone."

I'll second those holidays greetings, but I will keep my remarks to prose today. Thank you for joining us. As you see on Slide 4, our second quarter results are summarized there. Net sales grew 6% to nearly $4.9 bill",1044,"Thanks, Kris. Good morning, everybody. I'll second those holidays greetings, but I will keep my remarks to prose today. Thank you for joining us. As you see on Slide 4, our second quarter results are summarized there. Net sales grew 6% to nearly $4.9 billion. New businesses, particularly Yoki in Brazil and Yoplait Canada contributed 4 points of net sales growth in the quarter.
Segment operating profit grew faster than sales, up 10%, reflecting a higher gross margin and a 3% decrease in advertising and media expense in the period. All 3 of our business segments posted operating profit gains. 
Net earnings totaled $542 million, and diluted earnings per share were $0.82, as reported. Excluding certain items affecting comparability, our adjusted diluted EPS would be $0.86, up 13% from last year's second quarter.
Slide 5 shows the components of our net sales growth. Pound volume contributed 7 percentage points of growth in the quarter. That's primarily the addition of Yoki and Yoplait Canada. Sales mix and net price realizations attracted 1 point of sales growth, and foreign exchange had no impact on sales growth for the company in total.
Slide 6 shows net sales growth by segment. The U.S. retail pound volume and net sales grew 2% in the quarter. This performance was led by our Snacks, Small Planet Foods and Meals divisions.
Net sales of our Bakeries and Foodservice business declined 1% with pound volume down 2% due to a lower bakery flour sales. These sales declined on index price items offset gains on cereal, snacks and frozen breakfast items. 
International segment sales rose 19% as reported and 22% on a constant currency basis with good growth across all 4 geographic regions. While these results do include contributions from Yoki and Yoplait Canada, our established businesses also performed well. Excluding new businesses and foreign exchange, international sales also increased 4% in the quarter.
Our gross margin grew to 120 basis points in the second quarter as reported. This includes the impact of mark-to-market valuation for certain grain inventories and commodity hedges we will use in future periods. 
Slide 7 also shows that excluding these effects, underlying gross margin improved 20 basis points, primarily due to lower levels of input cost inflation, HMM and good plant operating performance.
We expect our input cost inflation rate to tick up in the second half, reflecting the impact of this summer's drought. So we expect to be at the high-end of our 2% to 3% inflation estimate for the full year. We are now roughly 90% covered on our commodity needs for fiscal 2013.
Slide 8 shows second quarter profit growth by operating segment. U.S. retail posted a 9% increase, driven primarily by lower input cost inflation and consumer marketing expenses below year-ago levels. International profit increased 4% in the quarter. This included an expense of $17 million associated with the transition of the Yoplait yogurt license in Canada. Remember that this investment was built into our fiscal 2013 guidance. Excluding this expense, international operating profit would've increased 17% in the quarter. And Bakeries and Foodservice profit grew 24%, reflecting lower wheat cost year-over-year, favorable mix, and increased grain merchandising earnings.
Earnings from joint ventures increased 14% in the second quarter to $33 million after-tax. On a constant currency basis, CPW sales increased 3% with strong performance in the emerging markets, partially offset by category softness in Southwestern Europe. Cost of currency sales for Häagen-Dazs Japan grew 5%, led by new products.
Completing our review of the income statement, corporate unallocated expenses, excluding mark-to-market effects were $79 million at above last year second quarter, primarily due to increased pension expense. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 32.6% as reported. Excluding items affecting comparability, the effective tax rate was 32.8% compared to 33.7% a year ago. This primarily reflects the timing of expense -- of tax expense for the year. We are still estimating our full year underlying tax rate at about 33%.
Turning to the balance sheet. Slide 11 shows the core working capital increased 8% in the quarter. The majority of the increase is the addition of Yoki. Excluding the impact of Yoki, core working capital grew modestly in the quarter at a rate less than sales growth.
Through the first half, cash flow from operations exceeded $1.3 billion, a 14% increase over last year. Capital expenditures totaled $264 million for the first half, generally matching year-ago levels. We expect full year capital spending to be comparable to last year as well.
We're returning more cash to shareholders this year. Through the first half, we paid $434 million in dividends. That's up 9% over last year, reflecting our dividend increase. We also repurchased approximately 12 million shares of common stock for a total of $479 million. That's more than twice the value of share repurchases in last year's first half.
In the second quarter, average diluted shares outstanding decreased by approximately 1 million shares. And for the full year, we continue to target a net reduction in average diluted shares outstanding.
Slide 13 summarizes our financial performance through the first half of the fiscal year. Net sales grew 5%. Segment operating profit grew faster than sales, up 8%. Net earnings attributable to General Mills totaled more than $1 billion. And diluted earnings per share were $1.64. Excluding items affecting comparability, our adjusted earnings per share totaled $1.52, up 8% from a year ago. These first half results are ahead of consensus expectations and a bit ahead of our plans too. That's good start for this early on track to achieve our key financial targets for fiscal 2013.
For the full year, we expect to deliver mid single digit growth in net sales, including growth for our established businesses and contributions from new businesses. We expect operating profit to grow to mid single digit rate too. We now expect input cost inflation of 3% for the year, including some impact from this summer's drought in the second half. We're also anticipating possible currency devaluation in Venezuela. Including these factors, we are raising our EPS guidance to a range of $2.65 to $2.67 per share. That's on an adjusted basis excluding certain items affecting comparability.

I appreciate the chance to give you an update on our U.S. Retail segment. Our top line trends improved in the second quarter. Pound volume stabilized in September and October and increased at a mid single digit rate in November. Net sales for the quarter increased 2%. The acquisition of Food Should Taste Good, combined with solid established business performance, drove double-digit growth in our Small Planet Foods division. Sales for our Snacks division also increased at a double-digit rate led by strong product innovation. Progresso soup and sauces pace growth in our meal division. Sales from our Frozen Foods division matched year ago level while baking and Big G division sales declined modestly. And while U.S. yogurt sales declined, clearly the rate of decline is moderating. I'll provide you with more details on that in a few minutes.
As shown on Slide 17, our second quarter U.S. retail performance reflected good sequential improvement. Volume, net sales and segment operating profit performance all improved versus the first quarter. We've got a number of great initiatives in the market right now, with more planned for the back half of the year. I'll highlight a few examples, starting with some of our seasonal favorites. The holidays are in full swing, and we're hoping consumers bake out some favorite treats. On our refrigerated dough business, our Let The Making Begin campaign is designed to inspire consumers. Response has been terrific, based on sales have increased for both Pillsbury crescent rolls and biscuits since we launched this campaign in October. And we added over 0.5. point of market share in November.
And Betty Crocker is back with her red hot holiday trend, chips are making a perfect 18 layer velvet cake, hidden surprise cookies and many other recipes are available online at bettycrocker.com. This campaign helped drive over a full point of desserts market share growth in November.
Soup season is underway too and Progresso sales are growing. Our new line of recipe start their sauces is off to a good start. However, the primary driver of our year-to-date performance is our core ready-to-serve soup business. We've added points of distribution, and we've increased investment behind our taste-focused advertising. In total, first half Progresso retail sales increased 7%, and we added 1.5 points of market share in the ready-to-serve segment, including 0.5 share point in the second quarter. Progresso has some great marketing and merchandising events planned for the second half of the year. We're partnering with both Weight Watchers and the Biggest Loser TV show to help consumers shed those extra holiday pounds. Our plans include strong advertising and in-store merchandising as well as product placement in an upcoming Biggest Loser episode.
With the holidays here, consumers are making party mix Snacks with our Chex cereal. This year, we're sharing recipes for the microwave, so these snacks are ready in just a minute. We're supporting this annual campaign with a strong combination of digital media and in-store merchandising. And on top of this party mix activity, Chex gluten-free position continues to drive growth. 
In total, first half retail sales for the Chex franchise rose 14%.  
We've got a strong second-half innovation lineup for our cereal business. I'll start with Cheerios, the largest franchise in the U.S. cereal category with a 13% share of total category sales. Honey Nut Cheerios is the single largest brand in the cereal aisle. We are expanding it in January with the launch of a medley crunch variety. This new cereal has the heartfelt benefit and great taste consumers expect from Honey Nut Cheerios. It also has a great texture with oats, clusters and flakes. We think this is a terrific addition to the Cheerios franchise.
Slide 22 highlights our Cascadian Farm organic cereals. First half retail sales for this line increased 13%. Cascadian Farm is the #1 granola brand in America, organic or otherwise. The ancient grains variety we launched in June is off to a good start. And next month, we are adding a berry cobbler variety. 
We're adding new varieties of our other popular cereal brands too. Fiber One 80 calorie cereal offers consumers 35% of the adult daily value of fiber and great chocolate taste at just 80 calories per serving. Out new peanut butter toast crunch builds on the success of our toast crunch franchise.
Now I'm sure you noticed that our first half cereal net sales and market share were below year-ago levels. Other players in the category had more merchandising activity in the first half of the year. We've got more merchandising planned for the second half, including introductory support for our new items. With a great lineup of new products and strong levels of marketing support for our new and established brands, we remain very excited about our U.S. cereal business, and we expect sales growth for Big G in the second half of this year.
Turning to the yogurt aisle, we are encouraged by recent trends on our Greek business. Yoplait Greek 100-calorie yogurt was launched in August. Distribution is ramping up nicely, and all 6 SKUs are turning in the top third of the total yogurt category. Our marketing campaign and dedicated advertising are now in market and on air, and we are pleased with the initial results. In fact, Yoplait share in each of the most recent 2 months was 9% of Greek segment sales. It is still early days for U.S. Greek yogurt, and we expect to earn our fair share of this market segment over time.
At the same time, we're gaining share in Greek. We continue to see signs of stabilization for Yoplait original and Yoplait light yogurt, what we call our core cup business. Remember that we improve these products and our merchandise price points are now better aligned with competitive level. As shown on Slide 26, we're seeing a nice improvement in core up unit volume turns as a result. We've also launched innovative new items, Fruplait has 2 times the fruit of original Yoplait, while Simplait is made up some of just 6 all-natural ingredients. We have more new products coming in the second half to keep this momentum going. We're launching new flavors of Yoplait Greek 100, new Yoplait Pro source, brings a combination of higher protein and great taste to the kids segments, and we are bringing new level of fun to the leading brand in the kids segment with yogurt twisted. Our second half plans also include regional expansion of Liberté Mediterranean and indulging yogurt with higher fat content and the addition of Liberté Greek. We will support both product lines with the combination of digital and billboard advertising along with product sampling efforts. So we expect to see increasing momentum across our U.S. yogurt business in the second half of this year.
In Grain Snacks, we continue to lead category growth with great product innovation, and we plan to build on that record in the second half. Slide 28 highlights several example. We'll be expanding our Fiber One franchise with the launch of Fiber One protein bars. They have at least 6 grams of protein per serving and 20% of the adult daily value for fiber at 140 calories or less per bar. Writing new varieties to our Nature Valley and Cascadian Farm product line, we're also launching Green Giant vegetable chips. These chips contain at least 16 grams of whole grain per serving. And with flavors like multigrain sweet potato and roasted vegetable cheddar, they really taste terrific. We continue to see strong performance by our natural and organic Snacks. First half retail sales for LÄRABAR, all natural food nut bars increased at a double-digit pace. And we gained market share in the health and nutrition bars category.  In January, we are adding a cappuccino flavor to the LÄRABAR lineup.
Our new Food Should Taste Good business is also doing great. We focused on expanding distributions of these great tasting snacks. Fiscal year-to-date shipments are up double digits. By leveraging General Mills sales and supply chain, we expect continuing distribution gains for this business over the balance of the year. 
Across our U.S. retail business, we have strong levels of marketing and in-store merchandising supporting our brands. As we had discussed with you before, our spending this year is weighted toward in-store merchandising. This promotional support is designed to drive awareness and trial for all of our new products, and we've sharpened our merchandise price points for certain product lines based on competitive merchandising levels in those categories. These actions are working for us. 
Our U.S. advertising expense is below strong year-ago levels through the first half, and we now expect our media expense to be down for the year in total. This is due in part to this year's tactical shift on merchandising. It also reflects ongoing cost discipline, which helps us lower media expense while maintaining very competitive media pressure against the consumer. In fact, as we look at cantor measured media spending across our U.S. categories over the latest 12 months available, our track advertising dollars are up and at a rate well above the 1% growth in ad spending across our categories overall. So our share voice with the consumer has been growing.
Across all of U.S. retail, we are launching over 100 new products in 2013, but it's not just quantity that matters. We're excited about the quality of our new product lineup. So we like our prospects for growth in U.S. retail over the balance of 2013.
With that, let me wrap up my overview of General Mills U.S. retail business. We're encouraged by the recent trends we see in the operating environment. Across the U.S. food and beverage industry, volumes have improved as pricing has moderated. We have terrific product innovation in market, and we're supporting our brands with strong levels of in-store merchandising, advertising and other consumer-directed marketing. We are on track to meet our low single digit sales growth target in 2013, and are continuing HMM initiative and cost management discipline of protecting our margins. So we expect our operating profit to grow faster than sales for the year.
Thank you for your time this morning. I will now pass the microphone over to Ken."

You just heard Ian described some of the product innovation and marketing efforts we have underway in U.S. retail.

You just heard Ian described some of the product innovation and marketing efforts we have underway in U.S. retail. And I want to give you now an update on the other 2 segments, starting with Bakeries and Foodservice.
As you can see on Slide 34, net sales for this segment are down 2% through the first half. That's primarily due to negative price realization. We had lower bakery flour prices in the first half. However, first half operating profit is up 18%, driven by lower wheat costs in our cost of goods, favorable mix and grain merchandising earnings. This 18% profit growth builds on a strong track record of earnings growth for this segment. Over the past 5 years, segment operating profit has grown at a 14% compound rate. Grain merchandising activities have played a part, but primarily this growth reflects our strategy of focusing on the most profitable products in the fastest-growing Foodservice channels, and we continue to follow this winning strategy in fiscal 2013.
For example, our sales to U.S. convenience stores are captured in this business segment. We have a great lineup of new snack products hitting sea store shelves, including Nature Valley protein bars, snack crackers and Betty Crocker dessert bites. We are launching Yoplait Greek 100 yogurt in a variety of Foodservice outlets, and we recently introduced our Greek version of Yoplait parfait Pro. As you can see on Slide 36, this product gives Foodservice operators an easy way to prepare layered yogurt parfaits. Sales for Yoplait parfait Pro have been growing nicely, and the addition of a Greek variety will keep the momentum going.
Sales for our frozen breakfast products are increasing at a double-digit pace, led by our line of Pillsbury breakfast items in school cafeterias. And we recently introduced our mini cinnamon role in Burger King restaurants nationwide.
Turning to our international segment. First half net sales are up 22% as reported, including new businesses. Segment operating profit is up 24%, including a 3% increase in media spending. On a constant currency basis, first half international sales are up 28%. We're posting good growth across all of our geographic region. 
Sales in Canada are up 21%, reflecting the addition of the Liberté and Yoplait yogurt businesses. In Europe, sales grew 23% with good performance on the Yoplait, Häagen-Dazs and Nature Valley brands.
In the Asia Pacific regions, our business in China is showing 13% constant currency sales growth. And in Latin America, sales have doubled year to date, reflecting the addition of Yoki. So let me say a bit more about each of these regions.
In Canada, we're excited about the growth opportunities for yogurt. Category sales are up 9% so far this fiscal year. Our Liberté and Yoplait brands combined represent 1/3 of this $1.4 billion market. We assumed the license for Yoplait in Canada in September. In the short term, we did experience some disruption in the business as the previous licensee transitioned to cold pack Yoplait while also launching their own yogurt product. Now that much of that disruption is behind us, we are launching our first innovation in the market with the 50-calorie Greek yogurt offering, the first of its kind in the Canadian market.
Liberté yogurt continues to perform well. The brand now holds a 10% dollar share of the yogurt category, gaining nearly 2 points of share year-to-date with retail sales up 35%. We will invest behind both the Yoplait and Liberté brands with increased advertising and new product introductions in the second half.
Our yogurt business in Europe is also performing well. In France, we have launched new varieties of Calin. This is a yogurt high in calcium, and we've introduced a Greek style line extension. We've expanded these products to the U.K. market too, and we're supporting both new and established yogurt products with higher levels of advertising. In total, our year-to-date retail sales in both markets have increased at a mid single digit rate.
Also in Europe, we're seeing good growth on Häagen-Dazs. Year-to-date retail sales are up 15% on this business. Nature Valley snack bars are growing nicely too. Retail sales are up 33% so far this year, and this includes the recent launch of Sweet and Nutty bars in the U.K. We see great opportunities to increase household penetration for our brands in Europe, and we continue to like our growth prospects in this region.
In China, we're on track to deliver another year of double-digit sales growth. Our Häagen-Dazs team just completed a terrific mooncake event. In total, net sales for Häagen-Dazs are up 20% through the first half of the year. 
Sales for Wanchai Ferry Frozen Foods are up 6% year-to-date. We are increasing distribution on existing products and expanding into high-growth segments like wonton, mantu and frozen noodles. While the overall Chinese economy may be slowing a bit, the demand for branded consumer food products continues to expand. For our business, we're seeing good growth in both existing and new cities.
In Latin America, the highlight is certainly our Yoki acquisition. Our new brands have strong positions in Brazil with the Kitano and Yoki brands in more than 70% of Brazilian households. We're posting double-digit sales growth in some of our largest categories including popcorn, seasoning and side dishes.
Let me also say a quick word about our Cereal Partners Worldwide joint venture. Through the first half, constant currency net sales were up 2%. We're leveraging our large core brands by Chocapic thick and Cheerios, and we recently launched Chocolate Cheerios in the U.K. The cereal category is posting growth in markets around the world. While there is some category softness in Southwestern Europe, sales in other established markets like the U.K. and Mexico are up, and the category is growing even faster in emerging markets, in Latin America and Asia. CPW holds a 23% value share of the cereal category outside of North America, and we continue to like the growth prospects we see for this venture.
So with that, let me summarize today's update on fiscal 2013. We had a good second quarter and first half, fueled by strong operating profit gains across all 3 segments of our business. As we look ahead to the second half of the year, we've incorporated a bit more input cost inflation and an expectation of currency devaluation in Venezuela, and that's built into our outlook. 
Our second half plans also include a very good slate of new product introductions and robust marketing and in-store merchandising plan designed to support both new and established products. And our full year EPS guidance is up a bit to a range of $2.65 to $2.67 for fiscal 2013.
Let me briefly shift from talking about the fiscal year to the calendar year. As we get ready to ring in calendar 2013, the operating environment, and more broadly the global economic environment, present a great deal of uncertainty. But to be frank, 2012, the calendar year just ending, is no walk in the park either and yet our brands and our business continued to grow. As shown on Slide 46, over the last 4 quarters, our sales grew with contributions from established product lines and new businesses. Our sales outside the U.S. grew even faster, consistent with our strategy of expanding our business in developed and emerging international markets. Our operating profit increased 7% to exceed $3 billion, and our earnings per share grew despite headwinds ranging from sharply higher input costs to low interest rates and the resulting impact on calculated pension expense.
Our operations generated more than $2.5 billion of cash over the past 4 quarters and a 23% increase from the prior year. Cash return to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases grew 21% to exceed $1.4 billion. And we generated an 11% total return to shareholders over this same time period.
So, as I have said before, in challenging times, it's good to be in the food business, and we are committed to generating another good year of growth for our business and to create value for our shareholders again in calendar 2013.
So that concludes our prepared remarks this morning. So operator, I will ask you to open the line for questions."

So it wasn't -- I mean, the weather last year was certainly or likely a factor for soup sales, because we know that was a little bit weather-related. But by far, the dominant factor over last year was the pricing that we began to take early in the calendar year, which had all the effects that you're very well aware of. We had the high inflation, we took very significant price increases, and that resulted in a volume impact across many of our categories. And so that was, I think, the big event of our last fiscal year. And as we adjust those prices tactically, as we said in the presentation really to restore the gap where it needed to be restored, we're seeing those businesses respond, as we thought that they would.

We looked at our trends year to date and look at the balance of the year, we see our full year expectation at mid single digits for total company sales. As far as our performance in the first half, as we mentioned, we did slightly outperformed our plan. A few factors drove that, the international momentum that we've seen has been -- continues to be very robust. Bakeries and Foodservice business strictly the mix of products and channels that we're selling through our expectation. Across the company, we knew it was going to be a challenging year, and I think everybody has just made sure from an expense downfall and we made that appropriately that had some benefit. And then interest rates and tax rate has played -- interest rates because market tax rates because of timing of discrete items that we have every year, that we had baked into our full year forecast but some favorable items hit earlier in the year that we had anticipated. So those are a number of factors accumulating to a favorable result in the first half. In the second half, we have noted a couple of things. One, inflation will be higher than our original expectation. That's backloaded because we had some hedge positions that covered us in the front half with the drought cost from last summer. We Will start seeing come through in the second half. We'll see gross margin, we will see some gross margin pressure. Tax rate, again, we had, from a phasing standpoint, that some variability in the first half. We'll normalize in the second half still get to our 33% tax rate for the full year. And then as I mentioned, the devaluation of the will be a couple of cent drag in the back half as well.

As you see on Slide 4, our second quarter results are summarized there. Net sales grew 6% to nearly $4.9 billion. New businesses, particularly Yoki in Brazil and Yoplait Canada, contributed 4 points of net sales growth in the quarter. Segment operating profit grew faster than sales, up 10%, reflecting a higher gross margin and a 3% decrease in advertising and media expense in the period. 
All 3 of our business segments posted operating profit gains. Net earnings totaled $542 million, and diluted earnings per share were $0.82 as reported. Excluding certain items affecting comparability, our adjusted diluted EPS would be $0.86, up 13% from last year's second quarter.
Slide 5 shows the components of our net sales growth. Pound volume contributed 7 percentage points of growth in the quarter. That's primarily the addition of Yoki and Yoplait Canada. Sales mix and net price realizations subtracted 1 point of sales growth. Foreign exchange had no impact on sales growth for the company in total.
Slide 6 shows net sales growth by segment. For U.S. retail, pound volume and net sales grew 2% in the quarter. This performance was led by our Snacks, Small Planet Foods and Meals divisions. Net sales of our Bakeries and Foodservice business declined 1% with pound volume down 2% due to lower bakery flour sales. This sales decline on index-priced items offset gains on cereal, snacks and frozen breakfast items. 
International segment net sales rose 19% as reported and 22% on a constant currency basis with good growth across all 4 geographic regions. While these results do include contributions from Yoki and Yoplait Canada, our established businesses also performed well. Excluding new businesses and foreign exchange, international sales increased 4% in the quarter. 
Our gross margin improved 120 basis points in the second quarter as reported. This includes the impact of mark-to-market valuation for certain grain inventories and commodity hedges we'll use in future periods. Slide 7 also shows that excluding these effects, underlying gross margin improved 20 basis points primarily due to lower levels of input cost inflation, HMM and good plant operating performance.
We expect our input cost inflation rate to tick up in the second half, reflecting the impact of this summer's drought. So we expect to be at the high end of our 2% to 3% inflation estimate for the full year, and we're now roughly 90% covered on our commodity needs for fiscal 2013.
Slide 8 shows second quarter profit growth by operating segment. U.S. retail posted a 9% increase driven primarily by lower input cost inflation and consumer marketing expenses below year-ago levels. International profit increased 4% in the quarter. This includes an expense of $17 million associated with the transition of the Yoplait yogurt license in Canada. Remember that this investment was built into our fiscal 2013 guidance. Excluding this expense, international operating profit would have increased 17% in the quarter. And Bakeries and Foodservice profit grew 24%, reflecting lower wheat costs year-over-year, favorable mix and increased grain merchandising earnings.
Earnings from joint ventures increased 14% in the second quarter to $33 million after tax. On a constant-currency basis, CPW sales increased 3%, with strong performance in the emerging markets partially offset by category softness in southwestern Europe. Cost of currency sales for Häagen-Dazs Japan grew 5%, led by new products.
Completing our review of the income statement, corporate unallocated expenses excluding mark-to-market effects were $79 million. That's above last year's second quarter primarily due to increased pension expense. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 32.6% as reported. Excluding items affecting comparability, the effective tax rate was 32.8% compared to 33.7% a year ago. This primarily reflects the timing of expense -- of tax expense for the year. We're still estimating our full year underlying tax rate at about 33%.
Turning to the balance sheet. Slide 11 shows the core working capital increased 8% in the quarter. The majority of the increase is the addition of Yoki. Excluding the impact of Yoki, core working capital grew modestly in the quarter at a rate less than sales growth. Through first half, cash flow from operations exceeded $1.3 billion, a 14% increase over last year. Capital expenditures totaled $264 million through the first half, generally matching year-ago levels. We expect full year capital spending to be comparable to last year as well.
We're returning more cash to shareholders this year. Through the first half, we paid $434 million in dividends. That's up 9% over last year, reflecting our dividend increase. We also repurchased approximately 12 million shares of common stock for a total of $479 million. That's more than twice the value of share repurchases in last year's first half. In the second quarter, average diluted shares outstanding decreased by approximately 1 million shares. And for the full year, we continue to target a net reduction in average diluted shares outstanding.
Slide 13 summarizes our financial performance through the first half of the fiscal year. Net sales grew 5%. Segment operating profit grew faster than sales, up 8%. Net earnings attributable to General Mills totaled more than $1 billion, and diluted earnings per share were $1.64. Excluding items affecting comparability, our adjusted earnings per share totaled $1.52, up 8% from a year ago. These first half results are ahead of consensus expectations and a bit ahead of our plans, too. This good start puts us early on track to achieve our key financial targets for fiscal 2013.
For the full year, we expect to deliver mid-single digit growth in net sales, including growth for our established businesses and contributions from new businesses. We expect operating profit to grow to mid-single digit rate, too. We now expect input cost inflation of 3% for the year, including some impact from this summer's drought in the second half. We're also anticipating possible currency devaluation in Venezuela. Including these factors, we're raising our EPS guidance a bit to a range of $2.65 to $2.67 per share. That's on an adjusted basis excluding certain items affecting comparability.

I appreciate the chance to give you an update on our U.S. Retail segment. Our top line trends improved in the second quarter. Pound volume stabilized in September and October and increased at a mid-single digit rate in November. 
Net sales for the quarter increased 2%. The acquisition of Food Should Taste Good combined with solid established business performance drove double-digit growth in our Small Planet Foods division. Sales for our Snacks division also increased at a double-digit rate led by strong product innovation. Progresso soup and sauces paced growth in our Meals division. Sales for our Frozen Foods division matched year-ago levels, while Baking and Big G divisions sales declined modestly. And while U.S. yogurt sales declined, clearly the rate of decline is moderating. I'll provide you with more details on that in a few minutes.
As shown on Slide 17, our second quarter U.S. retail performance reflected good sequential improvement. Volume, net sales and segment operating profit performance all improved versus the first quarter. We've got a number of great initiatives in the market right now, with more planned for the back half of the year. I'll highlight a few examples, starting with some of our seasonal favorites. The holidays are in full swing, and we're hoping consumers bake up some favorite treats. 
On our refrigerated dough business, our Let The Making Begin campaign is designed to inspire consumers. Response has been terrific. Baseline sales have increased for both Pillsbury crescent rolls and biscuits since we launched this campaign in October, and we added over 0.5 point of market share in November.  And Betty Crocker is back with her red hot holiday trends. Tips for making a perfect 18-layer velvet cake, hidden-surprise cookies and many other recipes are available online at bettycrocker.com. This campaign helped drive over a full point of desserts market share growth in November.
Soup season is underway, too, and Progresso sales are growing. Our new line of recipe starter sauces is off to a good start. However, the primary driver of our year-to-date performance is our core ready-to-serve soup business. We've added points of distribution, and we've increased investment behind our taste-focused advertising. In total, first half Progresso retail sales increased 7%, and we added 1.5 points of market share in the ready-to-serve segment, including 0.5 share point in the second quarter. 
Progresso has some great marketing and merchandising events planned for the second half of the year. We're partnering with both Weight Watchers and the Biggest Loser TV show to help consumers shed those extra holiday pounds. Our plans include strong advertising and in-store merchandising, as well as product placement in an upcoming Biggest Loser episode.
With the holidays here, consumers are making party mix snacks with our Chex cereals. This year, we're sharing recipes for the microwave so these snacks are ready in just minutes. We're supporting this annual campaign with a strong combination of digital media and in-store merchandising. And on top of this party mix activity, Chex gluten-free positioning continues to drive growth. In total, first half retail sales for the Chex franchise rose 14%.  
We've got a strong second half innovation lineup for our cereal business. I'll start with Cheerios, the largest franchise in the U.S. cereal category with a 13% share of total category sales. Honey Nut Cheerios is the single largest brand in the cereal aisle. We're expanding it in January with the launch of a medley crunch variety. This new cereal has the heart health benefits and great taste consumers expect from Honey Nut Cheerios. It also has a great texture with oats clusters and flakes. We think this is a terrific addition to the Cheerios franchise.
Slide 22 highlights our Cascadian Farm organic cereals. First half retail sales for this line increased 13%. Cascadian Farm is the #1 granola brand in America, organic or otherwise. The ancient grains variety we launched in June is off to a good start. And next month, we're adding a berry cobbler variety. We're adding new varieties of our other popular cereal brands, too. Fiber One 80 Calorie chocolate cereal offers consumers 35% of the adult daily value of fiber and great chocolate taste at just 80 calories per serving. And the new Peanut Butter Toast Crunch builds on the success of our Cinnamon Toast Crunch franchise.
Now I'm sure you noticed that our first half cereal net sales and market share were below year-ago levels. Other players in the category had more merchandising activity in the first half of the year. We've got more merchandising planned for the second half, including introductory support for our new items. With a great lineup of new products and strong levels of marketing support behind new and established brands, we remain very excited about our U.S. cereal business, and we expect sales growth for Big G in the second half of this year.
Turning to the yogurt aisle. We are encouraged by recent trends on our Greek business. Yoplait Greek 100-calorie yogurt was launched in August. Distribution is ramping up nicely, and all 6 SKUs are turning in the top third of the total yogurt category. Our marketing campaign and dedicated advertising are now in market and on air, and we are pleased with the initial results. In fact, Yoplait's share in each of the most recent 2 months was 9% of Greek segment sales. It is still early days for U.S. Greek yogurt, and we expect to earn our fair share of this market segment over time.
At the same time, we're gaining share in Greek. We continue to see signs of stabilization for Yoplait Original and Yoplait Light yogurt, what we call our core cup business. Remember that we improved these products, and our merchandise price points are now better aligned with competitive level. As shown on Slide 26, we're seeing a nice improvement in core cup unit volume turns as a result. 
We've also launched innovative new items. Fruplait has 2 times the fruit of original Yoplait, while Simplait is made of just 6 all-natural ingredients. We have more new products coming in the second half to keep this momentum going. We're launching new flavors of Yoplait Greek 100. New Yoplait Pro-Force brings a combination of higher protein and great taste to the kids segments, and we're bringing new level of fun to the leading brand in the kids segment with Go-GURt's Twisted. 
Our second half plans also include regional expansion of Liberté Mediterranean and indulgent yogurt with higher fat content and the addition of Liberté Greek. We'll support both product lines with a combination of digital and billboard advertising along with product sampling efforts. So we expect to see increasing momentum across our U.S. yogurt business in the second half of this year.
In grain snacks, we continue to lead category growth with great product innovation, and we plan to build on that record in the second half. Slide 28 highlights several examples. We'll be expanding our Fiber One franchise with the launch of Fiber One protein bars. They have at least 6 grams of protein per serving and 20% of the adult daily value for fiber at 140 calories or less per bar. We're adding new varieties to our Nature Valley and Cascadian Farm product line. We're also launching Green Giant vegetable chips. These chips contain at least 16 grams of whole grain per serving. And with flavors like multigrain sweet potato and roasted vegetable zesty cheddar, they really taste terrific. 
We continue to see strong performance by our natural and organic snacks. First half retail sales for LÄRABAR, all-natural fruit and nut bars, increased at a double-digit pace. And we gained market share in the health and nutrition bars category.  In January, we're adding a cappuccino flavor to the LÄRABAR lineup.
Our new Food Should Taste Good business is also doing great. We focused on expanding distributions for these great-tasting snacks. Fiscal year-to-date shipments are up double digits. By leveraging General Mills sales and supply chain, we expect continuing distribution gains for this business over the balance of the year. 
Across our U.S. retail business, we have strong levels of marketing and in-store merchandising supporting our brands. As we have discussed with you before, our spending this year is weighted toward in-store merchandising. This promotional support is designed to drive awareness and trial for all of our new products, and we've sharpened our merchandise price points for certain product lines based on competitive merchandising levels in those categories. These actions are working for us. 
Our U.S. advertising expense is below strong year-ago levels through the first half, and we now expect our media expense to be down for the year in total. This is due in part to this year's tactical shift on merchandising. It also reflects ongoing cost discipline, which helps us lower media expense while maintaining very competitive media pressure against the consumer. In fact, as we look at Cantor-measured media spending across our U.S. categories over the latest 12 months available, our tracked advertising dollars are up and at a rate well above the 1% growth in ad spending across our categories overall. 
So our share of voice with the consumer has been growing. Across all of U.S. retail, we're launching over 100 new products in 2013, but it's not just quantity that matters. We're excited about the quality of our new product lineup. So we like our prospects for growth in U.S. retail over the balance of 2013. 
With that, let me wrap up my overview of General Mills' U.S. retail business. We're encouraged by the recent trends we see in the operating environment. Across the U.S. food and beverage industry, volumes have improved as pricing has moderated. We have terrific product innovation in market, and we're supporting our brands with strong levels of in-store merchandising, advertising and other consumer-directed marketing. We're on track to meet our low-single digit sales growth target in 2013 and are continuing HMM initiatives and cost management discipline of protecting our margins. So we expect our operating profit to grow faster than sales for the year.
Thank you for your time this morning. I will now pass the microphone over to Ken."

You just heard Ian describe some of the product innovation and marketing efforts we have underway in U.S. retail. And I want to give you now an update on the other 2 segments, starting with Bakeries and Foodservice",1363,"Thanks, Ian, and good morning, everyone. You just heard Ian describe some of the product innovation and marketing efforts we have underway in U.S. retail. And I want to give you now an update on the other 2 segments, starting with Bakeries and Foodservice.
As you can see on Slide 34, net sales for this segment are down 2% through the first half. That's primarily due to negative price realization. We had lower bakery flour prices in the first half. However, first half operating profit is up 18% driven by lower wheat costs in our cost of goods, favorable mix and grain merchandising earnings. This 18% profit growth builds on a strong track record of earnings growth for this segment. 
Over the past 5 years, segment operating profit has grown at a 14% compound rate. Grain merchandising activities have played a part, but primarily, this growth reflects our strategy of focusing on the most profitable products in the fastest-growing foodservice channels, and we continue to follow this winning strategy in fiscal 2013.
For example, our sales to U.S. convenient stores are captured in this business segment. We have a great lineup of new snack products hitting C-store shelf, including Nature Valley protein bars, Gardetto's snack crackers and Betty Crocker dessert bites. We're launching Yoplait Greek 100 yogurt in a variety of foodservice outlets, and we recently introduced our Greek version of Yoplait ParfaitPro. 
As you can see on Slide 36, this product gives foodservice operators an easy way to prepare layered yogurt parfaits. Sales for Yoplait ParfaitPro have been growing nicely, and the addition of a Greek variety will keep the momentum going. Sales for our frozen breakfast products are increasing at a double-digit pace, led by our line of Pillsbury breakfast items in school cafeterias. And we recently introduced mini cinnamon roll in Burger King restaurants nationwide.
Turning to our international segment. First half net sales are up 22% as reported, including new businesses. Segment operating profit is up 24%, including a 3% increase in media spending. On a constant-currency basis, first half international sales are up 28%. We're posting good growth across all of our geographic regions. 
Sales in Canada are up 21%, reflecting the addition of the Liberté and Yoplait yogurt businesses. In Europe, sales grew 23% with good performance on the Yoplait, Häagen-Dazs and Nature Valley brands. In the Asia Pacific region, our business in China is showing 13% constant-currency sales growth. And in Latin America, sales have doubled year-to-date, reflecting the addition of Yoki. 
So let me say a bit more about each of these regions. In Canada, we're excited about the growth opportunities for yogurt. Category sales are up 9% so far this fiscal year. Our Liberté and Yoplait brands combined represent 1/3 of this $1.4 billion market. We assumed the license for Yoplait in Canada in September. In the short term, we did experience some disruption in the business as the previous licensee transitioned to co-pack Yoplait while also launching their own yogurt product. Now that much of that disruption is behind us, we're launching our first innovation in the market with the 50-calorie Greek yogurt offering, the first of its kind in the Canadian market.
Liberté yogurt continues to perform well. The brand now holds a 10% dollar share of the yogurt category, gaining nearly 2 points of share year-to-date, with retail sales up 35%. We'll invest behind both the Yoplait and Liberté brands with increased advertising and new product introductions in the second half.
Our yogurt business in Europe is also performing well. In France, we have launched new varieties of Calin. This is a yogurt high in calcium, and we've introduced a Greek-style line extension. We've expanded these products to the U.K. market, too, and we're supporting both new and established yogurt products with higher levels of advertising. In total, our year-to-date retail sales in both markets have increased at a mid-single digit rate.
Also in Europe, we're seeing good growth on Häagen-Dazs. Year-to-date retail sales are up 15% on this business. Nature Valley snack bars are growing nicely, too. Retail sales are up 33% so far this year, and this includes the recent launch of Sweet & Nutty bars in the U.K. We see great opportunities to increase household penetration for our brands in Europe, and we continue to like our growth prospects in this region.
In China, we're on track to deliver another year of double-digit sales growth. Our Häagen-Dazs team just completed a terrific mooncake event. In total, net sales for Häagen-Dazs are up 20% through the first half of the year. Sales for Wanchai Ferry frozen foods are up 6% year-to-date. We are increasing distribution on existing products and expanding into high-growth segments like wonton, mantou and frozen noodles. While the overall Chinese economy may be slowing a bit, the demand for branded consumer food products continues to expand. For our business, we're seeing good growth in both existing and new cities.
In Latin America, the highlight is certainly our Yoki acquisition. Our new brands have strong positions in Brazil with the Kitano and Yoki brands in more than 70% of Brazilian households. We're posting double-digit sales growth in some of our largest categories including popcorn, seasonings and side dishes.
Let me also say a quick word about our Cereal Partners Worldwide joint venture. Through the first half, constant currency net sales were up 2%. We're leveraging our large core brands like Chocapic and Cheerios, and we recently launched Chocolate Cheerios in the U.K. The cereal category is posting growth in markets around the world. While there is some category softness in southwestern Europe, sales in other established markets like the U.K. and Mexico are up. And the category is growing even faster in emerging markets in Latin America and Asia. CPW holds a 23% value share of the cereal category outside of North America, and we continue to like the growth prospects we see for this venture.
So with that, let me summarize today's update on fiscal 2013. We had a good second quarter and first half, fueled by strong operating profit gains across all 3 segments of our business. As we look ahead to the second half of the year, we've incorporated a bit more input cost inflation and an expectation of currency devaluation in Venezuela, and that's built into our outlook. 
Our second half plans also include a very good slate of new product introductions and robust marketing and in-store merchandising plan designed to support both new and established products. And our full year EPS guidance is up a bit to a range of $2.65 to $2.67 for fiscal 2013.
Let me briefly shift from talking about the fiscal year to the calendar year. As we get ready to ring in calendar 2013, the operating environment, and more broadly, the global economic environment, present a great deal of uncertainty. But to be frank, 2012, the calendar year just ending, was no walk in the park either and yet our brands and our business continued to grow. 
As shown on Slide 46, over the last 4 quarters, our sales grew with contributions from established product lines and new businesses. Our sales outside the U.S. grew even faster, consistent with our strategy of expanding our business in developed and emerging international markets. Our operating profit increased 7% to exceed $3 billion, and our earnings per share grew despite headwinds ranging from sharply higher input costs to low interest rates and the resulting impact on calculated pension expense.
Our operations generated more than $2.5 billion of cash over the past 4 quarters and a 23% increase from the prior year. Cash return to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases grew 21% to exceed $1.4 billion. And we generated an 11% total return to shareholders over this same time period. So as I've said before, in challenging times, it's good to be in the food business, and we're committed to generating another good year of growth for our business and to create value for our shareholders again in calendar 2013.
So that concludes our prepared remarks this morning. So operator, I will ask you to open the line for questions."

And as we adjust those prices tactically, as we said in the presentation really to restore the gap where it needed to be restored, we're seeing those businesses respond as we thought they would. We're seeing baseline strengthen, and we're getting the merchandising lift as well. So it's really more about the pricing and inflation dynamic of the last 2 years that is driving the fundamental trends in our categories."

If you looked at our trends year-to-date and then look at the balance of the year, we see our full year expectation at mid-single digits for total company sales. As far as our performance in the first half, as we mentioned, we did slightly outperformed our plan. A few factors drove that.  The international momentum that we've seen has been -- continues to be very robust. Our Bakeries and Foodservice business, strictly the mix of products and channels that we're selling, was favorable to our expectations. Across the company, we knew it was going to be a challenging year, and I think everybody has just kind of made sure, from an expense standpoint, we've managed that appropriately. That had some benefit. And then interest rates and tax rates have played in our favor. Interest rates because of the market, tax rates because of some timing of discrete items that we have every year that we had baked into our full year forecast with some other favorable items hit earlier in the year that we had anticipated. So those are a number of factors that -- accumulating to a favorable result in the first half. In the second half, we've noted a couple of things. One, inflation will be higher than our original expectation. That's backloaded because we had some hedge positions that covered us in the front half with the drought costs from last summer we'll start seeing come through in the second half. So you'll see gross margin -- we'll see some gross margin pressure. Tax rates, again, we're -- we had -- from a phasing standpoint, we had some variability in the first half that we'll normalize in the second half and still get to our 33% tax rate for the full year. And then, as I mentioned, the devaluation of the bolivar, which is -- will be a couple of cent drag in the back half as well. So kind of take that all into consideration, that gives us confidence to increase our guidance by the -- increase the range up to plus $0.02 from our original guidance."

And maybe if you support it or you've got more advertising dollars behind it, there'd be more brands that move because Lucky Charms seem to be moving nicely with a little brand support."

Net sales grew 6% to nearly $4.9 bil",1038,"Thanks, Kris. Good morning, everybody. I'll second those holiday greetings, but I will keep my remarks to prose today. Thank you for joining us. 
As you see on Slide 4, our second quarter results are summarized there. Net sales grew 6% to nearly $4.9 billion. New businesses, particularly Yoki in Brazil and Yoplait Canada, contributed 4 points of net sales growth in the quarter. Segment operating profit grew faster than sales, up 10%, reflecting a higher gross margin and a 3% decrease in advertising and media expense in the period. 
All 3 of our business segments posted operating profit gains. Net earnings totaled $542 million, and diluted earnings per share were $0.82 as reported. Excluding certain items affecting comparability, our adjusted diluted EPS would be $0.86, up 13% from last year's second quarter.
Slide 5 shows the components of our net sales growth. Pound volume contributed 7 percentage points of growth in the quarter. That's primarily the addition of Yoki and Yoplait Canada. Sales mix and net price realizations subtracted 1 point of sales growth. Foreign exchange had no impact on sales growth for the company in total.
Slide 6 shows net sales growth by segment. For U.S. retail, pound volume and net sales grew 2% in the quarter. This performance was led by our Snacks, Small Planet Foods and Meals divisions. Net sales of our Bakeries and Foodservice business declined 1% with pound volume down 2% due to lower bakery flour sales. These sales declines on index-priced items offset gains on cereal, snacks and frozen breakfast items. 
International segment net sales rose 19% as reported and 22% on a constant currency basis with good growth across all 4 geographic regions. While these results do include contributions from Yoki and Yoplait Canada, our established businesses also performed well. Excluding new businesses and foreign exchange, international sales increased 4% in the quarter. 
Our gross margin improved 120 basis points in the second quarter as reported. This includes the impact of mark-to-market valuation for certain grain inventories and commodity hedges we'll use in future periods. Slide 7 also shows that excluding these effects, underlying gross margin improved 20 basis points, primarily due to lower levels of input cost inflation, HMM and good plant operating performance.
We expect our input cost inflation rate to tick up in the second half, reflecting the impact of this summer's drought. So we expect to be at the high end of our 2% to 3% inflation estimate for the full year, and we're now roughly 90% covered on our commodity needs for fiscal 2013.
Slide 8 shows second quarter profit growth by operating segment. U.S. retail posted a 9% increase, driven primarily by lower input cost inflation and consumer marketing expenses below year-ago levels. International profit increased 4% in the quarter. This includes an expense of $17 million associated with the transition of the Yoplait yogurt license in Canada. Remember that this investment was built into our fiscal 2013 guidance. Excluding this expense, international operating profit would have increased 17% in the quarter. And Bakeries and Foodservice profit grew 24%, reflecting lower wheat costs year-over-year, favorable mix and increased grain merchandising earnings.
Earnings from joint ventures increased 14% in the second quarter to $33 million after tax. On a constant-currency basis, CPW sales increased 3%, with strong performance in the emerging markets partially offset by category softness in southwestern Europe. Constant currency sales for Häagen-Dazs Japan grew 5%, led by new products.
Completing our review of the income statement, corporate unallocated expenses excluding mark-to-market effects were $79 million. That's above last year's second quarter, primarily due to increased pension expense. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 32.6% as reported. Excluding items affecting comparability, the effective tax rate was 32.8% compared to 33.7% a year ago. This primarily reflects the timing of expense -- of tax expense for the year. We're still estimating our full year underlying tax rate at about 33%.
Turning to the balance sheet. Slide 11 shows that core working capital increased 8% in the quarter. The majority of the increase is the addition of Yoki. Excluding the impact of Yoki, core working capital grew modestly in the quarter at a rate less than sales growth. Through first half, cash flow from operations exceeded $1.3 billion, a 14% increase over last year. Capital expenditures totaled $264 million through the first half, generally matching year-ago levels. We expect full year capital spending to be comparable to last year as well.
We're returning more cash to shareholders this year. Through the first half, we’ve paid $434 million in dividends. That's up 9% over last year, reflecting our dividend increase. We also repurchased approximately 12 million shares of common stock for a total of $479 million. That's more than twice the value of share repurchases in last year's first half. In the second quarter, average diluted shares outstanding decreased by approximately 1 million shares. And for the full year, we continue to target a net reduction in average diluted shares outstanding.
Slide 13 summarizes our financial performance through the first half of the fiscal year. Net sales grew 5%. Segment operating profit grew faster than sales, up 8%. Net earnings attributable to General Mills totaled more than $1 billion, and diluted earnings per share were $1.64. Excluding items affecting comparability, our adjusted earnings per share totaled $1.52, up 8% from a year ago. These first half results are ahead of consensus expectations and a bit ahead of our plans, too. This good start puts us firmly on track to achieve our key financial targets for fiscal 2013.
For the full year, we expect to deliver mid-single digit growth in net sales, including growth for our established businesses and contributions from new businesses. We expect operating profit to grow at a mid-single digit rate, too. We now expect input cost inflation of 3% for the year, including some impact from this summer's drought in the second half. We're also anticipating possible currency devaluation in Venezuela. Including these factors, we're raising our EPS guidance a bit to a range of $2.65 to $2.67 per share. That's on an adjusted basis, excluding certain items affecting comparability.

I appreciate the chance to give you an update on our U.S. Retail segment. Our top line trends improved in the second quarter. Pound volume stabilized in September and October and increased at a mid-single digit rate in November. 
Net sales for the quarter increased 2%. The acquisition of Food Should Taste Good, combined with solid established business performance, drove double-digit growth in our Small Planet Foods division. Sales for our Snacks division also increased at a double-digit rate, led by strong product innovation. Progresso soup and sauces paced growth in our Meals division. Sales for our Frozen Foods division matched year-ago levels, while Baking and Big G divisions sales declined modestly. And while U.S. yogurt sales declined, clearly the rate of decline is moderating. I'll provide you with more details on that in a few minutes.
As shown on Slide 17, our second quarter U.S. retail performance reflected good sequential improvement. Volume, net sales and segment operating profit performance all improved versus the first quarter. We've got a number of great initiatives in the market right now, with more planned for the back half of the year. I'll highlight a few examples, starting with some of our seasonal favorites. The holidays are in full swing, and we're helping consumers bake up some favorite treats. 
On our refrigerated dough business, our Let The Making Begin campaign is designed to inspire consumers. Response has been terrific. Baseline sales have increased for both Pillsbury crescent rolls and biscuits since we launched this campaign in October, and we added over 0.5 points of market share in November.  And Betty Crocker is back with her red hot holiday trends. Tips for making a perfect 18-layer velvet cake, hidden-surprise cookies and many other recipes are available online at bettycrocker.com. This campaign helped drive over 1 full point of desserts market share growth in November.
Soup season is underway, too, and Progresso sales are growing. Our new line of recipe-starter sauces is off to a good start. However, the primary driver of our year-to-date performance is our core ready-to-serve soup business. We've added points of distribution, and we've increased investment behind our taste-focused advertising. In total, first half Progresso retail sales increased 7%, and we added 1.5 points of market share in the ready-to-serve segment, including 0.5 share points in the second quarter. 
Progresso has some great marketing and merchandising events planned for the second half of the year. We're partnering with both Weight Watchers and The Biggest Loser TV show to help consumers shed those extra holiday pounds. Our plans include strong advertising and in-store merchandising, as well as product placement in an upcoming Biggest Loser episode.
With the holidays here, consumers are making party mix snacks with our Chex cereals. This year, we're sharing recipes for the microwave, so these snacks are ready in just minutes. We're supporting this annual campaign with a strong combination of digital media and in-store merchandising. And on top of this party mix activity, Chex gluten-free positioning continues to drive growth. In total, first half retail sales for the Chex franchise rose 14%.  
We've got a strong second half innovation lineup for our cereal business. I'll start with Cheerios, the largest franchise in the U.S. cereal category with a 13% share of total category sales. Honey Nut Cheerios is the single largest brand in the cereal aisle. We're expanding it in January with the launch of a Medley Crunch variety. This new cereal has the heart health benefits and great taste consumers expect from Honey Nut Cheerios. It also has that great texture with O’s, clusters and flakes. We think this is a terrific addition to the Cheerios franchise.
Slide 22 highlights our Cascadian Farm organic cereals. First half retail sales for this line increased 13%. Cascadian Farm is the #1 granola brand in America, organic or otherwise. The ancient grains variety we launched in June is off to a good start. And next month, we're adding a berry cobbler variety. We're adding new variety in some of our other popular cereal brands, too. Fiber One 80 Calorie chocolate cereal offers consumers 35% of the adult daily value of fiber and great chocolate taste at just 80 calories per serving. And new Peanut Butter Toast Crunch builds on the success of our Cinnamon Toast Crunch franchise.
Now I'm sure you noticed that our first half cereal net sales and market share were below year-ago levels. Other players in the category had more merchandising activity in the first half of the year. We've got more merchandising planned for the second half, including introductory support for our new items. With a great lineup of new products and strong levels of marketing support behind new and established brands, we remain very excited about our U.S. cereal business, and we expect sales growth for Big G in the second half of this year.
Turning to the yogurt aisle. We are encouraged by recent trends on our Greek business. Yoplait Greek 100-calorie yogurt was launched in August. Distribution is ramping up nicely, and all 6 SKUs are turning in the top third of the total yogurt category. Our marketing campaign and dedicated advertising are now in market and on air, and we are pleased with the initial results. In fact, Yoplait's share in each of the most recent 2 months was 9% of Greek segment sales. It is still early days for U.S. Greek yogurt, and we expect to earn our fair share of this market segment over time.
At the same time we're gaining share in Greek, we continue to see signs of stabilization for Yoplait Original and Yoplait Light yogurt, what we call our core cup business. Remember that we improved these products, and our merchandise price points are now better aligned with competitive levels. As shown on Slide 26, we're seeing a nice improvement in core cup unit volume turns as a result. 
We've also launched innovative new items. Fruplait has 2 times the fruit of original Yoplait, while Simplait is made of just 6 all-natural ingredients. We have more new products coming in the second half to keep this momentum going. We're launching new flavors of Yoplait Greek 100. New Yoplait Pro-Force brings a combination of higher protein and great taste to the kids segment, and we're bringing new level of fun to the leading brand in the kids segment with Go-GURT's Twisted. 
Our second half plans also include regional expansion of Liberté Mediterranean, an indulging yogurt with higher fat content, and the addition of Liberté Greek. We'll support both product lines with a combination of digital and billboard advertising along with product sampling efforts. So we expect to see increasing momentum across our U.S. yogurt business in the second half of this year.
In grain snacks, we continue to lead category growth with great product innovation, and we plan to build on that record in the second half. Slide 28 highlights several examples. We'll be expanding our Fiber One franchise with the launch of Fiber One protein bars. They have at least 6 grams of protein per serving and 20% of the adult daily value for fiber at 140 calories or less per bar. We're adding new varieties to our Nature Valley and Cascadian Farm product lines. We're also launching Green Giant vegetable chips. These chips contain at least 16 grams of whole grain per serving. And with flavors like multigrain sweet potato and roasted vegetable zesty cheddar, they really taste terrific. 
We continue to see strong performance by our natural and organic snacks. First half retail sales for LÄRABAR, all-natural fruit and nut bars, increased at a double-digit pace. And we gained market share in the health and nutrition bars category.  In January, we're adding a cappuccino flavor to the LÄRABAR lineup.
Our new Food Should Taste Good business is also doing great. We’ve focused on expanding distributions for these great-tasting snacks. Fiscal year-to-date shipments are up double digits. By leveraging General Mills sales and supply chain, we expect continuing distribution gains for this business over the balance of the year. 
Across our U.S. retail business, we have strong levels of marketing and in-store merchandising supporting our brands. As we have discussed with you before, our spending this year is weighted toward in-store merchandising. This promotional support is designed to drive awareness and trial for all of our new products, and we've sharpened our merchandise price points for certain product lines based on competitive merchandising levels in those categories. These actions are working for us. 
Our U.S. advertising expense is below strong year-ago levels through the first half, and we now expect our media expense to be down for the year in total. This is due in part to this year's tactical shift on merchandising. It also reflects ongoing cost discipline, which helps us lower media expense while maintaining very competitive media pressure against the consumer. In fact, as we look at Cantor-measured media spending across our U.S. categories over the latest 12 months available, our tracked advertising dollars are up and at a rate well above the 1% growth in ad spending across our categories overall. 
So our share of voice with the consumer has been growing. Across all of U.S. retail, we're launching over 100 new products in 2013, but it's not just quantity that matters. We're excited about the quality of our new product lineup. So we like our prospects for growth in U.S. retail over the balance of 2013. 
With that, let me wrap up my overview of General Mills' U.S. retail business. We're encouraged by the recent trends we see in the operating environment. Across the U.S. food and beverage industry, volumes have improved as pricing has moderated. We have terrific product innovation in market, and we're supporting our brands with strong levels of in-store merchandising, advertising and other consumer-directed marketing. We're on track to meet our low-single digit sales growth target in 2013 and are continuing HMM initiatives and cost management discipline of protecting our margins. So we expect our operating profit to grow faster than sales for the year.
Thank you for your time this morning. I will now pass the microphone over to Ken."

You just heard Ian describe some of the product innovation and marketing efforts we have underway in U.S. retail. And I want to give you now an update on the other 2 segments, starting with Bakeries and Foodservice",1363,"Thanks, Ian, and good morning, everyone. You just heard Ian describe some of the product innovation and marketing efforts we have underway in U.S. retail. And I want to give you now an update on the other 2 segments, starting with Bakeries and Foodservice.
As you can see on Slide 34, net sales for this segment are down 2% through the first half. That's primarily due to negative price realization. We had lower bakery flour prices in the first half. However, first half operating profit is up 18%, driven by lower wheat costs in our cost of goods, favorable mix and grain merchandising earnings. This 18% profit growth builds on a strong track record of earnings growth for this segment. 
Over the past 5 years, segment operating profit has grown at a 14% compound rate. Grain merchandising activities have played a part, but primarily, this growth reflects our strategy of focusing on the most profitable products in the fastest-growing foodservice channels, and we continue to follow this winning strategy in fiscal 2013.
For example, our sales to U.S. convenience stores are captured in this business segment. We have a great lineup of new snack products hitting C-store shelves, including Nature Valley protein bars, Gardetto's snack crackers and Betty Crocker dessert bites. We're launching Yoplait Greek 100 yogurt in a variety of foodservice outlets, and we recently introduced a Greek version of Yoplait ParfaitPro. 
As you can see on Slide 36, this product gives foodservice operators an easy way to prepare layered yogurt parfaits. Sales for Yoplait ParfaitPro have been growing nicely, and the addition of a Greek variety will keep the momentum going. Sales for our frozen breakfast products are increasing at a double-digit pace, led by our line of Pillsbury breakfast items in school cafeterias. And we recently introduced a mini cinnamon roll in Burger King restaurants nationwide.
Turning to our international segment. First half net sales are up 22% as reported, including new businesses. Segment operating profit is up 24%, including a 3% increase in media spending. On a constant-currency basis, first half international sales are up 28%. We're posting good growth across all of our geographic regions. 
Sales in Canada are up 21%, reflecting the addition of the Liberté and Yoplait yogurt businesses. In Europe, sales grew 23% with good performance on the Yoplait, Häagen-Dazs and Nature Valley brands. In the Asia Pacific region, our business in China is showing 13% constant-currency sales growth. And in Latin America, sales have doubled year-to-date, reflecting the addition of Yoki. 
So let me say a bit more about each of these regions. In Canada, we're excited about the growth opportunities for yogurt. Category sales are up 9% so far this fiscal year. Our Liberté and Yoplait brands combined represent 1/3 of this $1.4 billion market. We assumed the license for Yoplait in Canada in September. In the short term, we did experience some disruption in the business as the previous licensee transitioned to co-pack Yoplait while also launching their own yogurt product. Now that much of that disruption is behind us, we're launching our first innovation in the market with a 50-calorie Greek yogurt offering, the first of its kind in the Canadian market.
Liberté yogurt continues to perform well. The brand now holds a 10% dollar share of the yogurt category, gaining nearly 2 points of share year-to-date, with retail sales up 35%. We'll invest behind both the Yoplait and Liberté brands with increased advertising and new product introductions in the second half.
Our yogurt business in Europe is also performing well. In France, we have launched new varieties of Calin. This is a yogurt high in calcium, and we've introduced a Greek-style line extension. We've expanded these products to the U.K. market, too, and we're supporting both new and established yogurt products with higher levels of advertising. In total, our year-to-date retail sales in both markets have increased at a mid-single digit rate.
Also in Europe, we're seeing good growth on Häagen-Dazs. Year-to-date retail sales are up 15% on this business. Nature Valley snack bars are growing nicely, too. Retail sales are up 33% so far this year, and this includes the recent launch of Sweet & Nutty bars in the U.K. We see great opportunities to increase household penetration for our brands in Europe, and we continue to like our growth prospects in this region.
In China, we're on track to deliver another year of double-digit sales growth. Our Häagen-Dazs team just completed a terrific mooncake event. In total, net sales for Häagen-Dazs are up 20% through the first half of the year. Sales for Wanchai Ferry frozen foods are up 6% year-to-date. We’re increasing distribution on existing products and expanding into high-growth segments like wonton, mantou and frozen noodles. While the overall Chinese economy may be slowing a bit, the demand for branded consumer food products continues to expand. For our business, we're seeing good growth in both existing and new cities.
In Latin America, the highlight is certainly our Yoki acquisition. Our new brands have strong positions in Brazil with the Kitano and Yoki brands in more than 70% of Brazilian households. We're posting double-digit sales growth in some of our largest categories, including popcorn, seasonings and side dishes.
Let me also say a quick word about our Cereal Partners Worldwide joint venture. Through the first half, constant currency net sales were up 2%. We're leveraging our large core brands like Chocapic and Cheerios, and we recently launched Chocolate Cheerios in the U.K. The cereal category is posting growth in markets around the world. While there is some category softness in southwestern Europe, sales in other established markets like the U.K. and Mexico are up. And the category is growing even faster in emerging markets in Latin America and Asia. CPW holds a 23% value share of the cereal category outside of North America, and we continue to like the growth prospects we see for this venture.
So with that, let me summarize today's update on fiscal 2013. We had a good second quarter and first half, fueled by strong operating profit gains across all 3 segments of our business. As we look ahead to the second half of the year, we've incorporated a bit more input cost inflation and an expectation of currency devaluation in Venezuela, and that's built into our outlook. 
Our second half plans also include a very good slate of new product introductions and robust marketing and in-store merchandising plans designed to support both new and established products. And our full year EPS guidance is up a bit to a range of $2.65 to $2.67 for fiscal 2013.
Let me briefly shift from talking about the fiscal year to the calendar year. As we get ready to ring in calendar 2013, the operating environment and, more broadly, the global economic environment, present a great deal of uncertainty. But to be frank, 2012, the calendar year just ending, was no walk in the park either, and yet our brands and our business continued to grow. 
As shown on Slide 46, over the last 4 quarters, our sales grew with contributions from established product lines and new businesses. Our sales outside the U.S. grew even faster, consistent with our strategy of expanding our business in developed and emerging international markets. Our operating profit increased 7% to exceed $3 billion, and our earnings per share grew, despite headwinds ranging from sharply higher input costs to low interest rates and the resulting impact on calculated pension expense.
Our operations generated more than $2.5 billion of cash over the past 4 quarters and a 23% increase from the prior year. Cash return to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases grew 21% to exceed $1.4 billion. And we generated an 11% total return to shareholders over this same time period. So as I've said before, in challenging times, it's good to be in the food business, and we're committed to generating another good year of growth for our business and to create value for our shareholders again in calendar 2013.
So that concludes our prepared remarks this morning. So operator, I will ask you to open the line for questions."

We had high inflation, we took very significant price increases, and that resulted in a volume impact across many of our categories. And so that was, I think, the big event of our last fiscal year.

If you look at our trends year-to-date and then look at the balance of the year, we see our full year expectation at mid-single digits for total company sales. As far as our performance in the first half, as we mentioned, we did slightly outperform our plan. A few factors drove that.  Clearly, the international momentum that we've seen has been -- continues to be very robust. Our Bakeries and Foodservice business, particularly the mix of products and channels that we're selling, was favorable to our expectations. Across the company, we knew it was going to be a challenging year, and I think everybody has just kind of made sure, from an expense standpoint, we've managed that appropriately. That’s had some benefit. And then interest rates and tax rates have played in our favor. Interest rates because of the market, tax rates because of some timing of discrete items that we have every year that we had baked into our full year forecast with some other favorable items hit earlier in the year that we had anticipated. So those are a number of factors that ended up accumulating to a favorable result in the first half. In the second half, we've noted a couple of things. One, inflation will be higher than our original expectations. That's backloaded because we had some hedge positions that covered us in the front half, but the drought costs from last summer we'll start seeing come through in the second half. So you'll see gross margin -- we'll see some gross margin pressure. Tax rates, again, we're -- we had -- from a phasing standpoint, we had some favorability in the first half that will normalize in the second half, and still, we’ll get to our 33% tax rate for the full year. And then, as I mentioned, the devaluation of the bolivar, which is -- will be a couple of cent drag in the back half as well. So kind of take that all into consideration, that gives us confidence to increase our guidance by the -- increase the range up to plus $0.02 from our original guidance."

As you heard Ian mention, that is off to quite a nice start, and consumers love variety in the yogurt category. So we're getting back to them as quickly as we can, and so it offers them variety.

And as I said in my prepared remarks around both our refrigerated dough business, it's been very responsive to the Let the Making Begin campaign, and our dry mix has also had a very good response to the marketing. So, so far, so good. We like what we're seeing, and it seems to be going well."

We thought more of our promotional plan would start showing up throughout Q2. It started showing up largely towards the end of Q2 and going here into December. And so we're seeing cereal, as I commented, sequentially pick up. But we didn't quite get all that we expected. And again, it had a lot to do with just higher levels of competitive -- certain competitive frequencies in that particular quarter. It will all, I think, come out in the year. Primarily some of that stuff was pushed into December and into the back half for us. So it will be a different flow than we anticipated, but I would anticipate that by year-end it will pretty much be where we thought."
