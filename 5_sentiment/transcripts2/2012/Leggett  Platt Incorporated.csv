Yesterday, we reported fourth quarter and full-year 2011 earnings. For the quarter, earnings were $0.06 per share and included $0.16 per share of costs associated with the restructuring activities",898,"Good morning, and thank you for participating in our call. Yesterday, we reported fourth quarter and full-year 2011 earnings. For the quarter, earnings were $0.06 per share and included $0.16 per share of costs associated with the restructuring activities that we announced in late December. Earnings per share excluding these costs were $0.22 in the quarter. In the fourth quarter 2010, we are in $0.21 per share. Fourth quarter same location sales grew 6% versus the prior year partially from items that brought little incremental profit. Raw material-related price inflation and trade sales from our steel mill accounted for the bulk of the growth with unit volumes from our other businesses in total adding about 1% to sales. Earnings per share  for the full year 2011 adjusted to exclude the fourth quarter restructuring related costs were $1.20 per share. In 2010, we earned $1.15 per share. The increase is primarily due to a lower share count, a lower effective tax rate and slightly higher sales partially offset by higher selling and administrative expense and other cost. Sales grew 8% in 2011, largely from inflation, currency rate changes and trade sales from our steel mill. 
Across the company as a whole, unit volume increased slightly. Demand improved in certain of our markets in 2011 with automotive and Office Furniture leading the way. In contrast, stagnant demand negatively impacted our residential markets. Many consumers continue to spending on worker ticket items such as bedding and furniture in the phase of ongoing weak economy. 
On the third quarter earnings call, we stated that our view of continuing demand weakness in certain of our markets and our plan to initiate actions that would yield improved ongoing profitability. In late December, we announced further restructuring which included the closure of 4 production facilities along with other cost reductions. These activities resulted in a $0.16 per share predominantly non-cash charge to earnings during the fourth quarter. The restructuring-related activities that we initiated during 2011 in total, should benefit 2012 earnings per share by approximately $0.07 to $0.10. 
We were very pleased to report in late December that we were acquiring Western Pneumatic Tube, a leading provider to the aerospace industry with integral components for critical aircraft systems. Our  strategic long-term 4% to 5% annual growth objective envisions pre-acquisitions of companies exactly like Western. High-quality businesses with secure leading positions in growing profitable attractive markets and it makes sense to be part of Leggett & Platt. The acquisition was completed in January 12 and is expected to be slightly accretive to EPS in 2012 . 
Operating cash for the fourth quarter was $127 million, bringing the full year 2011 operating cash to $329 million. With concern about weak markets, our operating folks continue to closely monitor the working capital levels.  We entered the year with working capital at 11.8% of annualized sales. Now current liabilities include approximately $30 million associated with an interest rate swap that we entered in 2010. 
Excluding this item, working capital was 12.7% of annualized sales, still well below our 15% target. In August, we increased the quarterly dividend by $0.01 to $0.28 per share reinforcing our commitment to consistent shareholder returns and our confidence in Leggett's strong cash generation. 2011 marks our 40th consecutive year of annual dividend increases maintaining our dividend track record is very important to us.  Only 2 companies in the S&P 500 have a stronger string of annual increases at a higher growth rate than Leggett. 
For over 20 years, we have generated more than enough operating cash for capital expenditures and dividends and we expect that to be the case again in 2012. For the upcoming year, operating cash should exceed $300 million, capital expenditures are expected to be about $100 million and dividend payment should approximate $160 million. 
We Anticipate the increase in capital expenditures relates primarily to new automotive programs that we have been awarded and that should contribute meaningfully to earnings and cash flow beginning in 2013. 
During 2011, we continued purchasing our stock while maintaining our strong financial base. For the year, we repurchased 10 million shares, we also issued 3 million shares to various employee benefits and stock purchase programs. We ended the year with net debt at 29% of net capital which is below our long-term targeted range of 30% to 40%. We expect to continue repurchasing our stock when we have excess cash flow and we have an annual $10 million share authorization at which these purchases may be made. However, with the acquisition of Western Pneumatic Tube in mid-January resulting in temporary increase in our net debt levels to about 35% of that capital, we may choose not to repurchase any shares during 2012. 
For the fourth consecutive year, Leggett & Platt's stock provided a better return to investors than did the S&P 500 index. We target total shareholder return in the top 1/3 of the S&P 500 over the long-term, which we believe will require an average TSR of 12% to 15% per year. 
For the 3 years ending December 31, 2011, we generated an average annual Total Shareholder Return of 21% compared to 14% for the S&P 500 index. That places us in the top 38% of the S&P 500, just a bit shy of our goal. 
With those comments, I'll turn the call over to Karl Glassman, who will provide some operating highlights. Karl?"

In my comments, I'll discuss a few segment highlights.

Good morning. In my comments, I'll discuss a few segment highlights. You will find segment details in yesterday's press release and in the Slide presentation on our website . fourth quarter sales in the Residential Furnishings segment increased 6% primarily from raw material-related price inflation. Unit volumes were up slightly. In our U.S. Spring business, innerspring unit volumes increased 4% and boxspring units increased 2% during the fourth quarter. The positive innerspring data primarily reflects our recovery of market share in 2011 that was temporarily lost to a European supplier in the back half of 2010. 
For the full year 2011, both innerspring and boxspring units were essentially flat. In our pressure hardware business, fourth quarter unit volume decreased 3% versus the prior year. While units were still negative for the quarter, the market has stabilized since mid year and we're showing some improved strength as the year came to a close. For the full year 2011, units were down 6%.
Again this quarter, we had significant growth in adjustable beds with unit shipments up 35%. With our other major residential businesses flat or down in unit volume for the full-year, this business was the bright spot in this segment. For the full year 2011, adjustable beds units grew 44%. EBIT and EBIT margins in our Residential Furnishings segment decreased versus the fourth quarter of 2010. The earnings benefit from slightly higher unit volumes was more than offset by higher restructuring-related costs. 
Of the 4 additional plant closures that we mentioned in the restructuring announcement in late December, one was in the residential segment. This operation was a fabric coating business that was formerly part of our fabricant carpet underlay group. Earlier restructuring activity in 2011 included the Canadian spring facility which was converted from manufacturing warehouse and 2 corporate underlay plants. We expect segment margins to benefit 2012 from the cost savings associated with these activities. 
In the Commercial Fixture and Components segment, fourth quarter sales decreased 4% from lower Fixture & Display volume, most of this decrease resulted from lower volume with brand product companies supplied by our point of purchase business. Sales in the Office Furniture components was essentially flat during the quarter, volume in this business continued to generally track the overall recovery in the Office Furniture industry. Growth rate slowed in the back half of 2011, as comparisons became more difficult, reflecting the acceleration of the industry's recovery in mid 2010. 
EBIT and EBIT margins in the Commercial Fixturing and Components segment decreased versus fourth quarter of 2010 comma primarily from lower Fixture & Display sales and production levels and higher inventory reserves. 
For the 4 plant closures that we mentioned in our December announcement comma one is in the commercial segment. We have begun the consolidation of one of our 6 remaining store fixtures and locations, the majority of the volume is expected to be retained and will be supplied through 2 of our remaining operations. This activity is expected to benefit 2012 margins and should be complete in the second quarter. 
In addition, consistent with our stated plan to continually assess our portfolio and exit non-core businesses, we divested our small U.K.-based point-of-purchase display operation in January 2012.
Moving on to the industrial segment. Fourth quarter sales increased 18% reflecting steel-related price inflation and higher trade sales through our steel mill. Unit volumes increased slightly in our wire drawing business but declined in steel tubing and fabricated wire products. EBIT decreased versus fourth quarter of 2010 primarily due to restructuring related costs. EBIT margins also decreased during the quarter comma as a result of the change in sales from inter-segment to trade at our steel rod mill. These trade sales have positive earnings contribution in addition to covering overhead costs, and have kept the mill running at full capacity, while internal demand for steel rod has been down. 
However, this sales shift is dilutive to margin percentages since it increases our reported sales while preserving comparable EBIT levels. 
The remaining 2 plant closures that we discussed in December are occurring in this segment. We closed 1 of our 6 domestic wire operations and consolidated that volume into 2 of the remaining plants. We are also closing a wire forming operation that was a supplier of coated wire dishwasher racks to the domestic appliance industry. These activities should improve capacity utilization within the segment in 2012 and benefit earnings and margins.
As Dave mentioned earlier, we completed the acquisition of Western Pneumatic Tube on January 12. This operation will become a stand-alone business unit in the Industrial Materials segment and with operating margins of above company average, it bolstered the segment's full-year EBIT margins in when 2012 .
In the Specialized Products segment, we posted 6% sales growth in the fourth quarter, with the increase coming from all parts of the segment. Automotive growth continued but in a more moderate 6% rate as prior year comparisons have become more challenging. EBIT and EBIT margins decreased during the quarter, higher sales contributed favorably to EBIT but the benefit was more than offset by impairment costs associated with the write-down of the specific patent. 
Automotive industry forecast anticipate continued growth in the global production rates in 2012 but the outlook varies by geography. North America and Asia have both expected to have meaningful production growth, the European forecasts are negative as economic concerns linger. 
With those comments, I'll turn the call back over to Dave."

The full-year revenue forecast assumes only modest improvement in the economy with no significant change from inflation, deflation or currency factors. We had to make some difficult and emotional decisions this past quarter. It is never easy to close facilities or reduce the number of employee partners, but it's a tough business environment and we've reacted accordingly. The changes we've made and the meaningful positive effects that they will have in our operations going forward are valuable to our entire shareholder base.

And Dave, you did tantalize us a bit with 2013 talking about the automotive project in the automotive projects, and I think the announcement on Western Pneumatic, you talked about significant accretion after 2012 as you go through some of the purchase accounting issues. Can you give us kind of a goalpost of what are the goalposts of 2012 in terms of negative 1% plus 5% and the operating margins that happened? Why do you have a negative 1? What has to happen there, what has to happen to get to plus 5 in the top line and in the bottom line? And what does 2013 look like?

We're very pleased to do that because the return on that investment is outstanding. But we wanted to kind of timing of that increased capital expenditure and the fact that it's probably or it will be 2013 whenever that incremental benefit comes to pass. So there wasn't a -- I wasn't trying to do anything other than just show that difference in time on capital expenditure. And with regard to Western, you're right, there is some purchase accounting that comes into play and that's a good thing. 2013 will see improved accretion as a result of that acquisition. I'm not in the position to try to quantify that for you except to say that the bias on EPS will be higher the next year and subsequent years. And then with regard to -- let me take the low end of the guidance if I may, let me apologize for jumbling around here, because we reckoned that question would come. And as we set around and put forth our best estimate of a range, we reminded ourselves of what happened in 2010. Namely, we came out of the gate pretty robustly, pretty strong and by midyear, we started to see some significant pullback in demand. We hope we're being conservative but we think we're being realistic that, that could happen. So that really talks to the lower end of that guidance. And then I read your notes this morning that you put out and I think you've done a good job of talking about what's going to call as, the EPS shift and specifically, margins and reduced fixed costs and higher volumes, certainly assist us, the restructuring benefits that I spoke about, that $0.07 to $0.10 certainly come to pass. A modest accretion in the first year here with Western and then those higher tax rates and interest expenses, we know those are going to happen and so we've gone ahead and put those into play. It gets us in that approximate $1.30, $1.32 range. And so we back in we $1.20, $1.40."

We believe today that the alternative sleep or specialty today how you define the terms is about 10% of total industry units, probably in the 25% to 30% range in dollars, big future expectation of how large it can get is difficult. Admittedly, that product sells at some ultra-premium price points. Until recently, almost all of $2,000 retail, that consumer certainly has been a more comfortable consumer allowing that business to grow significantly last year. I give a lot of credit to the people in that space, the temper Tempur-Pedics and and Select Comforts who've done a wonderful job and on the consumer and to the replacement cycle as opposed to the fulfillment replacement business that others have been doing. To give you an order magnitude though, I think that your statistics would tell us that Temper sales were about 618,000 units in 2011. Admittedly, to give you that magnitude though, and I don't want to be overly defensive, but that's about 3 average shipping weeks for us. So 90% of the market is still alive and well, servicing a consumer but has been less confident that the ultra-premium consumer. Now what we saw in the Las Vegas was a shift in that Tempur-Pedics along with some others specifically, have done a really good job of introducing new products that hit a target consumer north of the $1,000 cream and we believe that about 75% to 80% of sales are still below $1,000 that is very highly concentrated to an innerspring probably in the 90%, 80% range, don't know for sure. It's interesting in conversations with both Simmons and that they had done a lot of consumer market preference analysis and believe that the $1,000 price point and above, their own studies tell them that about 60% of consumers prefer an innerspring hybrid product that highly correlates to our own internal studies. That's why you saw Simmons focus on a hybrid product, that's why saw, obviously those 2 shares, the same dataset, introduce a hybrid, I series product.  Sealy, there's no secrets in the bedding industry, certainly introduced a beauty rest hybrid product. It becomes a definition of terms issue. We had some conversation with a manufacturer at the Las Vegas market and asked him how things were doing and he said business is great and I'm having hard time. So in innerspring what's your best-selling introduction and he described the hybrid product that has our innerspring in it but he called it specialty. So we need to understand the definition of the terms. We are really optimistic about the launch of the hybrid product offerings and what the support innerspring combined with some alternative and the sleeping mean for the consumer. The fact that a high percentage of those introductions contain our products is rewarding. Though we're bullish, but at the same time, we're looking forward to the day that, that consumer who is more price sensitive comes back into the market. We'll learn a lot over the next few months and as you know, the bedding demand cycle has changed a little bit. The biggest selling month store you go back in time were August and September. They're now February and March, highly correlated to tax refund season so we'll' see, it's a little bit too early to say what that demand will look like, but we're optimistic. Oh I'm sorry, the import issue. Go back in time, and you'll know that we filed an antidumping suit against the combination of South Africa and Vietnam believing that primarily China at that time and the others to a lesser degree, were dumping innersprings into the United States at lower than their cost of manufacture and lower than they were pricing their products in the domestic market. We then and today, produce innersprings in China, we're very confident of that filing, the U.S. government agreed with us, at its peak, we were experiencing about 3.5 million innerspring coming into this country with the benefit of that anti-dumping and sister counterbailing duty funding the were put on those innersprings at the high rate of 235% and we saw the importation of that dump product drop pretty significantly. And again, only in 2010, late 2009, we saw a spike in that product again, probably at the rate of 1 million pieces. So we've fixed 2/3 of it but, there's about 1 million pieces that we believe that we closely track that are shipped into this country illegally, that by transshipment, most of the point of origin was still in China and all that happens is shipping documents change hands and it looks up to the customs department that those products are produced in places like Malaysia and Singapore and Taiwan where there's not a big manufacturing  base of innersprings.  The reference that you made is that I did have the pleasure of testifying in front of a senate trade subcommittee in May of last year, making the folks in Washington aware of is that the legal transshipment. It's an nonpartisan issue but there is a charge job issue that we're losing jobs due to lack of enforcement of U.S. trade laws and continue to hear good things, but one thing that I'm sure of in Washington, is there is a propensity to point fingers in the other agency and to cut through the politics and the lack of action and the desire to enforce our laws but seemingly, the lack of ability is alarming. So as a U.S. taxpayer, we're certainly losing that revenue as the U.S. manufacturer is losing the ability to engage in increased job formation and we continue to pursue that, it's rewarding to hear talking heads, the politicians are all talking about fare trade, but little's being done so we'll continue to push."

We've used about $300 million of that as we speak, the overnight volume rate's about 30 basis points. So we're happy to have that in place, feel real good about that. We anticipate to continue to use that as a source of financing, and it's obviously quite inexpensive, all things considered. In January, which is when we bought Western too, that required about a $888 million check to arrive, so that's the spike in the balling that is taking place and we're glad it did so to make that acquisition come to pass and so that's directly correlated to some of the incremental expense we'll see on the interest line in 2012. We expect to pay that off significant during the year, which also directly correlates -- we do not anticipate to buy back shares if any at all, 2012. If you look at our rolling forward maturities, we have one coming around the corner in April of 2013, at $300 million, we expect to largely refinance most of that with an issuance later this year. That issuance will be about $200 million and again, when we see interest rates today, the coupon on that would be something without our swaps noted in the 3.5% to 4% range, once we our swaps it will be something still south of 5%, again if rates stay just where they are right now. And so when we anticipate refinancing some of the upcoming maturity debt just in a pragmatic fashion. So nothing on the debt side or the overall leverage should give any pause, in fact, quite the contrary, we would anticipate that our net dept to cap ratio which we often quote, would be near the end of the year about 30%, once again which is about where it was as we close 2011."

Yesterday, we reported fourth quarter and full year 2011 earnings. For the quarter, earnings were $0.06 per share and included $0.16 per share of costs associated with the restructuring activities",906,"Good morning, and thank you for participating in our call. Yesterday, we reported fourth quarter and full year 2011 earnings. For the quarter, earnings were $0.06 per share and included $0.16 per share of costs associated with the restructuring activities that we announced in late December. Earnings per share, excluding these costs, were $0.22 in the quarter. In the fourth quarter 2010, we are in $0.21 per share. Fourth quarter same location sales grew 6% versus the prior year partially from items that brought little incremental profit. Raw material-related price inflation and trade sales from our steel mill accounted for the bulk of the growth with unit volumes from our other businesses in total adding about 1% to sales. Earnings per share for the full year 2011 adjusted to exclude the fourth quarter restructuring related costs were $1.20 per share. In 2010, we earned $1.15 per share. The increase is primarily due to a lower share count, a lower effective tax rate and slightly higher sales partially offset by higher selling and administrative expense and other cost. Sales grew 8% in 2011 largely from inflation, currency rate changes and trade sales from our steel mill. 
Across the company as a whole, unit volume increased slightly. Demand improved in certain of our markets during 2011 with automotive and office furniture leading the way. In contrast, stagnant demand negatively impacted our major residential markets. Many consumers continued to postpone spending on larger ticket items such as bedding and furniture in the phase of ongoing weak economy. 
On the third quarter earnings call, we stated that our view of continuing demand weakness in certain of our markets and our plan to initiate actions that would yield improved ongoing profitability. In late December, we announced further restructuring which included the closure of 4 production facilities along with other cost reductions. These activities resulted in a $0.16 per share predominantly noncash charge to earnings during the fourth quarter. The restructuring-related activities that we initiated during 2011 in total should benefit 2012 earnings per share by approximately $0.07 to $0.10. 
We were very pleased to report in late December that we were acquiring Western Pneumatic Tube, a leading provider to the aerospace industry of integral components for critical aircraft systems. Our  strategic long-term 4% to 5% annual growth objective envisions periodic acquisitions of companies exactly like Western. High-quality businesses with secure leading positions in growing profitable, attractive markets and that makes sense to be part of Leggett & Platt. The acquisition was completed on January 12 and is expected to be slightly accretive to EPS in 2012 . 
Operating cash for the fourth quarter was $127 million, bringing the full year 2011 operating cash to $329 million. With concerns about weak markets, our operating folks continue to closely monitor the working capital levels.  We entered the year with working capital at 11.8% of annualized sales. Now current liabilities include approximately $30 million associated with an interest rate swap that we entered in 2010. 
Excluding this item, working capital was 12.7% of annualized sales, still well below our 15% target. In August, we increased the quarterly dividend by $0.01 to $0.28 per share reinforcing our commitment to consistent shareholder returns and our confidence in Leggett's strong cash generation. 
2011 marks our 40th consecutive year of annual dividend increases. Maintaining our dividend track record is very important to us.  Only 2 companies in the S&P 500 have a stronger string of annual increases at a higher growth rate than Leggett. 
For over 20 years, we have generated more than enough operating cash to fund both capital expenditures and dividends, and we expect that to be the case again in 2012. For the upcoming year, operating cash should exceed $300 million. Capital expenditures are expected to be about $100 million and dividend payment should approximate $160 million. 
We anticipate the increase in capital expenditures relates primarily to new automotive programs that we have been awarded and that should contribute meaningfully to earnings and cash flow beginning in 2013. 
During 2011, we continued purchasing our stock while maintaining our strong financial base. For the year, we repurchased 10 million shares. We also issued 3 million shares through various employee benefit and stock purchase programs. We ended the year with net debt at 29% of net capital, which is below our long-term targeted range of 30% to 40%. We expect to continue repurchasing our stock when we have excess cash flow, and we have an annual $10 million share authorization under which these purchases may be made. However, with the acquisition of Western Pneumatic Tube in mid-January and the resulting temporary increase in our net debt levels to about 35% of net capital, we may choose not to repurchase any shares during 2012. 
For the fourth consecutive year, Leggett & Platt's stock provided a better return to investors than did the S&P 500 index. We target total shareholder return in the top 1/3 of the S&P 500 over the long term, which we believe will require an average TSR of 12% to 15% per year. 
For the 3 years ending December 31, 2011, we generated an average annual Total Shareholder Return of 21% compared to 14% for the S&P 500 index. That places us in the top 38% of the S&P 500, just a bit shy of our goal. 
With those comments, I'll turn the call over to Karl Glassman who will provide some operating highlights. Karl?"

In my comments, I'll discuss a few segment highlights. You will find segment details in yesterday's press release and in the slide presentation on our website. Fourth quarter sales in the Residential Furnishings segment in",910,"Thank you, Dave. Good morning. In my comments, I'll discuss a few segment highlights. You will find segment details in yesterday's press release and in the slide presentation on our website. 
Fourth quarter sales in the Residential Furnishings segment increased 6% primarily from raw material-related price inflation. Unit volumes were up slightly. In our U.S. Spring business, innerspring unit volumes increased 4% and boxspring units increased 2% during the fourth quarter. The positive innerspring data primarily reflects our recovery of market share in 2011 that was temporarily lost to a European supplier in the back half of 2010. For the full year 2011, both innerspring and boxspring units were essentially flat. 
In our Furniture Hardware business, fourth quarter unit volume decreased 3% versus the prior year. While units were still negative in the quarter, the market has stabilized since mid-year and was showing some improved strength as the year came to a close. For the full year 2011, units were down 6%. 
Again this quarter, we had significant growth in adjustable beds with unit shipments up 35%. With our other major residential businesses flat or down in unit volume for the full year, this business was the bright spot in this segment. For the full year 2011, adjustable beds units grew 44%. 
EBIT and EBIT margins in the Residential Furnishings segment decreased versus the fourth quarter of 2010. The earnings benefit from slightly higher unit volumes was more than offset by higher restructuring-related costs. 
Of the 4 additional plant closures that we mentioned in the restructuring announcement in late December, 1 was in the residential segment. This operation was a fabric coating business that was formerly part of our Fabric and Carpet Underlay Group. Earlier, restructuring activity in 2011 included a Canadian spring facility, which was converted from manufacturing to warehouse, and 2 corporate underlay plants. We expect segment margins to benefit in 2012 from the cost savings associated with these activities. 
In the Commercial Fixturing & Components segment, fourth quarter sales decreased 4% from lower Fixture & Display volume. Most of this decrease resulted from lower volume with brand product companies supplied by our Point of Purchase business. Sales in the Office Furniture components was essentially flat during the quarter. Volume in this business continued to generally track the overall recovery in the office furniture industry. Growth rate slowed in the back half of 2011 as comparisons became more difficult, reflecting the acceleration of the industry's recovery in mid-2010. 
EBIT and EBIT margins in the Commercial Fixturing & Components segment decreased versus fourth quarter of 2010 comma primarily from lower Fixture & Display sales and production levels and higher inventory reserves. 
Of the 4 plant closures that we mentioned in our December announcement, 1 is in the commercial segment. We have begun the consolidation of 1 of our 6 remaining store fixtures locations. The majority of the volume is expected to be retained and will be supplied through 2 of our remaining operations. This activity is expected to benefit 2012 margins and should be complete in the second quarter. 
In addition, consistent with our stated plan to continually assess our portfolio and exit noncore businesses, we divested our small U.K.-based Point of Purchase display operation in January 2012.
Moving on to the industrial segment. Fourth quarter sales increased 18% reflecting steel-related price inflation and higher trade sales through our steel mill. Unit volumes increased slightly in our wire drawing business but declined in steel tubing and fabricated wire products. EBIT decreased versus fourth quarter of 2010 primarily due to restructuring-related costs. EBIT margins also decreased during the quarter as a result of a change in sales from intra-segment to trade at our steel rod mill. These trade sales have positive earnings contribution in addition to covering overhead costs and have kept the mill running at full capacity, while internal demand for steel rod has been down. 
However, this sales shift is dilutive to margin percentages since it increases our reported sales while preserving comparable EBIT levels. 
The remaining 2 plant closures that we discussed in December are occurring in this segment. We closed 1 of our 6 domestic wire drawing operations and consolidated that volume into 2 of the remaining plants. We are also closing a wire forming operation that was a supplier of coated wire dishwasher racks to the domestic appliance industry. These activities should improve capacity utilization within the segment in 2012 and benefit earnings and margins. 
As Dave mentioned earlier, we completed the acquisition of Western Pneumatic Tube on January 12. This operation will become a standalone business unit in the Industrial Materials segment. And with operating margins above company average, it bolstered the segment's full year EBIT margins in 2012.
In the Specialized Products segment, we posted 6% sales growth in the fourth quarter, with the increases coming from all parts of the segment. Automotive growth continued but in a more moderate 6% rate as prior year comparisons have become more challenging. EBIT and EBIT margins decreased during the quarter. Higher sales contributed favorably to EBIT, but the benefit was more than offset by impairment costs associated with the write-down of a specific patent. 
Automotive industry forecasts anticipate continued growth in the global production rates in 2012 but the outlook varies by geography. North America and Asia are both expected to have meaningful production growth, but European forecasts are negative as economic concerns linger. 
With those comments, I'll turn the call back over to Dave."

The full year revenue forecast assumes only modest improvement in the economy with no significant change from inflation, deflation or currency factors. We had to make some difficult and emotional decisions this past quarter. It is never easy to close facilities or reduce the number of employee partners, but it's a tough business environment and we've reacted accordingly. The changes we've made and the meaningful positive effects that they will have in our operations going forward are valuable to our entire shareholder base.

Can you give us kind of a goalpost of -- what are the goalposts of 2012 in terms of negative 1% plus 5% and the operating margins that happened? Why do you have a negative 1%? What has to happen there, what has to happen to get to plus 5% at the top line and then the bottom line? And then what does 2013 look like?

First of all, the reason I commented on the automotive business, the gestation period -- I think you know this, but the time it takes from conception through development, through quotation and then landing the business is significant and then there's quite a period of time for tooling and ultimate utilization of the product, and those are reasonably meaningful capital expenditures for us. We're very pleased to do that because the return on that investment is outstanding. But we wanted to kind of dovetail the timing of that increased capital expenditure and the fact that it's probably -- or it will be 2013 whenever that incremental benefit comes to pass. So there wasn't -- certainly wasn't trying to do anything other than just show that difference in time on capital expenditure. And with regard to Western, you're right, there's some purchase accounting that comes into play and that's a good thing. 2013 will see improved accretion as a result of that acquisition. I'm not in the position today to try to quantify that for you except to say that the bias on EPS will be higher the next year and subsequent years. And then with regard to -- let me take the low end of the guidance if I may -- and I apologize for jumping around here, because we reckoned that question would come. And as we sat around and put forth our best estimate of a range, we reminded ourselves of what happened in 2010. Namely, we came out of the gate pretty robustly, pretty strong and by mid-year, we started to see some significant pullback in demand. We hope we're being conservative, but we think we're being realistic that, that could happen. So that really talks -- that talks to the lower end of that guidance. And then I read your notes this morning that you put out and I think you've done a good job of talking about what's going to cause this EPS shift and specifically, margins and reduced fixed costs on higher volumes certainly assist us. The restructuring benefits that I spoke about, that $0.07 to $0.10 certainly going to come to pass. A modest accretion in the first year here with Western and then those higher tax rates and interest expense. As we know those are going to happen, and so we've gone ahead and put those into play. Stir that whole pat, it gets us in that approximate $1.30, $1.32 range. And so we bracketed $1.20, $1.40."

That's an excellent question, and really we're glad you asked that because part of the due diligence, in fact a meaningful part of the due diligence that we did in conjunction with this Western Pneumatic team, which incidentally they're an outstanding team of management and partners in general. But that diligence had to do with the customer concentration, the breadth of the product line and the duration of those products and the replication. They're very -- they're somewhat automotive-like and even longer their long-lived applications. And once you're able to be favored with that type of business, then the users of that product rarely will change suppliers over the life of the particular application. SO they're very long-lived. And so we gained a significant amount of comfort. And then of course, we're pleased to see the demand in global aircraft orders go up and certainly benefit from that."

I certainly feel that those that think that an innerspring is no longer part of a mattress didn't witness the Las Vegas market last week, didn't see the extreme proliferation of new innerspring designs, especially in hybrid placements. We feel good about the trend on innersprings. They were up in the fourth quarter. Innerspring sales in the January time frame are up about 7%. So we feel good about the trend, but today's earlier point, we're a little spooked by the head fake that we've experienced in the last couple of years with a strong start and a diminished back half. From a hardware standpoint, specific to furniture, that business was under greater pressure in 2011 than was bedding. We saw a trough in December months. Saw some recovery toward the end of the year with hardware units being up about 7% in December. Feel good about the trend, I cannot give you a January trend number on furniture because of the Asian aspect of that business. And as you all know that the Chinese holidays were in January this year versus February last, so I don't have meaningful comparisons. But we would expect for the full year flat to slightly unit positive in that business as well. All in the backdrop of, as you yourself witnessed, significant optimism and really positive feelings coming out of the Las Vegas market last week. But we continue to be concerned as our customers about the back half of the year, the cost of advertising, the probability of a very contentious selection. So we're guarded in our forecast."

We believe today that alternative sleep or specialty, depending on how you define the terms, is about 10% of total industry units, probably in the 25% to 30% range in dollars, big future expectation of how large it can get is difficult. Admittedly, that product sells at some ultra-premium price points. Until recently, almost all above $2,000 at queen retail. That consumer certainly has been a more comfortable consumer allowing that business to grow significantly last year. Give a lot of credit to the people in that space, the Tempur-Pedics and Select Comforts who've done a wonderful job at pulling the consumer into the replacement cycle as opposed to the fulfillment replacement business that others have been doing. To give you an order magnitude though, I think that your statistics would tell us that Tempur sales were about 618,000 units in 2011. Admittedly, great growth. To give you that magnitude though, and I don't want to be overly defensive, but that's about 3 average shipping weeks for us. So 90% of the market is still alive and well, servicing a consumer that has been less confident than the ultra-premium consumer. Now what we saw in Las Vegas was a shift in that Tempur-Pedic along with some others specifically, Serta, have done a really good job of introducing new products that hit a target consumer north of the $1,000 queen. And we believe that about 75% to 80% of sales are still below $1,000 at queen, that is very highly concentrated to an innerspring probably in the 90%, 80% range, don't know for sure. It's interesting in conversations with both Simmons and that they have done a lot of consumer market preference analysis and believe that the $1,000 price point and above -- their own studies tell them that about 60% of consumers prefer an innerspring hybrid product that highly correlates to our own internal studies. That's why you saw Simmons focused on a hybrid product, that's why you saw Serta, obviously, those 2 share the same dataset, introduce a hybrid, hy [ph] series product. Sealy, there's no secrets in the bedding industry, certainly introduced a beauty rest hybrid product. It becomes a definition of terms issue. We had some conversation with a manufacturer at the Las Vegas market and asked him how things were doing and he said, ""Business is great. I'm having hard time selling innersprings."" And we said, well, what's your best-selling introduction and he described the hybrid product that has our innerspring in it but he called it specialty. So we need to understand the definition of the terms. We are really optimistic about the launch of the hybrid product offerings and what the support of an innerspring combined with some alternative materials and the sleeping surface mean for the consumer. The fact that a high percentage of those introductions contain our products is rewarding. So we're bullish, at the same time that we're looking forward to the day that, that consumer that is more price sensitive comes back into the market. We'll learn a lot over the next few months. And as you know, the bedding demand cycle has changed a little bit. The biggest selling months historically going back in time were August, September. They're now February and March, highly correlated to tax refund season, so we'll' see. It's a little bit too early to say what that demand will look like, but we're optimistic."

Go way back in time that you'll know that we filed an antidumping suit against the combination of China, South Africa and Vietnam believing that primarily China at that time and the others to a lesser degree, were dumping innersprings into the United States at lower than their cost of manufacture and lower than they were pricing their products in the domestic market. We then and today produce innersprings in China. We are very confident of that filing. The U.S. government agreed with us. At its peak, we were experiencing about 3.5 million innersprings coming into this country with the benefit of that antidumping and sister countervailing duty finding that new tariffs were put on those innersprings at the high rate of 235%, and we saw that the importation of that dumped product drop pretty significantly. Then again, early 2010, late 2009, we saw a spike in that product again, probably at the rate of 1 million pieces. So we've fixed 2/3 of it, but there's about 1 million pieces that we believe that we closely track that are shipped into this country illegally, that by a transshipment, most of the point of origin is still China and all that happens is shipping documents change hands, and it looks up to the customs department that those products are produced in places like Malaysia and Singapore and Taiwan where there's not a big manufacturing base of innersprings. The reference that you made is that I did have the pleasure of testifying in front of a Senate trade subcommittee in May of last year, making the folks in Washington aware of that illegal transshipment. It's a nonpartisan issue, and that it's a jobs issue that we're losing jobs through the lack of enforcement of U.S. trade laws. And we continue to fight -- we hear good things, but one thing that I'm sure of in Washington is there is a propensity to point fingers at the other agency and to cut through the politics and the lack of inaction and the desire to enforce our laws, but seemingly the lack of ability is alarming. So as a U.S. taxpayer, we're certainly losing that revenue as a U.S. manufacturer is losing the ability to engage in increased job formation, and we continue to pursue that. It's rewarding to hear the talking heads, the politicians all talk about fair trade, but little is being done, so we'll continue to push."

We anticipate to continue to use that as a source of financing, and it's obviously quite inexpensive, all things considered. In January, which is when we bought Western, too, that required about $188 million check to write. So that's the spike in the borrowing that has taken place, and we're glad it did so to make an acquisition come to pass. And so that will -- that's directly correlated to some of the incremental expense we will see on the interest line in 2012. We expect to pay that off significantly during the year, which also directly correlates [indiscernible] we do not anticipate to buy back many shares, if any at all, in 2012. If you look at our rolling forward maturities, we do have 1 coming around the corner in April of 2013 at $300 million. We expect to largely refinance most of that with an issuance later this year. That issuance will be about $200 million. And again, where we see interest rates today, the coupon on that would be something without our swaps noted in the 3.5% to 4% range. Once we factor in our swap, it will be something still south of 5%, again if rates stay just where they are right now. And so we would anticipate refinancing some of the upcoming maturity debt just in a pragmatic fashion. So nothing on the debt side or the overall leverage should give anybody pause. In fact, quite the contrary, we would anticipate that our net debt to cap ratio, which we often quote, would be near the end of the year about 30%, once again which is about where it was as we close 2011."

Yesterday, we reported fourth quarter and full year 2011 earnings. For the quarter, earnings were $0.06 per share and included $0.16 per share of costs associated with the restructuring activities",904,"Good morning, and thank you for participating in our call. Yesterday, we reported fourth quarter and full year 2011 earnings. For the quarter, earnings were $0.06 per share and included $0.16 per share of costs associated with the restructuring activities that we announced in late December. Earnings per share, excluding these costs, were $0.22 in the quarter. In the fourth quarter 2010, we earned $0.21 per share. Fourth quarter same location sales grew 6% versus the prior year largely from items that brought little incremental profit. Raw material-related price inflation and trade sales from our steel mill accounted for the bulk of the growth with unit volumes from our other businesses in total adding about 1% to sales. Earnings per share for the full year 2011 adjusted to exclude the fourth quarter restructuring related costs were $1.20 per share. In 2010, we earned $1.15 per share. The increase is primarily due to a lower share count, a lower effective tax rate and slightly higher sales partially offset by higher selling and administrative expense and other costs. Sales grew 8% in 2011 largely from inflation, currency rate changes and trade sales from our steel mill. 
Across the company as a whole, unit volume increased slightly. Demand improved in certain of our markets during 2011 with automotive and office furniture leading the way. In contrast, stagnant demand negatively impacted our major residential markets. Many consumers continued to postpone spending on larger ticket items such as bedding and furniture in the phase of ongoing weak economy. 
On the third quarter earnings call, we stated that our view of continuing demand weakness in certain of our markets and our plan to initiate actions that would yield improved ongoing profitability. In late December, we announced further restructuring which included the closure of 4 production facilities along with other cost reductions. These activities resulted in a $0.16 per share, predominantly noncash charge to earnings during the fourth quarter. The restructuring-related activities that we initiated during 2011 in total should benefit 2012 earnings per share by approximately $0.07 to $0.10. 
We were very pleased to report in late December that we were acquiring Western Pneumatic Tube, a leading provider to the aerospace industry of integral components for critical aircraft systems. Our  strategic long-term 4% to 5% annual growth objective envisions periodic acquisitions of companies exactly like Western. High-quality businesses with secure leading positions in growing, profitable, attractive markets and that makes sense to be part of Leggett & Platt. The acquisition was completed on January 12 and is expected to be slightly accretive to EPS in 2012.
Operating cash for the fourth quarter was $127 million, bringing the full year 2011 operating cash to $329 million. With concerns about weak markets, our operating folks continue to closely monitor the working capital levels.  We ended the year with working capital at 11.8% of annualized sales. Now current liabilities include approximately $30 million associated with an interest rate swap that we entered in 2010. 
Excluding this item, working capital was 12.7% of annualized sales, still well below our 15% target. In August, we increased the quarterly dividend by $0.01 to $0.28 per share reinforcing our commitment to consistent shareholder returns and our confidence in Leggett's strong cash generation. 
2011 marks our 40th consecutive year of annual dividend increases. Maintaining our dividend track record is very important to us. Only 2 companies in the S&P 500 have a stronger string of annual increases at a higher growth rate than Leggett. 
For over 20 years, we have generated more than enough operating cash to fund both capital expenditures and dividends, and we expect that to be the case again in 2012. For the upcoming year, operating cash should exceed $300 million. Capital expenditures are expected to be about $100 million and dividend payment should approximate $160 million. 
We anticipate the increase in capital expenditures relates primarily to new automotive programs that we have been awarded and that should contribute meaningfully to earnings and cash flow beginning in 2013. 
During 2011, we continued purchasing our stock while maintaining our strong financial base. For the year, we repurchased 10 million shares. We also issued 3 million shares through various employee benefit and stock purchase programs. We ended the year with net debt at 29% of net capital, which is below our long-term targeted range of 30% to 40%. We expect to continue repurchasing our stock when we have excess cash flow, and we have an annual $10 million share authorization under which these purchases may be made. However, with the acquisition of Western Pneumatic Tube in mid-January and the resulting temporary increase in our net debt levels to about 35% of net capital, we may choose not to repurchase any shares during 2012. 
For the fourth consecutive year, Leggett & Platt's stock provided a better return to investors than did the S&P 500 index. We target total shareholder return in the top 1/3 of the S&P 500 over the long term, which we believe will require an average TSR of 12% to 15% per year. 
For the 3 years ending December 31, 2011, we generated an average annual Total Shareholder Return of 21% compared to 14% for the S&P 500 index. That places us in the top 38% of the S&P 500, just a bit shy of our goal. 
With those comments, I'll turn the call over to Karl Glassman who will provide some operating highlights. Karl?"

In my comments, I'll discuss a few segment highlights. You will find segment details in yesterday's press release and in the slide presentation on our website. Fourth quarter sales in the Residential Furnishings segment in",908,"Thank you, Dave. Good morning. In my comments, I'll discuss a few segment highlights. You will find segment details in yesterday's press release and in the slide presentation on our website. 
Fourth quarter sales in the Residential Furnishings segment increased 6% primarily from raw material-related price inflation. Unit volumes were up slightly. In our U.S. Spring business, innerspring unit volumes increased 4% and boxspring units increased 2% during the fourth quarter. The positive innerspring data primarily reflects our recovery of market share in 2011 that was temporarily lost to a European supplier in the back half of 2010. For the full year 2011, both innerspring and boxspring units were essentially flat. 
In our Furniture Hardware business, fourth quarter unit volume decreased 3% versus the prior year. While units were still negative in the quarter, the market has stabilized since mid-year and was showing some improved strength as the year came to a close. For the full year 2011, units were down 6%. 
Again this quarter, we had significant growth in adjustable beds with unit shipments up 35%. With our other major residential businesses flat or down in unit volume for the full year, this business was the bright spot in this segment. For the full year 2011, adjustable beds units grew 44%. 
EBIT and EBIT margins in the Residential Furnishings segment decreased versus the fourth quarter of 2010. The earnings benefit from slightly higher unit volumes was more than offset by higher restructuring-related costs. 
Of the 4 additional plant closures that we mentioned in the restructuring announcement in late December, one was in the residential segment. This operation was a fabric coating business that was formerly part of our Fabric and Carpet Underlay Group. Earlier, restructuring activity in 2011 included a Canadian spring facility, which was converted from manufacturing to warehouse, and 2 carpet underlay plants. We expect segment margins to benefit in 2012 from the cost savings associated with these activities. 
In the Commercial Fixturing & Components segment, fourth quarter sales decreased 4% from lower Fixture & Display volume. Most of this decrease resulted from lower volume with brand product companies supplied by our Point of Purchase business. Sales in the Office Furniture components was essentially flat during the quarter. Volume in this business continued to generally track the overall recovery in the office furniture industry. Growth rate slowed in the back half of 2011 as comparisons became more difficult, reflecting the acceleration of the industry's recovery in mid-2010. 
EBIT and EBIT margins in the Commercial Fixturing & Components segment decreased versus fourth quarter of 2010, primarily from lower Fixture & Display sales and production levels and higher inventory reserves. 
Of the 4 plant closures that we mentioned in our December announcement, one is in the commercial segment. We have begun the consolidation of 1 of our 6 remaining store fixtures locations. The majority of the volume is expected to be retained and will be supplied through 2 of our remaining operations. This activity is expected to benefit 2012 margins and should be complete in the second quarter. 
In addition, consistent with our stated plan to continually assess our portfolio and exit non-core businesses, we divested our small U.K.-based Point of Purchase display operation in January 2012.
Moving on to the industrial segment. Fourth quarter sales increased 18% reflecting steel-related price inflation and higher trade sales through our steel mill. Unit volumes increased slightly in our wire drawing business but declined in steel tubing and fabricated wire products. EBIT decreased versus fourth quarter of 2010 primarily due to restructuring-related costs. EBIT margins also decreased during the quarter as a result of a change in sales from intra-segment to trade at our steel rod mill. These trade sales have positive earnings contribution in addition to covering overhead costs and have kept the mill running at full capacity, while internal demand for steel rod has been down. 
However, this sales shift is dilutive to margin percentages since it increases our reported sales while preserving comparable EBIT levels. 
The remaining 2 plant closures that we discussed in December are occurring in this segment. We closed 1 of our 6 domestic wire drawing operations and consolidated that volume into 2 of the remaining plants. We are also closing a wire forming operation that was a supplier of coated wire dishwasher racks to the domestic appliance industry. These activities should improve capacity utilization within the segment in 2012 and benefit earnings and margins. 
As Dave mentioned earlier, we completed the acquisition of Western Pneumatic Tube on January 12. This operation will become a standalone business unit in the Industrial Materials segment. And with operating margins above company average, it bolstered the segment's full year EBIT margins in 2012.
In the Specialized Products segment, we posted 6% sales growth in the fourth quarter, with increases coming from all parts of the segment. Automotive growth continued but in a more moderate 6% rate as prior year comparisons have become more challenging. EBIT and EBIT margins decreased during the quarter. Higher sales contributed favorably to EBIT, but the benefit was more than offset by impairment costs associated with the write-down of a specific patent. 
Automotive industry forecasts anticipate continued growth in the global production rates in 2012 but the outlook varies by geography. North America and Asia are both expected to have meaningful production growth, but European forecasts are negative as economic concerns linger. 
With those comments, I'll turn the call back over to Dave."

The full year revenue forecast assumes only modest improvement in the economy with no significant change from inflation, deflation or currency factors. We had to make some difficult and emotional decisions this past quarter. It is never easy to close facilities or reduce the number of employee partners, but it's a tough business environment and we've reacted accordingly. The changes we've made and the meaningful positive effects that they will have in our operations going forward are valuable to our entire shareholder base. We are leaner than we've been for many years and are in great shape to benefit from improved demand.

What has to happen there, what has to happen to get to plus 5% at the top line and then the bottom line? And then what does 2013 look like?

First of all, the reason I commented on the automotive business, the gestation period -- I think you know this, but the time it takes from conception through development, through quotation and then landing the business is significant and then there's quite a period of time for tooling and ultimate utilization of the product, and those are reasonably meaningful capital expenditures for us. We're very pleased to do that because the return on that investment is outstanding. But we wanted to kind of dovetail the timing of that increased capital expenditure and the fact that it's probably -- or it will be 2013 whenever that incremental benefit comes to pass. So there wasn't -- certainly wasn't trying to do anything other than just show that difference in timing on capital expenditure. And with regard to Western, you're right, there's some purchase accounting that comes into play and that's a good thing. 2013 will see improved accretion as a result of that acquisition. I'm not in a position today to try to quantify that for you except to say that the bias on EPS will be higher the next year and subsequent years. And then with regard to -- let me take the low end of the guidance if I may Budd -- and I apologize for jumping around here, because we reckoned that question would come. And as we sat around and put forth our best estimate of a range, we reminded ourselves of what happened in 2010. Namely, we came out of the gate pretty robustly, pretty strong and by mid-year, we started to see some significant pullback in demand. We hope we're being conservative, but we think we're being realistic that, that could happen. So that really talks -- that talks to the lower end of that guidance. And then I read your notes this morning that you put out and I think you've done a good job of talking about what's going to cause this EPS shift and specifically, margins and reduced fixed costs on higher volumes certainly assist us. The restructuring benefits that I spoke about, that $0.07 to $0.10 certainly going to come to pass. A modest accretion in the first year here with Western and then those higher tax rates and interest expenses. As we know those are going to happen, and so we've gone ahead and put those into play. Stir that whole pot, it gets us in that approximate $1.30, $1.32 range. And so we bracketed $1.20, $1.40."

That's an excellent question, and really we're glad you asked that because part of the due diligence, in fact a meaningful part of the due diligence that we did in conjunction with this Western Pneumatic team, which incidentally they're an outstanding team of management and partners in general. But that diligence had to do with the customer concentration, the breadth of the product line and the duration of those products and their application. They're very -- they're somewhat automotive-like and even longer their long-lived applications. And once you're able to be favored with that type of business, then the users of that product rarely will change suppliers over the life of that particular application. SO they're very long-lived. And so we gained a significant amount of comfort. And then of course, we're pleased to see the demand in global aircraft orders go up and certainly benefit from that."

They also -- and they incorporate all the specialty space, so some people would say our innerspring growth forecast may be bullish. I certainly feel that those that think that an innerspring is no longer part of a mattress didn't witness the Las Vegas market last week, didn't see the extreme proliferation of new innerspring designs, especially in hybrid placements. We feel good about the trend on innersprings. They were up in the fourth quarter. Innerspring sales in the January timeframe are up about 7%. So we feel good about the trend, but today's earlier point, we're a little spooked by the head fake that we've experienced in the last couple of years with a strong start and a diminished back half. From a hardware standpoint, specific to furniture, that business was under greater pressure in 2011 than was bedding. We saw a trough in the summer months. Saw some recovery toward the end of the year with hardware units being up about 7% in December. Feel good about the trend, I cannot give you a January trend number on furniture because of the Asian aspect of that business. And as you all know that the Chinese holidays were in January this year versus February last, so I don't have meaningful comparisons. But we would expect for the full year flat to slightly unit positive in that business as well.

We believe today that alternative sleep or specialty, depending on how you define the terms, is about 10% of total industry units, probably in the 25% to 30% range in dollars, big future expectation of how large it can get is difficult. Admittedly, that product sells at some ultra-premium price points. Until recently, almost all above $2,000 at queen retail. That consumer certainly has been a more comfortable consumer allowing that business to grow significantly last year. Give a lot of credit to the people in that space, the Tempur-Pedics and Select Comforts who've done a wonderful job at pulling the consumer into the replacement cycle as opposed to the fulfillment replacement business that others have been doing. To give you an order magnitude though, I think that your statistics would tell us that Tempur sales were about 618,000 units in 2011. Admittedly, great growth. To give you that magnitude though, and I don't want to be overly defensive, but that's about 3 average shipping weeks for us. So 90% of the market is still alive and well, servicing a consumer that has been less confident than the ultra-premium consumer. Now what we saw in Las Vegas was a shift in that Tempur-Pedic along with some others specifically, Serta, have done a really good job of introducing new products that hit a target customer north of the $1,000 queen. And we believe that about 75% to 80% of sales are still below $1,000 at queen, that is very highly concentrated to an innerspring probably in the 98% range, don't know for sure. It's interesting in conversations with both Simmons and that they have done a lot of consumer market preference analysis and believe that at the $1,000 price point and above -- their own studies tell them that about 60% of consumers prefer an innerspring hybrid product that highly correlates to our own internal studies. That's why you saw Simmons focused on a hybrid product, that's why you saw Serta, obviously, those 2 share the same dataset, introduce a hybrid, hy [ph] series product. Sealy, there's no secrets in the bedding industry, certainly introduced a beauty rest hybrid product. It becomes a definition of terms issue. We had some conversation with a manufacturer at the Las Vegas market and asked him how things were doing and he said, ""Business is great. I'm having hard time selling innersprings."" And we said, well, what's your best-selling introduction and he described the hybrid product that has our innerspring in it but he called it specialty. So we need to understand the definition of the terms. We are really optimistic about the launch of the hybrid product offerings and what the support of an innerspring combined with some alternative materials and the sleeping surface mean for the consumer. The fact that a high percentage of those introductions contain our products is rewarding. So we're bullish, at the same time that we're looking forward to the day that, that consumer that is more price sensitive comes back into the market. We'll learn a lot over the next few months. And as you know, the bedding demand cycle has changed a little bit. The biggest selling months historically going back in time were August, September. They're now February and March, highly correlated to tax refund season, so we'll see. It's a little bit too early to say what that demand will look like, but we're optimistic."

Go way back in time that you'll know that we filed an antidumping suit against the combination of China, South Africa and Vietnam believing that primarily China at that time and the others to a lesser degree, were dumping innersprings into the United States at lower than their cost of manufacture and lower than they were pricing their products in the domestic market. We then and today produce innersprings in China. We are very confident of that filing. The U.S. government agreed with us. At its peak, we were experiencing about 3.5 million innersprings coming into this country with the benefit of that antidumping and sister countervailing duty finding that new tariffs were put on those innersprings at the high rate of 235%, and we saw that the importation of that dumped product drop pretty significantly. Then again, early 2010, late 2009, we saw a spike in that product again, probably at the rate of 1 million pieces. So we've fixed 2/3 of it, but there's about 1 million pieces that we believe that we closely track that are shipped into this country illegally, that by a transshipment, most of the point of origin is still China and all that happens is shipping documents change hands, and it looks on to the customs department that those products are produced in places like Malaysia and Singapore and Taiwan where there's not a big manufacturing base of innersprings. The reference that you made is that I did have the pleasure of testifying in front of a Senate trade subcommittee in May of last year, making the folks in Washington aware of that illegal transshipment. It's a nonpartisan issue, in that it's a jobs issue that we're losing jobs through the lack of enforcement of U.S. trade laws. And we continue to fight -- we hear good things, but one thing that I'm sure of in Washington is there is a propensity to point fingers at the other agency and to cut through the politics and the lack of inaction and the desire to enforce our laws, but seemingly the lack of ability is alarming. So as a U.S. taxpayer, we're certainly losing that revenue as a U.S. manufacturer is losing the ability to engage in increased job formation, and we continue to pursue that. It's rewarding to hear the talking heads, the politicians all talk about fair trade, but little is being done, so we'll continue to push."

We anticipate to continue to use that as a source of financing, and it's obviously quite inexpensive, all things considered. In January, which is when we bought Western, too, that required about $188 million check to write. So that's the spike in the borrowing that has taken place, and we're glad it did so to make an acquisition come to pass. And so that will -- that's directly correlated to some of the incremental expense we will see on the interest line in 2012. We expect to pay that off significantly during the year, which also directly correlates [indiscernible] we do not anticipate to buy back many shares, if any at all, in 2012. If you look at our rolling forward maturities, we do have one coming around the corner in April of 2013 at $300 million. We expect to largely refinance most of that with an issuance later this year. That issuance will be about $200 million. And again, where we see interest rates today, the coupon on that would be something without our swaps noted in the 3.5% to 4% range. Once we factor in our swap, it will be something still south of 5%, again if rates stay just where they are right now. And so we would anticipate refinancing some of the upcoming maturity debt just in a pragmatic fashion. So nothing on the debt side or the overall leverage should give anybody pause. In fact, quite the contrary, we would anticipate that our net debt to cap ratio, which we often quote, would be near the end of the year about 30%, once again which is about where it was as we closed 2011."

We were pleased with first quarter results we reported yesterday. First quarter same-location sales increased 4.5% versus a relatively strong first quarter of 2011, reflecting a combination of unit volume growth and raw material related price inflation. Volume trends were mixed across our businesses. We saw volume gains in automotive and office components, as well as in U.S. spring adjustable beds and other parts of the Residential segment. The most notable volume declines occurred in and store fixtures, furniture hardware and commercial vehicle products. 
Earnings per share for the quarter were $0.30, unchanged from the first quarter of 2011. In last year's first quarter, we had a $0.03 per share benefit from unusual items including gains from building sales that did not recur in 2012. Current quarter earnings benefited from higher unit volumes. We are also realizing the expected earnings benefits from the restructuring activities we initiated in late 2011. The strategically attractive Western Pneumatic Tube acquisition that we competed in January is exceeding our expectation for strong operating performance. 
In the first half of this year, we were recognized $6 million of charges, half of this in the first quarter. From an acquisition-related fair value adjustment to inventory, these charges will not repeat in the back half of this year, so we expect Western's earnings to improve as the year progresses. 
Our operating folks continue to do an excellent job of closely managing working capital reflecting our focus on return optimization. We ended the quarter with working capital at 12.3% of annualized sales. Current liabilities include approximately $28 million, associated with an interest rate swap that we entered in 2010. If you exclude that item, working capital was 13% of annualized sales, still well below our 15% target. Cash from operations was strong during the quarter at $65 million. We expect operating cash for the full year of over $325 million, which should once again comfortably exceed the amount required to fund capital expenditures and dividends. 
Capital expenditures should be approximately $100 million this year and dividends should require about $160 million. We have maintained our strong financial base and ended the first quarter with net debt at 34% of net capital, which is within our long-term targeted range of 30% to 40%.
In February, we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.28 per share and extended to 41 years our record of consecutive annual dividend increases. At yesterday's closing price of $23.67, the current dividend yield is 4.7%. Given the cash outlay to acquire Western Pneumatic Tube, we did not complete any open market purchases of our stock during the first quarter. However, consistent with our stated priorities for use of excess cash flow, we expect eventually to resume buying back our stock subject to the outlook of the economy, our level of cash generation and other potential opportunities to grow the company. For the full year, with strong cash generation, we expect to repurchase some number of our shares but have established the specific purchase commitment or timetable. We have a standing authorization from our board to repurchase up to 10 million shares each year. 
We assess our overall performance by comparing our Total Shareholder Return to that of peer companies on a rolling 3-year basis. Our target is to achieve TSR in the top 1/3 of the S&P 500 over the long term, which we believe will would require an average TSR of 12% to 15% per year. For the 3-year period that began January 1, 2010, we have so far generated TSR of 12% per year on average, which matches the return of the S&P 500 index over that same time period. So with those comments, I'll turn the call over to Karl Glassman will provide some operating highlights. Karl?"

You will find segment details in yesterday's press release and in the slide presentation on our website. First quarter, same-location sales and Residential Furnishings segment increased 7% from a combination of unit volume growth and raw material related price inflation. In our U.S. Spring business, innerspring unit volumes increased 3% and boxspring units were flat. In our Furniture Hardware business, unit volume decreased 10% versus the prior year. Again this quarter, we had significant growth in adjustable beds with unit shipments of the 48%. 
Sales also grew in carpet underlay, GO components and consumer products. EBIT and EBIT margins in the segment decreased versus the first quarter last year, primarily from the absence of a gain from a building sale that occurred in early 2011. The earnings benefit from slightly higher unit volumes in the current quarter was partially offset by raw material inflation and a less favorable sales mix. 
In the Commercial Fixturing and Component segment, first quarter same location sales decreased 8% from lower Fixture & Display volume. This decrease resulted in a large part from lower spending by a single large value-oriented retailer. Sales in Office Furniture components increased slightly during the quarter. Volume in this business continues to generally track the overall recovery in the office furniture industry. EBIT and EBIT margins in the segment decreased slightly versus first quarter of 2011, primarily from the absence of a gain from a building sale that occurred early last year. The earnings impact from lower sales in the current quarter was more than offset by a gain from the sale of our U.K. based Point of Purchase business in January, benefits from restructuring activity and other cost savings. 
In the industrial Materials segment, first quarter same location sales increased 6% with growth from steel related price inflation slightly offset by union volume declines. Overall unit volumes were lower, led by a decrease in shipments of wire and rod. EBIT decreased in the quarter primarily due to a $2 million acquisition related fair value adjustment inventory. Earnings benefits from the recently completed acquisition and the plank consolidations announced in late 2011 were largely offset in the quarter by lower unit volumes and unusually higher workers compensation expense. 
EBIT margins were further compressed by the inflation driven sales increase as this revenue growth brought little incremental profit. As Dave mentioned earlier, the Western Pneumatic Tube acquisition, which resides in the Industrial Materials segment, is exceeding our performance expectations. We continue to expect this business to produce full-year 2012 margins greater than the company average. First and second quarters results will reflect approximately $3 million of charges from acquisition-related fair value adjustments.  Since those charges do not repeat, segment margin should improve appreciably in the back half of the year. 
In the Specialized Products segment, first quarter sales increased 6% entirely from growth on automotive. Machinery sales were down slightly in the quarter and commercial vehicle product sales were up significantly compared to first quarter of last year. EBIT was flat and EBIT margins decreased during the quarter. Higher sales and the non-recurrence of last year's impairment charges contributed favorably to EBIT, but these improvements were offset by several items including higher raw material cost, litigation reserves, less favorable sales mix and higher R&D spending. 
Automotive industry forecast anticipate continued growth in global production rates in 2012. But the outlook varies by geography. North America and Asia are both expected to have meaningful production growth, but European forecast are negative as economic concerns linger. WI think those comments, I'll turn the call back to Dave."

We are also increasing our full-year guidance, sales guidance, that is, to $3.65 to $3.85 billion, which is up from our previous range of $3.6 billion to $3.8 billion. We continue to expect the restructuring related activities that we initiated in 2011, in total, to have $0.07 to $0.10 per share to our 2012 earnings. We also anticipate the Western Pneumatic Tube acquisition to be modestly accretive to the full year's earnings here in its first year. These improvements are largely offset by a higher anticipated full-year effective tax rate and interest expense, which negatively impact earnings by approximately $0.10 per share, $0.08 of that for the tax rate and $0.02 for interest.

As you inferred, the quarterly results were released not before last. And while we believe that the results were a good barometer of change from a sequential movement standpoint, that as you infer that they only captured 65% of the industry units. So I believe, we believe, that January and February results were probably overstated and the March results were a catch up. As are -- as we state, our innerspring units were up 3%, we think that, that is an inappropriate reflection of the industry. The ISPA statistics show that March and those things were up 9.4% in units. Our experience was a couple percent off. We believe that as a better barometer of the macro industry. So I don't think investors should view the March ISPA results as falling off a Cliff, we know that, that in fact didn't happen. But we do think that it's a normalization of the stronger than probably was accurate January and February results. Now I want to make it clear, I am not in any way taking an issue with ISPA.

You should see an expansion in margins, that we had an abnormally the mix and the first quarter with furniture hardware sales off 10%. And if you'll allow me, I'd like to speak to that very issue for just a second. From a headline perspective, that may look pretty negative as it does, but our first quarter experience was pretty choppy and that the December sales of furniture hardware were actually up 7.5%. They were up 12% from our international locations. We believe there was a significant pull forward by our customers because of an unusually early Chinese New Year. So we saw a pull forward into December of 2011 that January of 2012 experience was particularly negative with Unisom 30%. Remembering that Chinese New Year was in January this year, February last. And sort through the whole thing, we ended up experiencing down 10%. Oddly, or I guess appreciatively, that units gains were up 3% March. So it wasn't a train wreck from a full disclosure perspective, I do want to make comment that we have lost a little bit of market share in furniture hardware to a Chinese-based finished furniture manufacturer that does make some of their lower value mechanisms. We believe that, that is completed or that exposure is behind us. All of the pickup in March. So that mix of negative hardware is negative to us in the first quarter while we very much appreciate a pick up in corporate units, which was up about 6% to 7%. And a pickup in new component sales. Those two had lower contribution margins than furniture in total. So certainly, a negative mix in the first quarter that we don't expect to continue. In addition, we're in the process of passing through some price increases, particularly in the U.S. Spring market based on some inflation, some January steel inflation that ran through the quarter. And obviously, some inflation in fuel costs. So we believe the second quarter will have a good bit of that through the system and the pull through the system by the first day of the third quarter."

We expect that mix based on some larger customers introductions that appear to be very successfully implemented and well received in the market that, that mix with a few.

And that continues. So we continue to enjoy a very good relationship with them, they continue to remodel but at a slower pace and we expect that they will continue to at a slower pace through this year until they figure out what their strategy from a long-term go-forward is. We're very well placed with them. Certainly, have a good relationship and they're doing well in the marketplace. But what you should expect is a strong third quarter in store fixtures because of our position gained with some other retailers. You will remember, John, that the third quarter historically had been the strongest selling season for store fixtures as those retailers position themselves for the holiday selling season.

If we go back to when we first discussed that $2 a share concept and the assumptions used in that concept, it certainly is something that we're comfortable with and the assumptions occurred. And we didn't anticipate that we'd see this sort of economic downturn. That could come across as an excuse. I certainly don't mean it that way. We still have a significant, very significant amount of earnings power in the company, and especially when you take a look at our production capacity utilizations, which are up incidentally this first quarter. We're pleased to see that almost across the board in the various units. But what it's going to take is increased demand capacity, utilization. The concept or the leverage that, that incremental volume has is still real. In some cases, the leverage is, starts with a 4 handle, it has a 40% impact. In some cases, it's 18%, 19%, but on average, we still feel comfortable with that 25% to 30%, 35% leverage, Budd.  And so, when it happened? It to be a function of when demand continues, when the demand reaches the level that provides us the capacity utilizations that we want and need to get there. I don't know how to predict that. I know that if we say, if we just threw our revenue number out, it's challenging because we don't know how much inflation or deflation may come into that. I'm still very comfortable as a shareholder and as part of the management team here that we will be able to continue to reduce our payout ratio going forward, and ultimately, get into that range of 50% to 60% payout ratio. I know it's frustrating for certain investors. We're very comfortable that we'll be able to achieve that. We just need the demand. And like I said, I don't want to get too optimistic, but the first quarter, I'm looking at the production capacity utilization chart right now, is they're very encouraging in that regard. So as we see these margins expand in the second, third and the fourth quarter relative to last year, we can even seek more comfort in that thinking. Anybody else want to add something to that, though?"

And conversely, when you look at this year's $75 million of EBIT in the first quarter, and again adjust that for things that we've talked about that are a little bit out of the ordinary, including the gain from the divestiture and some of the acquisition related adjustments, then you're somewhere around $75 million, $76 million of EBIT. That increased which is about $8 million when you take that noise out, on $20 million of volume, and in addition, rightfully so, you should expect and we are realizing operating contribution from the acquisition. You can see it's just what's unfortunate as always, it seems like every quarter, a bit of noise here and now whether with it's revenue or in a noise so it's never just one thing really that's driving our performance but when you kind of work through those details that I continue to kind of keep comfort with that 25, 30, 35% contribution margin.

And that helps us quite a bit in terms of our comfort with the investment, as well as the prospects for it going forward."

We were pleased with the first quarter results we reported yesterday. First quarter same-location sales increased 4.5% versus a relatively strong first quarter of 2011, reflecting a combination of unit volume growth and raw material related price inflation. Volume trends were mixed across our businesses. We saw volume gains in automotive and office components, as well as in U.S. Spring, adjustable beds and other parts of the Residential segment. The most notable volume declines occurred in store fixtures, furniture hardware and commercial vehicle products. 
Earnings per share for the quarter were $0.30, unchanged from the first quarter of 2011. In last year's first quarter, we had a $0.03 per share benefit from unusual items including gains from building sales that did not recur in 2012. Current quarter earnings benefited from higher unit volumes. We are also realizing the expected earnings benefits from the restructuring activities we initiated in late 2011. The strategically attractive Western Pneumatic Tube acquisition that we completed in January is exceeding in our expectation for strong operating performance. 
In the first half of this year, we will recognize $6 million of charges, half of this in the first quarter from an acquisition-related fair value adjustment to inventory. These charges will not repeat in the back half of this year, so we expect Western's earnings to improve as the year progresses. 
Our operating folks continue to do an excellent job of closely managing working capital reflecting our focus on return optimization. We ended the quarter with working capital at 12.3% of annualized sales. Current liabilities include approximately $28 million, associated with an interest rate swap that we entered in 2010. If you exclude that item, working capital was 13% of annualized sales, still well below our 15% target. Cash from operations was strong during the quarter at $65 million. We expect operating cash for the full year of over $325 million, which should once again comfortably exceed the amount required to fund capital expenditures and dividends. 
Capital expenditures should be approximately $100 million this year and dividends should require about $160 million. We have maintained our strong financial base and ended the first quarter with net debt at 34% of net capital, which is within our long-term targeted range of 30% to 40%.
In February, we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.28 per share and extended to 41 years our record of consecutive annual dividend increases. At yesterday's closing price of $23.67, the current dividend yield is 4.7%. Given the cash outlay to acquire Western Pneumatic Tube, we did not complete any open market purchases of our stock during the first quarter. However, consistent with our stated priorities for use of excess cash flow, we expect eventually to resume buying back our stock subject to the outlook to the outlook for the economy, our level of cash generation and other potential opportunities to grow the company. For the full year, with strong cash generation, we expect to repurchase some number of our shares but have established no specific repurchase commitment or timetable. We have a standing authorization from our Board to repurchase up to 10 million shares each year. 
We assess our overall performance by comparing our Total Shareholder Return to that of peer companies on a rolling 3-year basis. Our target is to achieve TSR in the top 1/3 of the S&P 500 over the long term, which we believe will require an average TSR of 12% to 15% per year. For the 3-year period that began January 1, 2010, we have so far generated TSR of 12% per year on average, which matches the return of the S&P 500 index over that same time period. So with those comments, I'll turn the call over to Karl Glassman who will provide some operating highlights. Karl?"

You will find segment details in yesterday's press release and in the slide presentation on our website. First quarter, same location sales and Residential Furnishings segment increased 7% from a combination of unit volume growth and raw material related price inflation. In our U.S. Spring business, innerspring unit volumes increased 3% and boxspring units were flat. In our Furniture Hardware business, unit volume decreased 10% versus the prior year. Again this quarter, we had significant growth in adjustable beds with unit shipments of 48%. 
Sales also grew in carpet underlay, Geo Components and consumer products. EBIT and EBIT margins in the segment decreased versus the first quarter last year, primarily from the absence of a gain from a building sale that occurred in early 2011. The earnings benefit from slightly higher unit volumes in the current quarter was partially offset by raw material inflation and a less favorable sales mix. 
In the Commercial Fixturing and Components segment, first quarter same location sales decreased 8% from lower Fixture & Display volume. This decrease resulted in a large part from lower spending by a single large value-oriented retailer. Sales in Office Furniture components increased slightly during the quarter. Volume in this business continues to generally track the overall recovery in the office furniture industry. EBIT and EBIT margins in the segment decreased slightly versus first quarter of 2011, primarily from the absence of a gain from a building sale that occurred early last year. The earnings impact from lower sales in the current quarter was more than offset by a gain from the sale of our U.K. based Point of Purchase business in January, benefits from restructuring activity and other cost savings. 
In the Industrial Materials segment, first quarter same location sales increased 6% with growth from steel-related price inflation slightly offset by union volume declines. Overall unit volumes were lower, led by a decrease in shipments of wire and rod. EBIT decreased in the quarter primarily due to a $3 million acquisition-related fair value adjustment inventory. Earnings benefits from the recently completed acquisition and the plant  consolidations announced in late 2011 were largely offset in the quarter by lower unit volumes and unusually higher workers compensation expense. 
EBIT margins were further compressed by the inflation driven sales increase as this revenue growth brought little incremental profit. As Dave mentioned earlier, the Western Pneumatic Tube acquisition, which resides in the Industrial Materials segment, is exceeding our performance expectations. We continue to expect this business to produce full-year 2012 margins greater than the company average. First and second quarters results will reflect approximately $3 million of charges from acquisition-related fair value adjustments.  Since those charges do not repeat, segment margin should improve appreciably in the back half of the year. 
In the Specialized Products segment, first quarter sales increased 6% entirely from growth on automotive. Machinery sales were down slightly in the quarter and commercial vehicle product sales were up significantly compared to first quarter of last year. EBIT was flat and EBIT margins decreased during the quarter. Higher sales and the non-recurrence of last year's impairment charges contributed favorably to EBIT, but these improvements were offset by several items including higher raw material cost, litigation reserves, less favorable sales mix and higher R&D spending. 
Automotive industry forecast anticipate continued growth in global production rates in 2012. But the outlook varies by geography. North America and Asia are both expected to have meaningful production growth, but European forecast are negative as economic concerns linger. With those comments, I'll turn the call back over to Dave."

We continue to expect the restructuring related activities that we initiated in 2011, in total, to add $0.07 to $0.10 per share to our 2012 earnings. We also anticipate the Western Pneumatic Tube acquisition to be modestly accretive to the full year's earnings here in its first year. These improvements are largely offset by a higher anticipated full-year effective tax rate and interest expense, which negatively impact earnings by approximately $0.10 per share, $0.08 of that for the tax rate and $0.02 for interest.

As you inferred, that ISPA the quarterly results were released not before last. And while we believe that the ISPA results are a good barometer of change from a sequential movement standpoint, that as you infer, that they only captured 65% of the industry units. So I believe, we believe, that the January and February results were probably overstated and the March results were a catch up. As are -- as we state, that our innerspring units were up 3%, we think that, that is an appropriate reflection of the industry. The ISPA statistics show that March innersprings were up 9.4% in units, our experience was a couple percent off. We believe that as a better barometer of the macro industry. So I don't think investors should view the March ISPA results as falling off a Cliff, we know that, that in fact didn't happen. But we do think that it's a normalization of stronger than probably, was accurate January and February results. Now, I want to make it clear, I am not in any way, taking issue with ISPA.

Oddly, or I guess appreciatively, that unit sales were up 3% in March. So it wasn't a train wreck. From a full disclosure perspective, I do want to make comment that we have lost a little bit of market share in Furniture Hardware to a Chinese-based finished furniture manufacturer that does make some of their own lower value mechanisms. We believe that, that is completed, all law -- or that exposure is behind us, all law the pickup in March. So that mix of negative hardware is negative to us in the first quarter while we very much appreciate a pick up in carpet units, which was up about 6% to 7%. And a pickup in Geo Components sales, those 2 have lower contribution margins than Furniture in total. So certainly, a negative mix in the first quarter that we don't expect to continue. In addition, we're in the process of passing through some price increases, particularly in the U.S. Spring market based on some inflation, some January steel inflation that ran through the quarter. And obviously, some inflation in fuel costs. So we believe the second quarter will have a good bit of that through the system and be fully through the system by the first day of the third quarter."

That could come across as an excuse, I certainly don't mean it that way. We still have a significant, very significant amount of earnings power in the company, and especially when you take a look at our production capacity utilizations, which are up incidentally this first quarter. We're pleased to see that almost across the board in the various units. But what it's going to take is increased demand, capacity, utilization. The concept or the leverage that, that incremental volume has is still real. In some cases, the leverage is -- starts with a forward handle, it has a 40% impact. In some cases, it's 18%, 19%, but on average, we still feel comfortable with that 25% to 30%, 35% leverage, Budd.  And so, when will it happen? It'll be a function of when that demand continues, I mean when the demand reaches the level that provides us the capacity utilizations that we want and need to get there. I don't know how to predict that. I know that if we say -- if we just threw our revenue number out, it's challenging because we don't know how much inflation or deflation may come into that. I'm still very comfortable as a shareholder and as part of the management team here, that we will be able to continue to reduce our payout ratio going forward, and ultimately, get into that range of 50% to 60% payout ratio. I know it's frustrating for certain investors. We're very comfortable that we'll be able to achieve that. We just need the demand. And like I said, I don't want to get too optimistic, but the first quarter, I'm looking at the production capacity utilization chart right now, is very encouraging in that regard. So as we see these margins expand in the second, third and the fourth quarter relative to last year, we can even seek more comfort in that thinking.

Slide #4 is a bridge from last year's to this year's sales and EBIT.

And when you start with last year's EBIT, that was $74 million, but I recognize that there were $6 million or so of unusual things that helped that, that you're really looking at kind of operationally about $68 million of EBIT. And conversely, when you look at this year's $75 million of EBIT in the first quarter, and again adjust that for things that we've talked about that are a little bit out of the ordinary, including the gain from the divestiture and some of the acquisition-related adjustments, then you're somewhere around $75 million, $76 million of EBIT. That increase which is about $8 million, when you take that noise out, on $20 million of volume, and in addition, rightfully so, you should expect and we are realizing, operating contribution from the acquisition. You can see it's just -- what's unfortunate is as always, it seems like every quarter, a bit of noise here and there, whether it's revenue or in a noise, or earnings or in a noise. So it's never just one thing really, that's driving our performance.

We were pleased with the first quarter results we reported yesterday. First quarter same-location sales increased 4.5% versus a relatively strong first quarter of 2011, reflecting a combination of unit volume growth and raw material related price inflation. Volume trends were mixed across our businesses. We saw volume gains in automotive and office components, as well as in U.S. Spring, adjustable beds and other parts of the Residential segment. The most notable volume declines occurred in store fixtures, furniture hardware and commercial vehicle products. 
Earnings per share for the quarter were $0.30, unchanged from the first quarter of 2011. In last year's first quarter, we had a $0.03 per share benefit from unusual items including gains from building sales that did not recur in 2012. Current quarter earnings benefited from higher unit volumes. We are also realizing the expected earnings benefits from the restructuring activities we initiated in late 2011. The strategically attractive Western Pneumatic Tube acquisition that we completed in January is exceeding in our expectation for strong operating performance. 
In the first half of this year, we will recognize $6 million of charges, half of this in the first quarter from an acquisition-related fair value adjustment to inventory. These charges will not repeat in the back half of this year, so we expect Western's earnings to improve as the year progresses. 
Our operating folks continue to do an excellent job of closely managing working capital reflecting our focus on return optimization. We ended the quarter with working capital at 12.3% of annualized sales. Current liabilities include approximately $28 million, associated with an interest rate swap that we entered in 2010. If you exclude that item, working capital was 13% of annualized sales, still well below our 15% target. Cash from operations was strong during the quarter at $65 million. We expect operating cash for the full year of over $325 million, which should once again comfortably exceed the amount required to fund capital expenditures and dividends. 
Capital expenditures should be approximately $100 million this year and dividends should require about $160 million. We have maintained our strong financial base and ended the first quarter with net debt at 34% of net capital, which is within our long-term targeted range of 30% to 40%.
In February, we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.28 per share and extended to 41 years our record of consecutive annual dividend increases. At yesterday's closing price of $23.67, the current dividend yield is 4.7%. Given the cash outlay to acquire Western Pneumatic Tube, we did not complete any open market purchases of our stock during the first quarter. However, consistent with our stated priorities for use of excess cash flow, we expect eventually to resume buying back our stock subject to the outlook to the outlook for the economy, our level of cash generation and other potential opportunities to grow the company. For the full year, with strong cash generation, we expect to repurchase some number of our shares but have established no specific repurchase commitment or timetable. We have a standing authorization from our Board to repurchase up to 10 million shares each year. 
We assess our overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return to that of peer companies on a rolling 3-year basis. Our target is to achieve TSR in the top 1/3 of the S&P 500 over the long term, which we believe will require an average TSR of 12% to 15% per year. For the 3-year period that began January 1, 2010, we have so far generated TSR of 12% per year on average, which matches the return of the S&P 500 index over that same time period. So with those comments, I'll turn the call over to Karl Glassman who will provide some operating highlights. Karl?"

You will find segment details in yesterday's press release and in the slide presentation on our website. First quarter, same location sales in Residential Furnishings segment increased 7% from a combination of unit volume growth and raw material related price inflation. In our U.S. Spring business, innerspring unit volumes increased 3% and boxspring units were flat. In our Furniture Hardware business, unit volume decreased 10% versus the prior year. Again this quarter, we had significant growth in adjustable beds with unit shipments of 48%. 
Sales also grew in carpet underlay, Geo Components and consumer products. EBIT and EBIT margins in the segment decreased versus the first quarter last year, primarily from the absence of a gain from a building sale that occurred in early 2011. The earnings benefit from slightly higher unit volumes in the current quarter was partially offset by raw material inflation and a less favorable sales mix. 
In the Commercial Fixturing & Components segment, first quarter same location sales decreased 8% from lower Fixture & Display volume. This decrease resulted in a large part from lower spending by a single large value-oriented retailer. Sales in Office Furniture components increased slightly during the quarter. Volume in this business continues to generally track the overall recovery in the office furniture industry. EBIT and EBIT margins in the segment decreased slightly versus first quarter of 2011, primarily from the absence of a gain from a building sale that occurred early last year. The earnings impact from lower sales in the current quarter was more than offset by a gain from the sale of our U.K. based Point of Purchase business in January, benefits from restructuring activity and other cost savings. 
In the Industrial Materials segment, first quarter same location sales increased 6% with growth from steel-related price inflation slightly offset by union volume declines. Overall unit volumes were lower, led by a decrease in shipments of wire and rod. EBIT decreased in the quarter primarily due to a $3 million acquisition-related fair value adjustment to inventory. Earnings benefits from the recently completed acquisition and the plant  consolidations announced in late 2011 were largely offset in the quarter by lower unit volumes and unusually high workers compensation expense. 
EBIT margins were further compressed by the inflation driven sales increase as this revenue growth brought little incremental profit. As Dave mentioned earlier, the Western Pneumatic Tube acquisition, which resides in the Industrial Materials segment, is exceeding our performance expectations. We continue to expect this business to produce full-year 2012 margins greater than the company average. First and second quarter's results will reflect approximately $3 million of charges from acquisition-related fair value adjustments.  Since those charges do not repeat, segment margin should improve appreciably in the back half of the year. 
In the Specialized Products segment, first quarter sales increased 6% entirely from growth in automotive. Machinery sales were down slightly in the quarter and commercial vehicle product sales were up significantly compared to first quarter of last year. EBIT was flat and EBIT margins decreased during the quarter. Higher sales and the non-recurrence of last year's impairment charges contributed favorably to EBIT, but these improvements were offset by several items including higher raw material cost, litigation reserves, less favorable sales mix and higher R&D spending. 
Automotive industry forecasts anticipate continued growth in global production rates in 2012. But the outlook varies by geography. North America and Asia are both expected to have meaningful production growth, but European forecasts are negative as economic concerns linger. With those comments, I'll turn the call back over to Dave."

We are also increasing our full-year guidance, sales guidance, that is, to $3.65 billion to $3.85 billion, which is up from our previous range of $3.6 billion to $3.8 billion. We continue to expect the restructuring related activities that we initiated in 2011, in total, to add $0.07 to $0.10 per share to our 2012 earnings. We also anticipate the Western Pneumatic Tube acquisition to be modestly accretive to the full year's earnings here in its first year. These improvements are largely offset by a higher anticipated full-year effective tax rate and interest expense, which negatively impact earnings by approximately $0.10 per share, $0.08 of that for the tax rate and $0.02 for interest.

As you inferred, that ISPA the quarterly results were released not before last. And while we believe that the ISPA results are a good barometer of change from a sequential movement standpoint, that as you infer, that they only captured 65% of the industry units. So I believe, we believe, that the January and February results were probably overstated and the March results were a catch up. As are -- as we state, that our innerspring units were up 3%, we think that, that is an appropriate reflection of the industry. The ISPA statistics show that March innersprings were up 9.4% in units, our experience was a couple percent off. We believe that as a better barometer of the macro industry. So I don't think investors should view the March ISPA results as falling off a cliff, we know that, that in fact didn't happen. But we do think that it's a normalization of stronger than probably, was accurate January and February results. Now, I want to make it clear, I am not in any way, taking issue with ISPA. They are just reporting the data that's given to them so."

You should see an expansion in margins that we had an abnormally weak mix in the first quarter with Furniture Hardware sales off 10%. And if you'll allow me, I'd like to speak to that very issue for just a second. That from a headline perspective, that may look pretty negative as it does, but our first quarter experience was pretty choppy and that the December sales of furniture hardware were actually up 7.5%. They were up 12% from our international locations. We believe there was a significant pull forward by our customers because of an unusually early Chinese New Year, so we saw a pull forward into December of 2011. The January of 2012 experience was particularly negative with units off 30%, remembering that Chinese New Year was in January this year, February last, and sort through the whole thing, and we ended up in experiencing units down 10%. Oddly, or I guess appreciatively, that unit sales were up 3% in March. So it wasn't a train wreck. From a full disclosure perspective, I do want to make comment that we have lost a little bit of market share in Furniture Hardware to a Chinese-based finished furniture manufacturer that does make some of their own lower value mechanisms. We believe that, that is completed, a la -- or that exposure is behind us, a la the pickup in March. So that mix of negative hardware is negative to us in the first quarter while we very much appreciate a pick up in carpet units, which was up about 6% to 7%. And a pickup in Geo Components sales, those 2 have lower contribution margins than Furniture in total. So certainly, a negative mix in the first quarter that we don't expect to continue. In addition, we're in the process of passing through some price increases, particularly in the U.S. Spring market based on some inflation, some January steel inflation that ran through the quarter. And obviously, some inflation in fuel costs. So we believe the second quarter will have a good bit of that through the system and be fully through the system by the first day of the third quarter."

That could come across as an excuse, I certainly don't mean it that way. We still have a significant, very significant amount of earnings power in the company, and especially when you take a look at our production capacity utilizations, which are up incidentally this first quarter. We're pleased to see that almost across the board in the various units. But what it's going to take is increased demand, capacity, utilization. The concept or the leverage that, that incremental volume has is still real. In some cases, the leverage is -- starts with a four handle, it has a 40% impact. In some cases, it's 18%, 19%, but on average, we still feel comfortable with that 25% to 30%, 35% leverage, Budd.  And so, when will it happen? It'll be a function of when that demand continues, I mean when the demand reaches the level that provides us the capacity utilizations that we want and need to get there. I don't know how to predict that. I know that if we say -- if we just threw our revenue number out, it's challenging because we don't know how much inflation or deflation may come into that. I'm still very comfortable as a shareholder and as part of the management team here, that we will be able to continue to reduce our payout ratio going forward, and ultimately, get into that range of 50% to 60% payout ratio. I know it's frustrating for certain investors. We're very comfortable that we'll be able to achieve that. We just need the demand. And like I said, I don't want to get too optimistic, but the first quarter, I'm looking at the production capacity utilization chart right now, is very encouraging in that regard. So as we see these margins expand in the second, third and the fourth quarter relative to last year, we can even seek more comfort in that thinking.

Slide #4 is a bridge from last year's to this year's sales and EBIT.

And conversely, when you look at this year's $75 million of EBIT in the first quarter, and again adjust that for things that we've talked about that are a little bit out of the ordinary, including the gain from the divestiture and some of the acquisition-related adjustments, then you're somewhere around $75 million, $76 million of EBIT. That increase which is about $8 million, when you take that noise out, on $20 million of volume, and in addition, rightfully so, you should expect and we are realizing, operating contribution from the acquisition. You can see it's just -- what's unfortunate is as always, it seems like every quarter, a bit of noise here and there, whether it's revenue or in a noise, or earnings or in a noise. So it's never just one thing really, that's driving our performance.

But while -- our steel mill just absolutely does a wonderful job. They're great people that are dedicated to the business and they had a few challenges in the first quarter that won't repeat. One is we, unfortunately, had a crane-related accident. There was an employee that was hurt. That employee, thankfully, is well into recovery and was released from rehabilitation earlier this week and is now at home. So prayer's been answered. That is the reference to the worker's comp expanse in industrial. With that unfortunate incident, we did lose some yield in the steel mill. But a bigger cost impact was there was -- we took an 8-day outage in the mill that was planned, that will not repeat and it was dedicated to replacing the finishing end or the packaging line of the rod mill and that is really what the major driver was for our reduced sales. So you should expect that sales will recover in the second quarter and going forward."

We were pleased with the first quarter results we reported yesterday. First quarter same-location sales increased 4.5% versus a relatively strong first quarter of 2011, reflecting a combination of unit volume growth and raw material related price inflation. Volume trends were mixed across our businesses. We saw volume gains in automotive and office components, as well as in U.S. Spring, adjustable beds and other parts of the Residential segment. The most notable volume declines occurred in store fixtures, furniture hardware and commercial vehicle products. 
Earnings per share for the quarter were $0.30, unchanged from the first quarter of 2011. In last year's first quarter, we had a $0.03 per share benefit from unusual items including gains from building sales that did not recur in 2012. Current quarter earnings benefited from higher unit volumes. We are also realizing the expected earnings benefits from the restructuring activities we initiated in late 2011. The strategically attractive Western Pneumatic Tube acquisition that we completed in January is exceeding in our expectation for strong operating performance. 
In the first half of this year, we will recognize $6 million of charges, half of this in the first quarter from an acquisition-related fair value adjustment to inventory. These charges will not repeat in the back half of this year, so we expect Western's earnings to improve as the year progresses. 
Our operating folks continue to do an excellent job of closely managing working capital reflecting our focus on return optimization. We ended the quarter with working capital at 12.3% of annualized sales. Current liabilities include approximately $28 million, associated with an interest rate swap that we entered in 2010. If you exclude that item, working capital was 13% of annualized sales, still well below our 15% target. Cash from operations was strong during the quarter at $65 million. We expect operating cash for the full year of over $325 million, which should once again comfortably exceed the amount required to fund capital expenditures and dividends. 
Capital expenditures should be approximately $100 million this year and dividends should require about $160 million. We have maintained our strong financial base and ended the first quarter with net debt at 34% of net capital, which is within our long-term targeted range of 30% to 40%.
In February, we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.28 per share and extended to 41 years our record of consecutive annual dividend increases. At yesterday's closing price of $23.67, the current dividend yield is 4.7%. Given the cash outlay to acquire Western Pneumatic Tube, we did not complete any open market purchases of our stock during the first quarter. However, consistent with our stated priorities for use of excess cash flow, we expect eventually to resume buying back our stock subject to the outlook to the outlook for the economy, our level of cash generation and other potential opportunities to grow the company. For the full year, with strong cash generation, we expect to repurchase some number of our shares but have established no specific repurchase commitment or timetable. We have a standing authorization from our Board to repurchase up to 10 million shares each year. 
We assess our overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return to that of peer companies on a rolling 3-year basis. Our target is to achieve TSR in the top 1/3 of the S&P 500 over the long term, which we believe will require an average TSR of 12% to 15% per year. For the 3-year period that began January 1, 2010, we have so far generated TSR of 12% per year on average, which matches the return of the S&P 500 index over that same time period. So with those comments, I'll turn the call over to Karl Glassman who will provide some operating highlights. Karl?"

You will find segment details in yesterday's press release and in the slide presentation on our website. First quarter, same location sales in Residential Furnishings segment increased 7% from a combination of unit volume growth and raw material related price inflation. In our U.S. Spring business, innerspring unit volumes increased 3% and boxspring units were flat. In our Furniture Hardware business, unit volume decreased 10% versus the prior year. Again this quarter, we had significant growth in adjustable beds with unit shipments of 48%. 
Sales also grew in carpet underlay, Geo Components and consumer products. EBIT and EBIT margins in the segment decreased versus the first quarter last year, primarily from the absence of a gain from a building sale that occurred in early 2011. The earnings benefit from slightly higher unit volumes in the current quarter was partially offset by raw material inflation and a less favorable sales mix. 
In the Commercial Fixturing & Components segment, first quarter same location sales decreased 8% from lower Fixture & Display volume. This decrease resulted in a large part from lower spending by a single large value-oriented retailer. Sales in Office Furniture components increased slightly during the quarter. Volume in this business continues to generally track the overall recovery in the office furniture industry. EBIT and EBIT margins in the segment decreased slightly versus first quarter of 2011, primarily from the absence of a gain from a building sale that occurred early last year. The earnings impact from lower sales in the current quarter was more than offset by a gain from the sale of our U.K. based Point of Purchase business in January, benefits from restructuring activity and other cost savings. 
In the Industrial Materials segment, first quarter same location sales increased 6% with growth from steel-related price inflation slightly offset by union volume declines. Overall unit volumes were lower, led by a decrease in shipments of wire and rod. EBIT decreased in the quarter primarily due to a $3 million acquisition-related fair value adjustment to inventory. Earnings benefits from the recently completed acquisition and the plant  consolidations announced in late 2011 were largely offset in the quarter by lower unit volumes and unusually high workers compensation expense. 
EBIT margins were further compressed by the inflation driven sales increase as this revenue growth brought little incremental profit. As Dave mentioned earlier, the Western Pneumatic Tube acquisition, which resides in the Industrial Materials segment, is exceeding our performance expectations. We continue to expect this business to produce full-year 2012 margins greater than the company average. First and second quarter's results will reflect approximately $3 million of charges from acquisition-related fair value adjustments.  Since those charges do not repeat, segment margin should improve appreciably in the back half of the year. 
In the Specialized Products segment, first quarter sales increased 6% entirely from growth in automotive. Machinery sales were down slightly in the quarter and commercial vehicle product sales were up significantly compared to first quarter of last year. EBIT was flat and EBIT margins decreased during the quarter. Higher sales and the non-recurrence of last year's impairment charges contributed favorably to EBIT, but these improvements were offset by several items including higher raw material cost, litigation reserves, less favorable sales mix and higher R&D spending. 
Automotive industry forecasts anticipate continued growth in global production rates in 2012. But the outlook varies by geography. North America and Asia are both expected to have meaningful production growth, but European forecasts are negative as economic concerns linger. With those comments, I'll turn the call back over to Dave."

We are also increasing our full-year guidance, sales guidance, that is, to $3.65 billion to $3.85 billion, which is up from our previous range of $3.6 billion to $3.8 billion. We continue to expect the restructuring related activities that we initiated in 2011, in total, to add $0.07 to $0.10 per share to our 2012 earnings. We also anticipate the Western Pneumatic Tube acquisition to be modestly accretive to the full year's earnings here in its first year. These improvements are largely offset by a higher anticipated full-year effective tax rate and interest expense, which negatively impact earnings by approximately $0.10 per share, $0.08 of that for the tax rate and $0.02 for interest.
Now with those comments, I'll turn the call back over to Dave DeSonier."

As you inferred, that ISPA the quarterly results were released not before last. And while we believe that the ISPA results are a good barometer of change from a sequential movement standpoint, that as you infer, that they only captured 65% of the industry units. So I believe, we believe, that the January and February results were probably overstated and the March results were a catch up. As are -- as we state, that our innerspring units were up 3%, we think that, that is an appropriate reflection of the industry. The ISPA statistics show that March innersprings were up 9.4% in units, our experience was a couple percent off. We believe that as a better barometer of the macro industry. So I don't think investors should view the March ISPA results as falling off a cliff, we know that, that in fact didn't happen. But we do think that it's a normalization of stronger than probably, was accurate January and February results. Now, I want to make it clear, I am not in any way, taking issue with ISPA.

You should see an expansion in margins that we had an abnormally weak mix in the first quarter with Furniture Hardware sales off 10%. And if you'll allow me, I'd like to speak to that very issue for just a second. That from a headline perspective, that may look pretty negative as it does, but our first quarter experience was pretty choppy and that the December sales of furniture hardware were actually up 7.5%. They were up 12% from our international locations. We believe there was a significant pull forward by our customers because of an unusually early Chinese New Year, so we saw a pull forward into December of 2011. The January of 2012 experience was particularly negative with units off 30%, remembering that Chinese New Year was in January this year, February last, and sort through the whole thing, and we ended up in experiencing units down 10%. Oddly, or I guess appreciatively, that unit sales were up 3% in March. So it wasn't a train wreck. From a full disclosure perspective, I do want to make comment that we have lost a little bit of market share in Furniture Hardware to a Chinese-based finished furniture manufacturer that does make some of their own lower value mechanisms. We believe that, that is completed, all -- or that exposure is behind us, all the pickup in March. So that mix of negative hardware is negative to us in the first quarter while we very much appreciate a pick up in carpet units, which was up about 6% to 7%. And a pickup in Geo Components sales, those 2 have lower contribution margins than Furniture in total. So certainly, a negative mix in the first quarter that we don't expect to continue. In addition, we're in the process of passing through some price increases, particularly in the U.S. Spring market based on some inflation, some January steel inflation that ran through the quarter. And obviously, some inflation in fuel costs. So we believe the second quarter will have a good bit of that through the system and be fully through the system by the first day of the third quarter."

I don't know how to predict that. I know that if we say -- if we just threw our revenue number out, it's challenging because we don't know how much inflation or deflation may come into that. I'm still very comfortable as a shareholder and as part of the management team here, that we will be able to continue to reduce our payout ratio going forward, and ultimately, get into that range of 50% to 60% payout ratio. I know it's frustrating for certain investors. We're very comfortable that we'll be able to achieve that. We just need the demand. And like I said, I don't want to get too optimistic, but the first quarter, I'm looking at the production capacity utilization chart right now, is very encouraging in that regard. So as we see these margins expand in the second, third and the fourth quarter relative to last year, we can even seek more comfort in that thinking. Anybody else want to add something to that, though?"

Slide #4 is a bridge from last year's to this year's sales and EBIT. And if you recognize that of our total revenue growth, there's only about $20 million of that, that was from the unit volume increase that is the carrier of this 25, 30, 35% contribution margin that we talk about. And when you start with last year's EBIT, that was $74 million, but I recognize that there were $6 million or so of unusual things that helped that, that you're really looking at kind of operationally about $68 million of EBIT. And conversely, when you look at this year's $75 million of EBIT in the first quarter, and again adjust that for things that we've talked about that are a little bit out of the ordinary, including the gain from the divestiture and some of the acquisition-related adjustments, then you're somewhere around $75 million, $76 million of EBIT. That increase which is about $8 million, when you take that noise out, on $20 million of volume, and in addition, rightfully so, you should expect and we are realizing, operating contribution from the acquisition. You can see it's just -- what's unfortunate is as always, it seems like every quarter, a bit of noise here and there, whether it's revenue or in a noise, or earnings or in a noise. So it's never just one thing really, that's driving our performance. But when you kind of work through those details that's how I continue to kind of keep comfort with that 25%, 30%, 35% contribution margin. And it is mix sensitive, to Karl's comment earlier, our mix wasn't especially strong in this first quarter with some of the things going on."

But while -- our steel mill just absolutely does a wonderful job. They're great people that are dedicated to the business and they had a few challenges in the first quarter that won't repeat. One is we, unfortunately, had a crane-related accident. There was an employee that was hurt. That employee, thankfully, is well into recovery and was released from rehabilitation earlier this week and is now at home. So prayer's been answered. That is the reference to the worker's comp expanse in industrial. With that unfortunate incident, we did lose some yield in the steel mill. But a bigger cost impact was there was -- we took an 8-day outage in the mill that was planned, that will not repeat and it was dedicated to replacing the finishing end or the packaging line of the rod mill and that is really what the major driver was for our reduced sales.

We are pleased with the second quarter earnings and margin improvement we reported yesterday. Earnings per share for the quarter were $0.45 compared to $0.37 during the second quarter of last year. Second quarter 2012 earnings include a $0.04 per share unusual tax benefit and a $0.02 per share benefit in discontinued operations from a litigation settlement associated with the previously divested business. 
Second quarter of last year, earnings included $0.02 per share unusual tax benefit. Second quarter same location sales were down 2% from the prior year, primarily due to lower trade sales from our Rod mill, currency rates and lower store fixtures sales, a portion of which was volume we chose to exit. Apart from these 3 factors, same location sales increased 2%. 
Unit volumes were flat to positive across a majority of the company with the strongest growth continuing to come from our Automotive and Adjustable Bed businesses. EBIT increased and EBIT margins improved both year-over-year and sequentially to 9.2% during the quarter. Earnings are benefiting, as expected, from higher unit volumes and the cost savings associated with the restructuring activities we initiated in late 2011. In addition, the Western Pneumatic Tube acquisition that we completed in January is exceeding our expectation for strong operating performance. We are very pleased with the return we're generating on this investment. 
Reflecting our broad focus on returns, we ended the quarter with working capital at 12% of annualized sales. Current liabilities include $41 million associated with an interest rate swap that we entered in 2010. Excluding this item, working capital was 13.1% of annualized sales, well below our 15% target. Cash from operations was strong during the quarter at $81 million. We expect operating cash for the full-year of approximately $350 million, which had once again comfortably exceed the amount required to fund capital expenditures and dividends. 
Capital expenditures should be approximately $90 million this year and dividends should require about $160 million. We continue to maintain our strong financial base and ended the second quarter with net debt at 33% of net capital, which is within our long-term target range of 30% to 40%. 
In May, we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.28 per share. 2012 marks the 41st consecutive annual dividend increase for the company, a record we plan to extend. At yesterday's closing price of $22.49, the current dividend yield is 5%. Leggett possesses the highest  dividend yield among all of the S&P 500 dividend aristocrats that have over 30 consecutive annual dividend increases. 
Given the cash outlay earlier in the year to acquire Western Pneumatic Tube, we did not complete any open market purchases of our stock in the second quarter. However, consistent with our stated priorities for the use of excess cash flow, we expect eventually to resume buying back our stock subject to the outlook for the economy, our level of cash generation and other potential opportunities to strategically grow the company. 
We have a standing authorization from the board to repurchase up to 10 million shares each year established no specific purchase commitment our timetable. We assess our overall performance of a comparing our Total Shareholder Return needs to that of peer companies on a rolling 3-year basis. Our target is to achieve TSR in the top 1/3 of the S&P 500 over the long-term, which we believe will require an average TSR of 12% to 15% per year. 
For the 3 year period that began January 1, 2010, we have a so far generated TSR of 8% per year an average or slightly below the midpoint of the S&P 500 companies over that same time period. With those comments, I'll turn the call over now to Karl Glassman who will provide some operating highlights."

Second quarter same location sales on the Residential Furnishi",636,"Thank you, Dave. Good morning. In my comments, I'll discuss a few segment highlights. You will find segment details in yesterday's press release and in the slide presentation on our website. 
Second quarter same location sales on the Residential Furnishings segment increased 1% with unit volume growth partially offset by the impact of currency exchange rates. In our U.S. Frame business, inner spring unit volumes increased 2% and boxspring units were down 3%. Inner Spring units increased 2%, which is notable in this current economic environment. 
In our Furniture Hardware business, unit volume is flat with the prior year. Again, this quarter, we had significant growth in adjustable beds with unit shipments up 20%. EBIT and EBIT margins in this segment decreased slightly versus the second quarter last year. The earnings benefit from slightly higher unit volumes in the current quarter was more than offset by weaker mix in certain businesses. 
In the Commercial Fixturing and Component segment, second quarter same location sales decreased 10% due to lower spending by key Fixture & Display customers and our decision to exit certain programs formerly supplied by operations we have closed or consolidated. Sales of office furniture components were flat during the quarter, which we believe is roughly in line with the overall market for office seating. 
EBIT and EBIT margins in the segment decreased versus second quarter of 2011, primarily from lower sales, higher restructuring related cost and absence of earnings from the U.K. based Point of Purchase business we divested in January. These impacts were partially offset by restructuring related benefits and better overhead absorption associated with increased production for a major program that will ship in the third quarter. The seasonality of our store fixtures business this year is expected to be consistent with the long-term historical pattern in which third quarter is the sales peak, primarily due to a major initiative by one of our large retail customers. We anticipate an improvement in segment results in the third quarter as a result of this additional volume. 
In the Industrial Materials segment, second quarter same location sales decreased 5%, primarily due to lower trade sales from our Rod mill, partially offset by increased unit volumes in both and steel tubing. The decrease in steel rod sales resulted from an equipment change over at the Rod mill, which was an investment in process and quality improvement. The installation of the new equipment occurred late in the first quarter and production did not return to normal levels until early May. 
EBIT and EBIT margins for the segment increased in the quarter. Earnings benefit from the Western Pneumatic Tube acquisition and the plant consolidations announced in late 2011 contributed to the improvement. As Dave mentioned earlier, the Western Pneumatic Tube acquisition, which resides in the Industrial Materials segment, is exceeding our performance expectations. We continue to expect this business to produce full-year 2012 margins greater than the company average. 
In the Specialized Products segment, second quarter same location sales increased 5% with unit volume growth partially offset by the impact of currency exchange rates. The increase in unit volumes resulted entirely from growth on automotive. Commercial Vehicle Products sales were roughly flat and machinery sales were down compared to the second quarter last year. EBIT and EBIT margins increased during the quarter, largely due to higher sales. 
Automotive industry forecast anticipate continued growth in global production in 2012. But the outlook varies by geography. North America and Asia are both expected to have meaningful production growth, but European industry forecast are negative as economic concerns linger. Despite the macro issues and currency headwinds, our automotive sales in Europe are roughly flat during the second quarter and were up slightly for the first 6 months of the year. With those comments, I'll turn the call back over to Dave."

We now expect full-year 2012 EPS of between $1.35 and $1.50 per share, up from our previous $1.25 to $1.45 per share estimate on sales of $3.65 billion to $3.8 billion. 
We began the year with an appropriately cautious view of the macro environment, especially given election-year uncertainties with EPS guidance of $1.20 to $1.40 per share. We have now raised our full-year estimate following both first and seconds quarter given solid first half performance. In each of the prior 2 years, after the second quarter, we were beginning to feel a contraction in our markets and in each case, reduced our full-year guidance. That pattern does not seem to be repeating this year. Still, we're maintaining the degree of caution at the low-end of our guidance in the event that we were to experience a minor macro pullback. 
And lastly, I'd like to say, since we know that many of our employee shareholders are listening to our conference today, we want to thank them for their past and continued efforts, which have contributed to Leggett's improved execution and performance.

We are dealing with somewhat of a negative mix in that it feels like that the consumer in Europe is downgrading a little bit, that we felt a kind of a margin contraction from the mix from pocketed coils to more vinyls. But we're fortunate in that we're heavily weighted in Europe to the Scandinavians countries, northern Europe and the U.K. and have lesser exposure to the southern Europe countries. So things are really proceeding well. We are also benefiting from the deverticalization of the U.K. manufacturer earlier this year as part of the silent night business. So that business is good business. So all things said and done, while the margins have been slightly negatively impacted, things are proceeding well in Europe and as I noted in my comments, we're experiencing the same from an automotive perspective.

Thanks for opening the door for conversation on U.S. spring and the news there is very, very positive, that we are seeing significant positive impact from the launch of the Hybrid product lines. Comfort Core, which is our pocketed core offering, is the fastest growing part of U.S. frames with units up 20%, significantly higher average unit selling prices, improved margins associated with that, great overhead recovery in our facilities as we continue to work hard to keep up with that demand. So there is -- while we make comment of a negative mix shift in macro residential, U.S. spring is not impacted to that to any degree from an inner spring perspective. It is impacted from a boxspring perspective. You're right about the bifurcation of the market, but I'd do not think that high-end inner spring has been negatively, you'll go back to the ceiling conference call, they commented that Sterns is growing. We see that. We see that in our other customers with competitive offerings, high-end inner spring is doing extremely well and we are very, very bullish and will continue to invest capital to support that growth. 
The middle-market of the bedding industry is under pressure. The low end is a more promotional or somewhat say nonbranded business has been very, very strong. That correlates to our boxspring numbers and you saw into space U.S. inner spring is up 2%, boxspring decreased 3%, I will tell you that is no loss of market share. It is indicative of fewer  boxspring being sold. There are no steel boxspring under the promotional  bedding. Adjustable beds grow significantly, that mitigates the need for an adjustable boxspring under that adjustable mattress and some of the specialties suite product, very few of the selected specialties suite product, would sit on top of you are based product. So all those dynamics don't bode well for boxsprings, which is part of our residential makes explanation and it boxspring margins are higher than the rest of the segment. So there's a lot of moving parts. As it relates to home furniture, that flat units, certainly from a sequential perspective, is an improvement over the first quarter. We have lost a little bit of market share that we have since regained and we do think that, that demand is indicative of the market. To elaborate on another reference in your question though, we are seeing a shift from U.S. based mechanism production to Chinese based mechanism production. That is not a finished furniture mix, that is a component mix. We retain the business in Asia. So it's not a positive situation for our U.S. factory workers, which we're not fond of that situation. But we do retain the business and retain it in Asia. Sometimes with lesser functionality as the furniture industry has become a little bit promotional with the significant inflation of falling European home pricing. So that is also a negative shift. The units are there, but the average pricing drops slightly."

Good morning, and thank you, all, for participating in our call. We are pleased with the second quarter earnings and margin improvement we reported yesterday.

We are pleased with the second quarter earnings and margin improvement we reported yesterday. Earnings per share for the quarter were $0.45 compared to $0.37 during the second quarter of last year. Second quarter 2012 earnings include a $0.04 per share unusual tax benefit and a $0.02 per share benefit in discontinued operations from a litigation settlement associated with the previously divested business. 
Second quarter of last year, earnings included $0.02 per share unusual tax benefit. Second quarter same location sales were down 2% from the prior year, primarily due to lower trade sales from our Rod mill, currency rates and lower store fixtures sales, a portion of which was volume we chose to exit. Apart from these 3 factors, same location sales increased 2%. 
Unit volumes were flat to positive across the majority of the company and the strongest growth continuing -- with the strongest growth continuing to come from our automotive and adjustable bed businesses. EBIT increased and EBIT margins improved both year-over-year and sequentially to 9.2% during the quarter. Earnings are benefiting, as expected, from higher unit volumes and the cost savings associated with the restructuring activities we initiated in late 2011. In addition, the Western Pneumatic Tube acquisition that we completed in January is exceeding our expectation for strong operating performance. We are very pleased with the return we're generating on this investment. 
Reflecting our broad focus on returns, we ended the quarter with working capital at 12% of annualized sales. Current liabilities include $41 million associated with an interest rate swap that we entered in 2010. Excluding this item, working capital was 13.1% of annualized sales, well below our 15% target. Cash from operations was strong during the quarter at $81 million. We expect operating cash for the full year of approximately $350 million, which had once again comfortably exceed the amount required to fund capital expenditures and dividends. 
Capital expenditures should be approximately $90 million this year and dividends should require about $160 million. We continue to maintain our strong financial base and ended the second quarter with net debt at 33% of net capital, which is within our long-term target range of 30% to 40%. 
In May, we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.28 per share. 2012 marks the 41st consecutive annual dividend increase for the company, a record we plan to extend. At yesterday's closing price of $22.49, the current dividend yield is 5%. Leggett possesses the highest  dividend yield among all of the S&P 500 dividend aristocrats that have over 30 consecutive annual dividend increases. 
Given the cash outlay earlier in the year to acquire Western Pneumatic Tube, we did not complete any open market purchases of our stock during the second quarter. However, consistent with our stated priorities for the use of excess cash flow, we expect eventually to resume buying back our stock subject to the outlook for the economy, our level of cash generation and other potential opportunities to strategically grow the company. 
We have a standing authorization from the board to repurchase up to 10 million shares each year but have established no specific repurchase commitment or our timetable. We assess our overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return to that of peer companies on a rolling 3-year basis. Our target is to achieve TSR in the top 1/3 of the S&P 500 over the long term, which we believe will require an average TSR of 12% to 15% per year. 
For the 3-year period that began January 1, 2010, we have a so far generated TSR of 8% per year on average or slightly below the midpoint of the S&P 500 companies over that same time period. With those comments, I'll turn the call over now to Karl Glassman who will provide some operating highlights."

Second quarter same location sales on the Residential Furnishi",643,"Thank you, Dave. Good morning. In my comments, I'll discuss a few segment highlights. You will find segment details in yesterday's press release and in the slide presentation on our website. 
Second quarter same location sales on the Residential Furnishings segment increased 1% with unit volume growth partially offset by the impact of currency exchange rates. 
In our U.S. Spring business, innerspring unit volumes increased 2% and boxspring units were down 3%. Innerspring units in Europe also increased 2%, which is notable in this current economic environment. 
In our Furniture Hardware business, unit volume was flat with the prior year. Again, this quarter, we had significant growth in adjustable beds with unit shipments up 20%. EBIT and EBIT margins in this segment decreased slightly versus the second quarter last year. The earnings benefit from slightly higher unit volumes in the current quarter was more than offset by weaker mix in certain businesses. 
In the Commercial Fixturing & Component segment, second quarter same location sales decreased 10% due to lower spending by key Fixture & Display customers and our decision to exit certain programs formerly supplied by operations we have closed or consolidated. Sales on office furniture components were flat during the quarter, which we believe is roughly in line with the overall market for office seating. EBIT and EBIT margins in the segment decreased versus second quarter of 2011, primarily from lower sales, higher restructuring related cost and absence of earnings from the U.K.-based Point of Purchase business we divested in January. These impacts were partially offset by restructuring-related benefits and better overhead absorption associated with increased production for a major program that will ship in the third quarter. The seasonality of our Store Fixtures business this year is expected to be consistent with the long-term historical pattern in which third quarter is the sales peak, primarily due to a major initiative by one of our large retail customers. We anticipate an improvement in segment results in the third quarter as a result of this additional volume. 
In the Industrial Materials segment, second quarter same location sales decreased 5%, primarily due to lower trade sales from our rod mill, partially offset by increased unit volumes in both Drawn Wire and Steel Tubing. The decrease in steel rod sales resulted from an equipment change over at the rod mill, which was an investment in process and quality improvement. The installation of the new equipment occurred late in the first quarter and production did not return to normal levels until early May. 
EBIT and EBIT margins for the segment increased in the quarter. Earnings benefit from the Western Pneumatic Tube acquisition and the plant consolidations announced that late 2011 contributed to the improvement. As Dave mentioned earlier, the Western Pneumatic Tube acquisition, which resides in the Industrial Materials segment, is exceeding our performance expectations. We continue to expect this business to produce full year 2012 margins greater than the company average. 
In the Specialized Products segment, second quarter same location sales increased 5% with unit volume growth partially offset by the impact of currency exchange rates. The increase in unit volumes resulted entirely from growth on automotive. Commercial vehicle products sales were roughly flat and machinery sales were down compared to the second quarter of last year. EBIT and EBIT margin increased during the quarter, largely due to higher sales. 
Automotive industry forecast anticipate continued growth in global production in 2012, but the outlook varies by geography. North America and Asia are both expected to have meaningful production growth, but European industry forecast are negative as economic concerns linger. Despite the macro issues and currency headwinds, our automotive sales in Europe are roughly flat during -- were roughly flat during second quarter and were up slightly for the first 6 months of the year. With those comments, I'll turn the call back over to Dave."

We now expect full year 2012 EPS of between $1.35 and $1.50 per share, up from our previous $1.25 to $1.45 per share estimate on sales of $3.65 billion to $3.8 billion. 
We began the year with an appropriately cautious view of the macro environment, especially given election-year uncertainties, with EPS guidance of $1.20 to $1.40 per share. We have now raised our full year estimate following both first and second quarters given solid first half performance. In each of the prior 2 years, after the second quarter, we were beginning to feel a contraction in our markets and in each case, reduced our full year guidance. That pattern does not seem to be repeating this year. Still, we're maintaining the degree of caution at the low-end of our guidance in the event that we were to experience a minor macro pullback. 
And lastly, I'd like to say, since we know that many of our employee shareholders are listening to our conference today, we want to thank them for their past and continued efforts, which have contributed to Leggett's improved execution and performance.

We are dealing with somewhat of a negative mix in that it feels like that the consumer in Europe is downgrading a little bit, that we felt a kind of a margin contraction from the mix from Pocketed Coils to more vinyls. But we're fortunate in that we're heavy weighted in Europe to the Scandinavians countries, Northern Europe and the U.K. and have lesser exposure to the Southern European countries. So things are really proceeding well. We are also benefiting from the de-verticalization of the U.K. manufacturer earlier this year as part of the Silentnight business. So that business is good business. So all things said and done, while the margins have been slightly negatively impacted, things are proceeding well in Europe, and as I noted in my comments, we're experiencing the same from an automotive perspective. Europe has not been a negative issue for Leggett up to this point."

Let's talk U.S. It would appear to me in bedding, we've got high-end springs under some pressure, maybe not, but certainly middle and shifting down strength in units at lower end. Where are hybrids? Are they helping yet? Pocketed coils is getting a lot of attention. Is that helping or are we still looking at a negative mix issue within Leggett on innersprings?

Comfort Core, which is our pocketed c",506,"John, this is Karl. Thanks for opening the door for a conversation on U.S. spring. And the news there is very, very positive, that we are seeing significant positive impact from the launch of the Hybrid product lines. Comfort Core, which is our pocketed coil offering, is the fastest growing part of U.S. frames, with units up 20%, significantly higher average unit selling prices, improved margins associated with that, great overhead recovery in our facilities as we continue to work hard to keep up with that demand. So there is -- while we made comment of a negative mix shift in macro residential, U.S. spring is not impacted to that -- to any degree from an inner spring perspective. It is impacted from a boxspring perspective. You are right about the bifurcation of the market, but I'd do not think that high-end innerspring has been negatively impacted. You'll go back to the Sealy conference call, they commented that Stearns is growing. We see that. We see that in our other customers with competitive offerings, high-end innerspring is doing extremely well. And we are very, very bullish and we'll continue to invest capital to support that growth. 
The middle market of the bedding industry is under pressure. The low end or the more promotional or somewhat, say, nonbranded business has been very, very strong. That correlates to our boxspring numbers and that you saw innersprings -- U.S. innersprings up 2%, boxsprings decreased 3%. I will tell you that is no loss of market share. It is indicative of fewer boxsprings being sold. There are no steel boxsprings under the promotional bedding. As adjustable beds grow significantly, that mitigates the need for an adjustable boxspring under that adjustable mattress and some of the specialty suite product, very few of the selected -- of the specialty suite product sit on top of a wire-based product. So all those dynamics don't bode up [ph] well for boxsprings, which is part of our residential mix explanation and that boxspring margins are higher than the rest of the segment. So there's a lot of moving parts. As it relates to home furniture, that flat unit's,  certainly from a sequential perspective, is an improvement over the first quarter. We have lost a little bit of market share that we have since regained and we do think that, that demand is indicative of the market. To elaborate on another inference in your question though, we are seeing a shift from U.S.-based mechanism production to Chinese-based mechanism production. That is not a finished furniture mix, that is a component mix. We retain the business in Asia. So it's not a positive situation for our U.S. factory workers, which we're not fond of that situation. But we do retain the business and retain it in Asia sometimes with lesser functionality as the furniture industry has become a little bit promotional with the significant inflation of falling European foam pricing. So that is also a negative shift. The units are there, but the average pricings drops slightly"

Just kind of a crossover on pocket coils, which continued to gain momentum in bedding. It's also interesting, and we may have mentioned to you previously, that pocket coils are being considered and indeed utilized in upholstered furniture cushions more than they have in the past for a couple of or for several reasons. One important one, being the cost of the polyurethane foam, which is replaced with the air and the wire and the fabric of the pocket coils. And needless to say, it makes a superior seat.

So things are good in automotive. We expect them to be good, and not only to the rest of this year, but into the foreseeable future years. There was a little bit of a negative in the second quarter in specialized and that our machinery volume was down slightly.

Our people have been working literally night and day getting these releases out and the products have been shipped on time with high quality and have really done a commendable job. And we have been congratulated by that retailer at this point, and are very optimistic that we will be in the front of the line for some of their planned releases in 2013."

Good morning, and thank you, all, for participating in our call. We are pleased with the second quarter earnings and margin improvement we reported yesterday. Earnings per share for the quarter were $0.45 compared to $0.37 during the seco",643,"Thank you, Dave. Good morning, and thank you, all, for participating in our call. We are pleased with the second quarter earnings and margin improvement we reported yesterday. Earnings per share for the quarter were $0.45 compared to $0.37 during the second quarter of last year. Second quarter 2012 earnings include a $0.04 per share unusual tax benefit and a $0.02 per share benefit in discontinued operations from a litigation settlement associated with the previously divested business. 
Second quarter of last year, earnings included $0.02 per share unusual tax benefit. Second quarter same location sales were down 2% from the prior year, primarily due to lower trade sales from our Rod mill, currency rates and lower store fixtures sales, a portion of which was volume we chose to exit. Apart from these 3 factors, same location sales increased 2%. 
Unit volumes were flat to positive across the majority of the company and the strongest growth continuing -- with the strongest growth continuing to come from our automotive and adjustable bed businesses. EBIT increased and EBIT margins improved both year-over-year and sequentially to 9.2% during the quarter. Earnings are benefiting, as expected, from higher unit volumes and the cost savings associated with the restructuring activities we initiated in late 2011. In addition, the Western Pneumatic Tube acquisition that we completed in January is exceeding our expectation for strong operating performance. We are very pleased with the return we're generating on this investment. 
Reflecting our broad focus on returns, we ended the quarter with working capital at 12% of annualized sales. Current liabilities include $41 million associated with an interest rate swap that we entered in 2010. Excluding this item, working capital was 13.1% of annualized sales, well below our 15% target. Cash from operations was strong during the quarter at $81 million. We expect operating cash for the full year of approximately $350 million, which had once again comfortably exceed the amount required to fund capital expenditures and dividends. 
Capital expenditures should be approximately $90 million this year and dividends should require about $160 million. We continue to maintain our strong financial base and ended the second quarter with net debt at 33% of net capital, which is within our long-term target range of 30% to 40%. 
In May, we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.28 per share. 2012 marks the 41st consecutive annual dividend increase for the company, a record we plan to extend. At yesterday's closing price of $22.49, the current dividend yield is 5%. Leggett possesses the highest dividend yield among all of the S&P 500 dividend aristocrats that have over 30 consecutive annual dividend increases. 
Given the cash outlay earlier in the year to acquire Western Pneumatic Tube, we did not complete any open market purchases of our stock during the second quarter. However, consistent with our stated priorities for the use of excess cash flow, we expect eventually to resume buying back our stock subject to the outlook for the economy, our level of cash generation and other potential opportunities to strategically grow the company. 
We have a standing authorization from the board to repurchase up to 10 million shares each year but have established no specific repurchase commitment or our timetable. We assess our overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return to that of peer companies on a rolling 3-year basis. Our target is to achieve TSR in the top 1/3 of the S&P 500 over the long term, which we believe will require an average TSR of 12% to 15% per year. 
For the 3-year period that began January 1, 2010, we have so far generated TSR of 8% per year on average or slightly below the midpoint of the S&P 500 companies over that same time period. With those comments, I'll turn the call over now to Karl Glassman who will provide some operating highlights."

Second quarter same location sales on the Residential Furnishings segment increased 1% with unit volume growth partially offset by the impact of currency exchange rates. 
In our U.S. Spring business, innerspring unit volumes increased 2% and boxspring units were down 3%. Innerspring units in Europe also increased 2%, which is notable in this current economic environment. 
In our Furniture Hardware business, unit volume was flat with the prior year. Again, this quarter, we had significant growth in adjustable beds with unit shipments up 20%. EBIT and EBIT margins in this segment decreased slightly versus the second quarter last year. The earnings benefit from slightly higher unit volumes in the current quarter was more than offset by weaker mix in certain businesses. 
In the Commercial Fixturing & Component segment, second quarter same location sales decreased 10% due to lower spending by key Fixture & Display customers and our decision to exit certain programs formerly supplied by operations we have closed or consolidated. Sales on office furniture components were flat during the quarter, which we believe is roughly in line with the overall market for office seating. EBIT and EBIT margins in the segment decreased versus second quarter of 2011, primarily from lower sales, higher restructuring related cost and absence of earnings from the U.K.-based Point of Purchase business we divested in January. These impacts were partially offset by restructuring-related benefits and better overhead absorption associated with increased production for a major program that will ship in the third quarter. The seasonality of our Store Fixtures business this year is expected to be consistent with the long-term historical pattern in which third quarter is the sales peak, primarily due to a major initiative by one of our large retail customers. We anticipate an improvement in segment results in the third quarter as a result of this additional volume. 
In the Industrial Materials segment, second quarter same location sales decreased 5%, primarily due to lower trade sales from our rod mill, partially offset by increased unit volumes in both Drawn Wire and Steel Tubing. The decrease in steel rod sales resulted from an equipment change over at the rod mill, which was an investment in process and quality improvement. The installation of the new equipment occurred late in the first quarter and production did not return to normal levels until early May. 
EBIT and EBIT margins for the segment increased in the quarter. Earnings benefit from the Western Pneumatic Tube acquisition and the plant consolidations announced in late 2011 contributed to the improvement. As Dave mentioned earlier, the Western Pneumatic Tube acquisition, which resides in the Industrial Materials segment, is exceeding our performance expectations. We continue to expect this business to produce full year 2012 margins greater than the company average. 
In the Specialized Products segment, second quarter same location sales increased 5% with unit volume growth partially offset by the impact of currency exchange rates. The increase in unit volumes resulted entirely from growth on automotive. Commercial vehicle products sales were roughly flat and machinery sales were down compared to the second quarter of last year. EBIT and EBIT margin increased during the quarter, largely due to higher sales. 
Automotive industry forecast anticipate continued growth in global production in 2012, but the outlook varies by geography. North America and Asia are both expected to have meaningful production growth, but European industry forecast are negative as economic concerns linger. Despite the macro issues and currency headwinds, our automotive sales in Europe are roughly flat during -- were roughly flat during second quarter and were up slightly for the first 6 months of the year. With those comments, I'll turn the call back over to Dave."

As we announced yesterday, we increased our full year guidance to reflect the positive effect of second quarter's unusual items and improved margins. We now expect full year 2012 EPS of between $1.35 and $1.50 per share, up from our previous $1.25 to $1.45 per share estimate on sales of $3.65 billion to $3.8 billion. 
We began the year with an appropriately cautious view of the macro environment, especially given election-year uncertainties, with EPS guidance of $1.20 to $1.40 per share. We have now raised our full year estimate following both first and second quarters given solid first half performance. In each of the prior 2 years, after the second quarter, we were beginning to feel a contraction in our markets and in each case, reduced our full year guidance. That pattern does not seem to be repeating this year. Still, we're maintaining the degree of caution at the low-end of our guidance in the event that we were to experience a minor macro pullback. 
And lastly, I'd like to say, since we know that many of our employee shareholders are listening to our conference today, we want to thank them for their past and continued efforts, which have contributed to Leggett's improved execution and performance. And with those comments, I'll turn the call back over to Dave DeSonier."

We are dealing with somewhat of a negative mix in that it feels like that the consumer in Europe is downgrading a little bit, that we felt a kind of a margin contraction from the mix from Pocketed Coils to more vinyls. But we're fortunate in that we're heavy weighted in Europe to the Scandinavians countries, Northern Europe and the U.K. and have lesser exposure to the Southern European countries. So things are really proceeding well. We are also benefiting from the de-verticalization of the U.K. manufacturer earlier this year as part of the Silentnight business. So that business is good business. So all things said and done, while the margins have been slightly negatively impacted, things are proceeding well in Europe, and as I noted in my comments, we're experiencing the same from an automotive perspective. Europe has not been a negative issue for Leggett up to this point."

And the news there is very, very positive, that we are seeing significant positive impact from the launch of the Hybrid product lines. Comfort Core, which is our pocketed coil offering, is the fastest growing part of U.S. frames, with units up 20%, significantly higher average unit selling prices, improved margins associated with that, great overhead recovery in our facilities as we continue to work hard to keep up with that demand. So there is -- while we made comment of a negative mix shift in macro residential, U.S. spring is not impacted to that -- to any degree from an inner spring perspective. It is impacted from a boxspring perspective. You are right about the bifurcation of the market, but I'd do not think that high-end innerspring has been negatively impacted. You'll go back to the Sealy conference call, they commented that Stearns is growing. We see that. We see that in our other customers with competitive offerings, high-end innerspring is doing extremely well. And we are very, very bullish and we'll continue to invest capital to support that growth. 
The middle market of the bedding industry is under pressure. The low end or the more promotional or somewhat, say, non-branded business has been very, very strong. That correlates to our boxspring numbers and that you saw innersprings -- U.S. innersprings up 2%, boxsprings decreased 3%. I will tell you that is no loss of market share. It is indicative of fewer boxsprings being sold. There are no steel boxsprings under the promotional bedding. As adjustable beds grow significantly, that mitigates the need for an adjustable boxspring under that adjustable mattress and some of the specialty suite product, very few of the selected -- of the specialty suite product sit on top of a wire-based product. So all those dynamics don't bode well for boxsprings, which is part of our residential mix explanation in that boxspring margins are higher than the rest of the segment. So there's a lot of moving parts. As it relates to home furniture, that flat unit's, certainly from a sequential perspective, is an improvement over the first quarter. We have lost a little bit of market share that we have since regained and we do think that, that demand is indicative of the market. To elaborate on another inference in your question though, we are seeing a shift from U.S.-based mechanism production to Chinese-based mechanism production. That is not a finished furniture mix, that is a component mix. We retain the business in Asia. So it's not a positive situation for our U.S. factory workers, which we're not fond of that situation. But we do retain the business and retain it in Asia sometimes with lesser functionality as the furniture industry has become a little bit promotional with the significant inflation of polyurethane foam pricing. So that is also a negative shift. The units are there, but the average pricings drops slightly"

Just kind of a crossover on pocket coils, which continued to gain momentum in bedding. It's also interesting, and we may have mentioned to you previously, that pocket coils are being considered and indeed utilized in upholstered furniture cushions more than they have in the past for a couple of or for several reasons. One important one, being the cost of the polyurethane foam, which is replaced with the air and the wire and the fabric of the pocket coils. And needless to say, it makes a superior seat. So that's been also a positive trend. I don't want to spin everything just totally positive, but that's something that's significant enough to mention."

So things are good in automotive. We expect them to be good, and not only to the rest of this year, but into the foreseeable future years. There was a little bit of a negative in the second quarter in specialized and that our machinery volume was down slightly.

At the midpoint of our sales guidance, the total company will be about up 2.5% and thinking about that across the segment, that would be approximately [Audio Gap] magnitude of increase in residential. Commercial likely down around 7%, but most of that is the divestiture and the volume that we chose to exit. I'll just remind you that at the end of last year, we saw the combination of those 2 things would probably extract about $40 million of sales for the full year. Industrial up, order of magnitude maybe around 6%, but again, that's going to include the Western Pneumatic Tube acquisition which should have annualized sales in the ballpark of about $65 million and specialized up somewhere on the 5%, 5.5% range. That's full year. We haven't done anything to try to help you really by quarter.

Before I start my formal comments, I want to let everyone know that our thoughts and prayers go out to all of our friends and indeed, all of the folks that are being affected by this horrific storm",706,"Good morning and thank you for participating in our call. Before I start my formal comments, I want to let everyone know that our thoughts and prayers go out to all of our friends and indeed, all of the folks that are being affected by this horrific storm, Sandy. We are especially sensitive to the trauma that such related events can cause and we hope for the best for many people dealing with this horrific storm.
So now, I'll come to my formal comments. We're very please with our third quarter results. As we reported yesterday, earnings per share from continuing operations were a record $0.45 during the quarter compared to earnings of $0.31 per share in the third quarter last year.
Third quarter same location sales increased 3% over the third quarter of 2011. Unit volumes increased 7% but were partially offset by lower trade sales from our rod mill and changes in currency rates. Sales grew in several of our major businesses, including the store fixtures, automotive, U.S. spring, furniture components, adjustable beds, carpet underlay and Commercial Vehicle Products.
As expected, we realized significant earnings leverage on the higher sales during the quarter. EBIT increased and EBIT margins improved both year-over-year and sequentially to 10.7%.
Earnings benefited from higher unit volumes, lower raw material costs and some of our operations and cost improvements associated with restructuring activities. In addition, the Western Pneumatic Tube acquisition that we completed in January continues to exceed our expectation for strong operating performance and contributed to the earnings and margin improvement during the quarter.
Optimizing returns continues to be a major focus for our operations. We ended the quarter with working capital at 13.2% of annualized sales, well below our 15% target.
We generated $95 million of cash from operations during the quarter. For the full year, we expect operating cash of more than $350 million, that once again comfortably exceed the amount required upon capital expenditures and dividends.
Capital expenditures should be approximately $80 million this year and dividends should require about $160 million. In anticipation of long-term debt maturing next April, during the quarter, we took advantage of the current attractive interest rate environment and issued $300 million of 10-year notes. With the proceeds, we reduced our use of commercial paper during the quarter and ended with nearly $600 million available under the existing commercial paper program.
Our financial base remains very strong. We ended September with net debt at 33% of net Capital. Which is comfortably within our long-term targeted range of 30% to 40%.
In August, we increase the quarterly dividend by $0.01 to $0.29 per share. 2012 marks the 41st consecutive annual dividend increase for the company, a record we plan to extend. At Friday's closing price of $25.40, the current dividend yield is 4.6%.
Leggett possesses the highest dividend yield among all of the S&P 500 dividends aristocrats that have over 30 consecutive annual dividend increases.
Given the cash outlay earlier in the year to acquire Western Pneumatic Tube, our share repurchases have been at levels well below those of recent years. During the third quarter, we purchased 600,000 shares of our stock, bringing our year-to-date total to 1 million shares. Consistent with our stated priorities for uses of excess cash flow, we will probably buy back our stocks, subject to the outlook for the economy, our level of cash generation and other potential opportunities to strategically grow the company.
We have outstanding authorization from the board to repurchase up to 10 million shares each year but we've established no specific repurchase commitment or timetable.
We assess our overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return to that of peer companies on a rolling 3-year basis. Our target is to achieve TSR in the top 1/3 of the S&P 500 over the long term, which we believe will require an average TSR of 12% to 15% per year.
For the 3-year period that began January 1, 2010, we have so far generated TSR of 14% per year on average, which places us in the upper half of the S&P 500 companies over that same time period.
With those comments, I'll turn the call over to Karl Glassman, who will provide some operating highlights."

Good morning. In my comments, I'll discuss a few segment highlights. You will find segment details in yesterday's press release and in the slide presentation on our website.
Third quarter same location sales in the Residential Furnishings segment increased 2% with 4% unit volume growth partially offset by changes in currency rates.
In our U.S. Spring business, sales were up 5%. Innerspring unit volumes grew 5% and boxspring units increased 3%. To Comfort Core, which is our pocketed coil, our product offering continues to significantly updates the innerspring categories and was up 34% in the third quarter. This is being driven by higher growth rates in the premium portion of the mattress market along with strong market reception of hybrid mattresses. 
European spring sales were down 10%, reflecting a 4% decrease in unit volume and changes in currency rates. Sales were also down in the other parts of international spring, and these volume declines continue to pressure segment margins. 
Furniture group sales increased 4%, with flat unit volumes in our motion hardware business, augmented by continued solid performance in our ceiling components and softer sleeper businesses. Again, this quarter, we have significant growth in adjustable beds with unit shipments up 21%. We also had meaningful sales growth in carpet underlay, performance is improving in carpet underlay with the growth in this businesses dilutive to overall segment margins since it has inherently lower EBIT margins than other parts of the segment. EBIT and EBIT margins in the segment increased versus the third quarter last year, primarily reflecting higher unit volumes and lower raw material costs in certain businesses. 
In the commercial fixturing and component segment, same location sales increased 21% in the third quarter. Fixture and display sales increased significantly as anticipated, primarily from strong sales activity with JCP or JCPenney to us older folks. 
Sales in the office furniture components were down slightly during the quarter, which we believe is roughly in line with the overall market for office seating. We were pleased to see significant earnings in margins improvement in the segment during the quarter. EBIT and EBIT margins increased to the highest level in several years, primarily benefiting from the increased sales and cost improvements that have been implemented in recent years. 
The seasonality of our store fixtures business this year is expected to be consistent with the historical pattern in which fourth quarter sales, EBIT and margins, are significantly lower than third quarter. Retailers generally plan the majority of their remodeling and new store activities so that it's complete ahead of the holiday season. This results in lower volume levels within the store fixtures industry during the fourth quarter. 
In the Industrial Materials segment, third quarter same location sales decreased 8%. Lower trade sales from our rod mill, more than offset 2% unit volume growth in other parts of the segments. The decrease in trade sales of steel rod during the quarter was largely offset by an increase in intercompany rod sales, so total production in the quarter was roughly flat with prior year. 
The rod mill continues to run at 100% capacity utilization, despite the negative sales headlines bakery, lower trade sales of the rod mill are not negative to earnings if production levels are stable and we're consuming the rod in our own wire mills. 
EBIT and EBIT margins from the segment increased in the quarter primarily due to lower raw material costs in certain businesses, earnings from the Western Pneumatic Tube acquisition and cost savings from plant consolidations. 
As Dave mentioned earlier, we continue to be very pleased with the performance of the Western Pneumatic Tube acquisition. The business is on track to comfortably exceed our initial first year forecast and as previously stated, should produce full-year 2012 margins greater than the company average. 
In the Specialized Products segment, third quarter same location sales increased 2%, with 5% unit volume growth partially offset by changes in currency rates.
 Unit volumes increased in both automotive and Commercial Vehicle Products during the quarter. These improvements where partially offset by lower machinery sales. The increase in automotive sales reflect strong growth in both North America and Asia but sales decreases in Europe from changes in currency rates and lower volumes.
EBIT and EBIT margins increased during the quarter, primarily from higher sales. With those comments, I'll turn the call back over to Dave."

This full year guidance implies fourth quarter earnings of $0.25 to $0.32 per share on sales of approximately $830 million to $880 million.

Then they softened in August with sales up only 1% and then re-strengthened in September with unit sales up 6% for the total quarterly sales of 5% growth. So I know that, that contradicts with the numbers. Our sales trends are our sales trends. So the Labor Day holiday was very, very strong, the September numbers continued into October with October units up 2% to 3%. Again, as you commented, we are seeing a significantly stronger mix of higher end products that is interesting to us that when we look year-on-year from an innerspring unit perspective, promotional innersprings, which are vitals and verticals, and of the low end, only grow about 1.5% units, the higher end, what we call the premium innerspring Comfort Core being part of that, grew 13%. So there was 230 basis point shift in premium from promotional. We expect that trend will continue. Not all Comfort Core is a part of hybrid but there's certainly a mixed shift, and those premium price points, which we define premium at retail of between $1,000 and $2,000 at [indiscernible] is certainly growing."

Before I start my formal comments, I want to let everyone know that our thoughts and prayers go out to all of our friends and, indeed, all of the folks that are being affected by this horrific sto",703,"Good morning, and thank you for participating in our call. Before I start my formal comments, I want to let everyone know that our thoughts and prayers go out to all of our friends and, indeed, all of the folks that are being affected by this horrific storm, Sandy. We're especially sensitive to the trauma that such weather-related events can cause, and we hope the best for the many people dealing with this horrific storm.
So now I'll commence my formal comments. We're very pleased with our third quarter results. As we reported yesterday, earnings per share from continuing operations were a record $0.45 during the quarter compared to earnings of $0.31 per share in the third quarter last year. Third quarter same-location sales increased 3% over the third quarter of 2011. Unit volumes increased 7% but were partially offset by lower trade sales from our rod mill and changes in currency rates.  
Sales grew in several of our major businesses, including store fixtures, automotive, U.S. spring, furniture components, adjustable bed, carpet underlay and commercial vehicle Products. As expected, we realized significant earnings leverage on the higher sales during the quarter. 
EBIT increased and EBIT margins improved both year-over-year and sequentially to 10.7%. Earnings benefited from higher unit volumes, lower raw material costs in some of our operations and cost improvements associated with restructuring activities. In addition, the Western Pneumatic Tube acquisition that we completed in January continues to exceed our expectation for strong operating performance and contributed to the earnings and margin improvement during the quarter.
Optimizing returns continues to be a major focus for our operations. We ended the quarter with working capital at 13.2% of annualized sales, well below our 15% target. We generated $95 million of cash from operations during the quarter. For the full year, we expect operating cash of more than $350 million which will once again comfortably exceed the amount required upon capital expenditures and dividends. Capital expenditures should be approximately $80 million this year, and dividends should require about $160 million. 
In anticipation of long-term debt maturing next April, during the quarter, we took advantage of the current attractive interest rate environment and issued $300 million of 10-year notes. With the proceeds, we reduced our use of commercial paper during the quarter and ended with nearly $600 million available under the existing commercial paper program. Our financial base remains very strong. We ended September with net debt at 33% of net capital, which is comfortably within our long-term targeted range of 30% to 40%.
In August, we increase the quarterly dividend by $0.01 to $0.29 per share. 2012 marks the 41st consecutive annual dividend increase for the company, a record we plan to extend. At Friday's closing price of $25.40, the current dividend yield is 4.6%. Leggett possesses the highest dividend yield among all of the S&P 500's Dividend Aristocrats that have over 30 consecutive annual dividend increases.
Given the cash outlay earlier in the year to acquire Western Pneumatic Tube, our share repurchases have been at levels well below those of recent years. During the third quarter, we purchased 600,000 shares of our stock, bringing our year-to-date total to 1 million shares. Consistent with our stated priorities for uses of excess cash flow, we will prudently buy back our stock subject to the outlook for the economy, our level of cash generation and other potential opportunities to strategically grow the company. We have outstanding authorization from the board to repurchase up to 10 million shares each year but have established no specific repurchase commitment or timetable. 
We assess our overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return to that of peer companies on a rolling 3-year basis. Our target is to achieve TSR in the top 1/3 of the S&P 500 over the long term, which we believe will require an average TSR of 12% to 15% per year. For the 3-year period that began January 1, 2010, we have so far generated TSR of 14% per year, on average, which places us in the upper half of the S&P 500 companies over that same time period.
With those comments, I'll turn the call over to Karl Glassman, who will provide some operating highlights."

Third quarter same-location sales in the Residential Furnishin",732,"Thank you, Dave. Good morning. In my comments, I'll discuss a few segment highlights. You will find segment details in yesterday's press release and in the slide presentation on our website. 
Third quarter same-location sales in the Residential Furnishings segment increased 2%, with 4% unit volume growth partially offset by changes in currency rates. In our U.S. spring business, sales were up 5%. Innerspring unit volumes grew 5%, and boxspring units increased 3%. 
Growth of Comfort Core, which is our pocketed coil product offering, continues to significantly outpace the other innerspring categories and was up 34% in the third quarter. This is being driven by higher growth rates in the premium portion of the mattress market, along with strong market reception of hybrid mattresses. 
European spring sales were down 10%, reflecting a 4% decrease in unit volume and changes in currency rates. Sales were also down in the other parts of international spring, and these volume declines continue to pressure segment margins.    
Furniture group sales increased 4%, with flat unit volumes in our motion hardware business, augmented by continued solid performance in our seating components and sofa sleeper businesses. Again, this quarter, we have significant growth in adjustable beds with unit shipments up 21%. We also had meaningful sales growth in carpet underlay. 
Performance is improving in carpet underlay with growth in this business as dilutive to overall segment margins since it has inherently lower EBIT margins than other parts of the segment. EBIT and EBIT margins in the segment increased versus the third quarter last year, primarily reflecting higher unit volumes and lower raw material costs in certain businesses.  
In the Commercial Fixturing & Components segment, same-location sales increased 21% in the third quarter. Fixture and display sales increased significantly as anticipated, primarily from strong sales activity with JCP, or JCPenney to us older folks. Sales in the office furniture components were down slightly during the quarter, which we're -- which we believe is roughly in line with the overall market for office seating. 
We were pleased to see significant earnings in margins improvement in the segment during the quarter. EBIT and EBIT margins increased to the highest level in several years, primarily benefiting from the increased sales and cost improvements that have been implemented in recent years. 
The seasonality of our store fixtures business this year is expected to be consistent with the historical pattern in which fourth quarter sales, EBIT and margins are significantly lower than third quarter. Retailers generally plan the majority of their remodeling and new store activities so that it's complete ahead of the holiday season. This results in lower volume levels within the store fixtures industry during the fourth quarter.  
In the Industrial Materials segment, third quarter same-location sales decreased 8%. Lower trade sales from our rod mill, more than offset 2% unit volume growth in other parts of the segments. The decrease in trade sales of steel rod during the quarter was largely offset by an increase in intercompany rod sales. So total production in the quarter was roughly flat with the prior year. 
The rod mill continues to run at 100% capacity utilization. Despite the negative sales headlines they create, lower trade sales of the rod mill are not negative to earnings if production levels are stable and we're consuming the rod in our own wire mills. 
EBIT and EBIT margins for the segment increased in the quarter, primarily due to lower raw material costs in certain businesses, earnings from the Western Pneumatic Tube acquisition and cost savings from plant consolidations. As Dave mentioned earlier, we continue to be very pleased with the performance of the Western Pneumatic Tube acquisition. The business is on track to comfortably exceed our initial first year forecast and, as previously stated, should produce full year 2012 margins greater than the company average.  
In the Specialized Products segment, third quarter same-location sales increased 2% with 5% unit volume growth partially offset by changes in currency rates. Unit volumes increased in both automotive and commercial vehicle products during the quarter. These improvements where partially offset by lower machinery sales. The increase in automotive sales reflect strong growth in both North America and Asia, but sales decreases in Europe from changes in currency rates and lower volumes. EBIT and EBIT margins increased during the quarter, primarily from higher sales. 
With those comments, I'll turn the call back over to Dave."

So I know that, that contradicts with the -- it's the numbers. Our sales trends are our sales trends. So the Labor Day holiday was very, very strong. Those September numbers continued into October with October units up 2% to 3%. Again, as you commented, we are seeing a significantly stronger mix of higher-end products that it's interesting to us that when we look year-on-year, from an innerspring unit perspective, promotional innersprings, which are Bonnells and VertiCoils, kind of the low end, only grew about 1.5% units. The higher end, or the what we call premium innerspring, Comfort Core being part of that, grew 13%. So there was 230 basis point shift in premium from promotional. We expect that trend will continue. Not all Comfort Core is a part of hybrid, but there is certainly a mixed shift. And those premium price points, which we define premium at retail of between $1,000 and $2,000 at queen, is certainly growing."

We have seen scrap, again, retreat somewhat in the October timeframe with an expectation that scrap will inflate to an equal or greater rate in November. So steel is volatile. It's been particularly volatile since about the April timeframe this year. So we'll see what happens. As regards to the international springs, that we have not anniversary-ed that transaction in the U.K. That was the de-verticalization of a costumer that took place in January. We continue to benefit from that. As I said in the prepared comments, European spring units were down 4%. Actually, dollars in Europe are positive in the October timeframe. So it's a challenging environment. Our -- we are the largest producer of innersprings in Europe. We were negatively impacted in the third quarter as we were in the second by mix. We'll see what the fourth quarter brings. I'll remind listeners that we tend to be heavy weighted in Northern Europe. We don't have a position in Southern Europe. The other thing that's impacting us, though, in international spring has been a softness in Brazil, South American, in particular, but more specifically, very specifically, Brazil, in that the monitory policies by the Brazilian government have -- were changed in the early part of the second quarter. So we're seeing some soft demand there as well."

Before I start my formal comments, I want to let everyone know that our thoughts and prayers go out to all of our friends and, indeed, all of the folks that are being affected by this horrific sto",705,"Good morning, and thank you for participating in our call. Before I start my formal comments, I want to let everyone know that our thoughts and prayers go out to all of our friends and, indeed, all of the folks that are being affected by this horrific storm, Sandy. We're especially sensitive to the trauma that such weather-related events can cause, and we hope the best for the many people dealing with this horrific storm.
So now I'll commence my formal comments. We're very pleased with our third quarter results. As we reported yesterday, earnings per share from continuing operations were a record $0.45 during the quarter compared to earnings of $0.31 per share in the third quarter last year. Third quarter same-location sales increased 3% over the third quarter of 2011. Unit volumes increased 7% but were partially offset by lower trade sales from our rod mill and changes in currency rates.  
Sales grew in several of our major businesses, including store fixtures, automotive, U.S. spring, furniture components, adjustable bed, carpet underlay and commercial vehicle products. As expected, we realized significant earnings leverage on the higher sales during the quarter. 
EBIT increased and EBIT margins improved both year-over-year and sequentially to 10.7%. Earnings benefited from higher unit volumes, lower raw material costs in some of our operations and cost improvements associated with restructuring activities. In addition, the Western Pneumatic Tube acquisition that we completed in January continues to exceed our expectation for strong operating performance and contributed to the earnings and margin improvement during the quarter.
Optimizing returns continues to be a major focus for our operations. We ended the quarter with working capital at 13.2% of annualized sales, well below our 15% target. We generated $95 million of cash from operations during the quarter. For the full year, we expect operating cash of more than $350 million which will once again comfortably exceed the amount required to fund capital expenditures and dividends. Capital expenditures should be approximately $80 million this year, and dividends should require about $160 million. 
In anticipation of long-term debt maturing next April, during the quarter, we took advantage of the current attractive interest rate environment and issued $300 million of 10-year notes. With the proceeds, we reduced our use of commercial paper during the quarter and ended with nearly $600 million available under the existing commercial paper program. Our financial base remains very strong. We ended September with net debt at 33% of net capital, which is comfortably within our long-term targeted range of 30% to 40%.
In August, we increased the quarterly dividend by $0.01 to $0.29 per share. 2012 marks the 41st consecutive annual dividend increase for the company, a record we plan to extend. At Friday's closing price of $25.40, the current dividend yield is 4.6%. Leggett possesses the highest dividend yield among all of the S&P 500's Dividend Aristocrats that have over 30 consecutive annual dividend increases.
Given the cash outlay earlier in the year to acquire Western Pneumatic Tube, our share repurchases have been at levels well below those of recent years. During the third quarter, we purchased 600,000 shares of our stock, bringing our year-to-date total to 1 million shares. Consistent with our stated priorities for uses of excess cash flow, we will prudently buy back our stock subject to the outlook for the economy, our level of cash generation and other potential opportunities to strategically grow the company. We have a standing authorization from the board to repurchase up to 10 million shares each year but have established no specific repurchase commitment or timetable. 
We assess our overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return to that of peer companies on a rolling 3-year basis. Our target is to achieve TSR in the top 1/3 of the S&P 500 over the long term, which we believe will require an average TSR of 12% to 15% per year. For the 3-year period that began January 1, 2010, we have so far generated TSR of 14% per year, on average, which places us in the upper half of the S&P 500 companies over that same time period.
With those comments, I'll turn the call over to Karl Glassman, who will provide some operating highlights."

In my comments, I'll discuss a few segment highlights. You will find segment details in yesterday's press release and in the slide presentation on our website. Third quarter same-location sales in the Residential Furnishin",733,"Thank you, Dave. Good morning. In my comments, I'll discuss a few segment highlights. You will find segment details in yesterday's press release and in the slide presentation on our website. 
Third quarter same-location sales in the Residential Furnishings segment increased 2%, with 4% unit volume growth partially offset by changes in currency rates. In our U.S. spring business, sales were up 5%. Innerspring unit volumes grew 5%, and boxspring units increased 3%. 
Growth of Comfort Core, which is our pocketed coil product offering, continues to significantly outpace the other innerspring categories and was up 34% in the third quarter. This is being driven by higher growth rates in the premium portion of the mattress market, along with strong market reception of hybrid mattresses. 
European spring sales were down 10%, reflecting a 4% decrease in unit volume and changes in currency rates. Sales were also down in the other parts of international spring, and these volume declines continue to pressure segment margins.    
Furniture group sales increased 4%, with flat unit volumes in our motion hardware business, augmented by continued solid performance in our seating components and sofa sleeper businesses. Again, this quarter, we have significant growth in adjustable beds with unit shipments up 21%. We also had meaningful sales growth in carpet underlay. 
Performance is improving in carpet underlay but growth in this business is dilutive to overall segment margins since it has inherently lower EBIT margins than other parts of the segment. EBIT and EBIT margins in the segment increased versus the third quarter last year, primarily reflecting higher unit volumes and lower raw material costs in certain businesses.  
In the Commercial Fixturing & Components segment, same-location sales increased 21% in the third quarter. Fixture and display sales increased significantly as anticipated, primarily from strong sales activity with JCP, or JCPenney to us older folks. Sales in the office furniture components were down slightly during the quarter, which we're -- which we believe is roughly in line with the overall market for office seating. 
We were pleased to see significant earnings and margins improvement in the segment during the quarter. EBIT and EBIT margins increased to the highest level in several years, primarily benefiting from the increased sales and cost improvements that have been implemented in recent years. 
The seasonality of our store fixtures business this year is expected to be consistent with the historical pattern in which fourth quarter sales, EBIT and margins are significantly lower than third quarter. Retailers generally plan the majority of their remodeling and new store activities so that it's complete ahead of the holiday season. This results in lower volume levels within the store fixtures industry during the fourth quarter.  
In the Industrial Materials segment, third quarter same-location sales decreased 8%. Lower trade sales from our rod mill, more than offset 2% unit volume growth in other parts of the segment. The decrease in trade sales of steel rod during the quarter was largely offset by an increase in intercompany rod sales. So total rod production in the quarter was roughly flat with the prior year. 
The rod mill continues to run at 100% capacity utilization. Despite the negative sales headlines they create, lower trade sales of the rod mill are not negative to earnings if production levels are stable and we're consuming the rod in our own wire mills. 
EBIT and EBIT margins for the segment increased in the quarter, primarily due to lower raw material costs in certain businesses, earnings from the Western Pneumatic Tube acquisition and cost savings from plant consolidations. As Dave mentioned earlier, we continue to be very pleased with the performance of the Western Pneumatic Tube acquisition. The business is on track to comfortably exceed our initial first year forecast and, as previously stated, should produce full year 2012 margins greater than the company average.  
In the Specialized Products segment, third quarter same-location sales increased 2% with 5% unit volume growth partially offset by changes in currency rates. Unit volumes increased in both automotive and commercial vehicle products during the quarter. These improvements were partially offset by lower machinery sales. The increase in automotive sales reflect strong growth in both North America and Asia, but sales decreases in Europe from changes in currency rates and lower volumes. EBIT and EBIT margins increased during the quarter, primarily from higher sales. 
With those comments, I'll turn the call back over to Dave."

So I know that, that contradicts with the -- it's the numbers. Our sales trends are our sales trends. So the Labor Day holiday was very, very strong. Those September numbers continued into October with October units up 2% to 3%. Again, as you commented, we are seeing a significantly stronger mix of higher-end products that it's interesting to us that when we look year-on-year, from an innerspring unit perspective, promotional innersprings, which are Bonnells and VertiCoils, kind of the low end, only grew about 1.5% units. The higher end, or the what we call premium innerspring, Comfort Core being part of that, grew 13%. So there was 230 basis point shift in premium from promotional. We expect that trend will continue.

We have seen scrap, again, retreat somewhat in the October timeframe with an expectation that scrap will inflate to an equal or greater rate in November. So steel is volatile. It's been particularly volatile since about the April timeframe this year. So we'll see what happens. As regards to the international spring, that we have not anniversaried that transaction in the U.K. That was the de-verticalization of a costumer that took place in January. We continue to benefit from that. As I said in the prepared comments, European spring units were down 4%. Actually, dollars in Europe are positive in the October timeframe. So it's a challenging environment. Our -- we are the largest producer of innersprings in Europe. We were negatively impacted in the third quarter as we were in the second by mix. We'll see what the fourth quarter brings. I'll remind listeners that we tend to be heavy-weighted in Northern Europe. We don't have a position in Southern Europe.

Before I start my formal comments, I want to let everyone know that our thoughts and prayers go out to all of our friends and, indeed, all of the folks that are being affected by this horrific sto",705,"Good morning, and thank you for participating in our call. Before I start my formal comments, I want to let everyone know that our thoughts and prayers go out to all of our friends and, indeed, all of the folks that are being affected by this horrific storm, Sandy. We're especially sensitive to the trauma that such weather-related events can cause, and we hope the best for the many people dealing with this horrific storm.
So now I'll commence my formal comments. We're very pleased with our third quarter results. As we reported yesterday, earnings per share from continuing operations were a record $0.45 during the quarter compared to earnings of $0.31 per share in the third quarter last year. Third quarter same-location sales increased 3% over the third quarter of 2011. Unit volumes increased 7% but were partially offset by lower trade sales from our rod mill and changes in currency rates.  
Sales grew in several of our major businesses, including store fixtures, automotive, U.S. spring, furniture components, adjustable bed, carpet underlay and commercial vehicle products. As expected, we realized significant earnings leverage on the higher sales during the quarter. 
EBIT increased and EBIT margins improved both year-over-year and sequentially to 10.7%. Earnings benefited from higher unit volumes, lower raw material costs in some of our operations and cost improvements associated with restructuring activities. In addition, the Western Pneumatic Tube acquisition that we completed in January continues to exceed our expectation for strong operating performance and contributed to the earnings and margin improvement during the quarter.
Optimizing returns continues to be a major focus for our operations. We ended the quarter with working capital at 13.2% of annualized sales, well below our 15% target. We generated $95 million of cash from operations during the quarter. For the full year, we expect operating cash of more than $350 million which will once again comfortably exceed the amount required to fund capital expenditures and dividends. Capital expenditures should be approximately $80 million this year, and dividends should require about $160 million. 
In anticipation of long-term debt maturing next April, during the quarter, we took advantage of the current attractive interest rate environment and issued $300 million of 10-year notes. With the proceeds, we reduced our use of commercial paper during the quarter and ended with nearly $600 million available under the existing commercial paper program. Our financial base remains very strong. We ended September with net debt at 33% of net capital, which is comfortably within our long-term targeted range of 30% to 40%.
In August, we increased the quarterly dividend by $0.01 to $0.29 per share. 2012 marks the 41st consecutive annual dividend increase for the company, a record we plan to extend. At Friday's closing price of $25.40, the current dividend yield is 4.6%. Leggett possesses the highest dividend yield among all of the S&P 500's Dividend Aristocrats that have over 30 consecutive annual dividend increases.
Given the cash outlay earlier in the year to acquire Western Pneumatic Tube, our share repurchases have been at levels well below those of recent years. During the third quarter, we purchased 600,000 shares of our stock, bringing our year-to-date total to 1 million shares. Consistent with our stated priorities for uses of excess cash flow, we will prudently buy back our stock subject to the outlook for the economy, our level of cash generation and other potential opportunities to strategically grow the company. We have a standing authorization from the board to repurchase up to 10 million shares each year but have established no specific repurchase commitment or timetable. 
We assess our overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return to that of peer companies on a rolling 3-year basis. Our target is to achieve TSR in the top 1/3 of the S&P 500 over the long term, which we believe will require an average TSR of 12% to 15% per year. For the 3-year period that began January 1, 2010, we have so far generated TSR of 14% per year, on average, which places us in the upper half of the S&P 500 companies over that same time period.
With those comments, I'll turn the call over to Karl Glassman, who will provide some operating highlights."

Third quarter same-location sales in the Residential Furnishin",733,"Thank you, Dave. Good morning. In my comments, I'll discuss a few segment highlights. You will find segment details in yesterday's press release and in the slide presentation on our website. 
Third quarter same-location sales in the Residential Furnishings segment increased 2%, with 4% unit volume growth partially offset by changes in currency rates. In our U.S. spring business, sales were up 5%. Innerspring unit volumes grew 5%, and boxspring units increased 3%. 
Growth of Comfort Core, which is our pocketed coil product offering, continues to significantly outpace the other innerspring categories and was up 34% in the third quarter. This is being driven by higher growth rates in the premium portion of the mattress market, along with strong market reception of hybrid mattresses. 
European spring sales were down 10%, reflecting a 4% decrease in unit volume and changes in currency rates. Sales were also down in the other parts of international spring, and these volume declines continue to pressure segment margins.    
Furniture group sales increased 4%, with flat unit volumes in our motion hardware business, augmented by continued solid performance in our seating components and sofa sleeper businesses. Again, this quarter, we have significant growth in adjustable beds with unit shipments up 21%. We also had meaningful sales growth in carpet underlay. 
Performance is improving in carpet underlay but growth in this business is dilutive to overall segment margins since it has inherently lower EBIT margins than other parts of the segment. EBIT and EBIT margins in the segment increased versus the third quarter last year, primarily reflecting higher unit volumes and lower raw material costs in certain businesses.  
In the Commercial Fixturing & Components segment, same-location sales increased 21% in the third quarter. Fixture and display sales increased significantly as anticipated, primarily from strong sales activity with JCP, or JCPenney to us older folks. Sales in the office furniture components were down slightly during the quarter, which we're -- which we believe is roughly in line with the overall market for office seating. 
We were pleased to see significant earnings and margins improvement in the segment during the quarter. EBIT and EBIT margins increased to the highest level in several years, primarily benefiting from the increased sales and cost improvements that have been implemented in recent years. 
The seasonality of our store fixtures business this year is expected to be consistent with the historical pattern in which fourth quarter sales, EBIT and margins are significantly lower than third quarter. Retailers generally plan the majority of their remodeling and new store activities so that it's complete ahead of the holiday season. This results in lower volume levels within the store fixtures industry during the fourth quarter.  
In the Industrial Materials segment, third quarter same-location sales decreased 8%. Lower trade sales from our rod mill, more than offset 2% unit volume growth in other parts of the segment. The decrease in trade sales of steel rod during the quarter was largely offset by an increase in intercompany rod sales. So total rod production in the quarter was roughly flat with the prior year. 
The rod mill continues to run at 100% capacity utilization. Despite the negative sales headlines they create, lower trade sales of the rod mill are not negative to earnings if production levels are stable and we're consuming the rod in our own wire mills. 
EBIT and EBIT margins for the segment increased in the quarter, primarily due to lower raw material costs in certain businesses, earnings from the Western Pneumatic Tube acquisition and cost savings from plant consolidations. As Dave mentioned earlier, we continue to be very pleased with the performance of the Western Pneumatic Tube acquisition. The business is on track to comfortably exceed our initial first year forecast and, as previously stated, should produce full year 2012 margins greater than the company average.  
In the Specialized Products segment, third quarter same-location sales increased 2% with 5% unit volume growth partially offset by changes in currency rates. Unit volumes increased in both automotive and commercial vehicle products during the quarter. These improvements were partially offset by lower machinery sales. The increase in automotive sales reflect strong growth in both North America and Asia, but sales decreases in Europe from changes in currency rates and lower volumes. EBIT and EBIT margins increased during the quarter, primarily from higher sales. 
With those comments, I'll turn the call back over to Dave."

So that in our seating and distribution business, which is a part of home furnishings, we are significantly being impacted in those categories: sofa sleepers; sinuous wire; welt cord; all of those ancillary products to upholstered furniture assembly in the U.S. I don't think that there's a significant market share -- market uplift in the sale of sofa sleepers to the end consumer."

Those September numbers continued into October with October units up 2% to 3%. Again, as you commented, we are seeing a significantly stronger mix of higher-end products that it's interesting to us that when we look year-on-year, from an innerspring unit perspective, promotional innersprings, which are Bonnells and VertiCoils, kind of the low end, only grew about 1.5% units. The higher end, or the what we call premium innerspring, Comfort Core being part of that, grew 13%. So there was 230 basis point shift in premium from promotional. We expect that trend will continue. Not all Comfort Core is a part of hybrid, but there is certainly a mixed shift.

As regards to the international spring, that we have not anniversary-ed that transaction in the U.K. That was the de-verticalization of a costumer that took place in January. We continue to benefit from that. As I said in the prepared comments, European spring units were down 4%. Actually, dollars in Europe are positive in the October timeframe. So it's a challenging environment. Our -- we are the largest producer of innersprings in Europe. We were negatively impacted in the third quarter as we were in the second by mix. We'll see what the fourth quarter brings. I'll remind listeners that we tend to be heavy-weighted in Northern Europe. We don't have a position in Southern Europe.
