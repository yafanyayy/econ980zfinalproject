Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'm very pleased to report another quarter of record results for revenue, non-GAAP EPS and free cash flow. This excellent performance enabled us to achieve record results for the fu",4058,"Thanks, Tony. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'm very pleased to report another quarter of record results for revenue, non-GAAP EPS and free cash flow. This excellent performance enabled us to achieve record results for the full year, driven by year-on-year growth in revenue of 18% to $20 billion and non-GAAP EPS of 20% and a free cash flow of 29%. Clearly, we're delivering on our ongoing commitment to strengthen our strategic position within the evolving IT landscape and on our triple play of gaining market share, reinvesting for growth and delivering leverage. 
These very strong results make us better prepared than ever to maintain our strategic agility and operational excellence as we head into 2012. As you know, fundamental changes are underway in IT right now, and it is our ability to identify and invest in these changes that has enabled us to achieve the solid Q4 and record full year else we're reporting today. The transformation of IT is occurring with customer shift to private, public and hybrid cloud models. The transformation of business is also underway as new technology is enabling organizations to harness the power of Big Data in ways that were impossible only a few years ago. The transformation of EMC is ongoing as we continue our evolution of our company in order to remain at the forefront of these expansive opportunities and help our customers advance in this new age. 
As we look across our business, it is clear that EMC is well equipped for this era of transformation. To begin with, customers' cloud and Big Data objectives are best served by having the right information storage infrastructure. Intelligent automated storage is a critical component as is the ability to give customers options because the nature and use of these expanding data sets are almost as varied as the data itself. Having a broad and best-of-breed product portfolio in storage is an important differentiator and has been a key reason for our success. Year-on-year, Information Storage revenue grew a healthy 12% over Q4 of last year. As expected, we have adequate hard disk drive supply for the period, although there were some charges relative to the availability of certain drive types. Product revenue was up 11% and 24% in the high-end and mid-tier, respectively. This is an excellent result and speaks to the strength of our offerings across a wide spectrum of different applications, implementations and used cases. For customers with mission-critical data sets meeting to scale with the best performance, reliability and availability, our high-end scale-out VMAX is consistently selected as a tool for the job. While these attributes have driven market our leadership in the high-end for years, our value proposition in this segment has grown as we've improved our product portfolio to accommodate the transformations of IT and business. For example, we introduced Flash drives to enterprise storage 4 years ago, unveiled our virtual matrix VMAX architecture 3 years ago and refreshed VMAX software capabilities just last year, doubling performance and adding faster VP. The innovations we are consistently introduced are important to customers make our high-end more useful and for their evolving needs. The results have been meaningful share gains in the high end over the past several years. 
The addition of FAST VP to VMAX last year enabled customers to more efficiently and automatically tier the information across Flash and SATA drives. Clearly, customers value this feature as the attach rates of FAST VP to VMAX continue to climb in Q4. The vast majority of these systems are leveraging both Flash and SATA drives and, in fact, Flash capacity sold in VMAX more than doubled year-on-year in Q4. 
The addition of VMAXe to the portfolio in 2011 expanded our addressable markets. VMAXe offers the reliability availability and many of our attributes of a VMAX in a smaller system, 1 designed specifically for businesses with limited space, IT staff or capacity needs. The VMAXe is meeting our objective of successfully reaching this tier of the market, particularly outside the U.S. Half of VMAXe sold in 2011 went to international customers. The VMAXe is also allowing us to gain new customers in the U.S. Average pizza is just 1 example of a brand-new EMC customer we won because the VMAXe meets their specific needs for powerful scale-out block storage in an efficient package. 
In 2011, the addition of VPLEX Geo expanded our VPLEX family by offering high-availability and distributed data access over extended businesses. The value proposition of VPLEX offers turning a secondary data center into a productive site enabling active, active data across distance, has transformed how our customers are architecting their cloud infrastructures. A bank in Poland was a great example of this in Q4. VPLEX's ability to seamlessly move their vSphere applications between data centers without any interruption is enabling them to take full advantage of their virtualized infrastructure as they can now do load-balancing and allow real-time data access over 2 data centers that are miles apart. This value proposition is as yet unmet by an competitive offering. It is innovation such as these that keep our products at the leading edge and broaden their used cases. You can expect us to continue our unrelenting pace of improvements here in 2012. 
The transformation of EMC has been most evident in our mid-tier product set. As customer needs in the mid-tier have expanded, we have expanded our portfolio accordingly to ensure we have the right tool for the job. In 2011, we launched our VNX Family to meet the needs of customers seeking simplicity by our unified architecture, better VMware integration and auto tiering, all of which combined to deliver greater efficiency and a lower total cost of ownership. As a result, our VNX Family has been warmly embraced by both existing and new customers alike and brought in almost 2,000 new customers to EMC in Q4 alone. It is also interesting to note that almost half the customers who bought VNX systems during 2011 have not purchased EMC unified systems before. 
In addition to winning new customers, our VNX product family won numerous awards in 2011, including awards for best storage for SQL by SQL server magazine; the best array for storage virtualization by readers virtualization review; and product of the year by CRN. Resellers have embraced the VNX and VNXe as their design with a channel in mind. They are some simple, efficient and powerful, offered options that meet the widely varying needs presented across the diverse base of customers. 
Our acquisition of Isilon just over a year ago was a key step in the transformation of our mid-tier business to better meet customers' cloud and Big Data needs. Isilon has thrived as part of EMC and its revenue more than doubled again year-on-year in Q4 and for the full year 2011. With its core value proposition of simplicity of scale, Isilon has always enjoyed a strong position in verticals such as media and life sciences and continues to do so. Our recent win of the Associated Press for video production and archiving is a great example. Now as part of EMC, Isilon has been rapidly gaining traction in a number of new accounts, used cases in verticals where our scale-out capabilities are required to handle rapid growth. As the integration of Isilon progressed during 2011, the EMC sales teams became better at identifying and offering customers the best solution for the job at hand and we saw the growing effectiveness in Q4. By offering the simplicity of a single file system, scalability in line with data growth, ease-of-use and management and lower CapEx to improve utilization, Isilon meets general-purpose data center use cases and accounts where Isilon previously didn't exist and that EMC wasn't serving before. This is the case that won the world's most diversified technology organizations. This Fortune 50 company purchased more than 2 petabytes of Isilon to unify its massive network of user shares and home directories, completely eliminating the incumbent NAS vendor from its filesharing environments. 
Another great illustration of why Isilon is thriving within our portfolio was a multiproduct win at a large health insurance company. The customer's seeking greater flexibility and performance across all applications in their virtualized environments and they also needed a single repository that was simple to manage and grow. With VMware integration that was tied to the incumbent NAS vendor that it demonstrates, VNX was selected for the continued development of the cloud architecture. And with superior scale and efficiency, Isilon displays the same incumbent vendor from a customer's secondary site for Data Protection. As this examples makes clear, the one-size-fits-all approach of storage is not ideal for today's environments. Having the right tool for the job is. 
Add-on to VNX and Isilon, the capabilities of Atmos the geographically dispersed data and you have a storage infrastructure offering to cloud and Big Data that is unparalleled. EMC's transformation in the mid-tier extends beyond production data infrastructure into backup and recovery. The combination of Avamar and Data Domain in our backup portfolio 2 years ago enabled us to offer backup solutions that fit hand in glove with new data set architectures. An excellent example was a multimillion dollar, multiproduct win in Q4, where the customer, a global technology company, with a heavily virtualized environment, purchased VMAXe for their production data and adopted a combination of Data Domain and Avamar for disaster recovery. Product synergies both across EMC and within our backup portfolio itself are a competitive advantage and part of the reason why we're being consistently growing faster than the backup markets. The Data Domain and Avamar alone, exiting the year at a revenue run rate well over $2 billion, our BRS division has become an essential part of our strategic offering. 
Through the transformation of our mid-tier storage portfolio, we've created a truly formidable offering that far exceeds the capabilities of more narrowly focused storage vendors and also far exceeds the storage capability of a server vendors. We are best-of-breed unified VNX Family which includes VNX and VNXe, complemented by our market-leading backup and recovery solutions, and also by our scale-out Isilon product family, we offer a winning combination that resonates with customers and has driven the share gains we've made in the mid-tier segment in 2011. Customers also appreciate the additional choices we give them to scale out block with VMAX and VNXe. 
As we have noted, the transformation that is characterizing the industry today goes beyond the transformation of IT and cloud infrastructures. Increasingly, the transformation of the business itself is being driven by the ability to harness Big Data. Businesses that can make timely use of the vast of data inside and outside the company can gain a robust competitive advantage. EMC Greenplum meets the needs in customers of all sizes, enabling them to sort through extremely large data sets in the neighborhood of millions of transactions pretty or hundreds of billions of clicks per month. The broad appeal of Greenplum's technology won us new customers across a broad spectrum of industries in Q4, including healthcare, technology, retail and communications, to name just a few, and really helped to drive Greenplum's strong Q4 results. Throughout 2011, Greenplum has been establishing full leadership in Big Data, and we expect to build on the foundation we put in place over the last 18 months to continuously drive penetration and growth. Greenplum's offering has expanded from a single product to a portfolio that includes the industry's only unified solution for Big Data analytics, the unified analytics platform. Unveiled just last month, that UAP, combines the coprocessing of structured and unstructured data with the productivity engine and social network that enables collaboration among data science teams. With this next generation portfolio for analytics and by leveraging the broader EMC sales force, our own data scientists, our channel partners and our growing partnership with SAS, we expect to help more customers than ever before begin to extract value from the Big Data that surrounds them. 
Cloud and Big Data objectives will only be fully met if a company's blueprint fits IT transformation builds in trust. Companies need robust security designed for today's advanced persistent threats. Our RSA Security division grew 16% in Q4, as its holistic agile, data-centric approach is the right one for the modern threat environments. We maintained our leadership position in identity management and protection, adding 1,400 new SecurID customers in 2011 and we saw strong growth in security management and compliance. 
Our security management and Compliance, which combines the capabilities of NetWitness, Archer, DLP and enVision, presents a unique risk base, agile and contextual approach to advanced threats. The integrated software of the SMC suite gathers and analyzes security Big Data to deliver insights in real-time. This is a winning offering with customers, particularly as security has become a top priority among CEOs and corporate boards. And IT infrastructure designed for cloud and Big Data also requires the ability to easily access capture and integrate information from different sources, and our information and intelligent groups offered facilitate these objectives. 
This quarter, our Information Intelligence Group made their core Documentum, Captiva and Document Sciences products available as a private cloud offering, using internally developed VQ technology. They also demonstrated new Big Data use cases using their Documentum xCP technology. Revenue was roughly flat from Q4 a year ago as IIG caps a year of transition and stabilization of its product portfolio and operations. A key underpinning of an enterprise infrastructure built for cloud and Big Data is virtualization. We're making great strides here with VMware crossing the $1 billion milestone for the first time in Q4 at close to $1.1 billion, an increase of 27% over last year's Q4. Having become the de facto standard for virtualization in enterprise data centers, we're a tested and trusted virtualization platform, VMware is uniquely positioned to address customer needs for easier management through the virtualization layer. In 2012, VMware will continue to enhance its strategic relevance: in the data center, by building on the foundation we've played with vSphere and expanding our capabilities and management and security; at the application layer, by supporting the development of new applications through cloud foundry and vFabric; and with the end-user, by continuing to improve and expand upon the capabilities of view and other enabling technologies for the seamless access to data and applications in the cloud. The investments we've made to improve the functionality of our storage products in virtualization environments are also paying off as many of our wins are due to tight integration and ease of operation with VMware. We had many search wins in Q4, including wins of several technology companies in India, manufacturers in Japan and 2 telecommunication companies in China, to name just a few. 
We have been making great strides in transforming our product portfolio to equip it with leading-edge capabilities for cloud and Big Data. Equally important has been the transformation of our go-to-market model to facilitate the adoption of these technologies by customers. Already equipped with sales team that's widely recognized as the best in the industry, we've been focused over the past few  years on further developing our go-to-market model. By leveraging our organization, expanding our relationships with existing channel partners, seeking out and incentivizing new channel partners and capitalizing on VCE, we continued to drive our customers towards the next generation IT infrastructures that will support cloud and Big Data in the future. 
Our own services organization had an excellent Q4 and full year 2011 as demand was very robust from customers seeking the most effective ways to get to cloud and leverage that Big Data assets. For EMC, this translated into implementation, support and consulting services, not only in storage, but also in security as customers begin to understand that the new threat environment requires a whole new way of thinking about security. Over the past few years, we've been transforming our services business by implementing productivity tools to enhance the profitability of our service offerings, and we've seen the fruits of our labor in our financial results and in our excellent customer satisfaction ratings. 
2011 was a transformational year for our channel program. With the combination of renewed focus, a vastly improved channel model and the launch of products designed with the channel in mind, the channel is responding. In 2011, over 1,700 partners began selling EMC products for the first time, and revenue from these new partners in 2011 accounted for almost 1/2 our channel revenue growth in 2011. Our existing partner base is energized as well with revenues through our 3 largest partners expanding approximately 50% in 2011. The initial success we have enjoyed has won us accolades, including being named company of the year by CRN. But perhaps the most exciting part of our story is we still have a lot of room to grow. 
VCE has become a major force in the IT industry and an important element of our technology portfolio and our go-to-market model. VCE's strong momentum is due to the fact that more companies are recognizing the value proposition of the Vblock, and many of those that have are now working to standardize it. Given that Converged Infrastructure is a relatively new concept and Vblocks are very new products, we're extremely pleased of the adoption rate thus far. The order rate for Vblocks in Q4 exceeded $800 million on an annualized basis as we rapidly close in on the $1 billion run rate goal we highlighted last year. We expect continued success as Vblocks become more well known and sought after for their unique value proposition, a single converge product, single pane of glass for management, a clear upgrade path and 1 point of contact for customer support or on rocksolid technology from best-of-breed vendors. The appeal of Vblock is global as wins in the quarter include the Spanish National Statistics Institute, a Swiss pharmaceutical company, a Mexican IT service provider, a Russian energy company, an Australian bank and a large equipment distributor in the U.S. 
We think that the strength of our position is clear. Our product portfolio that has been developed with customers' current and future needs in mind and which will continue to evolve to remain the leading edge of efficiency, agility in trust to cloud and Big Data architectures; a powerful go-to-market model through our direct sales force and service teams and expanded server channel partners and unique joint venture in VCE; and perhaps most importantly a vision, strategy and roadmap that is in lockstep with 2 of the biggest trends in technology, cloud and Big Data. We leverage all these strengths through 2011 not only to enhance our market position, but also to drive excellent results. 
Consolidated revenue grew 14% in Q4, led by growth of 26% in APJ, with revenue growth of 16% in the Americas and 6% in EMEA. Our BRIC + 13 revenue grew 22% in Q4 as we continue to make progress penetrating these rapid growth markets. We've been stepping up our investments in these geographies as their growth will continue to materially outpace more established markets. 
Non-GAAP gross margin improved once again in Q4, up 260 basis points over last year's fourth quarter to 64.5%. We made exceptional progress in gross margins throughout 2011 due to volume and mix shifts, including introduction of Isilon, FAST VP and bundled VNX software products to our revenue stream. For the full year, we improved non-GAAP gross margin by 220 basis points to 62.2%. Gains in gross margins continue to drive progress in non-GAAP operating margin, which was 26.3% for Q4, 90 basis points higher than Q4 2010. For the full year, non-GAAP operating margin was 23.9%, 190 points higher than 2010. Operating expense in 2011 reflected the important investments we've been making in our go-to-market. For 2012, expect to see SG&A growth more aligned with the revenue growth and the allocation of more of our resources to R&D. 
Our strong execution drove record free cash flow of $4.4 billion for 2011, more than $1 billion higher than 2011 non-GAAP net income. Contributing to this was continued strong growth in deferred revenue of 32% to $6.2 billion. Driven over the course of the year by strong services bookings renewals, the expansion of deferred revenues helps to balance our more transaction-oriented business with a growing stream of more predictable revenue. We continue to manage our cash prudently to meet our objectives or returning value to the shareholders while making the right investments we need to keep us positioned for the long term. We returned $2 billion to shareholders through our buyback program over the course of 2011 and ended the year with $10.8 billion of cash and investments. Earlier this month, we used $1.7 billion of this cash balance to settle the first tranche of our convertible debt, and we plan to return an additional $700 million to shareholders in 2012 through EMC share buybacks. We will continue to deploy our cash wisely throughout 2012 by making strategic and disciplined acquisitions and reinvesting in our business to drive growth. 
We ended 2011 incrementally better positioned because of our triple play, gaining market share, reinvesting in the business and delivering leverage. In 2011, we gained market share not only because we have a broad portfolio of best-of-breed products built for the next wave of IT but also because our go-to-market approach continues to expand and mature. These advantages will also drive growth in 2012 and beyond. We were able to make strides in market share in 2011 because we have been investing for growth through strategic acquisition, investments in our partner ecosystem and go-to-market and in our own R&D. In 2012, we will continue to invest both externally and internally, especially in our own R&D in order to keep our leading-edge position in this very dynamic environment. 
In 2011, we do have an EPS leverage and are poised to continue to deliver leverage for the next several years. In 2012, we will continue this progress. While Joe will give more color on our view of the environments, a few of the factors built into our expectations include slower growth in IT spend, a headwind concurrency and from hard disk drive supply constraints. 
As you can see, we've laid out here for you all the assumptions that are guiding our expectations. We expect to achieve revenue growth in 2012 better than twice the projected growth of IT spend to $22 billion with non-GAAP EPS growing faster to $1.70 a share. We've modeled our revenue to follow a seasonally normal percentage of total for each quarter during the year. As you may recall, early last year, we presented our view of the growth potential for each of our lines of business. Our view of our long-term growth prospects has not changed as we operate in some of the hottest areas of IT where secular growth trends are strong and expected to persist. On top of this, we hold the leading position in the vast majority of these. As a result, we continue to expect our high-end storage and IIG business to grow in the range of 1% to 10%. We see our unified storage line, RSA and consulting growing in the 10% to 19% range. And we expect our higher growth businesses, including VMware, Isilon, BRS and VCE, to remain on track for 20% or higher compound annual growth rate over the 4-year period. This dynamic, along with our solid performance in 2011, puts us squarely on track to achieve the financial potential we laid out for you last February. Over $28 billion of revenue in 2014, which represents compounded annual revenue growth of at least 13% from 2010 and non-GAAP EPS growth even faster than this. 
This is truly a transformational time. IT is transforming to more efficient and agile cloud models. Business will be transformed by Big Data and EMC continues to transform its business to capitalize on these trends. Propelled by the many sound fundamentals of our markets, customer demand, our offerings, our partner ecosystem, our strategy and visible execution, we fully expect to continue this success we've achieved over the past several years to capitalize on what we think are the biggest opportunity the IT industry has ever presented. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Joe. Joe?"
121729,145793347,209698,"EMC Corporation, Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Jan 24, 2012",2012-01-24,"Earnings Calls","Dell EMC","Executives","Thanks, David. I'd like to begin by welcoming everyone to today's call. Thank you for joining us. I am pleased with our overall performance in Q4. Our results were strong and our balanced execution capped on a very successful 2011. For the year, EMC's r",1416,"Thanks, David. I'd like to begin by welcoming everyone to today's call. Thank you for joining us. I am pleased with our overall performance in Q4. Our results were strong and our balanced execution capped on a very successful 2011. 
For the year, EMC's revenues grew 18%, and to be totally transparent, normalizing the effect of our acquisitions, we grew at 16% on an apples-to-apples basis while producing substantial leverage as our non-GAAP EPS grew 20%. I would like to congratulate and thank the now over 53,000 dedicated people of EMC and VMware for their hard work and dedication. It is truly a pleasure to work by your side. 
Now let's turn to the 1 thing that I'm quite sure is on everyone's mind: namely, our thoughts and beliefs on the global economic environment and its impact on 2012 IT spending. We have no doubt that the global economy will remain choppy as it has for the vast majority of 2011, especially as it was on the second half. Within this economic landscape, we strongly believe that there will be real growth in IT spending this year. To put a number on it, we expect 3% to 4% growth in overall IT spending in 2012 over 2011. Putting this in context, this is about 1/2 of the 7% growth rate that we believe the IT industry experienced in 2011. But again, we see real growth. Within this 3% to 4%, there will be a lot of variability. There will be variability in geographies. We expect IT spending in Asia and Japan, Latin America, Middle East and Africa, to be up 6% to 8% year-over-year. We expect IT spending in the U.K. and the Eurozone to be roughly flat. And we expect North American, Eastern European and Japanese markets to grow IT spending at 3% to 4%. There will also be variability across IT sectors. IT spending in storage and Data Protection will grow faster than the IT industry average, and IT spending for security, Big Data storage, Big Data analytics, virtualization, data center OSS and cloud device virtualization automation will grow significantly faster than the IT average. The good news is that these higher growth areas of IT are where EMC and VMware play and where we have leadership positions and, very importantly, where we have momentum. 
For those of you on the webcast today, we have included 3 analyst surveys that demonstrate high spending intentions in the IT areas I just mentioned. That said, the key to our success in 2012 will be the strength of our innovative products and services, which will be further enhanced by a number of robust product launches during the year. This year, we plan to introduce a long list of new and exciting products into the market. We plan to launch a refresh of the NXE [ph] an increase author capabilities and performance enhancements across the VNX product line. We plan to reduce a new VMAX with even more software functionality, scale, capacity and performance. We plan to announce the general availability of project lighting, our service side Flash product that is fully integrated with our fully automated storage tiering technology commonly called FAST. Please join us in 2 weeks for this exciting launch. And by the way, while I'm on the subject of Flash, we will continue to enhance our extensive Flash and FAST capabilities across all of our stores platforms. 
We plan to refresh our Data Domain on Avamar product lines, featuring increased performance and scale, with enhanced offer functionality. We will also have even tighter integration between these 2 products. We also have planned product refreshes of Isilon this year, featuring increased performance, scale and virtualization support and functionality enhancements for enterprise use cases. 
RSA planned significant announcements around security management and compliance and identity and Data Protection. And VMware plans to deliver new functionality in all of their major product families, the vSphere cloud infrastructure suite, as well as vFabric, cloud Foundry, view and horizon. Again, these are just a few of the exciting new product launches you can expect to see from us this year. 
I guess the second question on your mind is about this driver availability especially for the first half of this year. To be clear, the floods in Thailand have a major impact on the disk drive industry. Some the major players and many of their supply chain vendors were directly affected by the flooding. For instance, 2/3 of all drive motors are made in this flood-affected region. The executives of the major drive companies are doing a superb job working with their supply chains in reestablishing their production capabilities. We told you on our Q3 call that we expect it to be okay in Q4 and that we would meet our revenue and EPS expectations, and we did just that. We also told you we would give you more color about drive availability for 2012 when we report at Q4. To amplify what David has already said, we expect there to be drive availability constraints throughout 2012, and we expect these constraints to apply more to near line drives and mission-critical drives. There is potential for availability constraints to improve in the second half of 2012. And given our strong relationship with our major driver vendors, we at EMC expect to be relatively better positioned. 
So given the factors I just mentioned, the choppy economy, real growth in IT spending, the industry constraints around drive availability and our strong product portfolio and roadmap, I would now like to reiterate our expectations and our financial goals for 2012. This year, we expect revenues of $22 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $1.70. As is our custom, these are the financial goals that were approved by our board and they are the goals in which management will be evaluated and compensated. Also, in very early February, our board will give us in additional goal for free cash flow. This goal will clearly be higher than the $4.4 billion we produced in 2011. As we strive to meet and hopefully beat these financial goals, our guiding light will be our strategies for private and hybrid cloud computing, Big Data and security for we firmly believe that in the intersection of cloud, Big Data and trust, areas there is massive opportunity. 
As I hope you can see from our solid Q4 and full year else, as well as our 2012 outlook, consolidated EMC is extremely well positioned to benefit from what our leadership team and I believe is a game-changing shift taking place in IT, a shift to IT-As-A-Service commonly called cloud computing. In that regard, I'm confident we have a compelling strategy to capitalize on the opportunities ahead, including leading technologies, products and services and what I believe are the most dedicated and hard-working employees with a passion for excellence, who, first and foremost, understand the importance of putting our customers' interest first. 
In closing, I am well aware that the topic of my succession has been a matter of some interest, so let me quickly address it and put it to bed. Based upon our business performance and some prospects for continued success, EMC's Board of Directors has requested that I remain Chairman and CEO into 2013. Equally as important to me is the fact that I am truly blessed and honored to work with an extremely talented senior leadership team here at EMC and VMware. And they, to a person, have also been actively encouraging me to rethink my transition plans. After much soul-searching, I have agreed to extend my role as Chairman and CEO into 2013. From a personal perspective, I have never been more energized and excited by what this great company can accomplish. And as I've said in the past, the board and I fully expect that my successor will come from within the existing, talented and experienced ranks of the EMC management team. I have already started to increase the responsibilities of my senior leadership team, and when the time is right, my successor will be named. Until then, we have much work to do and I am extremely grateful that I have the strong support and commitment of our board, as well as our senior leadership team to work alongside me as we pursue our full business potential. Thank you all again for being with us today. I would now like to turn it back to Tony to moderate the Q&A portion of today's call. Tony?"

Going back to VNXe, absolutely on track. We had a huge program inside the company this year, focused upon what we call the lower end of the mid-tier marketplace, and our growth rate in the lower end of the mid-tier market has been significantly higher than our growth in the higher end of the mid-tier market, which is what we've been trying to do this year, so we're very pleased. A lot of those net new partners I talked about, the 1,700 new customers partners, who came through the year solar products for the first time were also selling VNXe.

Obviously, 1 of the things I've said is 1 of the things we've got to overcome this year was, obviously, as we've separated from Dell, that was a big channel. The other thing I'd pointed out early on was, having Dell as a key partner made it very difficult to attract a variety in the kind of channel partners we need to go the other way. So what we're really focused on is saying, okay, the Dell divorce is finalized, so to speak, and we need you, we want you. And we've done all the things that you would think we've done. We've made sure that we're worried about the margins, not only of ourselves, but of our channel partners. We took our comp plans and made it favorable for our sales forces to partner with the news, the channels to become successful. When we build products like VNXe and VNX, channel-ready, adding new products into the channel like scaled-out Isilon and things we've done with the Data Domain and Avamar, I mean all these things give breadth to the channel, like everybody else in life. I don't think any company or any channel partner wants to be totally dedicated to 1 company, but they want to kind of narrow their scope and really go deep with their chosen partners. So we've really stepped up and done that role. So I think those are the key things we've done. Are we done? Never. We got to continue to. There's a lot of things we can do better and we are dedicated on this path, and I love the fact that we have a big and very successful and somewhat revered direct salesforce and getting that direct sales force and channels, it's not or it's and channels working together is a powerful, powerful go-to-market message and that's what we're going to do."

In 2011, we had more than $1 billion higher than our non-GAAP net income. Deferred revenue was the biggest driver of that. We expect continued deferred revenue growth in 2012 mainly from prepaid maintenance contracts, prepaid service contracts that are doing very well for us. So we'll give you a number when we next speak. But obviously, it's going to be north of $4.4 billion. It's going to be north of our 2012 non-GAAP net income. In terms of uses of cash, we have actually, as I mentioned, early this quarter, we spent $1.7 billion to retire the first half of our convertible debt, so that has actually happened. So that's a deduction from our year-end cash balance. I gave you the number that we would spend on EMC buybacks during this year, about $700 million. On the VMware side, we will, on the EMC side, we will reduce the amount we're spending on VMware buybacks and we'll move more of that load towards VMware. In total, we will buy back to keep EMC's ownership around 80%, but the EMC contribution will be less than it was in 2011. Final question was VCE, thank you. VCE will be a combination of what we spent to cover operating expenses, plus what we spent to fund working capital. We're expect our cash funding to VCE to be roughly similar in 2012 to what it was in 2011."

And whilst lead times will be a little longer for certain items that we would normally expect, we will get the drive to meet our numbers. So it's really a question of extra work to do more work through the supply chain and working in our field and our customers to kind of satisfy their needs in a constrained market environment. So it's not affecting our seasonality, as I discussed in my comments. In terms of gross margins, when you look at the business, we do expect continued progression positively in gross margins, if you just kind of look at the relative growth of various segments of the business and the mix changes inside the business, we do expect gross margins to continue to improve for EMC in 2012. But as you know, we've guided to relatively constant operating margins from 2011.

And as we have more and more software enhancements come out, I think you'll see continued more and more penetration of those kind of accounts, too. So we're very excited when Isilon became part of the family, and I could tell you without a doubt that we're even more excited today than we were when we bought it. So we've got great prospects ahead."

I'm very pleased to report another quarter of record results for revenue, non-GAAP EPS and free cash flow. This excellent performance enabled us to achieve record results for the full year, driven by year-on-year growth in revenue of 18% to $20 billion and non-GAAP EPS of 20% and a free cash flow of 29%. Clearly, we're delivering on our ongoing commitment to strengthen our strategic position within the evolving IT landscape and on our triple play of gaining market share, reinvesting for growth and delivering leverage.
These very strong results make us better prepared than ever to maintain our strategic agility and operational excellence as we head into 2012. As you know, fundamental changes are underway in IT right now, and it is our ability to identify and invest in these changes that has enabled us to achieve the solid Q4 and record full year results we're reporting today. The transformation of IT is occurring with customer shifts to private, public and hybrid cloud models. The transformation of business is also underway as new technology is enabling organizations to harness the power of Big Data in ways that were impossible only a few years ago. The transformation of EMC is ongoing as we continue our evolution of our company in order to remain at the forefront of these expansive opportunities and help our customers advance in this new age.
As we look across our business, it is clear that EMC is well equipped for this era of transformation. To begin with, customers' cloud and Big Data objectives are best served by having the right information storage infrastructure. Intelligent automated storage is a critical component as is the ability to give customers options because the nature and use of these expanding data sets are almost as varied as the data itself. Having a broad and best-of-breed product portfolio in storage is an important differentiator and has been a key reason for our success. Year-on-year, Information Storage revenue grew a healthy 12% over Q4 of last year. As expected, we have adequate hard disk drive supply for the period, although there were some charges relative to the availability of certain drive types. Product revenue was up 11% and 24% in the high-end and mid-tier, respectively. This is an excellent result and speaks to the strength of our offerings across a wide spectrum of different applications, implementations and use cases. For customers with mission-critical data sets needing to scale with the best performance, reliability and availability, our high-end scale-out VMAX is consistently selected as the tool for the job. While these attributes have driven market our leadership in the high-end for years, our value proposition in this segment has grown as we've improved our product portfolio to accommodate the transformations of IT and business. For example, we introduced flash drives to enterprise storage 4 years ago, unveiled our virtual matrix VMAX architecture 3 years ago and refreshed VMAX's software capabilities just last year, doubling performance and adding faster VP. The innovations we have consistently introduced are important to customers and make our high-end more useful and for their evolving needs. The results have been meaningful share gains in the high end over the past several years. 
The addition of FAST VP to VMAX last year enabled customers to more efficiently and automatically tier the information across flash and SATA drives. Clearly, customers value this feature as the attach rate of FAST VP to VMAX continue to climb in Q4. The vast majority of these systems are leveraging both flash and SATA drives and, in fact, flash capacity sold on VMAX more than doubled year-on-year in Q4.
The addition of VMAXe to the portfolio in 2011 expanded our addressable market. VMAXe offers the reliability, availability and many of our attributes of a VMAX in a small system, one designed specifically for businesses with limited space, IT staff or capacity needs. The VMAXe is meeting our objective of successfully reaching this tier of the market, particularly outside the U.S., although half of VMAXe sold in 2011 went to international customers. The VMAXe is also allowing us to gain new customers in the U.S. Average [ph] Pizza is just one example of a brand-new EMC customer we won because the VMAXe meets their specific needs for powerful scale-out block storage in an efficient package. 
In 2011, the addition of VPLEX Geo expanded our VPLEX family by offering high-availability and distributed data access over extended distances. The value proposition of VPLEX offers, turning a secondary data center into a productive site enabling active/active data across distance, has transformed how our customers are architecting their cloud infrastructures. A bank in Poland was a great example of this in Q4. VPLEX's ability to seamlessly move their vSphere applications between data centers without any interruption is enabling them to take full advantage of their virtualized infrastructure as they can now do load-balancing and allow real-time data access over 2 data centers that are miles apart. This value proposition is as yet unmet by any competitive offering. It is innovation such as these that keep our products at the leading edge and broaden their use cases. You can expect us to continue our unrelenting pace of improvements here in 2012.
The transformation of EMC has been most evident in our mid-tier product set. As customer needs in the mid-tier have expanded, we have expanded our portfolio accordingly to ensure we have the right tool for the job. In 2011, we launched our VNX Family to meet the needs of customers seeking simplicity by our unified architecture, better VMware integration and auto tiering, all of which combine to deliver greater efficiency and at lower total cost of ownership. As a result, our VNX Family has been warmly embraced by both existing and new customers alike, and brought in almost 2,000 new customers to EMC in Q4 alone. It is also interesting to note that almost half the customers who bought VNX systems during 2011 have not purchased EMC unified systems before.
In addition to winning new customers, our VNX product family won numerous awards in 2011, including awards for Best Storage Array for SQL by SQL Server Magazine, the Best Array for Storage Virtualization by readers of Virtualization Review, and product of the year by CRN. Resellers have embraced the VNX and VNXe as they're designed with a channel in mind. They are some simple, efficient and powerful, offering options that meet the widely varying needs presented across the diverse base of customers.
Our acquisition of, Isilon just over a year ago, was a key step in the transformation of our mid-tier business to better meet customers' cloud and Big Data needs. Isilon has thrived as part of EMC and its revenue more than doubled again, year-on-year, in Q4 and for the full year 2011. With its core value proposition of simplicity of scale, Isilon has always enjoyed a strong position in verticals such as media and life sciences, and continues to do so. Our recent win at the Associated Press for Video Production and Archiving is a great example. Now as part of EMC, Isilon has been rapidly gaining traction in a number of new accounts, use cases and verticals where scale-out capabilities are required to handle rapid growth. As the integration of Isilon progressed during 2011, the EMC sales teams became better at identifying and offering customers the best solution for the job at hand, and we saw the growing effect of this in Q4. By offering the simplicity of a single file system, scalability in line with data growth, ease-of-use and management, and lower CapEx for improved utilization, Isilon meets general-purpose data center use cases and accounts where Isilon previously didn't exist and that EMC wasn't serving before. This is a case that won the world's most diversified technology organizations. This Fortune 50 company purchased more than 2 petabytes of Isilon to unify its massive network of user shares and home directories, completely eliminating the incumbent NAS vendor from its file sharing environment.
Another great illustration of why Isilon is thriving within our portfolio was a multiproduct win at a large health insurance company. The customer is seeking greater flexibility and performance across all applications in their virtualized environments, and they also needed a single repository that was simple to manage and grow. With VMware integration that was tighter than the incumbent NAS vendor could demonstrates, VNX was selected for the continued development of the cloud architecture. And with it's superior scale and efficiency, Isilon displaced the same incumbent vendor from the customer's secondary site for data protection. As this examples makes clear, the one-size-fits-all approach to storage is not ideal for today's environments. Having the right tool for the job is.
Add-on to VNX and Isilon the capabilities of Atmos, the geographically dispersed data, and you have a storage infrastructure offering for cloud and Big Data that is unparalleled. EMC's transformation in the mid-tier extends beyond production data infrastructure into backup and recovery. The combination of Avamar and Data Domain in our backup portfolio 2 years ago enabled us to offer backup solutions that fit hand-in-glove with new data center architectures. An excellent example was a multimillion dollar, multiproduct win in Q4 where the customer, a global technology company with a heavily virtualized environment, purchased VMAXe for their production data and adopted a combination of Data Domain and Avamar for disaster recovery. Product synergies, both across EMC and within our backup portfolio itself, are a competitive advantage and part of the reason why we've being consistently growing faster than the backup market. With Data Domain and Avamar alone, exiting the year at a revenue run rate well over $2 billion, our BRS division has become an essential part of our strategic offering.
Through the transformation of our mid-tier storage portfolio, we've created a truly formidable offering that far exceeds the capabilities of more narrowly focused storage vendors and also far exceeds the storage capability of the server vendors. We are best-of-breed unified VNX Family which includes VNX and VNXe, complemented by our market-leading backup and recovery solutions and also by our scale-out Isilon product family, we offer a winning combination that resonates with customers and has driven the share gains we've made in the mid-tier segment in 2011. Customers also appreciate the additional choices we give them to scale out block with VMAX and VNXe. 
As we have noted, the transformation that is characterizing the industry today goes beyond the transformation of IT and cloud infrastructures. Increasingly, the transformation of business itself is being driven by the ability to harness Big Data. Businesses that can make timely use of the vast throves of data stored both within inside and outside a company can gain a robust competitive advantage. EMC Greenplum meets the needs in customers of all sizes, enabling to sort through extremely large data sets in the neighborhood of millions of transactions per day or hundreds of billions of clicks per month. The broad appeal of Greenplum's technology won us new customers across a broad spectrum of industries in Q4, including healthcare, technology, retail, and communications to name just a few, and really helped drive Greenplum's strong Q4 results. Throughout 2011, Greenplum has been establishing full leadership in Big Data, and we expect to build on the foundation we've put in place over the last 18 months to continue drive penetration and growth. Greenplum's offering has expanded from a single product to a portfolio that includes the industry's only unified solution for Big Data analytics, the unified analytics platform. Unveiled just last month the UAP combined the coprocessing of structured and unstructured data with a productivity engine and social network that enables collaboration among data science teams. With this next generation portfolio for analytics and by leveraging the broader EMC sales force, our own data scientists, our channel partners and our growing partnership with SAS, we expect to help more customers than ever before begin to extract the value from the Big Data that surrounds them. 
Cloud and Big Data objectives will only be fully met if a company's blueprint for it's IT transformation builds in trust. Companies need robust security designed for today's advanced persistent threats. Our RSA Security division grew 16% in Q4, as its holistic agile, data-centric approach is the right one for the modern threat environment. We maintained our leadership position in identity management and protection, adding 1,400 new SecurID customers in 2011, and we saw strong growth in security management and compliance.
Our security management and compliance suites, which combines the capabilities of NetWitness, Archer, DLP, and enVision, presents a unique, risk-based, agile, and contextual approach to advanced threats. The integrated software of the SMC suite gathers and analyzes security Big Data to deliver insights in real-time. This is a winning offering with customers, particularly as security has become a top priority among CEOs and corporate boards. And IT infrastructure designed for cloud and Big Data also requires the ability to easily access, capture and integrate information from disparate sources, and our Information Intelligent Group's offerings facilitate these objectives. 
This quarter, our Information Intelligence Group made their core Documentum, Captiva and Document Sciences products available as a private cloud offering, using internally developed VCUBE technology. They also demonstrated new Big Data use cases using their Documentum xCP technology. Revenue was roughly flat from Q4 a year ago as IIG caps a year of transition and stabilization of its product portfolio and operations.
A key underpinning of an enterprise infrastructure built for cloud and Big Data is virtualization. We're making great strides here with VMware crossing the $1 billion milestone for the first time in Q4 at close to $1.1 billion, an increase of 27% over last year's Q4. Having become the de facto standard for virtualization in enterprise data centers, we're a tested and trusted virtualization platform. VMware is uniquely positioned to address customer needs for easier management through the virtualization layer. In 2012, VMware will continue to enhance its strategic relevance: In the data center, by building on the foundation we've played with vSphere and expanding our capabilities in management and security; at the application layer, by supporting the development of new applications through Cloud Foundry and vFabric; and with the end-user, by continuing to improve and expand upon the capabilities of View and other enabling technologies for the seamless access to data and applications in the cloud. The investments we've made to improve the functionality of our storage products in virtualization environments are also paying off as many of our wins are due to tight integration and ease of operation with VMware. We had many such wins in Q4, including wins at several technology companies in India, manufacturers in Japan and 2 telecommunication companies in China, to name just a few.
We have been making great strides in transforming our product portfolio to equip it with leading-edge capabilities for cloud and Big Data. Equally important has been the transformation of our go-to-market model to facilitate the adoption of these technologies by customers. Already equipped with a direct sales team, that is widely recognized as the best in the industry, we've been focused over the past few  years on further developing our go-to-market model. By leveraging our surging organization, expanding our relationships with existing channel partners, seeking out and incentivizing new channel partners, and capitalizing on VCE, we continued to drive customers towards the next generation IT infrastructures that will support cloud and Big Data in the future.
Our own Services organization had an excellent Q4 and full year 2011 as demand was very robust from customers seeking the most effective ways to get to cloud and leverage their Big Data assets. For EMC, this translated into implementation, support and consulting services, not only in storage but also in security as customers begin to understand that the new threat environment requires a whole new way of thinking about security. Over the past few years, we've been transforming our services business by implementing productivity tools to enhance the profitability of our service offerings, and we've seen the fruits of our labor in our financial results and in our excellent customer satisfaction ratings.
2011 was a transformational year for our channel program. With the combination of renewed management focus, a vastly improved channel model and the launch of products designed with channel in mind, the channel is responding. In 2011, over 1,700 partners began selling EMC products for the first time, and revenue from these new partners in 2011 accounted for almost 1/2 our channel revenue growth in 2011. Our existing partner base is energized as well, with revenues through our 3 largest partners expanding approximately 50% in 2011. The mutual success we have enjoyed has won us accolades, including being named Company of the Year by CRN. But perhaps the most exciting part of our story is we still have a lot of room to grow.
VCE has become a major force in the IT industry and an important element of our technology portfolio and our go-to-market model. VCE's strong momentum is due to the fact that more companies are recognizing the value proposition of the Vblock, and many of those that have are now looking to standardize on it. Given that converged infrastructure is a relatively new concept, and Vblocks are very new products, we're extremely pleased of the adoption rate thus far. The order rate for Vblocks in Q4 exceeded $800 million on an annualized basis as we rapidly close in on the $1 billion run rate goal we highlighted last year. We expect continued success as Vblocks become more well known and sought after for their unique value proposition, a single converge product, a single pane of glass for management, a clear upgrade path, and 1 point of contact for customer support, all on rock solid technology from best-of-breed vendors. The appeal of Vblocks is global, as wins in the quarter include the Spanish National Statistics Institute, a Swiss pharmaceutical company, a Mexican IT service provider, a Russian energy company, an Australian bank, and a large equipment distributor in the U.S. 
We think that the strength of our position is clear: A product portfolio that has been developed with customers' current and future needs in mind and which will continue to evolve to remain the leading edge of efficiency, agility in trust to cloud and Big Data architectures; a powerful go-to-market model through our direct sales force and service teams, and expanded server channel partners, and unique joint venture in VCE; and perhaps most importantly a vision, strategy and roadmap that is in lockstep with 2 of the biggest trends in technology, cloud and Big Data.
We leveraged all these strengths through 2011, not only to enhance our market position, but also to drive excellent results. Consolidated revenue grew 14% in Q4, led by growth of 26% in APJ, with revenue growth of 16% in the Americas and 6% in EMEA. Our BRIC + 13 revenue grew 22% in Q4 as we continue to make progress penetrating these rapid growth markets. We've been stepping up our investment in these geographies as their growth will continue to materially outpace more established markets.
Non-GAAP gross margin improved once again in Q4, up 260 basis points over last year's fourth quarter to 64.5%. We made exceptional progress in gross margins throughout 2011 due to volume and mix shifts, including introduction of Isilon, FAST VP and bundled VNX software products to our revenue stream. For the full year, we improved non-GAAP gross margin by 220 basis points to 62.6%. Gains in gross margins continue to drive progress in non-GAAP operating margin, which was 26.3% for Q4, 90 basis points higher than Q4 2010. For the full year, non-GAAP operating margin was 23.9%, 190 points higher than 2010. Operating expense in 2011 reflected the important investments we've been making in our go-to-market. For 2012, expect to see SG&A growth more aligned with the revenue growth and the allocation of more of our resources to R&D. 
Our strong execution drove record free cash flow of $4.4 billion for 2011, more than $1 billion higher than 2011 non-GAAP net income. Contributing to this was continued strong growth in deferred revenue, up 32% to $6.2 billion. Driven over the course of the year by strong services bookings renewals, the expansion of deferred revenues helps to balance our more transaction-oriented business with a growing stream of more predictable revenue. We continue to manage our cash prudently to meet our objectives of returning value to the shareholders while making the right investments we need to keep us positioned for the long term. We returned $2 billion to shareholders through our buyback program over the course of 2011 and ended the year with $10.8 billion of cash and investments. Earlier this month, we used $1.7 billion of this cash balance to settle the first tranche of our convertible debt, and we plan to return an additional $700 million to shareholders in 2012 through EMC share buybacks. We will continue to deploy our cash wisely throughout 2012 by making strategic and disciplined acquisitions and reinvesting in our business to drive growth.
We ended 2011 incrementally better positioned because of our triple play, gaining market share, reinvesting in the business and delivering leverage. In 2011, we gained market share not only because we have a broad portfolio of best-of-breed products built for the next wave of IT, but also because our go-to-market approach continues to expand and mature. These durable advantages will also drive growth in 2012 and beyond. We were able to make strides in market share in 2011 because we have been investing for growth through strategic acquisition, investments in our partner ecosystem and go-to-market, and in our own R&D. In 2012, we will continue to invest, both externally and internally, especially in our own R&D in order to keep our leading-edge position in this very dynamic environment. In 2011, we do have an EPS leverage and are poised to continue to deliver leverage for the next several years.
In 2012, we will continue this progress. While Joe will give more color on our view of the environment, a few of the factors built into our expectations include slower growth in IT spend, a headwind concurrency and from hard disk drive supply constraints. As you can see, we've laid out here for you all the assumptions that are guiding our expectations. We expect to achieve revenue growth in 2012, better than twice the projected growth of IT spend, to $22 billion with non-GAAP EPS growing faster to $1.70 a share. We've modeled our revenue to follow a seasonally normal percentage of total for each quarter during the year. As you may recall, early last year, we presented our view of the growth potential for each of our lines of business. Our view of our long-term growth prospects has not changed as we operate in some of the hottest areas of IT where secular growth trends are strong and expected to persist. On top of this, we hold the leading position in the vast majority of these. As a result, we continue to expect our high-end storage and IIG business to grow in the range of 1% to 10%. We see our unified storage line, RSA and consulting, growing in the 10% to 19% range. And we expect our higher growth businesses, including VMware, Isilon, BRS and VCE, to remain on track for 20% or higher compound annual growth over the 4-year period. This dynamic, along with our solid performance in 2011, puts us squarely on track to achieve the financial potential we laid out for you last February. Over $28 billion of revenue in 2014, which represents compounded annual revenue growth of at least 13% from 2010, and non-GAAP EPS growth even faster than this.
This is truly a transformational time. IT is transforming to more efficient and agile cloud models. Business will be transformed by Big Data and EMC continues to transform its business to capitalize on these trends. Propelled by the many sound fundamentals of our markets, customer demand, our offerings, our partner ecosystem, our strategy and visible [ph] execution, we fully expect to continue the success we've achieved over the past several years to capitalize on what we think are the biggest opportunity the IT industry has ever presented.
With that, I'll turn it over to Joe. Joe?"

Thank you for joining us. I am pleased with our overall performance in Q4. Our results were strong and our balanced execution capped a very successful 2011.
For the year, EMC's revenues grew 18%. And to be totally transparent, normalizing the effect of our acquisitions, we grew at 16% on an apples-to-apples basis while producing substantial leverage as our non-GAAP EPS grew 20%. I would like to congratulate and thank the now over 53,000 dedicated people of EMC and VMware for their hard work and dedication. It is truly a pleasure to work by your side. 
Now let's turn to the one thing that I'm quite sure is on everyone's mind. Namely, our thoughts and beliefs on the global economic environment and its impact on 2012 IT spending. We have no doubt that the global economy will remain choppy as it has for the vast majority of 2011, especially as it was on the second half. Within this economic landscape, we strongly believe that there will be real growth in IT spending this year. To put a number on it, we expect 3% to 4% growth in overall IT spending in 2012 over 2011. Putting this in context, this is about 1/2 of the 7% growth rate that we believe the IT industry experienced in 2011. But again, we see real growth. Within this 3% to 4%, there will be a lot of variability. There will be variability in geographies. We expect IT spending in Asia and on Japan, Latin America, Middle East and Africa, to be up 6% to 8% year-over-year. We expect IT spending in the U.K. and the Eurozone to be roughly flat. And we expect North American, Eastern European and Japanese markets to grow IT spending at 3% to 4%. There will also be variability across IT sectors. IT spending in storage and data protection will grow faster than the IT industry average, and IT spending for security, Big Data storage, Big Data analytics, virtualization, data center OSs, and cloud device virtualization automation will grow significantly faster than the IT average. The good news is that these higher growth areas of IT are where EMC and VMware play and where we have leadership positions and, very importantly, where we have momentum.
For those of you on the webcast today, we have included 3 analyst surveys that demonstrate high spending intentions in the IT areas I just mentioned. That said, the key to our success in 2012 will be the strength of our innovative products and services, which will be further enhanced by a number of robust product launches during the year. This year, we plan to introduce a long list of new and exciting products into the market. We plan to launch a refresh of the VNXe and increase author capabilities and performance enhancements across the VNX product line. We plan to reduce a new VMAX with even more software functionality, scale, capacity and performance. We plan to announce the general availability of Project Lightning, our service side flash product that is fully integrated with our fully automated storage tiering technology commonly called FAST. Please join us in 2 weeks for this exciting launch. And by the way, while I'm on the subject of flash, we will continue to enhance our extensive flash and FAST capabilities across all of our stores platforms.
We plan to refresh our Data Domain and Avamar product lines, featuring increased performance and scale, with enhanced offer functionality. We will also have even tighter integration between these 2 products. We also have planned product refreshes of Isilon this year, featuring increased performance, scale and virtualization support and functionality enhancements for enterprise use cases.
RSA planned significant announcements around security management and compliance, and identity and Data Protection. And VMware plans to deliver new functionality in all of their major product families, the vSphere cloud infrastructure suite, as well as vFabric, Cloud Foundry, View and Horizon. Again, these are just a few of the exciting new product launches you can expect to see from us this year.
I guess the second question on your mind is about disk drive availability, especially for the first half of this year. To be clear, the floods in Thailand have a major impact on the disk drive industry. Some of the major players and many of their supply chain vendors were directly affected by the flooding. For instance, 2/3 of all drive motors are made in this flood-affected region. The executives of the major drive companies are doing a superb job working with their supply chains in reestablishing their production capabilities. We told you on our Q3 call that we expect it to be okay in Q4 and that we would meet our revenue and EPS expectations, and we did just that. We also told you we would give you more color about drive availability for 2012 when we reported Q4. To amplify what David has already said, we expect there to be drive availability constraints throughout 2012, and we expect these constraints to apply more to near-line drives than mission-critical drives. There is potential for availability constraints to improve in the second half of 2012, and given our strong relationship with our major driver vendors, we at EMC expect to be relatively better positioned.
So given the factors I just mentioned, the choppy economy, real growth in IT spending, the industry constraints around drive availability, and our strong product portfolio and roadmap, I would now like to reiterate our expectations and our financial goals for 2012. This year, we expect revenues of $22 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $1.70. As is our custom, these are the financial goals that were approved by our board and they are the goals in which management will be evaluated and compensated. Also, in very early February, our board will give us an additional goal for free cash flow. This goal will clearly be higher than the $4.4 billion we produced in 2011. As we strive to meet, and hopefully beat these financial goals, our guiding light will be our strategies for private and hybrid cloud computing, Big Data and security, for we firmly believe that at the intersection of cloud, Big Data and trust, there is massive opportunity. 
As I hope you can see from our solid Q4 and full year else, as well as our 2012 outlook, consolidated EMC is extremely well positioned to benefit from what our leadership team and I believe is a game-changing shift taking place in IT, a shift to IT-as-a-Service commonly called cloud computing. In that regard, I am confident that we have a compelling strategy to capitalize on the opportunities ahead, including leading technologies, products and services, and what I believe are the most dedicated and hard-working employees with a passion for excellence who, first and foremost, understand the importance of putting our customers' interest first.
In closing, I am well aware that the topic of my succession has been a matter of some interest, so let me quickly address it and put it to bed. Based upon our business performance and sound prospects for continued success, EMC's Board of Directors has requested that I remain Chairman and CEO into 2013. Equally as important to me is the fact that I am truly blessed and honored to work with an extremely talented senior leadership team here at EMC and VMware. And they, to a person, have also been actively encouraging me to rethink my transition plans. After much soul-searching, I have agreed to extend my role as Chairman and CEO into 2013. From a personal perspective, I have never been more energized and excited by what this great company can accomplish. And as I've said in the past, the board and I fully expect that my successor will come from within the existing, talented and experienced ranks of the EMC management team. I have already started to increase the responsibilities of my senior leadership team, and when the time is right, my successor will be named. Until then, we have much work to do and I am extremely grateful that I have the strong support and commitment of our board, as well as our senior leadership team to work alongside me as we pursue our full business potential. Thank you all again for being with us today. I would now like to turn it back to Tony to moderate the Q&A portion of today's call. Tony?"

Absolutely on track, we've had a huge program inside the company this year, focused upon what we call the lower end of the mid-tier marketplace, and our growth rate in the lower end of the mid-tier market has been significantly higher than our growth in the higher end of the mid-tier market which is what we've been trying to do this year, so we're very pleased. A lot of those net new partners I talked about, the 1,700 new partners who came on during the year and sold our product for the first time, were also selling VNXe. Having said that, we recruited twice as many partners, has actually started selling this year, so we still got work to do. But net-net, VNXe is on track."

So what we're really focused on is saying, okay, the Dell divorce is finalized, so to speak, and we need you, we want you. And we've done all the things that you would think we've done. We've made sure that we're worried about the margins, not only of ourselves, but of our channel partners. We took our comp plans and made it favorable for our sales forces to partner with: The news, the channels to become successful. When we build products like VNXe and VNX, channel-ready, adding new products into the channel like scaled-out Isilon and things we've done with Data Domain and Avamar, I mean all these things give breadth to the channel. Like everybody else in life, I don't think any company or any channel partner wants to be totally dedicated to 1 company, but they want to kind of narrow their scope and really go deep with their chosen partners. So we've really stepped up and done that role. So I think those are the key things we've done. Are we done? Never. We're going to continue to -- there's a lot of things we could do better and we're dedicated on this path, and I love the fact that we have a big and very successful and somewhat revered direct sales force and getting that direct sales force and channels, it's not or it's and channels, to work together is a powerful, powerful go-to-market message and that's what we're going to do."

In terms of uses of cash, we have actually, as I mentioned, early this quarter, we spent $1.7 billion to retire the first half of our convertible debt, so that has actually happened. So that's a deduction from our year-end cash balance. I gave you the number that we would spend on EMC buybacks during this year, about $700 million. On the VMware side, we will, on the EMC side, we will reduce the amount we're spending on VMware buybacks and we'll move more of that load towards VMware. In total, we will buy back to keep EMC's ownership around 80%, but the EMC contribution, that will be less than it was in 2011. And the final question was VCE.

And we did work around it in Q4, we plan to work around in 2012. Just as the disk drive suppliers are doing a good job of working their supply chain, we're doing an excellent job of working our supply chain, trying to match supply and demand during the year. And whilst lead times will be a little longer for certain items than we would normally expect, we will get the drive to make our numbers. So it's really a question of extra work to do more work through the supply chain and working with our field and our customers to kind of satisfy their needs in a constrained market environment. So it's not affecting our seasonality, as I discussed in my comments. In terms of gross margins, when you look at the business, we do expect continued progression positively in gross margins, if you just kind of look at the relative growth of various segments of the business and the mix changes inside the business, we do expect gross margins to continue to improve for EMC in 2012. But as you know, we've guided to relatively constant operating margins from 2011. And in this environment, with the opportunity in cloud, Big Data and trust, we're going to make sure we are investing to drive future market share gains. So those are the puts and takes around gross margin and hard drives."

I'm very pleased to report another quarter of record results for revenue, non-GAAP EPS and free cash flow. This excellent performance enabled us to achieve record results for the full year, driven by year-on-year growth in revenue of 18% to $20 billion and non-GAAP EPS of 20% and in free cash flow of 29%. Clearly, we're delivering on our ongoing commitment to strengthen our strategic position within the evolving IT landscape and on our triple play of gaining market share, reinvesting for growth and delivering leverage.
These very strong results make us better prepared than ever to maintain our strategic agility and operational excellence as we head into 2012. As you know, fundamental changes are underway in IT right now, and it is our ability to identify and invest in these changes that has enabled us to achieve the solid Q4 and record full year results we're reporting today. The transformation of IT is occurring with customer shifts to private, public and hybrid cloud models. The transformation of business is also underway as new technology is enabling organizations to harness the power of Big Data in ways that were impossible only a few years ago. The transformation of EMC is ongoing as we continue our evolution of our company in order to remain at the forefront of these expansive opportunities and help our customers advance in this new age.
As we look across our business, it is clear that EMC is well equipped for this era of transformation. To begin with, customers' cloud and Big Data objectives are best served by having the right information storage infrastructure. Intelligent automated storage is a critical component as is the ability to give customers options because the nature and use of these expanding data sets are almost as varied as the data itself. Having a broad and best-of-breed product portfolio in storage is an important differentiator and has been a key reason for our success. Year-on-year, Information Storage revenue grew a healthy 12% over Q4 of last year. As expected, we have adequate hard disk drive supply for the period, although there were some challenges relative to the availability of certain drive types. Product revenue was up 11% and 24% in the high-end and mid-tier, respectively. This is an excellent result and speaks to the strength of our offerings across a wide spectrum of different applications, implementations and use cases. For customers with mission-critical data sets needing to scale with the best performance, reliability and availability, our high-end scale-out VMAX is consistently selected as the tool for the job. While these attributes have driven our market leadership in the high-end for years, our value proposition in this segment has grown as we've improved our product portfolio to accommodate the transformations of IT and business. For example, we introduced flash drives to enterprise storage 4 years ago, unveiled our virtual matrix VMAX architecture 3 years ago and refreshed VMAX's software capabilities just last year, doubling performance and adding faster VP. The innovations we have consistently introduced are important to customers and make our high-end more useful for their evolving needs. The results have been meaningful share gains in the high end over the past several years. 
The addition of FAST VP to VMAX last year enabled customers to more efficiently and automatically tier the information across flash and SATA drives. Clearly customers value this feature as the attach rate of FAST VP to VMAX continue to climb in Q4. The vast majority of these systems are leveraging both flash and SATA drives and, in fact, flash capacity sold on VMAX more than doubled year-on-year in Q4.
The addition of VMAXe to the portfolio in 2011 expanded our addressable market. VMAXe offers the reliability, availability and many other attributes of a VMAX in a small system, one designed specifically for businesses with limited space, IT staff or capacity needs. The VMAXe is meeting our objective of successfully reaching this tier of the market, particularly outside the U.S., as over half of VMAXe sold in 2011 went to international customers. The VMAXe is also allowing us to gain new customers in the U.S. Papa John's Pizza is just one example of a brand-new EMC customer we won because the VMAXe meets their specific needs for powerful scale-out block storage in an efficient package. 
In 2011, the addition of VPLEX Geo expanded our VPLEX family by offering high-availability and distributed data access over extended distances. The value proposition of VPLEX offers, turning a secondary data center into a productive site enabling active/active data across distance, has transformed how our customers are architecting their cloud infrastructures. A bank in Poland was a great example of this in Q4. VPLEX's ability to seamlessly move their vSphere applications between data centers without any interruption is enabling them to take full advantage of their virtualized infrastructure as they can now do load-balancing and allow real-time data access over 2 data centers that are miles apart. This value, proposition is as yet unmet by any competitive offering. It is innovation such as these that keep our products at the leading edge and broaden their use cases. You can expect us to continue our unrelenting pace of improvements here in 2012.
The transformation of EMC has been most evident in our mid-tier product set. As customer needs in the mid-tier have expanded, we have expanded our portfolio accordingly to ensure we have the right tool for the job. In 2011, we launched our VNX Family to meet the needs of customers seeking simplicity via a unified architecture, better VMware integration and auto tiering, all of which combine to deliver greater efficiency and at lower total cost of ownership. As a result, our VNX Family has been warmly embraced by both existing and new customers alike, and brought in almost 2,000 new customers to EMC in Q4 alone. It is also interesting to note that almost half the customers who bought VNX systems during 2011 had not purchased EMC unified systems before.
In addition to winning new customers, our VNX product family won numerous awards in 2011, including awards for Best Storage Array for SQL by SQL Server Magazine, the Best Array for Storage Virtualization by readers of Virtualization Review, and product of the year by CRN. Resellers have embraced the VNX and VNXe as they're designed with a channel in mind. They are some simple, efficient and powerful, offering options that meet the widely varying needs presented across the diverse base of customers.
Our acquisition of Isilon just over a year ago, was a key step in the transformation of our mid-tier business to better meet customers' cloud and Big Data needs. Isilon has thrived as part of EMC and its revenue more than doubled again, year-on-year, in Q4 and for the full year 2011. With its core value proposition of simplicity of scale, Isilon has always enjoyed a strong position in verticals such as media and life sciences, and continues to do so. Our recent win at the Associated Press for Video Production and Archiving is a great example. Now as part of EMC, Isilon has been rapidly gaining traction in a number of new accounts, use cases and verticals where scale-out capabilities are required to handle rapid growth. As the integration of Isilon progressed during 2011, the EMC sales teams became better at identifying and offering customers the best solution for the job at hand, and we saw the growing effect of this in Q4. By offering the simplicity of a single file system, scalability in line with data growth, ease-of-use and management, and lower CapEx for improved utilization, Isilon meets general-purpose data center use cases and accounts where Isilon previously didn't exist and that EMC wasn't serving before. This is a case that won the world's most diversified technology organizations. This Fortune 50 company purchased more than 2 petabytes of Isilon to unify its massive network of user shares and home directories, completely eliminating the incumbent NAS vendor from its file sharing environment.
Another great illustration of why Isilon is thriving within our portfolio was a multiproduct win at a large health insurance company. The customer was seeking greater flexibility and performance across all applications in their virtualized environments, and they also needed a single repository that was simple to manage and grow. With VMware integration that was tighter than the incumbent NAS vendor could demonstrates, VNX was selected for the continued development of the cloud architecture. And with its superior scale and efficiency, Isilon displaced the same incumbent vendor from the customer's secondary site for data protection. As this example makes clear, the one-size-fits-all approach to storage is not ideal for today's environments. Having the right tool for the job is.
Add-on to VNX and Isilon the capabilities of Atmos, the geographically dispersed data, and you have a storage infrastructure offering for cloud and Big Data that is unparalleled. EMC's transformation in the mid-tier extends beyond production data infrastructure into backup and recovery. The combination of Avamar and Data Domain in our backup portfolio 2 years ago enabled us to offer backup solutions that fit hand-in-glove with new data center architectures. An excellent example was a multimillion dollar, multiproduct win in Q4 where the customer, a global technology company with a heavily virtualized environment, purchased VMAXe for their production data and adopted a combination of Data Domain and Avamar for disaster recovery. Product synergies, both across EMC and within our backup portfolio itself, are a competitive advantage and part of the reason why we've being consistently growing faster than the backup market. With Data Domain and Avamar alone exiting the year at a revenue run rate well over $2 billion, our BRS division has become an essential part of our strategic offering.
Through the transformation of our mid-tier storage portfolio, we've created a truly formidable offering that far exceeds the capabilities of more narrowly focused storage vendors and also far exceeds the storage capability of the server vendors. We are best-of-breed unified VNX Family which includes VNX and VNXe, complemented by our market-leading backup and recovery solutions and also by our scale-out Isilon product family, we offer a winning combination that resonates with customers and has driven the share gains we've made in the mid-tier segment in 2011. Customers also appreciate the additional choices we give them to scale out block with VMAX and VNXe. 
As we have noted, the transformation that is characterizing the industry today goes beyond the transformation of IT and cloud infrastructures. Increasingly, the transformation of business itself is being driven by the ability to harness Big Data. Businesses that can make timely use of the vast troves of data stored both with -- inside and outside a company can gain a robust competitive advantage. EMC Greenplum meets the needs in customers of all sizes, enabling to sort through extremely large data sets in the neighborhood of millions of transactions per day or hundreds of billions of clicks per month. The broad appeal of Greenplum's technology won us new customers across a broad spectrum of industries in Q4, including healthcare, technology, retail, and communications to name just a few, and really helped drive Greenplum's strong Q4 results. Throughout 2011, Greenplum has been establishing full leadership in Big Data, and we expect to build on the foundation we've put in place over the last 18 months to continue to drive penetration and growth. Greenplum's offering has expanded from a single product to a portfolio that includes the industry's only unified solution for Big Data analytics, the unified analytics platform. Unveiled just last month, the UAP combines the coprocessing of structured and unstructured data with a productivity engine and social network that enables collaboration among data science teams. With this next generation portfolio for analytics and by leveraging the broader EMC sales force, our own data scientists, our channel partners and our growing partnership with SAS, we expect to help more customers than ever before begin to extract the value from the Big Data that surrounds them. 
Cloud and Big Data objectives will only be fully met if a company's blueprint for its IT transformation builds in trust. Companies need robust security designed for today's advanced persistent threats. Our RSA Security division grew 16% in Q4, as its holistic, agile, data-centric approach is the right one for the modern threat environment. We maintained our leadership position in identity management and protection, adding 1,400 new SecurID customers in 2011, and we saw strong growth in security management and compliance.
Our security management and compliance suite, which combines the capabilities of NetWitness, Archer, DLP, and enVision, presents a unique, risk-based, agile, and contextual approach to advanced threats. The integrated software of the SMC suite gathers and analyzes security Big Data to deliver insights in real-time. This is a winning offering with customers, particularly as security has become a top priority among CEOs and corporate boards. An IT infrastructure designed for cloud and Big Data also requires the ability to easily access, capture and integrate information from disparate sources, and our Information Intelligent Group's offerings facilitate these objectives. 
This quarter, our Information Intelligence Group made their core Documentum, Captiva and Document Sciences products available as a private cloud offering, using internally-developed VCUBE technology. They also demonstrated new Big Data use cases using their Documentum xCP technology. Revenue was roughly flat from Q4 a year ago as IIG caps a year of transition and stabilization of its product portfolio and operations.
A key underpinning of an enterprise infrastructure built for cloud and Big Data is virtualization. We're making great strides here with VMware crossing the $1 billion milestone for the first time in Q4 at close to $1.1 billion, an increase of 27% over last year's Q4. Having become the de facto standard for virtualization in enterprise data centers, with a tested and trusted virtualization platform, VMware is uniquely positioned to address customer needs for easier management through the virtualization layer. In 2012, VMware will continue to enhance its strategic relevance: In the data center, by building on the foundation we've played with vSphere and expanding our capabilities in management and security; at the application layer, by supporting the development of new applications through Cloud Foundry and vFabric; and with the end-user, by continuing to improve and expand upon the capabilities of View and other enabling technologies for the seamless access to data and applications in the cloud. The investments we've made to improve the functionality of our storage products in virtualization environments are also paying off as many of our wins are due to tight integration and ease of operation with VMware. We had many such wins in Q4, including wins at several technology companies in India, manufacturers in Japan and 2 telecommunication companies in China, to name just a few.
We have been making great strides in transforming our product portfolio to equip it with leading-edge capabilities for cloud and Big Data. Equally important has been the transformation of our go-to-market model to facilitate the adoption of these technologies by customers. Already equipped with a direct sales team, that is widely recognized as the best in the industry, we've been focused over the past few  years on further developing our go-to-market model. By leveraging our services organization, expanding our relationships with existing channel partners, seeking out and incentivizing new channel partners, and capitalizing on VCE, we continued to drive customers towards the next generation IT infrastructures that will support cloud and Big Data in the future.
Our own Services organization had an excellent Q4 and full year 2011 as demand was very robust from customers seeking the most effective ways to get to cloud and leverage their Big Data assets. For EMC, this translated into implementation, support and consulting services, not only in storage but also in security as customers begin to understand that the new threat environment requires a whole new way of thinking about security. Over the past few years, we've been transforming our services business by implementing productivity tools to enhance the profitability of our service offerings, and we've seen the fruits of our labor in our financial results and in our excellent customer satisfaction ratings.
2011 was a transformational year for our channel program. With the combination of renewed management focus, a vastly improved channel model and the launch of products designed with channel in mind, the channel is responding. In 2011, over 1,700 partners began selling EMC products for the first time, and revenue from these new partners in 2011 accounted for almost 1/2 our channel revenue growth in 2011. Our existing partner base is energized as well, with revenues through our 3 largest partners expanding approximately 50% in 2011. The mutual success we have enjoyed has won us accolades, including being named Company of the Year by CRN. But perhaps the most exciting part of our story is we still have a lot of room to grow.
VCE has become a major force in the IT industry and an important element of our technology portfolio and our go-to-market model. VCE's strong momentum is due to the fact that more companies are recognizing the value proposition of the Vblock, and many of those that have are now looking to standardize on it. Given that converged infrastructure is a relatively new concept, and Vblocks are very new products, we're extremely pleased at the adoption rate thus far. The order rate for Vblocks in Q4 exceeded $800 million on an annualized basis as we rapidly close in on the $1 billion run rate goal we highlighted last year. We expect continued success as Vblocks become more well known and sought after for their unique value proposition, a single converge product, a single pane of glass for management, a clear upgrade path, and one point of contact for customer support, all on rock solid technology from best-of-breed vendors. The appeal of Vblocks is global, as wins in the quarter include the Spanish National Statistics Institute, a Swiss pharmaceutical company, a Mexican IT service provider, a Russian energy company, an Australian bank, and a large equipment distributor in the U.S. 
We think that the strength of our position is clear: A product portfolio that has been developed with customers' current and future needs in mind and which will continue to evolve to remain at the leading edge of efficiency, agility and trust to cloud and Big Data architectures; a powerful go-to-market model through our direct sales force and service team, an expanded server channel partners, and unique joint venture in VCE; and perhaps most importantly a vision, strategy and roadmap that is in lockstep with 2 of the biggest trends in technology, cloud and Big Data.
We leveraged all these strengths through 2011, not only to enhance our market position, but also to drive excellent results. Consolidated revenue grew 14% in Q4, led by growth of 26% in APJ, with revenue growth of 16% in the Americas and 6% in EMEA. Our BRIC + 13 revenue grew 22% in Q4 as we continue to make progress penetrating these rapid growth markets. We've been stepping up our investment in these geographies as their growth will continue to materially outpace more established markets.
Non-GAAP gross margin improved once again in Q4, up 260 basis points over last year's fourth quarter to 64.5%. We made exceptional progress in gross margins throughout 2011 due to volume and mix shifts, including introduction of Isilon, FAST VP and bundled VNX software products to our revenue stream. For the full year, we improved non-GAAP gross margin by 220 basis points to 62.6%. Gains in gross margins continue to drive progress in non-GAAP operating margin, which was 26.3% for Q4, 90 basis points higher than Q4 2010. For the full year, non-GAAP operating margin was 23.9%, 190 points higher than 2010. Operating expense in 2011 reflected the important investments we've been making in our go-to-market. For 2012, expect to see SG&A growth more aligned with revenue growth and the allocation of more of our resources to R&D. 
Our strong execution drove record free cash flow of $4.4 billion for 2011, more than $1 billion higher than 2011 non-GAAP net income. Contributing to this was continued strong growth in deferred revenue, up 32% to $6.2 billion. Driven over the course of the year by strong services bookings and renewals, the expansion of deferred revenues helps to balance our more transaction-oriented business with a growing stream of more predictable revenue. We continue to manage our cash prudently to meet our objectives of returning value to the shareholders while making the right investments we need to keep us positioned for the long term. We returned $2 billion to shareholders through our buyback program over the course of 2011 and ended the year with $10.8 billion of cash and investments. Earlier this month, we used $1.7 billion of this cash balance to settle the first tranche of our convertible debt, and we plan to return an additional $700 million to shareholders in 2012 through EMC share buybacks. We will continue to deploy our cash wisely throughout 2012 by making strategic and disciplined acquisitions and reinvesting in our business to drive growth.
We ended 2011 incrementally better positioned because of our triple play, gaining market share, reinvesting in the business and delivering leverage. In 2011, we gained market share not only because we have a broad portfolio of best-of-breed products built for the next wave of IT, but also because our go-to-market approach continues to expand and mature. These durable advantages will also drive growth in 2012 and beyond. We were able to make strides in market share in 2011 because we have been investing for growth through strategic acquisition, investments in our partner ecosystem and go-to-market, and in our own R&D. In 2012, we will continue to invest, both externally and internally, especially in our own R&D in order to keep our leading-edge position in this very dynamic environment. In 2011, we delivered EPS leverage and are poised to continue to deliver leverage for the next several years.
In 2012, we will continue this progress. While Joe will give more color on our view of the environment, a few of the factors built into our expectations include slower growth in IT spend, a headwind concurrency and some hard disk drive supply constraints. As you can see, we've laid out here for you all the assumptions that are guiding our expectations. We expect to achieve revenue growth in 2012 better than twice the projected growth of IT spend, to $22 billion with non-GAAP EPS growing faster to $1.70 a share. We've modeled our revenue to follow a seasonally normal percentage of total for each quarter during the year. As you may recall, early last year, we presented our view of the growth potential for each of our lines of business. Our view of our long-term growth prospects has not changed as we operate in some of the hottest areas of IT where secular growth trends are strong and expected to persist. On top of this, we hold the leading position in the vast majority of these. As a result, we continue to expect our high-end storage and IIG business to grow in the range of 1% to 10%. We see our unified storage line, RSA and consulting, growing in the 10% to 19% range. And we expect our higher growth businesses, including VMware, Isilon, BRS and VCE, to remain on track for 20% or higher compound annual growth over the 4-year period. This dynamic, along with our solid performance in 2011, puts us squarely on track to achieve the financial potential we laid out for you last February. Over $28 billion of revenue in 2014, which represents compound annual revenue growth of at least 13% from 2010, and non-GAAP EPS growth even faster than this.
This is truly a transformational time. IT is transforming to more efficient and agile cloud models. Business will be transformed by Big Data and EMC continues to transform its business to capitalize on these trends. Propelled by the many sound fundamentals of our markets, customer demand, our offerings, our partner ecosystem, our strategy and visible [ph] execution, we fully expect to continue the success we've achieved over the past several years to capitalize on what we think are the biggest opportunities the IT industry has ever presented.
With that, I'll turn it over to Joe. Joe?"

Thank you for joining us. I am pleased with our overall performance in Q4. Our results were strong and our balanced execution capped a very successful 2011.
For the year, EMC's revenues grew 18%. And to be totally transparent, normalizing the effect of our acquisitions, we grew at 16% on an apples-to-apples basis while producing substantial leverage as our non-GAAP EPS grew 20%. I would like to congratulate and thank the now over 53,000 dedicated people of EMC and VMware for their hard work and dedication. It is truly a pleasure to work by your side. 
Now let's turn to the one thing that I'm quite sure is on everyone's mind. Namely, our thoughts and beliefs on the global economic environment and its impact on 2012 IT spending. We have no doubt that the global economy will remain choppy as it has for the vast majority of 2011, especially as it was in the second half. Within this economic landscape, we strongly believe that there will be real growth in IT spending this year. To put a number on it, we expect 3% to 4% growth in overall IT spending in 2012 over 2011. Putting this in context, this is about 1/2 of the 7% growth rate that we believe the IT industry experienced in 2011. But again, we see real growth. Within this 3% to 4%, there will be a lot of variability. There will be variability in geographies. We expect IT spending in Asia and on Japan, Latin America, Middle East and Africa, to be up 6% to 8% year-over-year. We expect IT spending in the U.K. and the Eurozone to be roughly flat. And we expect North American, Eastern European and Japanese markets to grow IT spending at 3% to 4%. There will also be variability across IT sectors. IT spending in storage and data protection will grow faster than the IT industry average, and IT spending for security, Big Data storage, Big Data analytics, virtualization, data center OSs, and cloud device virtualization automation will grow significantly faster than the IT average. The good news is that these higher growth areas of IT are where EMC and VMware play and where we have leadership positions and, very importantly, where we have momentum.
For those of you on the webcast today, we have included 3 analyst surveys that demonstrate high spending intentions in the IT areas I just mentioned. That said, the key to our success in 2012 will be the strength of our innovative products and services, which will be further enhanced by a number of robust product launches during the year. This year, we plan to introduce a long list of new and exciting products into the market. We plan to launch a refresh of VNXe and increase software capabilities and performance enhancements across the VNX product line. We plan to introduce a new VMAX with even more software functionality, scale, capacity and performance. We plan to announce the general availability of Project Lightning, our service side flash product that is fully integrated with our fully automated storage tiering technology commonly called FAST. Please join us in 2 weeks for this exciting launch. And by the way, while I'm on the subject of flash, we will continue to enhance our extensive flash and FAST capabilities across all of our storage platforms.
We plan to refresh our Data Domain and Avamar product lines, featuring increased performance and scale, with enhanced offer of functionality. We will also have even tighter integration between these 2 products. We also have planned product refreshes of Isilon this year, featuring increased performance, scale and virtualization support and functionality enhancements for enterprise use cases.
RSA planned significant announcements around security management and compliance, and identity and Data Protection. And VMware plans to deliver new functionality in all of their major product families, the vSphere cloud infrastructure suite, as well as vFabric, Cloud Foundry, View and Horizon. Again, these are just a few of the exciting new product launches you can expect to see from us this year.
I guess the second question on your mind is about disk drive availability, especially for the first half of this year. To be clear, the floods in Thailand have had a major impact on the disk drive industry. Some of the major players and many of their supply chain vendors were directly affected by the flooding. For instance, 2/3 of all drive motors are made in this flood-affected region. The executives of the major drive companies are doing a superb job working with their supply chains in reestablishing their production capabilities. We told you on our Q3 call that we expected to be okay in Q4 and that we would meet our revenue and EPS expectations, and we did just that. We also told you we would give you more color about drive availability for 2012 when we reported Q4. To amplify what David has already said, we expect there to be drive availability constraints throughout 2012, and we expect these constraints to apply more to near-line drives than mission-critical drives. There is potential for availability constraints to improve in the second half of 2012, and given our strong relationship with our major driver vendors, we at EMC expect to be relatively better positioned.
So given the factors I just mentioned, the choppy economy, real growth in IT spending, the industry constraints around drive availability, and our strong product portfolio and roadmap, I would now like to reiterate our expectations and our financial goals for 2012. This year, we expect revenues of $22 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $1.70. As is our custom, these are the financial goals that were approved by our board and they are the goals in which management will be evaluated and compensated. Also, in very early February, our board will give us an additional goal for free cash flow. This goal will clearly be higher than the $4.4 billion we produced in 2011. As we strive to meet, and hopefully beat these financial goals, our guiding light will be our strategies for private and hybrid cloud computing, Big Data and security, for we firmly believe that at the intersection of cloud, Big Data and trust, there is massive opportunity. 
As I hope you can see from our solid Q4 and full year results, as well as our 2012 outlook, that solid[ph] EMC is extremely well positioned to benefit from what our leadership team and I believe is a game-changing shift taking place in IT, a shift to IT-As-A-Service commonly called cloud computing. In that regard, I am confident that we have a compelling strategy to capitalize on the opportunities ahead, including leading technologies, products and services, and what I believe are the most dedicated and hard-working employees with a passion for excellence who, first and foremost, understand the importance of putting our customers' interest first.
In closing, I am well aware that the topic of my succession has been a matter of some interest, so let me quickly address it and put it to bed. Based upon our business performance and sound prospects for continued success, EMC's Board of Directors has requested that I remain Chairman and CEO into 2013. Equally as important to me is the fact that I am truly blessed and honored to work with an extremely talented senior leadership team here at EMC and VMware. And they, to a person, have also been actively encouraging me to rethink my transition plans. After much soul-searching, I have agreed to extend my role as Chairman and CEO into 2013. From a personal perspective, I have never been more energized and excited by what this great company can accomplish. And as I've said in the past, the board and I fully expect that my successor will come from within the existing, talented and experienced ranks of the EMC management team. I have already started to increase the responsibilities of my senior leadership team, and when the time is right, my successor will be named. Until then, we have much work to do and I am extremely grateful that I have the strong support and commitment of our board, as well as our senior leadership team to work alongside me as we pursue our full business potential. Thank you all again for being with us today. I would now like to turn it back to Tony to moderate the Q&A portion of today's call. Tony?"

Absolutely on track, we've had a huge program inside the company this year, focused upon what we call the lower end of the mid-tier marketplace, and our growth rate in the lower end of the mid-tier market has been significantly higher than our growth in the higher end of the mid-tier market which is what we've been trying to do this year, so we're very pleased. A lot of those net new partners I talked about, the 1,700 new partners who came on during the year and sold our product for the first time, were also selling VNXe.

When we build products like VNXe and VNX, channel-ready, adding new products into the channel like scaled-out Isilon and things we've done with Data Domain and Avamar, I mean all these things give breadth to the channel. Like everybody else in life, I don't think any company or any channel partner wants to be totally dedicated to one company, but they want to kind of narrow their scope and really go deep with their chosen partners. So we've really stepped up and done that role. So I think those are the key things we've done. Are we done? Never. We're going to continue to -- there's a lot of things we could do better and we're dedicated on this path, and I love the fact that we have a big and very successful and somewhat revered direct sales force and getting that direct sales force and channels -- it's not or, it's and channels -- to work together is a powerful, powerful go-to-market message and that's what we're going to do."

It's different numbers across different drive types, obviously based upon the supply and demand situation. And first of all, again bear in mind, we said we'd get enough drives to get to our revenue plan in Q4, which we did. We also said that we expect the revenue in 2012 to follow a normal seasonal pattern, so we're not expecting a skewing in our revenue because of drives. We think we'll get enough each quarter to make our numbers. Relative to margin, we think we can offset the margin dollars that we're facing in terms of cost pressure with price pressure so we don't expect to have less margin dollars coming through because of price increases."

At 2011, we had more than $1 billion higher than our non-GAAP net income. Deferred revenue was the biggest driver of that, we expect continued deferred revenue growth in 2012, mainly from prepaid maintenance contracts, prepaid service contracts that are doing very well for us. So we'll give you a number when we next speak but, obviously, it's going to be north of $4.4 billion. It's going to be north of our 2012 non-GAAP net income. In terms of uses of cash, we have actually, as I mentioned, early this quarter, we spent $1.7 billion to retire the first half of our convertible debt, so that has actually happened. So that's a deduction from our year-end cash balance. I gave you the number that we would spend on EMC buybacks during this year, about $700 million. On the VMware side, we will, on the EMC side, we will reduce the amount we're spending on VMware buybacks and we'll move more of that load towards VMware. In total, we will buy back to keep EMC's ownership around 80%, but the EMC contribution of that will be less than it was in 2011. Oh sorry, the final question was VCE. The thing to VCE, which will be a combination of what we spend to cover operating expenses, plus what we spend to fund working capital.

And I don't think that $1 billion by any ways, shape, or form, near to max. We're going to go into multibillion, this thing has potential for multibillion dollars in size. So we do internally have a management plan which we drive then to where we give some of that credit back.

And we did work around it in Q4, we plan to work around it in 2012. Just as the disk drive suppliers are doing a good job of working their supply chain, we're doing an excellent job of working our supply chain, trying to match supply and demand during the year. And whilst lead times will be a little longer for certain items than we would normally expect, we will get the drives to make our numbers. So it's really a question of extra work to do more work through the supply chain and working with our field and our customers to kind of satisfy their needs in a constrained market environment. So it's not affecting our seasonality, as I discussed in my comments. In terms of gross margins, when you look at the business, we do expect continued progression positively in gross margins, if you just kind of look at the relative growth of various segments of the business and the mix changes inside the business, we do expect gross margins to continue to improve for EMC in 2012. But as you know, we've guided to relatively constant operating margins from 2011. And in this environment, with the opportunity in cloud, Big Data and trust, we're going to make sure we are investing to drive future market share gains.

I'm very pleased to report that EMC had a strong start to 2012. As you know, there's major conservation happening in IT today, and the challenge for all of us is to make sure we correctly align our businesses to best take advantage of the opportunity the change provides. EMC's ability to correctly identify and invest in these changes has been a major reason for our success and enabled us to grow revenue 11% year-over-year this quarter with non-GAAP EPS of 19% and free cash flow of 67%. We are in a truly unprecedented time of transformation. IT is transforming with the shift to cloud computing. Businesses are transforming as a better leverage Big Data to deliver greater insight and uncover new opportunities. And the new spec environments is transforming the way customers think about trust.
We at EMC are transforming our portfolio and operations to best take advantage of these major shifts. We believe that we have positioned EMC well, and our solid results are ongoing proof that we're executing on our strategy to address the major trends in cloud, Big Data and trust. Based on our strong start to the year and how we feel about our opportunity, we are now more confident about what we can achieve in 2012.
Looking across our businesses, it's clear that EMC is very well equipped to help customers navigate the weights of change they are facing today. As foundation for customers cloud and Big Data initiatives, information storage continues to thrive. With varied use cases and data types, EMC's broader D portfolio continues to prove to be best-of-breed. As a case in point, information storage continues the trend of solid growth with revenues up 7% in Q1. High-end storage program was down 10% year-on-year versus a very strong Q1 last year. As you may recall, we had an unusually strong first quarter in 2011 due to the introduction of FAST VP in conjunction with VMAX. In that quarter, high-end product was up 25% year-on-year and a very strong and unusual 12% sequentially. Whilst the significant variance in this year-on-year growth rates had a meaningful impact on the year-on-year growth and inflation storage revenue, we're comfortable with how our storage business is trending.
After 2 years of above-trendline growth, we expect the high-end storage market to return to the long-term single-digit growth profile we projected for the segment. Customers at the high-end seek the very best in performance, scalability and reliability, and VMAX is the best position to meet these needs as it offers unmatched combination of innovative features.
Fully automated storage tearing, or FAST software, along with Flash, fiber and SATA drives allows customers to consolidate different years of data onto a single array and reduce the data center footprints. While scale-out architecture of VMAX, coupled with Flash, improves transactional performance dramatically while accommodating explosive data growth. And we continuously improve our Symmetrix product line technology as customer needs evolve. We recently became the first enterprise storage vendor to achieve validation of 140 encryption for all drive types including Flash with our Symmetrix data arrest encryption module. This module, which protects information from unauthorized access of the intellectual drive level, can be integrated with RSA key management.
The unmatched combination of leading-edge capabilities at the high-end is Amron, a power company with 3.4 million electric and gas customers selected VMAX for their mission-critical Oracle database and custom application environments. With 100 terabytes of data being added to its infrastructure each year, Amron was struggling to keep up with its data growth and increasing IT management costs while advancing their VMware virtualization and cloud computing strategy. With VMAX using FAST and accommodation of Flash fiber channel and SATA drives, they are able to reduce channel capital expenses by 50%, increase transactional performance by 30% and achieved power and cooling savings of 28%.
In its second full quarter of availability, VMAX e revenue continues to ramp as it meets the requirements between a low end VMAX and a high-end VNX and extends the reach of the VMAX family to new customers, usages and price points. Such was the case with the fast-growing community college system in Texas. By consolidating its infrastructure onto a VMAXe, the school system dramatically improved its ability to provide students with latest educational technology and tools, respond more quickly to the needs of local employees and increase the overall efficiency and reliability of their operational systems. The VMAXe was part of a larger win the customer but also implemented EMC Avamar, Networker, Recover Point, vSphere and Vcenter site recovery manager for the 97% virtualized infrastructure.
VPLEX continues to be an integral part of our portfolio, as a unique product that dissolves distance and enables data centers to be truly active active for the first time. This was illustrated by a draw and a larger win in Q1, this one is healthcare. This transaction include a number of complementary EMC products including VMAX block, Data Domain and Avamar. To complete its life-critical continuous computing platform, the hospital needed active active data center configuration, that VPLEX Metro made possible. VPLEX ability to move these fewer applications between data centers, several towns apart without interruption, will enable them to fully leverage their virtualized infrastructure and lower the total cost of ownership.
Our mid-tier product continue to perform very well, with product revenue growth of 26% year-on-year. And by the way, this is 100% organic growth, so no growth bump from acquisitions. Our portfolio midtier storage capabilities is a great match with customers expanding requirements in this area. 
Our VNX Family, which reintroduced in Q1 of last year, is living up to our high expectations. Customers and partners alike like its functionality, simplicity, efficiency and lower cost of ownership. With its unified architecture, unparalleled VMware integration, incorporation of Flash for both cache and storage and the ability to automatically tier data with FAST, the VNX continues to win us a bigger footprint with customers. And the VNXe, which offers affordable simplicity and efficiency to small customers and remote offices, has firmly established EMC as a player in the lower end of the markets.
Vintage introduction, the VNX Family has brought just under 6,000 branded customers to EMC, many of whom have been acquired via the more than 2,000 new channel partners who started selling EMC over the same period of time. Together, the VNX and VNXe allow us to meet a broad set of need to customers, seeking the flexibility of unified storage. One such customers are global aluminum company that is consolidating its IT infrastructure worldwide to 3 primary data centers plus a DR site and approximately 30 remote offices. The primary data centers will use VNXs is with VMware to consolidate applications and significantly reduce costs. While the 30 remote offices will use VNXe 3100 arrays for primary storage. This example illustrates how valuable it is to have a broad array of products in today's rapidly changing IT environments. This same customer, by the way, also purchased our full suite of backup product to address the various backup needs across their next-gen infrastructure.
Lifelong continues of Florida with total revenue almost doubling from Q1 year ago. This long technology plays important role among our mid-tier products as it meets customer's cloud and Big Data requirements across industries and use cases. Our scale at Nassau architecture is suited for extremely large-scale Big Data needs. And in Q1, we completed what we believe was the largest capacity single order in the history of storage, 28 petabytes with a web company. To put this into perspective, this amount of stores could hold 6 million movies. And while 28 petabytes is impressive, you need 37 million petabytes to accommodate the genetic sequence of the entire population of the United States. As you can see, we have a lot more room to grow in some of these emerging Big Data areas.
Isilon is being used in more traditional enterprise implementation as well. File-based data that managed 10 years ago has been growing unchecked, reaching petabyte scale in some cases. And this is where Isilon scale architecture is ideal. A case in points was the choice of Isilon by a large national insurance company recently. EMC has been part of its data center for some time and used the value proposition of Isilon to consolidate their file environment in Q1. 
As our sales force and partners have become much better at identifying the best opportunities for Isilon, we expect to see Isilon increasingly penetrating our existing customer base. Putting the EMC name, reputation, sales force and service levels behind great new technology is powerful combination. The result is what we call that EMC effect.
We have seen the EMC effect at work for the past couple of years in our backup recovery systems business, which continues to thrive. Our market-leading backup products, which include the powerful combination of Avamar and Data Domain also lead the way into new accounts and have brought hundreds of new logos to EMC over the past several quarters. One of these in Q1 was a large financial services organization that was running out data center floor space and running to power and cooling challenges with its large tape silos. By demonstrating the data domains next gen backup architecture provides efficiency, reliability and business value that was impossible with a tape based systems, our BRS team was able to establish brand-new footprint in all 3 of the organizations data centers.
We continue to broaden our stores portfolio in Q1 with the very exciting addition of VFCache, which extends our lead in Enterprise Flash. In 2008, we were the first to bring Flash technology to enterprise storage and its value proposition to customers is clear as evidenced by the growing demand it has enjoyed ever since. We are leveraging our expertise in Enterprise Flash with VFCache, which extent the benefit of Flash into the server for dramatic performance improvement. What distinguishes VFCache is its ability to deliver extremely fast response times whilst preserving all the back and capabilities around data protection, reliability, scalability and manageability. This is a value proposition that broad appeal as illustrated by our early customer wins including a bank in China, a financial services company in Boston, a retailer the Middle East, a government in Asia, and a research lab in U.K., a hospital in New England and U.S.-based to communications company name but a few. Their feedback so far is very positive as they are seeing how fast some of their mission-critical applications like Oracle and SQL are able to run. We're also excited to be in discussions with several new generation web application companies, and you'll see us continue to enhance VFCache later this year.
Later this quarter, at EMC world, you'll hear more about our next step with a Flash, codename Project Thunder. Optimized the high frequency, low latency, rewrite work loads, Thunder will build upon the advanced PCIe technology delivered in VFCache to leverage the power Flash for dedicated server network flash-based appliance. 
Building Flash into many places in the IT infrastructure while fully leveraging it with intelligent automated software that operates across this stack is the real secret sauce to delivering value. What the customer cares about is having the right data at the right time in the right place at the right cost. And making this happen involves service, leveraging Flash at end of the spectrum high-capacity SATA drives and storage arrays of the other. We have the intent expertise with Enterprise Flash and data storage unmatched in the industry, and we'll continue to build an opposition is the innovative leaders in Enterprise Flash.
When we look back at the storage proxy we just discussed, VMAX, VPLEX, VNX, Isilon, Data Domain, Avamar, VFCache, you can see this is a very different portfolio than what we had just 3 years ago. One has been purposely assembled to address the requirements brought about by the rapidly changing IT environments. Our recent win at a global humanitarian organization is an excellent example of the power of EMC's portfolio in this new world. Rotary International implemented VNXe, Isilon, Avamar and vSphere to better manage its growing digital assets, deploy a Vblock for its mission critical applications and primary stores and leverages VNXe at a second facility to replicate data. Rocher was able to build a solid foundation for its virtualization environment on EMC's suite of complementary products, which will be optimized for these environments. The result is simplify management, strengthen data protection, predictable performance and improve efficiency. This is our strategy at work.
Increasingly, businesses are being transformed by their ability to unlock the value of data store within their organization and in the outside world. We identified this trend early and began making investments to capture the opportunity Big Data presents, starting with the acquisition of Greenplum in 2010. Greenplum has since made great strides in the space with several achievements in Q1 alone, including the industry's first and only enterprise proven Hadoop solution on the scale out mass architecture with Isilon, enabling end-to-end data protection for Hadoop Big Data. The designation is a leader in enterprise Hadoop solution by far researched as the first integrate its Hadoop GWN an data integration in a single rack. The launch of the industry's first social tool kit for Big Data, Greenplum Chorus, enabling data science teams to collaborate on data sets. The acquisition of pivotal labs accelerate the development of Big Data applications in the enterprise, not to mention continued very strong year-on-year growth in revenue.
Greenplum is increasingly benefiting from the EMC effects. While it's early days and the Big Data trend has quite a way to go before it reaches full potential, customers see the transformation in analytics and want to build the technology stack with the right partners as they start on their journey to leverage Big Data. As a result, we're now seeing multimillion dollar transactions as more and more enterprises select Greenplum technology as the foundation for the next gen analytics architectures. In Q1, these wins included a large financial services company in New York, a leading supplier of industrial automation solutions in India and a multinational telecommunications company in Europe.
Taking a step back, it is clear that we've anticipated how customers needs will change in this space, and we've transformed our portfolio of storage offerings to address those needs. As a result, we now have a broad portfolio of best-of-breed products, which enable customers to pick the right tool for the job they have. The offerings we have far exceed the capabilities of both the more narrowly focused storage vendors and the less focused server companies. EMC is truly unique in the storage infrastructure markets. Our diverse and best portfolio enable us to serve virtually information storage need in just about any customer in any industry. The results has been strong and steady growth of our storage infrastructure business driven by the strong secular trends of cloud and Big Data.
The successful transitions for model that leverages clouded Big Data is dependent upon both the right infrastructure and also building trust to that infrastructure. Having a holistic and data center approach to security dangers such as advanced precision that's the key to building trust, and RSA has been at the forefront of this security trend. RSA's focus and execution are paying off as a business grew a strong 19% over the last year's Q1.
Attendance in this year's RSA security conference, the murky conference in the industry, grew to a record 21,000 people underscoring the growing importance of information security in today's digital world. RSA solutions are built from the multiple environments, and customers are expanding as revenue from both our identity management and protection our security management and compliance offerings both showed good growth over last year's Q1. RSA continues to earn accolades as our NetWitness technology received gold level honors in security products magazines, government security warrants, was named Best Computer Forensic Tool in Secure Computing's Magazine 2012 trust and was named Best Security Solution in Government Technology Research Alliance award program. NetWitness, in conjunction with Archer, envision and DLP, worked together to provide controls and visibility features that are based on agile, predictive analysis and continuous monitoring of mass amounts of data. We'll continue to build on our data centric approach to security to enable our customers in turn to take full advantage of benefits afforded by cloud and Big Data.
Revenue from our information intelligence group was down 4% year-on-year. In Q1, IIG released documents and mobile app for the iPhone, expanding uses ability to access share and collaborate on their preferred device and enable them to act upon information faster than ever before. IIG continues to win new customers as it did with the largest public banking organization in Turkey. With an aggressive strategy to grow its service network, more than 22,000 employees and 1,400 branch offices, Bank shows EMC Documentum. As a result, the bank can now manage internal correspondence and regulation processes to ensure global compliance and operational efficiency, automate application processing to accelerate transactions and increase productivity across various sale departments.
We are pleased with the operational and strategic progress on new leadership team is making at IIG. VMware continues to perform very well as we execute on our strategy to be the standard for virtualization and enterprise data centers enabling businesses to thrive in the cloud era. VMware revenue was up 25% year-on-year as customers continue to look to VMware's proven technology for virtualized their mission-critical applications increasingly rely upon VMware's management and automation tools to manage the rapidly expanded virtual environments.
We continue to enhance EMC's product integration with VMware in ways to solve real-world problems and in areas that are clearly making a difference including VPLEX for active after data centers, procedure for integrated management and the inclusion of VMware as the founding partner in the VSPEX Reference Architecture Program.
Site integration with VMware is important as customers expand their virtual environments and was a key reason for several wins in Q1 alone, including a U.S.-based manufacturer, a hospital in Shanghai, a stock exchange in Asia and a mining company in Latin America. Expect to hear more about EMC and VMware working together at EMC World. EMC's initiatives have transformed and expand our go-to-market model continue to pay dividends. Over the past couple of years, we augmented our already formidable sales efforts with additional target service capabilities, expanded alliance partnerships, have vastly expanded resale channel and the unique joint venture in VCE. All these initiatives broaden our reach with the result being better scale and more leverage. EMC serves its business continues to thrive as customers see guidance on the transformation of their own IT architectures. In addition to our existing design and implementation services for cloud infrastructures, in Q1, we added offerings specific to the delivery of IT as a service. These new services which aligned around cloud infrastructure, cloud optimized applications and end-user computing, helped clients accelerate the adoption, optimization and consumption of technologies.
Our alliance partnerships with service providers continue to expand, and these partners are steadily increasing their capabilities. With well over 100 public cloud services now being offered by service provider partners based upon underlying EMC technology, our entire product portfolio stands to benefit. The transformative changes we've made to our channel program in 2011 continue to be successful. Channel revenue from our S75 program which is primarily VNXe, continues to ramp steadily. As unified storage revenue throughout our top 5 partners increased 45% year-on-year in Q1. 
We continue to make improvements to further develop our relationships with our partners and help ensure their success. The VSPEX service architectures we announced last week help our partners accelerate their customers transition to cloud with solutions that make the move to the cloud faster and less complex. EMC has proven several architectures for partners to package into storable VSPEX solutions, which are available only from industry partners. VSPEX enables customers to select the technologies that best fit their existing IT environments from a broad selection of leading vendors.
For customers and partners who want to make their implementation even easier, V blocks continues to be the answer, and demand for Vblocks in the quarter more than doubled from Q1 a year ago. As a single converged product with components from EMC, Cisco and VMware with a single pane of glass and managements, a clear upgrade path and one point of contact for customer support, Vblocks are compelling option for customers looking to accelerate the journey to the cloud.
We are seeing significant interest in Vblocks on a global basis. Not only our many new customers is dying to test out these conversion products, but we see early adopters coming back to purchase multiple Vblocks to run through their production operations. In fact, a growing percentage of VCE business is coming from customers who are beginning to adopt multiple Vblocks for their production environments after liking what they saw in their initial purchase. A prime example of this was a Fortune 50 customer who had an initial transaction in Q3 of last year, followed by a multimillion dollar deal in Q4, followed by $25 million order in Q1. This deal is representative of the penetration we're seeing in competitive stronghold accounts.
It's as important to understand the difference between Vblocks and our newly announced VSPEX offerings as both are important to our strategy to help customers to get the cloud to most suitable way for them. For customers wanting pretax conversion product, there are Vblocks, which have been available for 2 years. For customers wanting a test improvement reference architecture with different options for network, servant hypervisor, now is VSPEX. For customers wanting to assemble solutions themselves, we have a broad portfolio of information infrastructure and virtualization props they can choose from. So in short, we offer the full continuum of options to get to cloud in whatever way is best suited to them, whether it's a prebaked cake, a set of tested recipes to make the cake or just ingredients.
For some time now, our vision has been to become the undisputed leader in hybrid cloud computing, and as our results attest, we're making this happen. We developed the strategy to our customers the right data in the right place at the right time.  We have secured every step of the way that you make the best use of cloud technology and Big Data assets in a trust environment. Our product and services portfolio and go-to-market model are evolving as we continue our own transitions help customers improve business agility, lower costs and enhance their competitive edge. This unwavering focus instead acquisition is supported by the strong secular trends of cloud, Big Data and trust are what they have enabled us to deliver consistently solid financial results.
Consolidated revenues were up a solid 11% year-on-year. Within this, North America was up 11%, EMEA was up 6% overall but was somewhat of a mixed story across various countries with strong and some caution in others, Latin America and APJ were both a strong 20%.
Now taking a look at gross margins. Obviously, we've shown significant improvement in gross margins over the last year or so. There are lots of puts and takes built into these results so I thought it would make sense to take a few moments to discuss these factors with you so you have a better understanding of the dynamics. 
From Q1 '11 through Q4 '11, gross margin improved by a very significant 440 basis points. Apart from volume, this improvement was driven by 4 factors: The first 2 of which were margin rate impacts, while the second 2 were mixed effects. First was the RSA remediation cost we absorbed in Q1 '11. This resulted in what was effectively an adverse onetime impact of approximately 50 basis points to the Q1 '11 non-GAAP gross margin rates. Second was a step-function improvement to the margin rates of specific products and services which played out over the course of the year. Integration of Data Domain and Isilon into our supply chain was a bit factor here. We also benefited from greater efficiencies in our services operations. Third was the benefit to mix of some low margin business declining through 2011. Our consumer products business deemphasized low-margin, resale focus hard drive systems in favor of more value-added NAS systems. In addition, we saw the decline in the Dell cobranding Clarion business throughout 2011. These 2 declining businesses reduced our lower margin revenues over the course of the year and have a result of positive impact that gross margin improvements during 2011. Fourth was the improving mix of higher-margin businesses and products, and we benefited from this over the course of 2011. This is an important ongoing aspect of our financial model as our faster growing businesses tend to be our higher-margin businesses.
We will look at 2012 and how we expect gross margins to progress from Q1 to Q4 this year, the first 3 of these factors will not repeat. The fourth, however, is ongoing. We certainly do expect to see continual mix-related improvements to gross margins as our higher-margin faster growing business become a bigger proportion of the business. This is an important part of our strategy and a key element of our triple play and of course, we'll continue to have benefits from volumes as our business continues to grow. 
To help you understand the relative contribution to these drivers to the improvements in gross margin we saw from Q1 '11 to Q4 '11, approximately half of the improvements gross margins through 2011 resulted from the first 3 factors that will not be repeated in 2012. We expect the growth in volume to continue to benefit the gross margin line but obviously, the improvement from strategic mix shift will be more gradual this year and moving forward. This dynamic is reflected in our outlook for 2012.
Improvement in gross margin in Q1 drove non-GAAP operating margin up 150 basis points as SG&A growth was in line with revenue growth and R&D higher as we have projected, it will be in January. Investments in our gross margins and R&D are important to maintain our triple play over the long-term. You'll see some of the results of these investments in the form of the exciting product announcements we'll make drop this year.
Other expense was $31 million non-GAAP. We've updated our full-year guidance for other expense reflects some gains from strategic investments in Q1. Our non-GAAP Q1 tax rate was 24%. We expect it to be 21% for the full year assuming the U.S. R&D tax credit is passed in Q4. Non-GAAP EPS grew 19% below last year's first quarter to $0.37 per share. Share count was higher than expected due to the effect of the 39% increase in our share price in the quarter on our 2012 warrants that were settled in Q1 2012 and our on 2013 convertible and warrants. As a result, we've increased our full user and protection back 45 million shares, the impact of which is about $0.04 for the full year 2012. We still expect 2012 non-GAAP EPS to be $1.70 due to the offsetting benefit from side to higher operating margins that we predicted in January.
Our strong execution drove record Q1 free cache flow of $1.4 billion, $611 million higher than non-GAAP net income for the period. Contributing to this was continued strong growth in deferred revenue of 10% sequentially to $6.8 billion. We ended Q1 with $10.9 billion in cash and investments, after using $1.7 billion of cash to settle the first tranche of our convertible debt in January. Our U.S. cash, excluding VMware, was down from $4.8 billion to $4 billion as a result of these repayments. Our priorities for the use of cash has not changed. We still expect to buy $700 million of EMC shares in 2012 and continue to invest in the business. The results continue to achieve quarter after quarter, it is clear that our strategy is the right one, our execution is solid and we're on track to deliver triple play. This gives us greater confidence in our ability to meet and potentially exceed our 2012 goals of $22 billion of revenue, non-GAAP EPS of $1.70 and free cash flow $4.9 billion. 
In summary, the business we have built is at the intersection of 3 strong secular trends, cloud, Big Data and trust that will persist into the foreseeable future. With this fundamental shift in our favor and unparalleled combination of best-of-breed offerings, our wealth of experience and proven track record, we think we are better positioned than any other company in IT.
We've continued steady acquisition, well on our way to achieving the financial potential we laid out for you last year. Over $28 billion in revenue in 2014, which represents compound annual revenue growth of at least 13% from 2010 and non-GAAP EPS growth even faster than this.
With that, I'll hand over to Joe. Joe?"

We appreciate your interest in EMC. Overall, I was very pleased with our acquisition and performance in Q1. I've always believed that starting at a new year with strength is incredib",1077,"Thank you, David, and my thanks to everyone joining us for today's call. We appreciate your interest in EMC. Overall, I was very pleased with our acquisition and performance in Q1. I've always believed that starting at a new year with strength is incredibly important. The momentum and confidence of bill throughout EMC, our customers and our partners is invaluable. I will talk about the economy in IT spending trends shortly, but we firmly believe that the 11% year-over-year growth rate we produced in Q1 was significantly greater than that of the IT market. And thus, we gained share. I'd like to thank the more than 54,000 people of EMC and VMware for their passion to win and their dedication to our customers success.
In Q1, we saw IT spending and our business unfold pretty much as we expected and predicted. Overall IT spending growth is fairly good in the Americas and APJ as our 11% and 20% year-over-year respective increases the maturity. In Europe, I believe that overall IT spending growth was at best, flat. For sure, the 6% year-over-year growth we posted in Q1 was better than average. And finally, we saw our highest growth rates in the rapid growth economies. Across our BRIC + 13 countries, we grew over 25% in Q1 versus the same period last year.
Looking at Q1 year-over-year IT spending growth from a vertical industry point of view, we saw some softness in the banking sector. Average growth in retail manufacturing, telco and information-technology verticals, good growth in insurance, government, healthcare, education and media in these our rapid growth even with service providers. Net-net, we continue to expect the global IT spending growth, we'll be in the 3% to 4% range this year. And for sure, the IT markets for virtualization, cloud computing, information storage, information protection, information security and for information intelligence and analytics will grow faster than the IT average. And we at EMC and VMware will expect to grow faster than our total addressable market.
What underpins our belief and our ability to succeed in the future is our strategy and the focus we have in cloud computing, Big Data and trust. What makes our strategy work is several key ingredients that we have built deeply into our DNA. First and foremost, EMC and VMware are product companies. And as such, our mission is to produce truly innovative and distinctive products, which are complemented by world-class enabling and supportive services with a tightknit partner ecosystem by our side. Our recipe to produce these innovative products cost for us to invest over 11% of revenues into organic R&D and bet heavily on our brilliant engineering teams. And in addition, to acquire smaller, best-of-breed technology companies to enhance and extend our crowd to Big Data interest strategy and reach. This one-two punch gives us a competitive product edge and we aim to continue this winning strategy of dual innovation engines.
That said, a great strategy is not sufficient alone. Equally as important, we at EMC and VMware have also built the following attributes into our DNA. We always exhibit an excellence in acquisition and an urgency in everything we do. We have built an accomplished executive leadership group that truly comes together as a team. We have a passion to win that permeates every level and every person in our company and most importantly, every fiber in our DNA ensures that we have maniacal focus and our customers. Collectively, this is our formula for success.
We have limited time together today, and I would like used benefit to drill down on EMC's storage business and share a bit of our view on this market and our strategy. First, let's start with the media itself. We can store a string of bytes be it measured in gigabytes, megabytes or terabytes in memory or on a single level cell flash device or on a multilevel cell flash device or on a high-speed spinning drive or a net SATA or so-called that FAST drive. I've listed these forms of media from the most expensive, highest performance on top and in order going down to the least expensive, lowest performance media on the bottom. By the way, the price differential hear from top to bottom is significantly more than 100 to one. And there are substantial price differentials between each of these media layers. So where's the best place to store the aforementioned string of bytes? Well, the answer is, it depends. It depends on the performance requirements of the application, the business process, the activity level or how often the data is being accessed, the required retention periods for the data and I could go on and on with this. It depends. But net net, we at EMC will use all these forms of media and that will be more forms will in the future our customers with unmatched fit and choice. With these media types, we will use our strength, breadth and depth and ability to create organic and nonorganic innovation and produce truly distinctive storage products. Products like VFCache that plugs directly into server PCIe slot. Products like Project Thunder, are coming server Flash appliance, storage products that feature 100% Flash media and of course, we will continue to lead the market with hybrid storage arrays that incorporate memory, Flash and spinning drive technology as this category of storage will undoubtedly make up the vast majority for years to come.
Additionally, EMC will feature and support all connectivity options. Fiber Channel, FCOe, NAS and direct attach. And we will offer object, file and block access methods and scale up, scale out and geographically dispersed architectures. And across all of our storage offerings, we'll fully integrate and future advanced management software like pros fear, software like FAST, or fully automated storage tearing, software that the duplicates and compresses redundant data and automation that active active distribute work loads across data centers. In short, we will have the best fit, most complete family of best-of-breed storage solutions that truly meet and exceed the needs of our most demanding customers.
For sure, information storage is not and I repeat, not a one-size-fits-all world. And all this product is backed by our reputation for quality and service and fronted by the best stored sales organization in the industry, bar none.

So first of all, kudos to the drive supplies for responding rapidly to a very serious situation. And the quarter played out as expected. There were constraints, and there still are constraints particularly in near line drives. But we got the drives. During the quarter, we expected needed to make our numbers albeit in the near line space, they came in a little late in the quarter, end of February to early March. And of course, as we said on the last call, we have to do some balancing during the quarter to meet supply and demand. We do expect it to be constrained certainly throughout Q2. But again, we do have line of sight to drive a GAAP that we need but we think we'll reach income and improvement in the second half but certain class of drugs will see constraint throughout the entire year. On the price increase side, as you know, we did put drive price increases up between 5% and 15% in early January. And whilst nobody likes the price increases again to our gross margins that we're able to capture the majority if not all those price increases. And given the supply constraints, we don't expect it to be any significant reduction in prices in the near future, maybe towards the end of the year when the whole situation becomes a little bit more normal. And then finally, in terms of orders, the good news is that although it took us a little longer this quarter to deliver some of the orders we took early in the quarter, we don't think we lost orders and we don't think that customers pushed out this is because I think everybody is in the same boat when it comes to drive availability and I think if anything, we were better off the most."

Flash today is a small single-digit percentage, but the adage goes in hybrid array, a little Flash goes a long way. And what I mean by that is that you can improve the performance of an array dramatically by having maybe less than 5% of the capacity in Flash and using FAST software, moving those hot data sets into the high-performing media types. So we see a small increase in a steady increase going forward in the mix of Flash, but we still think that the vast majority of capacity shifts for many, many years is going be fiber and SATA. Within that, a mix more towards SATA and less towards fiber but we think that's pretty much how things play out. And from a margin point of view as Joe said, we're fairly agnostic to the media type. In fact, different media types are in fact good for us because we can offer more choices, more price points to our customers. And we're getting a very broadly similar margins across those media types. So the mix shift in media is not going to have a material impact in our gross margins."

That being said, the public cloud market will be the faster growing of the 2 because it's coming from a tiny base, if you will. But we do believe totally that the world is going to be hybrid. Certainly, as you heard on the VMware call last night, one of the state of the art is that customers are now confident of that they are, in significant numbers, working on virtualizing and cloud icing, if you will, private cloud icing, their Tier 1 apps. And that probably has the most return and benefits for our customers and that's where a lot of the action is. But certainly, on their lower tiers and test and dev, I think over time, you'll see customers basically when they get to a peak workload or a peak time of the year, they'll be pushing out some applications like test and dev and other applications to a public cloud, and that will avoid them having to peak of the day, peak of the day, peak times and help reduce and contain their overall IT cost. With taking them crowded to be more application work and get business benefits. That's a trend you're going to see. So it's not an either/or, we're in a world of both. You also heard yesterday that the progress that we're making in these tier adopted clouds and of course, I just told you that the public cloud business is probably the fastest growing sector, kind of verticals, if you will, that I'd spoke about.

We expected VMAX to be down this quarter for 2 reasons. One is the one that David highlighted and you mentioned. It is a tremendous quarter we had one year ago. I mean it's highly unusual that you would grow from Q4 to a Q1 with Symmetrix 12%. Highly unusual that you would actually decline from Q1 to Q2 8%, which is exactly what happened last year. And that was so year in your growth last year was 25%. So it was a really strong quarter, and that is absolutely a major factor and we knew that, and that's why we plan the way we plan. But you hit upon the second reason, which is a major reason too. Look, lifecycles are important in any product. But I'll tell you point blank, the higher end product you have, right, the more important a life cycle is. And if you recall, we launched the VMAX in April of 2009. So it is pretty close to exactly 3 years old. And clearly, our customers are expecting and wanting a new, even higher end model and product. And all I'm going to say is we don't want to get ahead of ourselves and ruin our announcement, but I'm probably am going to do that anyhow. I'll tell you point-blank that the customers are expecting that will not be disappointed, and it's coming soon."

Rather than give our view, on the quote IDC, they just came out with a Big Data white paper and analysis for hardware, software and services and they did it dated from 2010 to 2015. I don't know if you saw it. But in 2010, they thought the Big Data market was $3.2 million and they think it will grow almost 40%, 39.4%, if memory serves me right, was the actual CAGR they had in there between then. And it'll be a $16.9 billion market in 2015. So there's a heck of an opportunity. Now if you look at the Big Data market, we're really playing in the highest and of that market. If you think of what a customer really needs to do to get an credible competitive advantage, they want to take their internal structure data, which there's a ton of. They want to take their internal unstructured data, which there's multiple times as much of, and then they want to go to the public markets and public sources and get the massive amount of data that's available there and blend these all together and really use this data in real-time predictive analysis to give their company a competitive advantage. And that's area we are playing in, and we don't even try to go and say at this place existing data warehouse. We're going after the new stuff which is more complex, and that's what products like Chorus and our Hadoop distribution and support is all about as well as, of course, our Greenplum Database. So we're playing I think at the highest end of the pyramid. So if the entire pyramid is growing at 39.4%, ours is growing faster than that. And we're growing faster than that. So we're very excited about the opportunity here. And as I said, I've always been one of the things I preach, and my team is probably tired of me saying it, but I really believe big companies should not do small things. Big companies should only do small things that are going to become big things. In our case and our size, we should not enter a market unless we think we can do $1 billion plus there. And this is the case where I think that $1 billion plus will be light, we can do more than that, and we'll do more than that. So I'm very pleased with our progress, and that's kind of how we think about this opportunity."

And what I'm really saying is we expect gross margins to increase sequentially from Q1 to Q4 this year. I've pointed out the sequential increase you saw last year, half of that was from the things that really we don't expect to reoccur. And just to put also into context, when I look at the 290 basis points of gross margin improvement we achieved Q1 this year versus Q1 last year, about half of that improvement was also from the 3 factors which I mentioned which would have occurring during 2011 that won't be occurring during 2012. So we do expect they'll be sequential margin improvement from where we are. Also bear in mind that we were being pretty consistent on our guidance for OpEx during the year. We said that we expect our SG&A growth to be in line broadly with revenue growth, and we expect R&D growth to grow faster. So we do expect OpEx to continue to increase as a percentage of revenue this year as we move through the year. SO you put all those together, and you can trend to a number that's pretty consistent with what we've implied in our guidance, and those are really the moving parts."

I'm very pleased to report that EMC had a strong start to 2012. As you know, there's a major transformation happening in IT today, and the challenge for all of us is to make sure we correctly align our businesses to best take advantage of the opportunity the change provides. EMC's ability to correctly identify and invest in these changes has been a major reason for our success and enabled us to grow revenue 11% year-over-year this quarter with non-GAAP EPS up 19% and free cash flow up 67%. We are in a truly unprecedented time of transformation. IT is transforming with the shift to cloud computing. Businesses are transforming as they better leverage Big Data to deliver greater insight and uncover new opportunities. And the new threat environments is transforming the way customers think about trust.
We at EMC are transforming our portfolio and operations to best take advantage of these major shifts. We believe that we have positioned EMC well, and our solid results are ongoing proof that we're executing on our strategy to address the major trends in cloud, Big Data and trust. Based on our strong start to the year and how we feel about our opportunity, we are now more confident about what we can achieve in 2012.
Looking across our businesses, it's clear that EMC is very well equipped to help customers navigate the waves of change they are facing today. As a foundation for customers cloud and Big Data initiatives, information storage continues to thrive. With varied use cases and data types, EMC's broad and deep portfolio continues to prove to be best-of-breed. As a case in point, information storage continues the trend on solid growth with revenues up 7% in Q1. High-end storage product revenue was down 10% year-on-year versus a very strong Q1 last year. As you may recall, we had an unusually strong first quarter in 2011 due to the introduction of FAST VP in conjunction with VMAX. In that quarter, high-end product was up 25% year-on-year and a very strong and unusual 12% sequentially. Whilst the significant variance in these year-on-year growth rates had a meaningful impact on the year-on-year growth and inflation storage revenue, we're comfortable with how our storage business is trending.
After 2 years of above trend line growth, we expect the high-end storage market to return to the long-term single-digit growth profile we projected for the segment. Customers at the high-end seek the very best in performance, scalability and reliability, and VMAX is the best position to meet these needs as it offers unmatched combination of innovative features.
Fully automated storage tiering or FAST software, along with Flash, fiber and SATA drives allows customers to consolidate different tiers of data onto a single array and reduce their data center footprint. While the scale-out architecture of VMAX, coupled with Flash, improves transactional performance dramatically while accommodating explosive data growth. And we continuously improve our Symmetrix product line as technology and customer needs evolve. We recently became the first enterprise storage vendor to achieve validation of 140 encryption for all drive types including Flash with our Symmetrix data arrest encryption module. This module, which protects the information from unauthorized access at the individual drive level, can be integrated with RSA key management.
The unmatched combination of leading-edge capabilities at the high-end is why Amaron, a power company with 3.4 million electric and gas customers, selected VMAX for their mission-critical Oracle database and custom application environments. With 100 terabytes of data being added to its infrastructure each year, Amaron was struggling to keep up with its data growth and increasing IT management costs while advancing their VMware virtualization and cloud computing strategy. With VMAX using FAST and accommodation of Flash fiber channel and SATA drives, they were able to reduce their annual capital expenses by 50%, increase transactional performance by 30% and achieve power and cooling savings of 28%.
In its second full quarter of availability, VMAXe revenue continues to ramp as it meets the requirements between a low-end VMAX and a high-end VNX and extends the reach of the VMAX family to new customers, usages and price points. Such was the case with a fast-growing community college system in Texas. By consolidating its infrastructure onto a VMAXe, the school system dramatically improved its ability to provide students with the latest educational technology and tools, respond more quickly to the needs of local employers and increase the overall efficiency and reliability of their operational systems. The VMAXe was part of a larger win a customer who also implemented EMC Avamar, Networker, RecoverPoint, vSphere and Vcenter Site Recovery Manager for their 97% virtualized infrastructure.
VPLEX continues to be an integral part of our portfolio, as a unique product that dissolves distance and enables data centers to be truly active/active for the first time. This was illustrated by a draw and a larger win in Q1, this one is healthcare. This transaction include a number of complementary EMC products including VMAX within a vBlock, Data Domain and Avamar. To complete its life-critical continuous computing platform, the hospital needed active/active data center configuration that VPLEX Metro made possible. VPLEX's ability to move vSphere applications between data centers, several towns apart without interruption, will enable them to fully leverage their virtualized infrastructure and lower the total cost of ownership.
Our mid-tier products continue to perform very well, with product revenue growth up 26% year-on-year. And by the way, this is 100% organic growth. So no growth bump from acquisitions. Our portfolio of mid-tier storage capabilities is a great match with customers expanding requirements in this area. 
Our VNX Family, which we introduced in Q1 of last year, is living up to our high expectations. Customers and partners alike like its functionality, simplicity, efficiency and lower cost of ownership. With its unified architecture, unparalleled VMware integration, incorporation of Flash for both cache and storage and ability to automatically tier data with FAST, the VNX continues to win us a bigger footprint with customers. And the VNXe, which offers affordable simplicity and efficiency to smaller customers and remote offices, has firmly established EMC as a player in the low-end of the market.
Since it's introduction, the VNX Family has brought just under 6,000 brand new customers to EMC, many of whom have been acquired via the more than 2,000 new channel partners who started selling EMC over the same period of time. Together, the VNX and VNXe allow us to meet a broad set of need to customers, seeking the flexibility of unified storage. One such customer was a global aluminum company that is consolidating its IT infrastructure worldwide to 3 primary data centers plus a DR site and approximately 30 remote offices. The primary data centers will use VNXs with VMware to consolidate applications and significantly reduce costs. While the 30 remote offices will use VNXe 3100 arrays for primary storage. This example illustrates how valuable it is to have a broad array of products in today's rapidly changing IT environments. This same customer, by the way, also purchased our full suite of backup product to address the various backup needs across their next-gen infrastructure.
Isilon continues to flourish, with total revenue almost doubling from Q1 year ago. Isilon technology plays an important role among our mid-tier products as it meets customer's cloud and Big Data requirements across industries and use cases. Our scale at NAS architecture is exceptionally well suited for extremely large-scale Big Data needs. And in Q1, we completed what we believe was the largest capacity single-order in the history of storage, 28 petabytes with a web company. To put this into perspective, this amount of storage could hold 6 million movies. And while 28 petabytes is impressive, you need 37 million petabytes to accommodate the genetic sequence of the entire population of the United States. As you can see, we have a lot more room to grow in some of these emerging Big Data areas.
Isilon is being used in more traditional enterprise implementation as well. File-based data, that might be managed -- or 10 years ago, has been growing unchecked, reaching petabyte scale in some cases. And this is where Isilon scale architecture is ideal. A case in point was the choice of Isilon by a large national insurance company recently. EMC has been part of its data center for some time and used the value proposition of Isilon to consolidate their file environment in Q1.
As our sales force and partners have become much better at identifying the best opportunities for Isilon, we expect to see Isilon increasingly penetrating our existing customer base. Putting the EMC name, reputation, sales force and service levels behind great new technology is a powerful combination. The result is what we call that EMC effect.
We have seen the EMC effect at work for the past couple of years in our backup recovery systems business, which continues to thrive. Our market-leading backup products, which include the powerful combination of Avamar and Data Domain also lead the way into new accounts and have brought hundreds of new logos to EMC over the past several quarters. One of these in Q1 was a large financial services organization that was running out of data center floor space and running into power and cooling challenges with its large tape silos. By demonstrating that Data Domain's next gen backup architecture provides efficiency, reliability and business value, it was impossible with their tape based systems. Our BRS team was able to establish brand-new footprint in all 3 of the organizations data centers.
We continue to broaden our storage portfolio in Q1 with the very exciting addition of VFCache, which extends our lead in Enterprise Flash. In 2008, we were the first to bring Flash technology to enterprise storage and its value proposition to customers is clear as evidenced by the growing demand it has enjoyed ever since. We are leveraging our expertise in Enterprise Flash with VFCache, which extent the benefit of Flash into the server for dramatic performance improvements. What distinguishes VFCache is its ability to deliver extremely fast response times whilst preserving all the back end capabilities around data protection, reliability, scalability and manageability. This is a value proposition with broad appeal, as illustrated by our early customer wins including a bank in China, a financial services company in Boston, a retailer in the Middle East, a government in Asia, and a research lab in U.K., a hospital in New England and a U.S.-based telecommunications company to name but a few. Their feedback so far is very positive as they're seeing how fast some of their mission-critical applications, like Oracle and SQL, are able to run. We're also excited to be in discussions with several new generation web application companies, and you'll see us continue to enhance VFCache later this year.
Later this quarter, At EMC World, you'll hear more about our next step with Flash, codenamed Project Thunder. Optimized for high-frequency, low-latency, rewrite work loads, Thunder will build upon the advanced PCIe technology delivered in VFCache to leverage the power of Flash for a dedicated server-networked flash-based appliance.
Building Flash into many places in the IT infrastructure, while fully leveraging it with intelligent automated software that operates across this stack, is the real secret sauce to delivering value. What the customer cares about is having the right data at the right time in the right place at the right cost. And making this happen involves service, leveraging Flash at end of the spectrum, the high-capacity SATA drives and storage arrays at the other. We have the end-to-end expertise with Enterprise Flash and data storage unmatched in the industry, and we'll continue to build on our opposition as the innovative leaders in Enterprise Flash.
When we look back at the storage products we've just discussed, VMAX, VPLEX, VNX, Isilon, Data Domain, Avamar, VFCache, you can see this is a very different portfolio than what we had just 3 years ago. One that's been purposely assembled to address new requirements brought about by the rapidly changing IT environments. Our recent win at a global humanitarian organization is an excellent example of the power of EMC's portfolio in this new world. Rotary International implemented VNXe, Isilon, Avamar and vSphere to better manage its growing digital assets, deploy a Vblock for its mission critical applications and primary storage and leverages VNXe at a second facility to replicate data. Rotary was able to build a solid foundation for its virtualization environment on EMC's suite of complementary products which have been optimized for these environments. The result is simplified management, strengthened data protection, predictable performance and improved efficiency. This is our strategy at work.
Increasingly, businesses are being transformed by their ability to unlock the value of data stored within their organization and in the outside world. We identified this trend early and began making investments to capture the opportunity Big Data presents, starting with the acquisition of Greenplum in 2010. Greenplum has since made great strides in the space with several achievements in Q1 alone, including the industry's first and only enterprise-proven Hadoop solution on the scale out NAS architecture with Isilon, enabling end-to-end data protection for Hadoop Big Data. The designation, as a leader, enterprise Hadoop solution by Forrester research as the first to integrate its Hadoop ETW and data integration in a single rack. The launch of the industry's first social tool kit for Big Data, Greenplum Chorus, enabling data science teams to collaborate on data sets. The acquisition of Pivotal Labs to accelerate the development of Big Data applications in the enterprise, not to mention continue very strong year-on-year growth in revenue.
Greenplum is increasingly benefiting from the EMC effect. While it's early days, and the Big Data trend has quite a way to go before it reaches full potential, customers see the transformation in analytics and want to build the best technology stack with the right partners as they start on their journey to leverage Big Data. As a result, we're now seeing multimillion dollar transactions as more and more enterprises select Greenplum technology as the foundation for their next gen analytics architectures. In Q1, these wins included a large financial services company in New York, a leading supplier of industrial automation solutions in India and a multinational telecommunications company in Europe.
Taking a step back, it is clear that we've anticipated how customers needs would change in this space, and we've transformed our portfolio of storage offerings to address those needs. As a result, we now have a broad portfolio of best-of-breed products, which enable customers to pick the right tool for the job they have. The offerings we have far exceed the capabilities of both the more narrowly focused storage vendors and the less focused server companies. EMC is truly unique in the storage infrastructure market. Our diverse and best-of-breed portfolio enable us to serve virtually information storage need in just about any customer in any industry. The results has been strong and steady growth of our storage infrastructure business driven by the strong secular trends of cloud and Big Data.
The successful transition to a model that leverages cloud and Big Data is dependent upon both the right infrastructure and also building trust into that infrastructure. Having a holistic and data center approach to security dangers, such as advanced persistent threats, is key to building trust and RSA has been at the forefront of this security trend. RSA's focus and execution are paying off as the business grew a strong 19% over last year's Q1.
Attendance at year's RSA security conference, the marquee conference in the industry, grew to a record 21,000 people, underscoring the growing importance of information security in today's digital world. RSA solutions are built for the modern threat environment, and customers are responding, as revenue from both our identity management and protection and our security management and compliance offerings both showed good growth over last year's Q1. RSA continues to earn accolades as our NetWitness technology received gold level honors in Security Products Magazine's Government Security Awards, was named Best Computer Forensic Tool in Secure Computing Magazine 2012 Reader's Trust and was named Best Security Solution in Government Technology Research Alliance GOVTek Awards program. NetWitness, in conjunction with Archer, enVision and DLP, worked together to provide controls and visibility features that are based on agile, predictive analysis and continuous monitoring of mass amounts of data. We'll continue to build on our data-centric approach to security to enable our customers, in turn, to take full advantage of benefits afforded by cloud and Big Data.
Revenue from our Information Intelligence Group was down 4% year-on-year. In Q1, IIG released documents and mobile app for the iPhone, expanding users ability to access, share and collaborate on their preferred device and enable them to act upon information faster than ever before. IIG continues to win new customers as it did with the largest public banking organization in Turkey. With an aggressive strategy to grow its service network of more than 22,000 employees and 1,400 branch offices, Ziraat Bank chose EMC Documentum. As a result, the bank can now manage internal correspondence and regulation processes to ensure global compliance and operational efficiency, automate application processing to accelerate transactions and increase productivity across various internal departments.  We are pleased with the operational and strategic progress our new leadership team is making at IIG. 
VMware continues to perform very well as we execute on our strategy to be the standard for virtualization and enterprise data centers, enabling businesses to thrive in the cloud era. VMware revenue was up 25% year-on-year as customers continue to look to VMware's proven technology for virtualized their mission-critical applications, and increasingly, rely upon VMware's management and automation tools to manage their rapidly expanding virtual environments.
We continue to enhance EMC's product integration with VMware in ways that solve real-world problems and in areas that are clearly making a difference, including VPLEX for active/active data centers, ProSphere for integrated management and the inclusion of VMware as the founding partner in the VSPEX reference architecture program.
Site integration with VMware is important as customers expand their virtual environment and were the key reason for several wins in Q1 alone, including a U.S.-based manufacturer, a hospital in Shanghai, a stock exchange in Asia and a mining company in Latin America. Expect to hear more about EMC and VMware working together at EMC World. EMC's initiatives to transform and expand our go-to-market model continue to pay dividends. Over the past couple of years, we've augmented our already formidable sales efforts with additional targeted service capabilities, expanded alliance partnerships, a vastly expanded resale channel and the unique joint venture in VCE. All these initiatives broaden our reach, with the result being better scale and more leverage. EMC Services business continues to thrive, as customers seek guidance on the transformation of their own IT architectures. In addition to our existing design and implementation services for cloud infrastructures, in Q1, we added offerings specific to the delivery of IT-as-a-service. These new services which are aligned around cloud infrastructure, cloud optimized applications and end-user computing, helped clients accelerate the adoption, optimization and consumption of cloud technologies.
Our alliance partnerships, with service providers continue to expand, and these partners are steadily increasing their capabilities. With well over 100 public cloud services now being offered by service provider partners based upon underlying EMC technology, our entire product portfolio stands to benefit.
The transformative changes we've made to our channel program in 2011 continue to be successful. Channel revenue from our S75 program which is primarily VNXe, continues to ramp steadily. As unified storage revenue throughout our top 5 partners increased 45% year-on-year in Q1.
We continue to make improvements to further develop our relationships with our partners and help ensure their success. The VSPEX reference architectures we announced last week help our partners accelerate their customers transition to cloud with solutions that make the move to the cloud faster and less complex. EMC has proven several architectures for partners to package into it's storable VSPEX solutions, which are available only EMC partners. VSPEX enables customers to select the technologies that best fit their existing IT environments from a broad selection of leading vendors.
For customers and partners who want to make their implementation even easier, vBlocks continues to be the answer, and demand for vBlocks in the quarter more than doubled from Q1 a year ago. As a single converged product, with components from EMC, Cisco and VMware with a single pane of glass and managements, a clear upgrade path and one point of contact for customer support, vBlocks are a compelling option for customers looking to accelerate their journey to the cloud.
We're seeing significant interest in vBlocks on a global basis. Not only are many new customers dying to test out these converged products, but we see early adopters coming back to purchase multiple vBlocks to run through their production applications. In fact, a growing percentage of VCE business is coming from customers who are beginning to adopt multiple vBlocks for their production environments after liking what they saw in their initial purchase. A prime example of this was a Fortune 50 customer who had an initial transaction in Q3 of last year, followed by a multimillion dollar deal in Q4, followed by a $25 million order in Q1. This deal is representative of the penetration we're seeing in competitive stronghold accounts.
It is important to understand the difference between vBlocks and our newly announced VSPEX offerings as both are important to our strategy to help customers to get the cloud to most suitable way for them. For customers wanting pretested converged product, there are vBlocks, which have been available for 2 years. For customers wanting a tested and proven reference architecture with different options for network, server and hypervisor, now as VSPEX. For customers wanting to assemble solutions themselves, we have our broad portfolio of information infrastructure and virtualization products they can choose from. So in short, we offer the full continuum of options for customers to get to cloud in whatever way is best suited to them, whether it's the prebaked cake, a set of tested recipes to make the cake or just the ingredients.
For some time now, our vision has been to become the undisputed leader in hybrid cloud computing, and as our results attest, we're making this happen. We've developed a strategy to help customers have the right data in the right place at the right time, where it's secure every step of the way, and where they can make the best use of cloud technology and Big Data assets in a trust environment. Our products and services portfolio and go-to-market model are evolving as we continue our own transition to help customers improve business agility, lower cost and enhance their competitive edge. This unwavering focus and steady execution supported by the strong secular trends of cloud, Big Data and trust are what have enabled us to deliver consistently solid financial results.
Consolidated revenues were up a solid 11% year-on-year. Within this, North America was up 11%, EMEA was up 6% overall but was somewhat of a mixed story across the various countries, with strength in some and caution in others, Latin America and APJ were both up a strong 20%.
Now taking a look at the gross margins. Obviously, we've shown significant improvements in gross margins over the last year or so. There are lots of puts and takes built into these results, so I thought it would make sense to take a few moments to discuss these factors with you so you'll have a better understanding of the dynamics.
From Q1 '11 through Q4 '11, gross margin improved by a very significant 440 basis points. Apart from volume, this improvement was driven by 4 factors: The first 2 of which were margin rate impacts while the second 2 were mixed effects. First was the RSA remediation cost we absorbed in Q1 '11. This resulted in what was effectively an adverse onetime impact of approximately 50 basis points to the Q1 '11 non-GAAP gross margin rate. Second was a step-function improvement to the margin rates of specific products and services which played out over the course of the year. The integration of Data Domain and Isilon into our supply chain was a big factor here. We also benefited from greater efficiencies in our services operations. Third was the benefit to mix of some low margin business declining through 2011. Our Consumer Products business deemphasized low-margin, resale focus hard drive systems in favor of more value-added NAS systems. In addition, we saw the decline in the Dell co-branded CLARiiON business throughout 2011. These 2 declining businesses reduced our lower margin revenues over the course of the year and have a resulting positive impact to gross margin improvements during 2011. Fourth was the improving mix of higher-margin businesses and products and we benefited from this over the course of 2011. This is an important ongoing aspect of our financial model and our faster growing businesses tend to be our higher-margin businesses.
When we will look at 2012 and how we expect gross margins to progress from Q1 to Q4 this year, the first 3 of these factors will not repeat. The fourth, however, is ongoing. We certainly do expect to see continual mix-related improvements to gross margins as our higher-margin faster growing business become a bigger proportion of the business. This is an important part of our strategy and a key element of our triple play, and of course, we'll continue to have the benefit from volumes as our business continues to grow.
To help you understand the relative contribution to these drivers, to improvements in gross margin we saw from Q1 '11 to Q4 '11, approximately half of the improvement's gross margins through 2011 resulted from the first 3 factors that will not be repeated in 2012. We expect the growth in volume to continue to benefit the gross margin line, but obviously, the improvement from strategic mix shift will be more gradual this year and moving forward. This dynamic is reflected in our outlook for 2012.
The improvement in gross margin in Q1 drove non-GAAP operating margin up 150 basis points as SG&A growth was in line with revenue growth and R&D higher, as we have projected it would be in January. Investments in our go-to-market and R&D are important to maintaining our triple play over the long-term. You'll see some of the results of these investments in the form of exciting product announcements we'll make throughout this year.
Other expense was $31 million non-GAAP. We've updated our full-year guidance for other expense reflects some gains from strategic investments in Q1. Our non-GAAP Q1 tax rate was 24%. We expect it to be 21% for the full year, assuming the U.S. R&D tax credit is passed in Q4. Non-GAAP EPS grew 19% over last year's first quarter to $0.37 per share. Share count was higher than expected due to the effect of the 39% increase in our share price in the quarter on our 2012 warrants that were settled in Q1 2012, and our on 2013 convertible and warrants. As a result, we've increased our full year share count projection by 45 million shares, the impact of which is about $0.04 for the full year 2012. We still expect 2012 non-GAAP EPS to be $1.70 due to the offsetting benefit from slightly higher operating margins than we predicted in January.
Our strong execution drove record Q1 free cache flow of $1.4 billion, $611 million higher than non-GAAP net income for the period. Contributing to this was continued strong growth in deferred revenue, up 10% sequentially to $6.8 billion. We ended Q1 with $10.9 billion in cash and investments after using $1.7 billion of cash to settle the first tranche of our convertible debt in January. Our U.S. cash, excluding VMware, was down from $4.8 billion to $4 billion as a result of this repayment. Our priorities for the use of cash has not changed. We still expect to buy $700 million of EMC shares in 2012 and continue to invest in the business. With the results we continue to achieve quarter after quarter, it is clear that our strategy is the right one, our execution is solid and we're on track to deliver our triple play. This gives us greater confidence in our ability to meet and potentially exceed our 2012 goals of $22 billion of revenue, non-GAAP EPS of $1.70 and free cash flow of $4.9 billion.
In summary, the business we have built is at the intersection of 3 strong secular trends, cloud, Big Data and trust, that will persist into the foreseeable future. With this fundamental shift in our favor and unparalleled combination of best-of-breed offerings, a wealth of experience and a proven track record, we think we are better positioned than any other company in IT.
With continued steady acquisition, we are well on our way to achieving the financial potential we laid out for you last year. Over $28 billion in revenue in 2014, which represents compound annual revenue growth of at least 13% from 2010 and non-GAAP EPS growth even faster than this.
With that, I'll hand over to Joe. Joe?"

Overall, I was very pleased with our execution and performance in Q1. I have always believed that starting at a new year with strength is incredibly important. The momentum and confidence it builds throughout EMC, our customers and our partners, is invaluable. I will talk about the economy in IT spending trends shortly, but we firmly believe that the 11% year-over-year growth rate we produced in Q1 was significantly greater than that of the IT market. And thus, we gained share. I would like to thank the more than 54,000 people of EMC and VMware for their passion to win and their dedication to our customer's success.
In Q1, we saw IT spending in our business unfold pretty much as we expected and predicted. Overall IT spending growth was fairly good in the Americas and APJ, as our 11% and 20% year-over-year respective increases demonstrated. In Europe, I believe that overall IT spending growth was, at best, flat. For sure, the 6% year-over-year growth we posted in Q1 was better than average. And finally, we saw our highest growth rates in the rapid growth economies. Across our BRIC, plus 13 countries, we grew over 25% in Q1 versus the same period last year.
Looking at Q1 year-over-year IT spending growth from a vertical industry point of view, we saw some softness in the banking sector. Average growth in retail, manufacturing, telco and information-technology verticals. Good growth in insurance, government, healthcare, education and media. And we saw rapid growth in and -- with service providers. Net-net, we continue to expect that global IT spending growth will be in the 3% to 4% range this year. And for sure, the IT markets for virtualization, cloud computing, information storage, information protection, information security and for information intelligence and analytics will grow faster than the IT average. And we at EMC and VMware will expect to grow faster than our total addressable market.
What underpins our belief in our ability to succeed in the future is our strategy and the focus we have in cloud computing, Big Data and trust. What makes our strategy work is blend of several key ingredients that we have built deeply into our DNA. First and foremost, EMC and VMware are product companies. And as such, our mission is to produce truly innovative and distinctive products which are complemented by world-class enabling and supportive services with a tightknit partner ecosystem by our side. Our recipe to produce these innovative products calls for us to invest over 11% of revenues into organic R&D and bet heavily on our brilliant engineering teams. And in addition, to acquire smaller, best-of-breed technology companies to enhance and extend our cloud to Big Data and trust strategy and reach. This one-two punch gives us a competitive product edge and we aim to continue this winning strategy of dual innovation engines.
That said, a great strategy is not sufficient alone. Equally as important, we at EMC and VMware have also built the following attributes into our DNA. We always exhibit an excellence in execution and an urgency in everything we do. We have built an accomplished executive leadership group that truly comes together as a team. We have a passion to win that permeates every level and every person in our company and most importantly, every fiber in our DNA assures we have maniacal focus on our customers. Collectively, this is our formula for success.
We have limited time together today, and I would like use a bit of it to drill down on EMC's storage business and share a bit of our view on this market and our strategy. First, let's start with the media itself. We can store a string of bytes, be it measured in megabytes, gigabytes or terabytes, in memory or on a single-level cell flash device or on a multilevel cell flash device or on a high-speed spinning drive or a net SATA or so-called FAT FAST drive. I've listed these forms of media from the most expensive, highest performance on top, and in order going down, to the least expensive, lowest performance media on the bottom. By the way, the price differential here, from top to bottom, is significantly more than 100:1. And there are substantial price differentials between each of these media layers. So where's the best place to store the aforementioned string of bytes? Well, the answer is, it depends. It depends on the performance requirements of the application, the business process, the activity level or how often the data is being accessed, the required retention periods for the data and I could go on and on with this. It depends. But net-net, we at EMC will use all these forms of media and on that will be more forms will in the future to provide our customers with unmatched fit and choice. With these media types, we will use our strength, breadth and depth and ability to create organic and nonorganic innovation and produce truly distinctive storage products. Products like VFCache that plugs directly into a server PCIe slot. Products like Project Thunder, our coming server Flash appliance, storage products that feature 100% Flash media, and of course, we will continue to lead the market with hybrid storage arrays that incorporate memory, Flash and spinning drive technology, as this category of storage will undoubtedly make up the vast majority for years to come.
Additionally, EMC will feature and support all connectivity options. Fiber Channel, FCOe, iscuzzy, NAS and direct-attached. And we will offer object, file and block access methods and scale up, scale out and geographically dispersed architectures. And across all of our storage offerings, we will fully integrate and feature advanced management and automation software like ProSphere; software like FAST, or fully automated storage tiering; software that the de-duplicates and compresses redundant data; and automation for active/active distributive work loads across data centers. In short, we will have the best fit, most complete family of best-of-breed storage solutions that truly meet and exceed the needs of our most demanding customers.
For sure, information storage is not, and I repeat, not a one-size-fits-all world. And all this product prowess is backed by our reputation for quality and service and fronted by the best storage sales organization in the industry, bar none.

So first of all, kudos to the drive supplies for responding rapidly to a very serious situation. And the quarter played out as expected. There were constraints, and there still are constraints, particularly in near-line drives. But we got the drives. During the quarter, we expected -- needed to make our numbers. Albeit, in the near-line space, they came in a little late in the quarter, end of February to early March. And of course, as we said on the last call, we had to do some balancing during the quarter to meet supply and demand. We do expect it to be constrained certainly throughout Q2. But again, we do have line of sight to the drives that we need. We think there'll be some incremental improvement in the second half but a certain class of drives will see constraint throughout the entire year. On the price increase side, as you know, we did put drive price increases up between 5% and 15% in early January. And whilst nobody likes a price increase, you can tell by our gross margins that we're able to capture the majority, if not all, of those price increases. And given the supply constraints, we don't expect there to be any significant reduction in prices in the near future. Maybe towards the end of the year when the whole situation becomes a little bit more normal. And then finally, in terms of orders, the good news is that although it took us a little longer this quarter to deliver some of the orders we took early in the quarter, we don't think we lost orders and we don't think that customers pushed out business because I think everybody's in the same boat when it comes to drive availability. And I think, if anything, we were better off the most."

Right now, when you look at what we ship inside arrays, the majority -- the vast major part is between fiber and the SATA FAST type drives. Flash, today, is a small single-digit percentage. But the adage goes, in hybrid array, a little Flash goes a long way. And what I mean by that is that you can improve the performance of an array dramatically by having maybe less than 5% of the capacity in Flash and using FAST software, moving those hot data sets into the high-performing media types. So we see a small increase and a steady increase going forward in the mix of Flash, but we still think that the vast majority of capacity shifts for many, many years is going be fiber and SATA. Within that, a mix more towards SATA and less towards fiber. But we think that's pretty much how things play out. And from a margin point of view, as Joe said, we're fairly agnostic to the media type. In fact, different media types are in fact good for us because we can offer more choices, more price points to our customers. And we're getting, very broadly, similar margins across those media types. So the mix shift in media is not going to have a material impact upon our gross margins."

That being said, the public cloud market will be the faster growing of the 2 because it's coming from a tiny base, if you will. But we do believe, totally, that the world is going to be hybrid. Certainly, as you heard on the VMware call last night, kind of the state of the art is that customers are now confident of -- that they are, in significant numbers, working on virtualizing and cloudizing, if you will, private cloudizing their Tier 1 apps. And that probably has the most return and benefits for our customers and that's where a lot of the action is. But certainly, on their lower tiers and test and dev, I think over time, you'll see customers -- basically, when they get to a peak workload or a peak time of the year, they'll be pushing out some applications like test and dev and other applications to a public cloud, and that'll avoid them having to buy for peak of the day, peak of the day, peak times and help reduce and contain their overall IT cost. Which they can then plow back into doing more application work and get business benefits. That's a trend you're going to see. So it's not an either/or, we're in a world of both. You also heard Paul say yesterday that the progress that we're making in vSphere adopted clouds, and of course, I just told you that the public cloud business is probably the fastest growing sector of all kind of verticals, if you will, that I spoke about. So both sides of the consolidated company are doing well with the cloud trend and phenomena. And we think we're going to continue to push the heck out of it.

We expected VMAX to be down this quarter for 2 reasons. One is the one that David highlighted and you mentioned. It is a tremendous quarter we had one year ago.

That was just -- so year-on-year growth last year was 25%. So it was a really strong quarter and that is absolutely a major factor and we knew that, and that's why we planned the way we planned. But you hit upon the second reason, which is a major reason too. Look, life cycles are important in any product. But I'll tell you point-blank, the higher-end product you have, right? The more important a life cycle is. And if you recall, we launched the VMAX in April of 2009. So it is pretty close to exactly 3 years old.

Between then, it'll be a $16.9 billion market in 2015. So there's a heck of an opportunity. Now if you look at the Big Data market, we're really playing in the highest end of that market. If you think of what a customer really needs to do to get any credible competitive advantage, they want to take their internal structure data, which there's a ton of; they want to take their internal unstructured data, which there's multiple times as much of; and then they want to go to the public markets and public sources and get the massive amount of data that's available there and blend these all together and really use this data in real-time predictive analysis to give their companies a competitive advantage. And that's the area that we're playing in and we don't even try to go and say displace a existing data warehouse. We're going after the new stuff which is more complex and that's what products like Chorus and our Hadoop distribution and support is all about as well as, of course, our Greenplum database. So we're playing, I think, at the highest end of the pyramid. So if the entire pyramid is growing at 39.4%, ours is growing faster than that and we're growing faster than that. So we're very excited about the opportunity here. And as I said, I've always been -- one of the things I preach, and my team is probably tired of me saying it, but I really believe big companies should not do small things. Big companies should only do small things that are going to become big things. And in our case and our size, we should not enter a market unless we think we can do $1 billion plus there. And this is the case where I think that $1 billion plus will be light, we can do more than that and we'll do more than that. So I'm very pleased with our progress and that's kind of how we think about this opportunity."

So Q1, clearly a lot of early interest from many, many customers across many, many industries. So we're quite excited about that. We're also starting to see the broadening of the product family as we go through the year. Clearly, a Thunder-like appliance is an easier product for an EMC sales force, right? And many of our customers don't want to be interrupting  blade environments and others that occur. So we're actually seeing that there's a lot of interest for a Thunder appliance in many use cases, and as such, quite excited about this potential. We're just beginning, as we've indicated in Q2, we'll have the first early customer betas beginning for the Thunder appliance. With regard to last piece of the question, we are clearly seeing that this is a hot segment of the industry. We have organic activities, we have many engagements with other industry players. We're not going to make any indications toward broader, nonorganic plays. But we do see that this is great opportunity for us. And we've clearly accelerated our internal activities, both from the VFCache Thunder, our use of MLC cache as well as SLC Flash, as well as the hybrid array opportunities which, as Joe indicated in his remarks, is clearly -- the large majority of the industry will be hybrid arrays for the long-term."

Because it's very tough to stay still in a competitive global economy like this. So there are investment opportunities and I do think that, at best, the IT spending will be flat. But if not, I don't believe IT spending will be down anything dramatically. I would say, less than 1% down to flat is where -- if I had to call it or place a bet is where I'd bet.

So I do expect they'll be sequential margin improvement from where we are. Also, bear in mind that we've been pretty consistent upon our guidance for OpEx during the year. We said that we expect our SG&A growth to be in line, broadly, with revenue growth and we expect R&D growth to grow faster. So we do expect OpEx to continue to increase as a percentage of revenue, this year, as we move through the year. So you put all those together and you can trend to a number that's pretty consistent with what we've implied in our guidance, and those are really the moving parts."

I'm very pleased to report that EMC had a strong start to 2012. As you know, there's a major transformation happening in IT today, and the challenge for all of us is to make sure we correctly align our businesses to best take advantage of the opportunity the change provides. EMC's ability to correctly identify and invest in these changes has been a major reason for our success and enabled us to grow revenue 11% year-over-year this quarter with non-GAAP EPS up 19% and free cash flow up 67%. We are in a truly unprecedented time of transformation. IT is transforming with the shift to cloud computing. Businesses are transforming as they better leverage Big Data to deliver greater insight and uncover new opportunities. And the new threat environments is transforming the way customers think about trust.
We at EMC are transforming our portfolio and operations to best take advantage of these major shifts. We believe that we have positioned EMC well, and our solid results are ongoing proof that we're executing on our strategy to address the major trends in cloud, Big Data and trust. Based on our strong start to the year and how we feel about our opportunity, we are now more confident about what we can achieve in 2012.
Looking across our businesses, it's clear that EMC is very well equipped to help customers navigate the waves of change they are facing today. As a foundation for customers cloud and Big Data initiatives, information storage continues to thrive. With varied use cases and data types, EMC's broad and deep portfolio continues to prove to be best-of-breed. As a case in point, information storage continues the trend on solid growth with revenues up 7% in Q1. High-end storage product revenue was down 10% year-on-year versus a very strong Q1 last year. As you may recall, we had an unusually strong first quarter in 2011 due to the introduction of FAST VP in conjunction with VMAX. In that quarter, high-end product was up 25% year-on-year and a very strong and unusual 12% sequentially. Whilst the significant variance in these year-on-year growth rates had a meaningful impact on the year-on-year growth and inflation storage revenue, we're comfortable with how our storage business is trending.
After 2 years of above trend line growth, we expect the high-end storage market to return to the long-term single-digit growth profile we projected for the segment. Customers at the high-end seek the very best in performance, scalability and reliability, and VMAX is the best position to meet these needs as it offers unmatched combination of innovative features.
Fully automated storage tiering or FAST software, along with Flash, fiber and SATA drives allows customers to consolidate different tiers of data onto a single array and reduce their data center footprint. While the scale-out architecture of VMAX, coupled with Flash, improves transactional performance dramatically while accommodating explosive data growth. And we continuously improve our Symmetrix product line as technology and customer needs evolve. We recently became the first enterprise storage vendor to achieve validation of 140 encryption for all drive types including Flash with our Symmetrix data arrest encryption module. This module, which protects the information from unauthorized access at the individual drive level, can be integrated with RSA key management.
The unmatched combination of leading-edge capabilities at the high-end is why Amaron, a power company with 3.4 million electric and gas customers, selected VMAX for their mission-critical Oracle database and custom application environments. With 100 terabytes of data being added to its infrastructure each year, Amaron was struggling to keep up with its data growth and increasing IT management costs while advancing their VMware virtualization and cloud computing strategy. With VMAX using FAST and a combination of Flash fiber channel and SATA drives, they were able to reduce their annual capital expenses by 50%, increase transactional performance by 30% and achieve power and cooling savings of 28%.
In its second full quarter of availability, VMAXe revenue continues to ramp as it meets the requirements between a low-end VMAX and a high-end VNX and extends the reach of the VMAX family to new customers, usages and price points. Such was the case with a fast-growing community college system in Texas. By consolidating its infrastructure onto a VMAXe, the school system dramatically improved its ability to provide students with the latest educational technology and tools, respond more quickly to the needs of local employers and increase the overall efficiency and reliability of their operational systems. The VMAXe was part of a larger win with a customer who also implemented EMC Avamar, Networker, RecoverPoint, vSphere and Vcenter Site Recovery Manager for their 97% virtualized infrastructure.
VPLEX continues to be an integral part of our portfolio, as a unique product that dissolves distance and enables data centers to be truly active/active for the first time. This was illustrated by a draw and a larger win in Q1, this one is healthcare. This transaction include a number of complementary EMC products including VMAX within a vBlock, Data Domain and Avamar. To complete its life-critical continuous computing platform, the hospital needed active/active data center configuration that VPLEX Metro made possible. VPLEX's ability to move vSphere applications between data centers several towns apart without interruption will enable them to fully leverage their virtualized infrastructure and lower the total cost of ownership.
Our mid-tier products continue to perform very well, with product revenue growth up 26% year-on-year. And by the way, this is 100% organic growth. So no growth bump from acquisitions. Our portfolio of mid-tier storage capabilities is a great match with customers expanding requirements in this area. 
Our VNX Family, which we introduced in Q1 of last year, is living up to our high expectations. Customers and partners alike like its functionality, simplicity, efficiency and lower cost of ownership. With its unified architecture, unparalleled VMware integration, incorporation of Flash for both cache and storage and ability to automatically tier data with FAST, the VNX continues to win us a bigger footprint with customers. And the VNXe, which offers affordable simplicity and efficiency to smaller customers and remote offices, has firmly established EMC as a player in the low-end of the market.
Since it's introduction, the VNX Family has brought just under 6,000 brand new customers to EMC, many of whom have been acquired via the more than 2,000 new channel partners who started selling EMC over the same period of time. Together, the VNX and VNXe allow us to meet a broad set of need to customers, seeking the flexibility of unified storage. One such customer was a global aluminum company that is consolidating its IT infrastructure worldwide to 3 primary data centers plus a DR site and approximately 30 remote offices. The primary data centers will use VNXs with VMware to consolidate applications and significantly reduce costs. While the 30 remote offices will use VNXe 3100 arrays for primary storage. This example illustrates how valuable it is to have a broad array of products in today's rapidly changing IT environments. This same customer, by the way, also purchased our full suite of backup products to address the various backup needs across their next-gen infrastructure.
Isilon continues to flourish, with total revenue almost doubling from Q1 year ago. Isilon technology plays an important role among our mid-tier products as it meets customer's cloud and Big Data requirements across industries and use cases. Our scale at NAS architecture is exceptionally well suited for extremely large-scale Big Data needs. And in Q1, we completed what we believe was the largest capacity single-order in the history of storage, 28 petabytes with a web company. To put this into perspective, this amount of storage could hold 6 million movies. And while 28 petabytes is impressive, you need 37 million petabytes to accommodate the genetic sequence of the entire population of the United States. As you can see, we have a lot more room to grow in some of these emerging Big Data areas.
Isilon is being used in more traditional enterprise implementations as well. File-based data, that might be managed -- or 10 years ago, has been growing unchecked, reaching petabyte scale in some cases. And this is where Isilon scale architecture is ideal. A case in point was the choice of Isilon by a large multi-national insurance company recently. EMC has been part of its data center for some time and used the value proposition of Isilon to consolidate their file environment in Q1.
As our sales force and partners have become much better at identifying the best opportunities for Isilon, we expect to see Isilon increasingly penetrating our existing customer base. Putting the EMC name, reputation, sales force and service levels behind great new technology is a powerful combination. The result is what we call that EMC effect.
We have seen the EMC effect at work for the past couple of years in our backup recovery systems business, which continues to thrive. Our market-leading backup products, which include the powerful combination of Avamar and Data Domain also lead the way into new accounts and have brought hundreds of new logos to EMC over the past several quarters. One of these in Q1 was a large financial services organization that was running out of data center floor space and running into power and cooling challenges with its large tape silos. By demonstrating that Data Domain's next gen backup architecture provides efficiency, reliability and business value, it was impossible with their tape based systems. Our BRS team was able to establish brand-new footprint in all 3 of the organizations data centers.
We continue to broaden our storage portfolio in Q1 with the very exciting addition of VFCache, which extends our lead in Enterprise Flash. In 2008, we were the first to bring Flash technology to enterprise storage and its value proposition to customers is clear as evidenced by the growing demand it has enjoyed ever since. We are leveraging our expertise in Enterprise Flash with VFCache, which extends the benefit of Flash into the server for dramatic performance improvements. What distinguishes VFCache is its ability to deliver extremely fast response times whilst preserving all the back end capabilities around data protection, reliability, scalability and manageability. This is a value proposition with broad appeal, as illustrated by our early customer wins including a bank in China, a financial services company in Boston, a retailer in the Middle East, a government in Asia, and a research lab in U.K., a hospital in New England and a U.S.-based telecommunications company to name but a few. Their feedback so far is very positive as they're seeing how fast some of their mission-critical applications, like Oracle and SQL, are able to run. We're also excited to be in discussions with several new generation web application companies, and you'll see us continue to enhance VFCache later this year.
Later this quarter, at EMC World, you'll hear more about our next step with Flash, codenamed Project Thunder. Optimized for high-frequency, low-latency, rewrite work loads, Thunder will build upon the advanced PCIe technology delivered in VFCache to leverage the power of Flash through a dedicated server-networked flash-based appliance.
Building Flash into many places in the IT infrastructure, while fully leveraging it with intelligent automated software that operates across this stack, is the real secret sauce to delivering value. What the customer cares about is having the right data at the right time in the right place at the right cost. And making this happen involves servers leveraging Flash at one end of the spectrum, the high-capacity SATA drives and storage arrays at the other. We have the end-to-end expertise with Enterprise Flash and data storage unmatched in the industry, and we'll continue to build on our opposition as the innovative leaders in Enterprise Flash.
When we look back at the storage products we've just discussed, VMAX, VPLEX, VNX, Isilon, Data Domain, Avamar, VFCache, you can see this is a very different portfolio than what we had just 3 years ago. One that's been purposely assembled to address new requirements brought about by the rapidly changing IT environments. Our recent win at a global humanitarian organization is an excellent example of the power of EMC's portfolio in this new world. Rotary International implemented VNXe, Isilon, Avamar and vSphere to better manage its growing digital assets, deploy a Vblock for its mission critical applications and primary storage and leverages VNXe at a second facility to replicate data. Rotary was able to build a solid foundation for its virtualization environment on EMC's suite of complementary products which have been optimized for these environments. The result is simplified management, strengthened data protection, predictable performance and improved efficiency. This is our strategy at work.
Increasingly, businesses are being transformed by their ability to unlock the value of data stored within their organization and in the outside world. We identified this trend early and began making investments to capture the opportunity Big Data presents, starting with the acquisition of Greenplum in 2010. Greenplum has since made great strides in the space with several achievements in Q1 alone, including the industry's first and only enterprise-proven Hadoop solution on the scale out NAS architecture with Isilon, enabling end-to-end data protection for Hadoop Big Data. The designation, as a leader, enterprise Hadoop solution by Forrester research as the first to integrate its Hadoop ETW and data integration in a single rack. The launch of the industry's first social tool kit for Big Data, Greenplum Chorus, enabling data science teams to collaborate on data sets. The acquisition of Pivotal Labs to accelerate the development of Big Data applications in the enterprise, not to mention continue very strong year-on-year growth in revenue.
Greenplum is increasingly benefiting from the EMC effects. While it's early days, and the Big Data trend has quite a way to go before it reaches full potential, customers see the transformation in analytics and want to build the best technology stack with the right partners as they start on their journey to leverage Big Data. As a result, we're now seeing multimillion dollar transactions as more and more enterprises select Greenplum technology as the foundation for their next gen analytics architectures. In Q1, these wins included a large financial services company in New York, a leading supplier of industrial automation solutions in India and a multinational telecommunications company in Europe.
Taking a step back, it is clear that we've anticipated how customers needs would change in this space, and we've transformed our portfolio of storage offerings to address those needs. As a result, we now have a broad portfolio of best-of-breed products, which enable customers to pick the right tool for the job they have. The offerings we have far exceed the capabilities of both the more narrowly focused storage vendors and the less focused server companies. EMC is truly unique in the storage infrastructure market. Our diverse and best-of-breed portfolio enable us to serve virtually any information storage need in just about any customer in any industry. The results has been strong and steady growth of our storage infrastructure business driven by the strong secular trends of cloud and Big Data.
The successful transition to a model that leverages cloud and Big Data is dependent upon both the right infrastructure and also building trust into that infrastructure. Having a holistic and data center approach to security dangers, such as advanced persistent threats, is key to building trust and RSA has been at the forefront of this security trend. RSA's focus and execution are paying off as the business grew a strong 19% over last year's Q1.
Attendance at this year's RSA security conference, the marquee conference in the industry, grew to a record 21,000 people, underscoring the growing importance of information security in today's digital world. RSA solutions are built for the modern threat environment, and customers are responding, as revenue from both our identity management and protection and our security management and compliance offerings both showed good growth over last year's Q1. RSA continues to earn accolades as our NetWitness technology received gold level honors in Security Products Magazine's Government Security Awards, was named Best Computer Forensic Tool in Secure Computing Magazine 2012 Reader's Trust and was named Best Security Solution in Government Technology Research Alliance GOVTek Awards program. NetWitness, in conjunction with Archer, enVision and DLP, worked together to provide controls and visibility features that are based on agile, predictive analysis and continuous monitoring of mass amounts of data. We'll continue to build on our data-centric approach to security to enable our customers, in turn, to take full advantage of benefits afforded by cloud and Big Data.
Revenue from our Information Intelligence Group was down 4% year-on-year. In Q1, IIG released documents and mobile app for the iPhone, expanding users ability to access, share and collaborate on their preferred device and enable them to act upon information faster than ever before. IIG continues to win new customers as it did with the largest public banking organization in Turkey. With an aggressive strategy to grow its service network of more than 22,000 employees and 1,400 branch offices, Ziraat Bank chose EMC Documentum. As a result, the bank can now manage internal correspondence and regulation processes to ensure global compliance and operational efficiency, automate application processing to accelerate transactions and increase productivity across various internal departments.  We are pleased with the operational and strategic progress our new leadership team is making at IIG. 
VMware continues to perform very well as we execute on our strategy to be the standard for virtualization in enterprise data centers, enabling businesses to thrive in the cloud era. VMware revenue was up 25% year-on-year as customers continue to look to VMware's proven technology for virtualizing their mission-critical applications, and increasingly, rely upon VMware's management and automation tools to manage their rapidly expanding virtual environments.
We continue to enhance EMC's product integration with VMware in ways that solve real-world problems and in areas that are clearly making a difference, including VPLEX for active/active data centers, ProSphere for integrated management and the inclusion of VMware as the founding partner in the VSPEX reference architecture program.
Site integration with VMware is important as customers expand their virtual environments and were the key reason for several wins in Q1 alone, including a U.S.-based manufacturer, a hospital in Shanghai, a stock exchange in Asia and a mining company in Latin America. Expect to hear more about EMC and VMware working together at EMC World. EMC's initiatives to transform and expand our go-to-market model continue to pay dividends. Over the past couple of years, we've augmented our already formidable sales efforts with additional targeted service capabilities, expanded alliance partnerships, a vastly expanded resale channel and the unique joint venture in VCE. All these initiatives broaden our reach, with the result being better scale and more leverage. EMC Services business continues to thrive, as customers seek guidance on the transformation of their own IT architectures. In addition to our existing design and implementation services for cloud infrastructures, in Q1, we added offerings specific to the delivery of IT-as-a-service. These new services which are aligned around cloud infrastructure, cloud optimized applications and end-user computing, helped clients accelerate the adoption, optimization and consumption of cloud technologies.
Our alliance partnerships, with service providers continue to expand, and these partners are steadily increasing their capabilities. With well over 100 public cloud services now being offered by service provider partners based upon underlying EMC technology, our entire product portfolio stands to benefit.
The transformative changes we've made to our channel program in 2011 continues to be successful. Channel revenue from our S75 program which is primarily VNXe, continues to ramp steadily. As unified storage revenue throughout our top 5 partners increased 45% year-on-year in Q1.
We continue to make improvements to further develop our relationships with our partners and help ensure their success. The VSPEX reference architectures we announced last week help our partners accelerate their customers transition to cloud with solutions that make the move to the cloud faster and less complex. EMC has proven several architectures for partners to package into it's storable VSPEX solutions, which are available only EMC partners. VSPEX enables customers to select the technologies that best fit their existing IT environments from a broad selection of leading vendors.
For customers and partners who want to make their implementation even easier, vBlocks continues to be the answer, and demand for vBlocks in the quarter more than doubled from Q1 a year ago. As a single converged product, with components from EMC, Cisco and VMware with a single pane of glass and managements, a clear upgrade path and one point of contact for customer support, vBlocks are a compelling option for customers looking to accelerate their journey to the cloud.
We're seeing significant interest in vBlocks on a global basis. Not only are many new customers starting to test out these converged products, but we see early adopters coming back to purchase multiple vBlocks to run their production applications. In fact, a growing percentage of VCE business is coming from customers who are beginning to adopt multiple vBlocks for their production environments after liking what they saw in their initial purchase. A prime example of this was a Fortune 50 customer who had an initial transaction in Q3 of last year, followed by a multimillion dollar deal in Q4, followed by a $25 million order in Q1. This deal is representative of the penetration we're seeing in competitive stronghold accounts.
It is important to understand the difference between vBlocks and our newly announced VSPEX offerings as both are important to our strategy to help customers to get the cloud to most suitable way for them. For customers wanting pretested converged product, there are vBlocks, which have been available for 2 years. For customers wanting a tested and proven reference architecture with different options for network, server and hypervisor, now as VSPEX. For customers wanting to assemble solutions themselves, we have our broad portfolio of information infrastructure and virtualization products they can choose from. So in short, we offer the full continuum of options for customers to get to cloud in whatever way is best suited to them, whether it's the prebaked cake, a set of tested recipes to make the cake or just the ingredients.
For some time now, our vision has been to become the undisputed leader in hybrid cloud computing, and as our results attest, we're making this happen. We've developed a strategy to help customers have the right data in the right place at the right time, where it's secure every step of the way, and where they can make the best use of cloud technology and Big Data assets in a trust environment. Our products and services portfolio and go-to-market model are evolving as we continue our own transition to help customers improve business agility, lower cost and enhance their competitive edge. This unwavering focus and steady execution supported by the strong secular trends of cloud, Big Data and trust are what have enabled us to deliver consistently solid financial results.
Consolidated revenues were up a solid 11% year-on-year. Within this, North America was up 11%, EMEA was up 6% overall but was somewhat of a mixed story across the various countries, with strength in some and caution in others, Latin America and APJ were both up a strong 20%.
Now taking a look at the gross margins. Obviously, we've shown significant improvements in gross margins over the last year or so. There are lots of puts and takes built into these results, so I thought it would make sense to take a few moments to discuss these factors with you so you'll have a better understanding of the dynamics.
From Q1 '11 through Q4 '11, gross margin improved by a very significant 440 basis points. Apart from volume, this improvement was driven by 4 factors: The first 2 of which were margin rate impacts while the second 2 were mix effects. First was the RSA remediation cost we absorbed in Q1 '11. This resulted in what was effectively an adverse onetime impact of approximately 50 basis points to the Q1 '11 non-GAAP gross margin rate. Second was a step-function improvement to the margin rates of specific products and services which played out over the course of the year. The integration of Data Domain and Isilon into our supply chain was a big factor here. We also benefited from greater efficiencies in our services operations. Third was the benefit to mix of some low margin businesses declining through 2011. Our Consumer Products business deemphasized low-margin, resale focus hard drive systems in favor of more value-added NAS systems. In addition, we saw the decline in the Dell co-branded CLARiiON business throughout 2011. These 2 declining businesses reduced our lower margin revenues over the course of the year and have a resulting positive impact to gross margin improvements during 2011. Fourth was the improving mix of higher-margin businesses and products and we benefited from this over the course of 2011. This is an important ongoing aspect of our financial model as our faster growing businesses tend to be our higher-margin businesses.
When we will look at 2012 and how we expect gross margins to progress from Q1 to Q4 this year, the first 3 of these factors will not repeat. The fourth, however, is ongoing. We certainly do expect to see continual mix-related improvements to gross margins as our higher-margin, faster growing businesses become a bigger proportion of the business. This is an important part of our strategy and a key element of our triple play, and of course, we'll continue to have the benefit from volumes as our business continues to grow.
To help you understand the relative contribution to these drivers, to improvements in gross margin we saw from Q1 '11 to Q4 '11, approximately 1/2 of the improvement's gross margins through 2011 resulted from the first 3 factors that will not be repeated in 2012. We expect the growth in volume to continue to benefit the gross margin line, but obviously, the improvement from strategic mix shift will be more gradual this year and moving forward. This dynamic is reflected in our outlook for 2012.
The improvement in gross margin in Q1 drove non-GAAP operating margin up 150 basis points as SG&A growth was in line with revenue growth and R&D higher, as we have projected it would be in January. Investments in our go-to-market and R&D are important to maintaining our triple play over the long-term. You'll see some of the results of these investments in the form of exciting product announcements we'll make throughout this year.
Other expense was $31 million non-GAAP. We've updated our full-year guidance for Other expense reflects some gains from strategic investments in Q1. Our non-GAAP Q1 tax rate was 24%. We expect it to be 21% for the full year, assuming the U.S. R&D tax credit is passed in Q4. Non-GAAP EPS grew 19% over last year's first quarter to $0.37 per share. Share count was higher than expected due to the effect of the 39% increase in our share price in the quarter on our 2012 warrants that were settled in Q1 2012, and our on 2013 convertible and warrants. As a result, we've increased our full year share count projection by 45 million shares, the impact of which is about $0.04 for the full year 2012. We still expect 2012 non-GAAP EPS to be $1.70 due to the offsetting benefit from slightly higher operating margins than we predicted in January.
Our strong execution drove record Q1 free cache flow of $1.4 billion, $611 million higher than non-GAAP net income for the period. Contributing to this was continued strong growth in deferred revenue, up 10% sequentially to $6.8 billion. We ended Q1 with $10.9 billion in cash and investments after using $1.7 billion of cash to settle the first tranche of our convertible debt in January. Our U.S. cash, excluding VMware, was down from $4.8 billion to $4 billion as a result of this repayment. Our priorities for the use of cash has not changed. We still expect to buy $700 million of EMC shares in 2012 and continue to invest in the business. With the results we continue to achieve quarter after quarter, it is clear that our strategy is the right one, our execution is solid and we're on track to deliver our triple play. This gives us greater confidence in our ability to meet and potentially exceed our 2012 goals of $22 billion of revenue, non-GAAP EPS of $1.70 and free cash flow of $4.9 billion.
In summary, the business we have built is at the intersection of 3 strong secular trends, cloud, Big Data and trust, that will persist into the foreseeable future. With this fundamental shift in our favor and unparalleled combination of best-of-breed offerings, a wealth of experience and a proven track record, we think we are better positioned than any other company in IT.
With continued steady acquisition, we are well on our way to achieving the financial potential we laid out for you last year. Over $28 billion in revenue in 2014, which represents compound annual revenue growth of at least 13% from 2010 and non-GAAP EPS growth even faster than this.
With that, I'll hand over to Joe. Joe?"

We appreciate your interest in EMC. Overall, I was very pleased with our execution and performance in Q1.

Overall, I was very pleased with our execution and performance in Q1. I have always believed that starting at a new year with strength is incredibly important. The momentum and confidence it builds throughout EMC, our customers and our partners, is invaluable. I will talk about the economy and IT spending trends shortly, but we firmly believe that the 11% year-over-year growth rate we produced in Q1 was significantly greater than that of the IT market. And thus, we gained share. I would like to thank the more than 54,000 people of EMC and VMware for their passion to win and their dedication to our customer's success.
In Q1, we saw IT spending in our business unfold pretty much as we expected and predicted. Overall IT spending growth was fairly good in the Americas and APJ, as our 11% and 20% year-over-year respective increases demonstrated. In Europe, I believe that overall IT spending growth was, at best, flat. For sure, the 6% year-over-year growth we posted in Q1 was better than average. And finally, we saw our highest growth rates in the rapid growth economies. Across our BRIC, plus 13 countries, we grew over 25% in Q1 versus the same period last year.
Looking at Q1 year-over-year IT spending growth from a vertical industry point of view, we saw some softness in the banking sector. Average growth in retail, manufacturing, telco and information-technology verticals. Good growth in insurance, government, healthcare, education and media. And we saw rapid growth in and -- with service providers. Net-net, we continue to expect that global IT spending growth will be in the 3% to 4% range this year. And for sure, the IT markets for virtualization, cloud computing, information storage, information protection, information security and for information intelligence and analytics will grow faster than the IT average. And we at EMC and VMware will expect to grow faster than our total addressable market.
What underpins our belief in our ability to succeed in the future is our strategy and the focus we have in cloud computing, Big Data and trust. What makes our strategy work is blend of several key ingredients that we have built deeply into our DNA. First and foremost, EMC and VMware are product companies. And as such, our mission is to produce truly innovative and distinctive products which are complemented by world-class enabling and supportive services with a tightknit partner ecosystem by our side. Our recipe to produce these innovative products calls for us to invest over 11% of revenues into organic R&D and bet heavily on our brilliant engineering teams. And in addition, to acquire smaller, best-of-breed technology companies to enhance and extend our cloud, Big Data and trust strategy and reach. This one-two punch gives us a competitive product edge and we aim to continue this winning strategy of dual innovation engines.
That said, a great strategy is not sufficient alone. Equally as important, we at EMC and VMware have also built the following attributes into our DNA. We always exhibit an excellence in execution and an urgency in everything we do. We have built an accomplished executive leadership group that truly comes together as a team. We have a passion to win that permeates every level and every person in our company and most importantly, every fiber in our DNA assures we have maniacal focus on our customers. Collectively, this is our formula for success.
We have limited time together today, and I would like use a bit of it to drill down on EMC's storage business and share a bit of our view on this market and our strategy. First, let's start with the media itself. We can store a string of bytes, be it measured in megabytes, gigabytes or terabytes, in memory or on a single-level cell flash device or on a multilevel cell flash device or on a high-speed spinning drive or on a SATA or so-called FAT FAST drive. I've listed these forms of media from the most expensive, highest performance on top, and in order going down, to the least expensive, lowest performance media on the bottom. By the way, the price differential here, from top to bottom, is significantly more than 100:1. And there are substantial price differentials between each of these media layers. So where's the best place to store the aforementioned string of bytes? Well the answer is, it depends. It depends on the performance requirements of the application, the business process, the activity level or how often the data is being accessed, the required retention periods for the data and I could go on and on with this. It depends. But net-net, we at EMC will use all these forms of media and undoubtedly more forms will come in the future to provide our customers with unmatched fit and choice. With these media types, we will use our strength, breadth and depth and ability to create organic and nonorganic innovation and produce truly distinctive storage products. Products like VFCache that plugs directly into a server PCIe slot. Products like Project Thunder, our coming server Flash appliance, storage products that feature 100% Flash media, and of course, we will continue to lead the market with hybrid storage arrays that incorporate memory, Flash and spinning drive technology, as this category of storage will undoubtedly make up the vast majority for years to come.
Additionally, EMC will feature and support all connectivity options. Fiber Channel, FCOe, iscuzzy, NAS and direct-attached. And we will offer object, file and block access methods and scale up, scale out in geographically dispersed architectures. And across all of our storage offerings, we will fully integrate and feature advanced management and automation software like ProSphere; software like FAST, or fully automated storage tiering; software that de-duplicates and compresses redundant data; and automation for active/active distributive work loads across data centers. In short, we will have the best fit, most complete family of best-of-breed storage solutions that truly meet and exceed the needs of our most demanding customers.
For sure, information storage is not, and I repeat, not a one-size-fits-all world. And all this product prowess is backed by our reputation for quality and service and fronted by the best storage sales organization in the industry, bar none.

So first of all, kudos to the drive suppliers for responding rapidly to a very serious situation. And the quarter played out as expected. There were constraints, and there still are constraints, particularly in near-line drives. But we got the drives. During the quarter, we expected -- needed to make our numbers. Albeit, in the near-line space, they came in a little late in the quarter, end of February to early March. And of course, as we said on the last call, we had to do some balancing during the quarter to meet supply and demand. We do expect it to be constrained certainly throughout Q2. But again, we do have line of sight to the drives that we need. We think there'll be some incremental improvement in the second half but a certain class of drives will see constraint throughout the entire year. On the price increase side, as you know, we did put drive price increases up between 5% and 15% in early January. And whilst nobody likes a price increase, you can tell by our gross margins that we're able to capture the majority, if not all, of those price increases. And given the supply constraints, we don't expect there to be any significant reduction in prices in the near future. Maybe towards the end of the year when the whole situation becomes a little bit more normal. And then finally, in terms of orders, the good news is that although it took us a little longer this quarter to deliver some of the orders we took early in the quarter, we don't think we lost orders and we don't think that customers pushed out business because I think everybody's in the same boat when it comes to drive availability. And I think, if anything, we were better off the most."

Right now, when you look at what we ship inside arrays, the majority -- the vast major part is between fiber and the SATA FAST type drives. Flash, today, is a small single-digit percentage. But the adage goes, in hybrid array, a little Flash goes a long way. And what I mean by that is that you can improve the performance of an array dramatically by having maybe less than 5% of the capacity in Flash and using FAST software, moving those hot data sets into the high-performing media types. So we see a small increase and a steady increase going forward in the mix of Flash, but we still think that the vast majority of capacity shipped for many, many years is going be fiber and SATA. Within that, a mix more towards SATA and less towards fiber. But we think that's pretty much how things play out. And from a margin point of view, as Joe said, we're fairly agnostic to the media type. In fact, different media types are in fact good for us because we can offer more choices, more price points to our customers. And we're getting, very broadly, similar margins across those media types. So the mix shift in media is not going to have a material impact upon our gross margins."

Certainly, as you heard on the VMware call last night, kind of the state of the art is that customers are now confident enough that they are, in significant numbers, working on virtualizing and cloudizing, if you will, private cloudizing their Tier 1 apps. And that probably has the most return and benefits for our customers and that's where a lot of the action is. But certainly, on their lower tiers and test and dev, I think over time, you'll see customers -- basically, when they get to a peak workload or a peak time of the year, they'll be pushing out some applications like test and dev and other applications to a public cloud, and that'll avoid them having to buy for peak of the day, peak of the day, peak times and help reduce and contain their overall IT cost. Which they can then plow back into doing more application work and get business benefits. That's a trend you're going to see. So it's not an either/or, we're in a world of both. You also heard Paul say yesterday that the progress that we're making in vSphere adopted clouds, and of course, I just told you that the public cloud business is probably the fastest growing sector of all kind of verticals, if you will, that I spoke about. So both sides of the consolidated company are doing well with the cloud trend and phenomena. And we think we're going to continue to push the heck out of it. But it's a world of both, it's and, not or."

Also, I mentioned that VCE has been a significant new customer door opener for us, in those case, in some of the very largest enterprises.

And a great thing is that we have really kind of hyped up our channel programs and are a full -- I believe 2/3 of those orders were heavily touched by our channel partners.

We expected VMAX to be down this quarter for 2 reasons. One is the one that David highlighted and you mentioned. It is a tremendous quarter we had one year ago. I mean, it's highly unusual that you would grow from a Q4 to a Q1, with Symmetrix, 12%. Highly unusual that you would actually decline from Q1 to Q2, 8%. Which is exactly what happened last year. That was just -- so year-on-year growth last year was 25%. So it was a really strong quarter and that is absolutely a major factor and we knew that, and that's why we planned the way we planned. But you hit upon the second reason, which is a major reason too. Look, life cycles are important in any product. But I'll tell you point-blank, the higher-end product you have, right? The more important a life cycle is. And if you recall, we launched the VMAX in April of 2009. So it is pretty close to exactly 3 years old. And clearly, our customers are expecting and wanting a new, even higher-end model and product. And all I'm going to say is we don't want to get ahead of ourselves and ruin the announcement, but I'm probably am going to do that anyhow. I'll tell you point-blank, the customers are expecting that will not be disappointed, and it's coming soon."

Rather than give our view, let me quote IDC, they just came out with a Big Data white paper and analysis for hardware, software and services and they did it from 2010 to 2015. I don't know if you saw it. But in 2010, they thought the Big Data market was $3.2 billion and they think it'll grow almost 40%, 39.4%, if memory serves me right, it was the actual CAGR they had in there. Between then, it'll be a $16.9 billion market in 2015. So there's a heck of an opportunity. Now if you look at the Big Data market, we're really playing in the highest end of that market. If you think of what a customer really needs to do to get an incredible competitive advantage, they want to take their internal structure data, which there's a ton of; they want to take their internal unstructured data, which there's multiple times as much of; and then they want to go to the public markets and public sources and get the massive amount of data that's available there and blend these all together and really use this data in real-time predictive analysis to give their companies a competitive advantage. And that's the area that we're playing in and we don't even try to go and say displace a existing data warehouse. We're going after the new stuff which is more complex and that's what products like Chorus and our Hadoop distribution and support is all about as well as, of course, our Greenplum database. So we're playing, I think, at the highest end of the pyramid. So if the entire pyramid is growing at 39.4%, ours is growing faster than that and we're growing faster than that. So we're very excited about the opportunity here. And as I said, I've always been -- one of the things I preach, and my team is probably tired of me saying it, but I really believe big companies should not do small things. Big companies should only do small things that are going to become big things. And in our case and our size, we should not enter a market unless we think we can do $1 billion plus there. And this is the case where I think that $1 billion plus will be light, we can do more than that and we'll do more than that. So I'm very pleased with our progress and that's kind of how we think about this opportunity."

So Q1, clearly a lot of early interest from many, many customers across many, many industries. So we're quite excited about that. We're also starting to see the broadening of the product family as we go through the year. Clearly, a Thunder-like appliance is an easier product for an EMC sales force, right? And many of our customers don't want to be disrupting blade environments and others that occur. So we're actually seeing that there's a lot of interest for a Thunder appliance in many use cases, and as such, quite excited about this potential. We're just beginning, as we've indicated in Q2, we'll have the first early customer betas beginning for the Thunder appliance. With regard to last piece of the question, we are clearly seeing that this is a hot segment of the industry. We have organic activities, we have many engagements with other industry players. We're not going to make any indications toward broader, nonorganic plays. But we do see that this is great opportunity for us.

I know this conversation always come up in the business with CIOs and CEOs and COOs that I meet over there, government officials. But the private companies over there are still -- got their head down and they're moving forward and they have plans and they understand that it if they stay still, they'll go backwards. Because it's very tough to stay still in a competitive global economy like this. So there are investment opportunities and I do think that, at best, the IT spending will be flat. But if not, I don't believe IT spending will be down anything dramatically. I would say, less than 1% down to flat is where -- if I had to call it or place a bet is where I'd bet. So obviously, there's a lot of caution, everybody is looking over their shoulder. But there's also, in the business community, a lot of confidence in themselves.

So I do expect they'll be sequential margin improvement from where we are. Also, bear in mind that we've been pretty consistent upon our guidance for OpEx during the year. We said that we expect our SG&A growth to be in line, broadly, with revenue growth and we expect R&D growth to grow faster.

In spite of what is clearly an unsettled macroenvironment, our solid results this quarter are a testament to the soundness of our strategy, the flexibility of our business model and the ability of our team to execute. As usual, Joe will comment more on the environment and what we're hearing from our customers, but it's pretty clear that things have gotten a bit weaker over the last few months. We all read the same headlines about Europe, concerns about slowing in China and the U.S., tight government spending, et cetera, and these are having an effect. 
While not immune to the economic pressures, we do believe that important customer priorities such as virtualization, storage and security will continue to grow faster than IT overall. Customers need to continue to drive their businesses forward, improve competitiveness and reduce costs, and these are the areas where they will continue to invest. 
This is evidenced in our Information Storage business where we grew 7%. Within this number, our reported storage product revenue growth was 3%. However, this product number includes other storage product revenue, some of which is outside of our strategic storage offerings. The biggest line in this other storage product bucket is third-party products that we resell, and another meaningful element is our consumer products business. In fact, the consumer products business was the biggest drag on this other storage buckets during the quarter due to planned decline in revenues as we refocus the Consumer business on lowering NAS and away from single-drive hardware. 
To make things clearer for you, this quarter, we're adding a new metric, network storage platforms, which includes our high-end and mid-tier to measure progress across our full family of complementary storage products, including scale block, scale file unified and backup. 
In today's rapidly changing environment, customers increasingly take advantage of our entire line up of offerings to accommodate their storage requirements, and as a result, it's helpful to monitor how its product portfolio as a whole performs, and this quarter, we continue to perform well. Our network storage platforms grew 7% year-on-year compared with 9% growth in Q1. 
Within network storage platforms, our mid-tier storage product revenue grew 10% in Q2, the result of year-on-year growth across all of our major mid-tier product lines. One of the hottest areas in storage right now is scale-out NAS. Companies seek solutions that can accommodate the explosive growth of unstructured data and do so simply at a scale. As a result, our scale-out file offering from Isilon continues to thrive as this is an excellent option for customers who are looking for a truly linear scale-out solution, especially given the lack of compelling alternatives. Isilon remains well suited for extremely large scale Big Data needs, and with continued technical innovation and the help of EMC's core sales force, is being deployed in mainstream data centers at some very large customers. 
Jaguar Land Rover has standardized upon Isilon to drive their most demanding HPC environments for modeling, simulation and design testing. Hyundai Heavy Industries selected Isilon to support a significant virtualization initiative and a larger Japanese mobile phone service provider recently chose Isilon as the foundation of a mission-critical service for business small phone users. 
And while Isilon is already very relevant to the enterprise data center, our OneFS Mavericks operating system expect to launch later this year, would make it even more so. Mavericks will open new opportunities for large-scale home directory and that's archiving workflows and will tightly integrate with VMware, making it an outstanding choice for virtual environments. 
Our Backup Recovery Systems business also continued to be a growth engine for EMC in Q2. Demand for our newly launched Data Domain 990 exceeded our high expectations. As customers rearchitect their IT infrastructures, they're looking across their entire backup landscape and thinking differently about how backup can be done most effectively, and this is where EMC comes in. Not only do our offerings cover the full range of backup requirements, they integrate it with other technologies in the data center in ways that make a difference to the user. Avamar is a good example of this. Its most recent addition Avamar 6.1, expanded support for hybrid environments and now delivers 3x the backup performance and 30x the recovery performance of its nearest competitor in VMware environments. 
Our unified storage offerings, VNX and VNXe, also contributed to our growth in network storage in Q2. The unified architecture of the VNX Family puts it at the top of the list for customers seeking a storage solution that is simple and efficient, as our VX Family boast the broadest integration among EMC products, as well as other vendors technologies. 
The VNX 5300 has been certified for Microsoft FastTrack, as well as SAP's HANA platform. VNX has pointed integration with Avamar, recovery point and VPLEX. Search integration made a big difference for the Kleberg County, North Carolina for user combination of VNX come Avamar and our cloud computing appliance to reclaim terabytes of primary storage while avoiding the need for more capacity for file shares and decreasing backup times by 90%. We continue to enhance the features and optionality of VNX as evidenced by a number of recent innovations. 
These include deeper integration with VMware's management suites to provide the most comprehensive performance analysis for VMware environments, as well as an upgrade to the VNX operating environment known as, available today to download to existing systems and shipping our new systems soon, in your features more storage utilization of automatic rebalancing of data where new drivers are added and added snapshot functionality, enhancing VNX for used cases such as testing, point in time backups and reporting or repurposing of new data. 
Growth of our high-end storage products rebounded in Q2 with revenue up 3% year-on-year. Undoubtedly, some of this growth was the direct result of the VMAX refresh we announced in May which refreshed our VMAXe and VMAX with the VMAX 10K and VMAX 20K, respectively, and introduced a new ultrahigh performance VMAX 40K. By making available several options for our scale-out scalable offering, customers can more closely match highest features and fiction outstandings with their specific requirements and resources. Common across all 3 additions is the new VMAX operating system which is available across all generations of the EMC VMAX family including all VMAX and VMAXe installed since 2009. We are pleased with how this transition is progressing. Approximately 1/3 of our new VMAX systems revenue in the quarter was from the 10K, 20K, 40K family. This new release illustrates the increasing importance of software to the storage infrastructure. While the underlying hardware offers different processing and capacity across the 10K, 20K and 40K depending upon need, a lot of the value to the customer comes from the software. 
The new VMAX line utilizes units here, the same user interfaces the VNX. Integration recovery points across the entire VMAX family offers the ability to extend faster capabilities other vendors arrays and can now apply FAST VP to mainframe and IBM environments. To ensure customers can extract maximum value for their storage solutions, the VMAX family incorporates options for MLC Flash, as well as 2.5-inch SaaS drives. 
All in, we've assembled a best-of-breed portfolio storage offerings that covers a wide range of customer needs with technology that truly requires no compromise on behalf of our customers. Some of these technologies were recently acquired. Some are developed in our labs. Either way, a key value preposition we developed over the past several years is bringing our wide array of offering together via common hardware, leveraging generally available and industry standard components. The benefits of the strategy are many, faster time-to-market, lower cost of goods sold, better quality, lower support costs, great efficiencies from engineering, better leverage of our supply chain and more efficient inventory management. 
On the software side of things, getting to a more holistic view makes customers growing and have the environment simpler. In addition to VMware integration is unmatched by any other storage provider, we continue to enhance integration across our products elsewhere to generate more value for our customers. 
In March, we integrated ProSphere with FAST VP to automatically track the consumption of Virtual Pools and identify when new capacity will be required. In May, we announced our new data bridge software. Data bridge match us up IT operations data, turning silos of disparate complete storage and network manager information into used case specific use for better visibility across the infrastructure as part of an IT-As-A-Service deployments. Recently, we acquired Watchfulness, a leader in IT performance management. Watchfulness solution consolidates and analyzes performance in one unified platform across multivendor multitechnology environments and is already tightly integrated with our IT operations intelligence suites. 
As you can see, from these May examples, our best-of-breed storage product which are built on common hardware and united by its core management interfaces with an ability to integrate with many environments are central to our strategy. This approach drives our complexity and empowers customers looking for efficiency, control and choice with agility. 
The way we've leveraged Flash technology is a great example of how we integrate industry-standard components and then build software around it. Once the Flash card is strategically placed, the next set is leveraging its functionality with intelligent automated software that operates across the stack. This is the key to delivering value. Not only does this 2-part approach resulted in an optimal cost-benefit outcome for the customer, it also enables us to address a wide variety of used cases in the contemporary data center. The mixed workloads customers use a hybrid array with a small amount of Flash for the hottest data and the rest cost-effectively tiered to high-capacity drives. The situations were 100% of the data is hot such as DDI or database testing development, customers can use in hold Flash RA. Our acquisition of Extreme I/O gives us excellent technology here as we've seen from the customer access programs that are currently underway. For market segments that require a persistent data store for performance-intensive workloads such as high-frequency trading and online gaming, we're developing Project Thunder, a server network attached appliance built entirely of high-speed PCIe Flash. Our early customer access program is underway here as well. 
And for applications that benefit from Flash in the server, customers use VFCache. VFCache has been embraced by more than 100 customers across industries for the dramatic performance improvements it enables. One of the largest retailers in the U.S. bought VFCache to accelerate the performance of their SQL production environments. The retail habitable performance with FAST VP and can now triple that again by adding VFCache. In total, that 6x the performance compared to the environment and we for FAST VP and VFCache. We will be significant expanding the use case potential for VFCache in the second half of the addition of in-line dedupe, support for larger PCIe cards, MLC Flash and support for UCS-based services. 
The value of Flash is resonating with our customers and in Q2, we shoot the record amount of Flash capacity. Importantly, our Flash solutions work in conjunction with customers network storage environments, bringing all the performance benefits of Flash without sacrificing the benefits of network storage like Data Protection and availability. 
In sum, EMC is developing the most comprehensive Flash portfolio across industry and will be the only company capable of providing the right Flash solution across a variety of used cases. 
The benefits of offering a full portfolio are not limited to storage. We've also gaining share and add value to customer relationships with offerings in analytics, security, Content Management and virtualization. Greenplum continues to reap the benefits of being in the thick of one of the hottest areas of IT right now. With this very rich Big Data toolset spanning data science, social collaboration, Siegel processing and Hadoop enterprise, Greenplum is a truly differentiated player in the space. As a result, we're winning new customers and gaining repeat business as customers add on to their existing analytics implementations. Wins from Q2 came from across verticals and for a variety of reasons. Some are looking to become truly predictive enterprises, some are looking for line of business implementation that can get up and running quickly while others simply want the ability to do ad hoc queries to find the best answer to a specific question about the business. And those we'll win in the quarter came from utility customer looking to create insight from the analysis of their customer usage patents. We're very excited about seizing these fast-growing opportunities. 
Like Big Data, security is also enjoying a position near the top customer priority list and RSA delivering growing 13% in Q2. Customers understand that with IT security, there's no longer a question of whether there will be an attack. Rather, the question in today's advanced threat environment is how quickly and effectively a tax can be forwarded. Because the threat landscape changes rapidly, customer defenses need a agile risk-based and contextual solutions that RSA offers. While our products do very well individually, customers are increasingly embracing the value of the integration across them. For example, NetWitness, Archer, enVision and DLP work together to provide controls and visibility functions that are based upon as operative analytics and continuous monitoring of massive and growing amounts of data. 
Additionally, there are integrations between RSA data loss prevention technology and VMWare's vShield, as well as between Archer and EMC's network and storage integration managers and vSphere, all enhancements to accelerate our customers' journey to the cloud without sacrificing trust. 
Revenue from our Information Intelligence Group was down 4% year-on-year. And it is encouraging to see license revenue growing at 3% this quarter. We see value here and we're making investments we believe are needed to return IT to the growth business we know it can be. To that end, we acquired Syncplicity, a cloud-based sync and share provider for businesses and continue to roll out vertical specific offerings such as the Documentum for life science solutions suite that was announced in early May. 
VMware revenues grew 22% over last year's second quarter as companies continue to expand their virtual infrastructures both in the data center and on the desktop and add management capabilities to virtual infrastructures that are built on VMware. Having become the standard way of running server applications in the cloud era, VMware is very well positioned for its move to the next phase of cloud computing, the software-defined data center. Customers of a software-defined data center can have their own virtual data center with isolated collections of all the compute, storage, networking and security resources they need. 
VMware's acquisition of Nicera upon closing will expand VMware's software-defined network portfolio across multiple hypervisors and cloud environments. VMware will continue to work with networking, compute, storage and security ecosystem partners to complement and support their continued innovations. 
Given VMware's a strong foundation for future growth, EMC is focusing more resources than ever on VMware integration across our portfolio. This integration plays a major role in many of our wins and we won a number of multimillion dollar orders in Q2 for virtualized environments, including a school system deploying a vBlock, VDI and Avamar, a large public-sector health organization deploying a vBlock, Data Domain and a global energy company consolidating 15 arrays on 2 VMAXes. 
To take advantage of the fundamental trends the cloud and Big Data, we've not only made a transformational changes to our product portfolio, but we've also expanded our customers' options to how they buy IT as well. As a result, our go-to-market model has evolved considerably over the past several years. We've strengthened and expanded our lines of partnerships, invested heavily in our channel relationships, expanded our reseller base and sharpen our services capabilities to help our customers successfully transition to cloud architectures. 
One of the greatest differences today compared with just a few years ago is the advent of IT service providers and that's a trend that we've not only followed but fostered. The team did early with several key cloud service providers including CSC, Verizon Terremark, AT&T, Telefonica, Rackspace, Cable & Wireless, Colt [ph] , Telstra and many, many others. This early entry allowed us to pioneer this new space together and is given us a head start on creating the technology solutions necessary support enterprise cloud services. 
Some of the essentials we have found include giving our partners tools to support things like policy-based service levels and flexible disaster recovery service modules. The recently announced VMAX SP is an excellent example. As a result, many of these SPs are standardized on EMC's technology for their business class as a service offerings. We continue to see rapid growth from the service provider vertical. 
The alliance we announced with Atos is an excellent example of how we work with our partners to ensure customers have control flexibility and choice. Atos new cloud services company Canopy will provide a one-stop shop for cloud services offering customers platform-as-a-service, as well as a variety of applications available for the Software-as-a-Service model. Both of these are powered by best-of-breed technology from EMC and VMware. 
And in June, we announced a partnership with Verizon Terremark where they will standardize upon EMC technology for their private and hybrid cloud offerings, as well as for public cloud offerings. These joint collaborations enable EMC and our service partners to deliver dramatic customer value, the number of Software-as-a-Service offerings provided by our 50-plus primary partners increased over 100% from Q1. This rapid ramp reflects the strength of demand for enterprise class public cloud offerings. As the technology provider those looking to do their public cloud platforms on proven and trusted architectures, we expect to benefit as a role transitions to hybrid cloud over the next several years. 
Our channel program has evolved considerably over the past year and a half as we set out to create our partner experience with EMC that's profitable, protectable and simple. The result has been incremental revenue to EMC and our partners alike. In fact, since we began the transformation of our channel program early last year, we've captured over $0.5 billion of revenue from these new partners, many of whom are small used to be beyond our reach. 
vBlocks continue to gain traction in enterprise data centers, as well as in cloud service providers as demand continues to show very strong growth in Q2. Existing customers continue to expand their vBlock footprint and VCE is winning new customers that strong rates. VC was recently selected to provide infrastructure for Europe's first education cloud in Northern Ireland, which is a central repository of education materials accessible to 350,000 students and teachers in 1,200 schools. We remain on track to reach the $1 billion run rate for vBlocks. 
Finally, we'd like to welcome, VCE's new CEO who previously was the GM of Cisco's routing technology group. Our services organization continues to be instrumental in transitioning customers to cloud architectures, transforming IT and virtualizing their mission-critical applications. A greater focus on solution selling in cooperation with VMware, VCE, RSA and Greenplum has also been beneficial to EMC, as well as to our customers. And our focus on customer service has not gone unnoticed as we were honored with 3 TSIA Star Awards for service and excellence in Q2. 
When customers think through how they want to build their cloud data centers, some choose to buy best-of-breed products sold separately, typically when the customer has specific requirements and prefers to configure a solution on their own. Some customers seek the ease and efficiency of our reference architecture with some flexibility on the server or networking side, which they can get with VSPEX and over 400 partners have certified their VSPEX solutions. 
Finally, there are situations where the customer know if they want to truly converge infrastructure with best-of-breed products and they want to see deployed solutions rapidly as possible. These customers buy vBlocks. Our ability to provide these options gets us into more opportunities and it's important to the customer. We're the only company that offers this degree of flexibility and choice. 
In sum, our go-to-market model differentiates us from the competition as our approach makes the right tool for the job available to many types of customer in a way that makes the most sense for them. Our focus on the customer, which has guided our strategy for so many years, continues to serve us well as we saw in our Q2 financial results. While macro headwinds, including the economies in Europe and the euro increased during the quarter, we still grew the overall business by 10% year-over-year or 12% in constant currency. Within this, North America was up 14%; EMEA was down 1%, though up 5% in constant currency; APJ grew 14%; Latin America was up 2% and up 12% in constant currency; and BRIC + 13 grew 20% or 24% in constant currency. 
Now let's turn to the income statements. A useful way to understand how we achieve our EPS growth is to look at the various puts and takes, driving the change in EPS year-on-year. To that end, we are providing a waterfall analysis to show how various income statement items have contributed to the non-GAAP EPS growth we achieved in Q2. As has been the case of the last several quarters, gross margin improvement was an important factor. This quarter, non-GAAP gross margins were 64.4%, up 210 basis points from last year's Q2. The improvement here was driven primarily by an increase in volume and mix benefit of higher-margin products. 
As you can see in the waterfall charts, increase in gross margin dollars was the biggest contributor to our EPS growth. Non-GAAP operating margins were a solid 24%, up 90 basis points from Q2 of last year. Within the operating expense line, SG&A grew a little slower than revenue and R&D grew faster than revenue as we continue to invest in our leading edge product portfolio. As a result, growth in OpEx partially offset the robust gains from gross profits. Overall, our operating and financial model delivered solid EPS leverage this quarter. 
Taking a look at a couple of other items that had a meaningful impact on EPS growth. Our tax rate was 25% compared to 22% in Q2 of 2011. We now expect our tax rate for the full year to be 22%, reflecting a higher mix of revenue and profits in the U.S. This assumes the U.S. R&D tax credit is passed in Q4. 
The only important fact this quarter is share counts. In Q2, shares outstanding were about 58 million shares lower than in Q2 '11, a result of settling the first tranche of our convert, as well as share repurchases. 
Other expense was $35 million non-GAAP. We've updated our full year guidance for other expense to reflect some gains from strategic investments in Q2. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.39, up 11% from last year. These results are a great example of the resiliency of our model and the discipline of our execution. 
Q2 free cash flow was $958 million, up 36% and $91 million higher than non-GAAP net income for the period. Considering this was continued strong growth in deferred revenues, up 30% year-on-year to $7.1 billion. We closed Q2 with $10.9 billion in cash and investments, and of this, $3.7 billion was U.S. cash, excluding VMware. We spent approximately $520 million on acquisitions in the quarter. We returned $260 million of our cash to shareholders via the repurchase of EMC stock in Q2 and we expect to buy $700 million worth of EMC shares in 2012. 
Looking forward, we do not expect the economy to get better this year, but we do like how we've positioned the company near term and long term. We believe we have the right strategy in place to leverage the 3 major ways of change in IT: cloud, Big Data and trust. We have leadership positions in many of the key areas enabling these ways. We have a best-of-breed product portfolio with breadth and depth that is unique in the industry. We have a great track record of helping customers and very high customer loyalty and satisfaction. We have a solid operational and financial model that has demonstrated success across cycles. And we're fortunate to have a global EMC team that is second to none. As a result of these and given our results so far in 2012, we expect to achieve $22 billion of revenues, $1.70 in non-GAAP EPS and $4.9 billion in free cash flow this year. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Joe, who will give you more color on the quarter and the great opportunities that lie ahead of us. Joe?"

I would like to take a moment to publicly congratulate David on his promotion to President and Chief Operating Officer of EMC. The board and I are extremely confident in David's abilities and the people of EMC are solidly behind him. We know he will do a great job. David, as always, it's a pleasure working with you. 
I would also like to sincerely and deeply thank Paul Maritz and Pat Gelsinger for the many, many contributions they have made towards the success of VMware in EMC, respectively, over the past several years and congratulate them as they take on their new roles. I look forward to continue to work closely with both of you also. 
Focusing back on our Q2 results and accomplishments, I am pleased with our performance and our execution. We maintained double-digit top line growth, produced leverage on the bottom line and focused on our customers' success and satisfaction. Given the choppy global economic environment, these accomplishments were quite noteworthy. 
I'd like to congratulate and thank the more than 55,000 people of EMC and VMware around the world who produced these financial results while remaining dedicated to our customers, well done. 
I would now like to comment on what we are seeing in the global economy and its impact on IT spending. On the macro front, pretty much everywhere in the world, we are seeing more caution and more scrutiny before any decisions to procure any IT product or service is made. There's an area of uncertainty that permeates the world stage right now. Customers want to ensure that we will get a good return on their investment in a shorter time frame. 
Despite this macro trends, customers do understand that they need to continue to better drive better productivity through the use of information technology. This helps to assure them our differentiation, our competitive advantage and helps drive down their overall cost. 
Translating all of this into IT spending metrics, we now expect operational IT spending growth to be around 3% this year, possibly a bit less. Previously, we believe that 2012 IT spending growth would be in the higher end of the 3% to 4% range. Net-net against this backdrop in Q2, we grew our revenues in the Americas and APJ by 14% year-over-year, while our business in EMEA declined 1%. But to give you a little more color, we showed several points of growth in Northern Europe and several points of decline in Southern Europe. And again, we saw our highest growth rates in the rapid growth economies. Across our BRIC + 13 countries, we grew approximately 20% in Q2 versus the same period last year. 
Looking at our year-over-year growth from a vertical industry perspective, our business with service providers, media, government and in financial services grew faster than our overall Q2 10% growth rate average, while our growth in local government, education and to the service sector was considerably slower. 
Clearly, we had EMC and VMware are well positioned in markets such as virtualization, storage and security that are growing faster than the IT average and it is equally clear that we are gaining share. Undoubtedly, a key reason for our success is the well-placed strategy and focus we have in cloud computing, Big Data and trust. But a company cannot rest on its past successes in this extremely fast-paced IT world we live in. And the best strategies, winning strategies, live, breathe, morph and grow. Our winning strategy allows one's total addressable market or TAM to expand considerably and when coupled with crisp execution, leads to profitable growth. In our case, EMC and VMware have enhanced and extended our strategies and have honed our focus on 3 core missions: Strategy one, which is VMware's primary mission, will focus a transforming data center infrastructures into truly automated software-defined data centers with cloud scale and style. 
Additionally, VMware will continue to have a strategic focus on supporting corporate end-users in a multi-device post-PC world. Strategy two will focus on the development community with technology, services and platform support to build out a new generation of cloud and Big Data applications. And strategy 3, which is EMC's primary mission, will focus on transforming the storage market with industry-leading products and services that feature game-changing technologies like FAST part, FAST software and Flash hardware. And we, at EMC, will focus on extending our RSA Security assets to assure trust in this new cloud and Big Data error. During this properly with visionary leadership and solid execution will drive a new wave of opportunity our way. So to that end, we have assigned 3 world-class IT leaders: Pat, Paul and David, respectively. They each lead one of these strategic major vectors, and each of them have dedicated talented team to publisher crisp execution. 
Getting this right will be critical to our future success and I can assure you, we are maniacally focused on getting it right. With that, I will now turn it back to Tony to moderate the Q&A portion of today's call."

And if we can help customers with their productivity, as I said, gain competitive advantage, help control costs, get more intimate with their customers, they are investing. What they're doing is, they're taken longer to invest that they're going to be like the good carpenter, they're measuring twice, cutting once, and obviously, there fighting just exactly where they need not buy in excess. So it's not that we're down in Europe any means, but it is, we are feeling the effects and I think this will be with us for a while. I don't think this is a short-term phenomena.

First of all, as we said last quarter, we did expect from Q1 to Q2, the growth in mid-tier to come down because of the stronger compare. If you recall last year, Q2 was the first full quarter of VNX and that was a  fair amount pent-up demand for that flat, a little bit of a reduction in growth rates. Also, a couple of other factors. Europe is actually overweight from a mix point of view towards mid-tier. So higher percentage of total revenues are in Europe from mid-tier given the nature of that market and of course, with the euro, with Europe being down because of the economy, of course, to the euro effect, that is slightly bigger impacts on mid-tier than it did in the overall business. A couple of other comments, the channel in mid-tier remains strong, which is important for us. All the key major parts of mid-tier family, the VNX Family, the BRS, Isilon all grew. And then if you look quarter-on-quarter, mid-tier actually grew 3% which is quite respectable. So we account, put it all together, that's really the story on mid-tier. And finally, I think with the dust settles and you're looking at 10% and you look at how everything is going to wind reporting this quarter for that segment of the marketplace, I think we're going to look pretty good."

I mean you just need to get your math right. i think there's been a little bit of confusion because of comparisons included organic and inorganic growth, et cetera. Well, the way we look at it is, really very simple. We think the right way of looking at growth is, first of all, to cannot break out individual products Whittle pit abroad market performance of the different businesses. The other thing is to make sure you including a true, what we would call apples-to-apples growth rates, so you would include all the revenues from acquired companies as if you acquired them in then prior periods. And then once you do that, here's how the math works. It's really quite simple. If you look at NetApps and we look at the last 4 quarters of growth rate, including that guidance for their current quarter, their 4-quarter growth rate average is 4%. If you look at our business, and by the way, that 4% includes services growing faster than their products. If you look at our business and you just look at the mid-tier product category alone, that same 4-quarter apples-to-apples growth rate is 19% and if you want to really stretch of the case and include Symmetrix and include all of our storage products, it's 12%.

The answer to those questions tells you where to place your storage and what type of storage to use. We have software that seamlessly and agilely moves and fits that information across these storage types and medias that I mentioned. And again, this is the key to when you talk about a software data center. that's what you have to have happened. It's not a one-size-fits-all world. That's kind of yesterday's paradigm. The cloud paradigm is basically saying what does the application need? What does it need to meet my SLAs? What does it need to meet my policies? And then what type of device am I going to select, okay, what type of media and then where am I going to place that media? So I could take the storage and I can put it on a PCI card and put it right into the server. I can put it on the server side of the network and a project like we have like Thunder. We can put it in, of course, in arrays and we can put both Flash, the memory Flash and storage, spending storage devices, media device in those arrays, and that's what we're planning.

As Joe said, we now expect IT spend about 3  and we're comfortable at that level. At the euro, we put on the numbers, first of all, let's just talk about the euro for a second in the event that's having upon our business. If you look at Q2 quarter, Q2 year-end growth rates, it's about $250 million headwind year-on-year and about $0.03 is the impact of the euro this year versus last year. Current swap rates, that includes, that goes up to like $208 million, $209 million year on year impact still about $0.03. And euro, at the level of where it was at quarter end and where it is now in that range, is consistent with our thinking about guidance. So those are the 2 parameters, 3 are a little less IT spending in euro between what is now and where it was on quarter and, and again, understand relative to our growth rate where it is now. Year-on-year, the euro is having about 150 basis points of year-on-year headwind growth on us. So when you compare this year versus last year, you're going to take that into account. So those are the assumptions that go into the guidance that we've given. And then relative to the EMC versus VMware elsewhere, I'll let Joe take that one."

We also said, Tony, that we did much better in the North than we did in the South. So if you bring that down, where is the real problem? The real problem's in Southern Europe. And why is that a little bit different than VMware? I'd say you can always, something like storage, pushing it off a bit and that was a good question so how long do think customers can put you off. It's not forever because eventually information is going to grow and you need a place to put it, you need a place for it to live. You need it to be managed. They can put it off solo but I think on the shorter jam down, you can say, look, I'm just going to get a little -- I'm just going to push a little harder, get a little higher may raise us closest productivity tools and make sure you raise your utilization rates and that's what we're seeing.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today.I'm pleased to report that we achieved our 10th consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue and EPS growth in Q2, with revenue up 10%, non-GAAP EPS up 11% and free cash flow up 36%",4198,"Thanks, Tony. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today.
I'm pleased to report that we achieved our 10th consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue and EPS growth in Q2, with revenue up 10%, non-GAAP EPS up 11% and free cash flow up 36%. Our ability to deliver these strong results is linked in large part to our strategy, which is to help companies use cloud technologies and Big Data assets in their trust environments.
In spite of what is clearly an unsettled macroenvironment, our solid results this quarter are a testament to the soundness of our strategy, the flexibility of our business model and the ability of our team to execute. As usual, Joe will comment more on the environment and what we're hearing from our customers, but it's pretty clear that things have gotten a bit weaker over the last few months. We all read the same headlines about Europe, concerns about slowing in China and the U.S., tight government spending, et cetera, and these are having an effect.
While not immune to economic pressures, we do believe that important customer priorities such as virtualization, storage and security will continue to grow faster than IT overall. Customers need to continue to drive their businesses forward, improve competitiveness and reduce costs, and these are the areas where they will continue to invest.
This is evidenced in our Information Storage business where we grew 7%. Within this number, our reported storage product revenue growth was 3%. However, this product number includes other storage product revenue, some of which is outside of our strategic storage offerings. The biggest line in this other storage product bucket is third-party products that we resell, and another meaningful element is our consumer products business. In fact, the consumer products business was the biggest drag on this other storage bucket during the quarter due to the planned decline in revenues as we refocused the consumer business on lowering NAS and away from single-drive hardware.
To make things clearer for you, this quarter we're adding a new metric, networked storage platforms, which includes our high-end and mid-tier, to measure progress across our full family of complementary storage products, including scale block, scale file, unified and backup. In today's rapidly changing environment, customers increasingly take advantage of our entire line-up of offerings to accommodate their storage requirements. And as a result, it's helpful to monitor how this product portfolio as a whole performs, and this quarter we continue to perform well. Our networked storage platforms grew 7% year-on-year compared with 9% growth in Q1.
Within networked storage platforms, our mid-tier storage product revenue grew 10% in Q2, the result of year-on-year growth across all of our major mid-tier product lines. One of the hottest areas in storage right now is scale-out NAS. Companies seek solutions that can accommodate the explosive growth of unstructured data and do so simply in a scale. As a result, our scale-out file offering from Isilon continues to thrive as this is an excellent option for customers who are looking for a truly linear scale-out solution especially given the lack of compelling alternatives. Isilon remains well suited for extremely large-scale Big Data needs and, with continued technical innovation and the help of EMC's core sales force, is being deployed in mainstream data centers at some very large customers.
Jaguar Land Rover has standardized upon Isilon to drive their most demanding HPC environments for modeling, simulation and design testing. Hyundai Heavy Industries selected Isilon to support a significant virtualization initiative. And a large Japanese mobile phone service provider recently chose Isilon as the foundation of a mission-critical service for business smartphone users. And while Isilon is already very relevant to the enterprise data center, our OneFS Mavericks operating system, expected to launch later this year, will make it even more so. Mavericks will open new opportunities for large-scale home directory, and that's archiving workloads, and will tightly integrate with VMware, making it an outstanding choice for virtual environments.
Our Backup Recovery Systems business also continued to be a growth engine for EMC in Q2. Demand for our newly launched Data Domain 990 exceeded our high expectations. As customers re-architect their IT infrastructures, they're looking across the entire backup landscape and thinking differently about how backup can be done most effectively, and this is where EMC comes in. Not only do our offerings cover the full range of backup requirements, they integrate it with other technologies in the data center in ways that make a difference to the user. Avamar is a good example of this. Its most recent addition, Avamar 6.1, expanded support for Hyper-V environments and now delivers 3x the backup performance and 30x the recovery performance of its nearest competitor in VMware environments.
Our unified storage offerings VNX and VNXe also contributed to our growth in networked storage in Q2. The unified architecture of the VNX Family puts it at the top of the list for customers seeking a storage solution that is simple and efficient as our VNX Family boasts some of the broadest integration among EMC products as well as other vendors' technologies.
The VNX5300 has been certified for Microsoft's FastTrack as well as SAP's HANA platform. VNX has points of integration with Avamar, RecoverPoint and VPLEX. Search integration made a big difference for Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, who use a combination of VNX, Avamar and our Cloud Tiering Appliance to reclaim terabytes of primary storage while avoiding the need for more capacity for file shares and decreasing backup times by 90%.
We continue to enhance the features and functionality of VNX, as evidenced by a number of recent innovations. These include deeper integration with VMware's management suites to provide the most comprehensive performance analysis for VMware environments, as well as an upgrade to the VNX operating environment known as Inyo. Available today for download to existing systems and shipping on new systems soon, Inyo features more efficient storage utilization, automatic rebalancing of data when new drivers are added and added snapshot functionality, enhancing VNX for use cases such as test and dev, point-in-time backups and reporting or the repurposing of data.
Growth of our high-end storage products rebounded in Q2, with revenue up 3% year-on-year. Undoubtedly, some of this growth was a direct result of the VMAX refresh we announced in May which refreshed our VMAXe and VMAX with the VMAX 10K and VMAX 20K, respectively, and introduced a new ultra-high performance VMAX 40K. By making available several options for our scale-out block offering, customers can more closely match high-end features and functionalities with their specific requirements and resources.
Common across all 3 additions is the new VMAX operating system which is available across all generations of the EMC VMAX family, including all VMAX and VMAXe arrays sold since 2009.
We are pleased with how this transition is progressing. Approximately 1/3 of our new VMAX systems revenue in the quarter was from the 10K, 20K, 40K family. This new release illustrates the increasing importance of software to the storage infrastructure. While the underlying hardware offers different processing and capacity across the 10K, 20K and 40K, depending upon need, a lot of the value to the customer comes from the software.
The new VMAX line utilizes Unisphere, the same user interface as VNX; integrates recover points across the entire VMAX family; offers the ability to extend fast capabilities to other vendors' arrays; and could now apply FAST VP to mainframe and IBM iSeries environments. To ensure customers can extract maximum value from their storage solutions, the VMAX family incorporates options for MLC Flash, as well as 2.5-inch SaaS drives.
All in, we've assembled a best-of-breed portfolio of storage offerings that covers a wide range of customer needs with technology that truly requires no compromise on behalf of our customers. Some of these technologies were recently acquired, some were developed in our labs. Either way, a key value proposition we've developed over the past several years is bringing a wide array of offerings together via common hardware, leveraging generally available and industry standard components. The benefits of this strategy are many: faster time to market, lower cost of goods sold, better quality, lower support costs, great efficiencies from engineering, better leverage of our supply chain and more efficient inventory managements.
On the software side of things, getting to a more holistic view makes customers growing and heterogeneous environments simpler. In addition to VMware integration that is unmatched by any other storage provider, we continue to enhance integration across our products elsewhere to generate more value for our customers. In March, we integrated ProSphere with FAST VP to automatically track the consumption of virtual pools and identify when new capacity will be required. In May, we announced our new DataBridge software. DataBridge mashes up IT operations data, turning silos of disparate compute, storage and network management information into used-case specific views for better visibility across the infrastructure as part of an IT-As-A-Service deployment. Recently, we acquired Watch4net, a leader in IT performance management. Watch4net solution consolidates and analyzes performance in one unified platform across multi-vendor, multi-technology environments and is already tightly integrated with our IT Operations Intelligence Suite.
As you can see through these many examples, our best-of-breed storage products, which are built on common hardware and united by common management interfaces with an ability to integrate with many environments, are central to our strategy. This approach drives our complexity and empowers customers looking for efficiency, control and choice with agility.
The way we've leveraged Flash technology is a great example of how we integrate industry standard components and then build software around it. Once the Flash hardware is strategically placed, the next step is leveraging its functionality with intelligent automated software that operates across the stack. This is the key to delivering value. Not only does this two-part approach results in an optimal cost-benefit outcome for the customer, it also enables us to address a wide variety of use cases in the contemporary data center.
For mixed workloads, customers use a hybrid array, with a small amount of Flash for the hottest data and the rest cost-effectively tiered to high-capacity drives. For situations where 100% of the data is hot, such as VDI or database test and development, customers can use an all-Flash array. Our acquisition of Extreme I/O gives us excellent technology here, as we've seen from the customer access programs that are currently underway.
For market segments that require a persistent data store for performance-intensive workloads such as high-frequency trading and online gaming, we're developing Project Thunder, a server network-attached appliance built entirely of high-speed PCIe Flash. Our early customer access program is underway here as well. And for applications that benefit from Flash in the server, customers use VFCache. VFCache has been embraced by more than 100 customers across industries for the dramatic performance improvements it enables. One of the largest retailers in the U.S. bought VFCache to accelerate the performance of their SQL production environments. The retail had already doubled performance with FAST VP and can now triple that again by adding VFCache. In total, that's 6x the performance compared to environments before FAST VP and VFCache. We will be significantly expanding the use case potential for VFCache in the second half with the addition of in-line dedupe, support for larger PCIe cards, MLC Flash and support for UCS-based service.
The value of Flash is resonating with our customers, and in Q2, we shipped a record amount of Flash capacity. Importantly, our Flash solutions work in conjunction with customers' network storage environments, bringing all the performance benefits of Flash without sacrificing the benefits of network storage like data protection and availability. In sum, EMC is developing the most comprehensive Flash portfolio across the industry and will be the only company capable of providing the right Flash solution across a variety of use cases.
The benefits of offering a full portfolio are not limited to storage. We've also been able to gain wallet share and add value to customer relationships with offerings in analytics, security, content management and virtualization.
Greenplum continues to reap the benefits of being in the thick of one of the hottest areas of IT right now. With its very rich Big Data toolsets spanning data science, social collaboration, SQL processing and Hadoop for the enterprise, Greenplum is a truly differentiated player in the space. As a result, we're winning new customers and gaining repeat business as customers add on to their existing analytics implementations. Wins from Q2 came from across verticals and for a variety of reasons. Some are looking to become truly predictive enterprises, some are looking for line-of-business implementation that can get up and running quickly, while others simply want the ability to do ad hoc queries to find the best answer to a specific question about the business, and those we'll win in the quarter came from the utility customer looking to create insight from the analysis of their customer usage patents. We're very excited about seizing these fast-growing opportunities.
Like Big Data, security is also enjoying a position near the top of customer priority lists. And RSA is delivering, growing 13% in Q2. Customers understand that with IT security there's no longer a question of whether there will be an attack. Rather, the question in today's advanced threat environment is how quickly and effectively attacks can be thwarted. Because the threat landscape changes rapidly, customer defenses need the agile risk-based and contextual solutions that RSA offers. While our products do very well individually, customers are increasingly embracing the value of the integration across them. For example, NetWitness, Archer, enVision and DLP work together to provide controls and visibility functions that are based upon agile, predictive analytics and continuous monitoring of massive and growing amounts of data.
Additionally, there are integrations between RSA's Data Loss Prevention technology and VMWare's vShield, as well as between Archer and EMC's network and storage configuration managers and the vSphere, all enhancements to accelerate customers' journey to the cloud without sacrificing trust.
Revenue from our Information Intelligence Group was down 4% year-on-year. It is encouraging to see license revenue growing at 3% this quarter. We see value here and we're making investments we believe are needed to return IIG to the growth business we know it can be. To that end, we acquired Syncplicity, a cloud-based sync-and-share provider for businesses, and continue to roll out vertical specific offerings such as the Documentum for life science solution suite that was announced in early May.
VMware revenues grew 22% over last year's second quarter as companies continue to expand their virtual infrastructures both in the data center and on the desktop and add management capabilities to virtual infrastructures they've built on VMware. Having become the standard way of running server applications in the cloud era, VMware is very well positioned for its move to the next phase of cloud computing, the software-defined data center. Customers of a software-defined data center can have their own virtual data center with isolated collections of all the compute, storage, networking and security resources they need. VMware's acquisition of Nicira upon closing will expand VMware's software-defined networking portfolio across multiple hypervisors and cloud environments. VMware will continue to work with networking, compute, storage and security ecosystem partners to complement and support their continued innovations. 
Given VMware's a strong foundation for future growth, EMC is focusing more resources than ever on VMware integration across our portfolio. This integration plays a major role in many of our wins, and we won a number of multimillion dollar orders in Q2 for virtualized environments, including a school system deploying a Vblock, VDI and Avamar; a large public-sector health organization deploying a Vblock, Data Domain; and a global energy company consolidating 15 arrays on the 2 VMAXes.
To take advantage of the fundamental trends of cloud and Big Data, we've not only made transformational changes to our product portfolio but we've also expanded our customers' options for how they buy IT as well. As a result, our go-to-market model has evolved considerably over the past several years. We've strengthened and expanded our lines of partnerships, invested heavily in our channel relationships, expanded our reseller base and sharpened our services capabilities to help our customers successfully transition to cloud architectures.
One of the greatest differences today compared with just a few years ago is the advent of IT service providers, and this is a trend that we've not only followed but fostered. We teamed up early with several key cloud service providers including CSC, Verizon Terremark, AT&T, Telefonica, Rackspace, Cable & Wireless, Colt, Telstra and many, many others. This early entry allowed us to pioneer this new space together and it's given us a head start on creating the technology solutions necessary to support enterprise cloud services. Some of the essentials we have found included giving our partners tools to support things like policy-based service levels and flexible disaster recovery service modules. The recently announced VMAX SP is an excellent example. As a result, many of these SPs are standardized on EMC's technology for their business class as a service offerings. We continue to see rapid growth from the service provider vertical.
The alliance we announced with Atos in February is an excellent example of how we work with our service provider partners to ensure customers have control, flexibility and choice. Atos' new cloud services company Canopy will provide a one-stop shop for cloud services, offering customers platform-as-a-service as well as a variety of applications available for a Software-as-a-Service model. Both of these are powered by best-of-breed technology from EMC and VMware. And in June, we announced a partnership with Verizon Terremark where they will standardize upon EMC technology for their private and hybrid cloud offerings as well as for public cloud offerings.
These joint collaborations enable EMC and our service partners to deliver dramatic customer value. The number of Software-as-a-Service offerings provided by our 50-plus primary partners increased over 100% from Q1. This rapid ramp reflects the strength of demand for enterprise-class public cloud offerings. As the technology provider to those looking to build their public cloud platforms on proven and trusted architectures, we expect to benefit as the world transitions to hybrid cloud over the next several years.
Our channel program has evolved considerably over the past 1.5 years as we set out to create a partner experience with EMC that's profitable, predictable and simple. The result has been incremental revenue to EMC and our partners alike. In fact, since we began the transformation of our channel program early last year, we've captured over $0.5 billion of revenue from these new partners, many of whom are small bars that used to be beyond our reach.
Vblock has continued to gain traction in enterprise data centers as well as in cloud service providers as demand continues to show very strong growth in Q2. Existing customers continue to expand their Vblock footprint, and VCE is winning new customers at a strong rate. VCE was recently selected to provide the infrastructure for Europe's first education cloud in Northern Ireland, which is a central repository of education materials accessible to 350,000 students and teachers in 1,200 schools. We remain on track to reach the $1 billion run rate for Vblocks.
Finally, we'd like to welcome Praveen Akkiraju, VCE's new CEO who previously was the GM of Cisco's routing technology group.
Our services organization continues to be instrumental in transitioning customers to cloud architectures, transforming IT and virtualizing their mission-critical applications. A greater focus on solution-selling in cooperation with VMware, VCE, RSA and Greenplum has also been beneficial to EMC as well as to our customers. And our focus on customer service has not gone unnoticed as we were honored with 3 TSIA Star Awards for service and excellence in Q2.
When customers think through how they want to build their cloud data centers, some choose to buy best-of-breed products sold separately typically when the customer has specific requirements and prefers to configure a solution on their own. Some customers seek the ease and efficiency of our reference architecture with some flexibility on the server or networking side, which they can get with VSPEX, and over 400 partners have certified their VSPEX solutions.
Finally, there are situations where the customer know if they want to truly converge infrastructure with best-of-breed products and they want to deploy solutions rapidly as possible. These customers buy Vblocks. Our ability to provide these options gets us into more opportunities and is important to the customer. We're the only company that offers this degree of flexibility and choice.
In sum, our go-to-market model differentiates us from the competition as our approach makes the right tool for the job available to many types of customer in the way that makes the most sense for them. Our focus on the customer, which has guided our strategy for so many years, continues to serve us well, as we saw in our Q2 financial results. While macro headwinds, including the economies in Europe and the euro, increased during the quarter, we still grew the overall business by 10% year-over-year or 12% in constant currency. Within this, North America was up 14%; EMEA was down 1%, though up 5% in constant currency; APJ grew 14%; Latin America was up 2% and up 12% in constant currency; and BRIC plus 13 grew 20% or 24% in constant currency.
Now let's turn to the income statements. A useful way to understand how we achieve our EPS growth is to look at the various puts and takes driving the change in EPS year-on-year. To that end, we're providing a waterfall analysis to show how various income statement items have contributed to the non-GAAP EPS growth we achieved in Q2.
As has been the case for the last several quarters, gross margin improvement was an important factor. This quarter, non-GAAP gross margins were 64.4%, up 210 basis points from last year's Q2. The improvement here was driven primarily by an increase in volume and mix benefit of high-margin products. As you can see in the waterfall charts, increase in gross margin dollars was the biggest contributor to our EPS growth. Non-GAAP operating margins were a solid 24%, up 90 basis points from Q2 of last year.
Within the operating expense line, SG&A grew a little slower than revenue and R&D grew faster than revenue as we continue to invest in our leading-edge product portfolio. As a result, growth in OpEx partially offset the robust gains from gross profits. Overall, our operating and financial model delivered solid EPS leverage this quarter.
Taking a look at a couple of other items that have a meaningful impact on EPS growth. Our tax rate was 25% compared to 22% in Q2 of 2011. We now expect our tax rate for the full year to be 22%, reflecting a higher mix of revenue and profits in the U.S. This assumes the U.S. R&D tax credit is passed in Q4.
The other important fact this quarter was share counts. In Q2, shares outstanding were about 58 million shares lower than in Q2 '11, a result of settling the first tranche of our converts, as well as share repurchases.
Other expense was $35 million non-GAAP. We've updated our full year guidance for other expense to reflect some gains from strategic investments in Q2. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.39, up 11% from last year.
These results are a great example of the resiliency of our model and the discipline of our execution.
Q2 free cash flow was $958 million, up 36% and $91 million higher than non-GAAP net income for the period. Contributing to this was continued strong growth in deferred revenues, up 30% year-on-year to $7.1 billion. We closed Q2 with $10.9 billion in cash and investments, and of this, $3.7 billion was U.S. cash, excluding VMware. We spent approximately $520 million on acquisitions in the quarter. We returned $260 million of our cash to shareholders via the repurchase of EMC stock in Q2 and we expect to buy $700 million worth of EMC shares in 2012.
Looking forward, we do not expect the economy to get better this year, but we do like how we've positioned the company near term and long term. We believe we have the right strategy in place to leverage the 3 major ways of change in IT: cloud, Big Data and trust. We have leadership positions in many of the key areas enabling these ways. We have a best-of-breed product portfolio with breadth and depth that is unique in the industry. We have a great track record of helping customers and very high customer loyalty and satisfaction. We have a solid operational and financial model that has demonstrated success across cycles. And we're fortunate to have a global EMC team that is second to none.
As a result of these and given our results so far in 2012, we expect to achieve $22 billion of revenues, $1.70 in non-GAAP EPS and $4.9 billion in free cash flow this year.
With that, I'll turn it over to Joe, who will give you more color on the quarter and the great opportunities that lie ahead of us. Joe?"

I would like to take a moment to publicly congratulate David on his promotion to President and Chief Operating Officer of EMC. The board and I are extremely confident in David's abilities and the people of EMC are solidly behind him. We know he will do a great job. David, as always, it's a pleasure working with you.
I would also like to sincerely and deeply thank Paul Maritz and Pat Gelsinger for the many, many contributions they have made towards the success of VMware and EMC, respectively, over the past several years and congratulate them as they take on their new roles. I look forward to continue to work closely with both of you also.
Focusing back on our Q2 results and accomplishments, I am pleased with our performance and our execution. We maintained double-digit top line growth, produced leverage on the bottom line and focused on our customer's success and satisfaction. Given the choppy global economic environment, these accomplishments were quite noteworthy. I'd like to congratulate and thank the more than 55,000 people of EMC and VMware around the world who produced these financial results while remaining dedicated to our customers. Well done.
I would now like to comment on what we are seeing in the global economy and its impact on IT spending. On the macro front, pretty much everywhere in the world we are seeing more caution and more scrutiny before any decisions to procure any IT product or service is made. There is an air of uncertainty that permeates the world stage right now. Customers want to ensure that they will get a good return on their investment in a shorter time frame. Despite this macro trend, customers do understand that they need to continue to better drive better productivity through the use of information technology. This helps to assure them a differentiation, a competitive advantage, and helps drive down their overall cost.
Translating all of this into IT spending metrics, we now expect operational IT spending growth to be around 3% this year, possibly a tick less. Previously, we believed that 2012 IT spending growth would be in the higher end of the 3% to 4% range. Net-net against this backdrop in Q2, we grew our revenues in the Americas and APJ by 14% year-over-year while our business in EMEA declined 1%. But to give you a little more color, we showed several points of growth in Northern Europe and several points of decline in Southern Europe. And again, we saw our highest growth rates in the rapid-growth economies. Across our BRIC plus 13 countries, we grew approximately 20% in Q2 versus the same period last year.
Looking at our year-over-year growth from a vertical industry perspective. Our business with service providers, media, government and in financial services grew faster than our overall Q2 10% growth rate average while our growth in local government, education and to the service sector was considerably slower. Clearly, we at EMC and VMware are well positioned in markets such as virtualization, storage and security that are growing faster than the IT average and it is equally clear that we are gaining share. Undoubtedly, a key reason for our success is the well-placed strategy and focus we have in cloud computing, Big Data and trust.
But a company cannot rest on its past successes in this extremely fast-paced IT world we live in. And the best strategies, winning strategies: live, breathe, morph and grow. A winning strategy allows one's total addressable market or TAM to expand considerably and, when coupled with crisp execution, leads to profitable growth. In our case, EMC and VMware have enhanced and extended our strategies and have honed our focus on 3 core missions. Strategy one, which is VMware's primary mission, will focus on transforming data center infrastructures into truly automated software-defined data centers with cloud scale and style. Additionally, VMware will continue to have a strategic focus on supporting corporate end users in a multi-device post-PC world.
Strategy two will focus on the development community with technology, services and platform support to build out a new generation of cloud and Big Data applications. And strategy three, which is EMC's primary mission, will focus on transforming the storage market with industry-leading products and services that feature game-changing technologies like FAST part, FAST software and Flash hardware.
And we at EMC will focus on extending our RSA security assets to assure trust in this new cloud and Big Data era. Doing this properly with visionary leadership and solid execution will drive a new wave of opportunity our way. So to that end, we have assigned 3 world-class IT leaders: Pat, Paul and David, respectively. They each lead 1 of these 3 major strategic vectors and each of them has a dedicated, talented team to help assure crisp execution. Getting this right will be critical to our future success, and I can assure you, we are maniacally focused on getting it right.
With that, I will now turn it back to Tony to moderate the Q&A portion of today's call."

So there is a  drive in Europe for sure, just like there is here, for productivity. And if we can help customers with their productivity, as I said, gain competitive advantage, help control costs, get more intimate with their customers, they are investing. What they're doing is they're taking longer to invest, that they're being like the good carpenter, they're measuring twice, cutting once. And obviously, they're being -- they're buying just exactly what they need and not buying in excess. So it's not that we're down on Europe by any means, but it is we are feeling the effect. And I think this will be with us for a while. I don't think this is a short-term phenomena.

So there are -- a few factors are going on in mid-tier growth this quarter. First of all, as we said last quarter, we did expect from Q1 to Q2 the growth in mid-tier to come down because of the stronger compare. If you recall, last year it was -- in Q2 was the first full quarter of VNX and there was a fair amount of pent-up demand for that flat, so that caused a little bit of a reduction in growth rates. Also, a couple of other factors. Europe is actually overweight from a mix point of view towards mid-tier. So a higher percentage of total revenues are in Europe for mid-tier given the nature of that market. And of course with euro -- with Europe being down because of the economy, of course, with the euro effect, that has a slightly bigger impacts on mid-tier than it did on the overall business. A couple of other comments: The channel in mid-tier remains strong, which is important for us. All the key major parts of mid-tier family, the VNX Family, BRS, Isilon, all grew. And then if you look quarter-on-quarter, mid-tier actually grew 3%, which is quite respectable. So when you kind of put all that together, that's really the story on mid-tier. And finally, I think, when the dust settles and you look at our 10% and you look at how others are going to wind up reporting this quarter for that segment of the marketplace, I think we're going to look pretty good."

And I think there's been a little bit of confusion because of -- comparisons have included organic and inorganic growth, et cetera. The way to look -- the way we look at it is really very simple: We think the right way of looking at growth is, first of all, to kind of not break out individual products but look at the broad market performance of the different businesses. The other thing is to make sure you include a true what we would call apples-to-apples growth rates, so you include all the revenues from acquired companies as if you acquired them in prior periods. And then once you do that, here's how the math works out, it's really quite simple. If we look at NetApps and we look at the last 4 quarters of growth rate, including the guidance for their current quarter, their 4-quarter growth rate average is 4%. If you look at our business -- and by the way, that 4% includes services that have been growing faster than their products. If you look at our business and you just look at the mid-tier product category alone, that same 4-quarter apples-to-apples growth rate is 19%, and if you want to really stretch the case and include Symmetrix and include all of our storage products, it's 12%.

So we're going to navigate a little bit faster. I think that next quarter we'll probably get closer to 50%. So we've always said it takes between 2 and 3 quarters to get to a 50% transition on a new family. It looks like, in this case, we'll be there a little sooner. And relative to the macro, nothing really to add. As Joe said, it's impacting everybody, but we've been executing well against that so I don't think that particularly is a dynamic against the VMAX transition rate."

There's 4 things that are important when you consider storage. One is, what performance do you need for that information? And again, that's going to change over time, so the performance you need for an -- for that particular piece of information today might be less in the future, it usually is: the persistency of that information, the longevity of that information and how much you want to share that information. The answer to those questions tells you where to place your storage and what type of storage to use. We have software that seamlessly and agilely moves and fits that information across these storage types and medias that I just mentioned. And again, this is the key to when you talk about a software-defined data center. That's what you want to have happened. So it's not a ""one size fits all"" world, that's kind of yesterday's paradigm. The cloud paradigm is basically saying, what does the application need? What does it need to meet my SLAs? What does it need to meet my policies? And then, what type of device am I going to select, okay, what type of media? And then, where am I going to place that media? So I could take the storage and I could put it on a PCI card and put it right into the server. I can put it on the server side of the network, in a project like we have, like Thunder. We can put it, of course, in arrays and we can put both Flash -- memory Flash and storage -- spinning storage devices, media devices, in those arrays. And that's where we're playing. And we're all automating it through our FAST technology, and that's basically going to be root. I talked about one of the roots of the software-defined data center: How do you do that automatically? That's where we're spending our money. So it's -- that's the way we're playing the game, and a lot of the other stuff is just the bunk."

At the euro, when we put on the numbers together -- first of all, let's just talk about the euro for a second and the impact that's having upon our business. If we look at Q2 quarter, Q2 year-end growth rates, it's about $250 million headwind year-on-year. And about $0.03 is the impact of the euro this year versus last year. Current swap rates, that includes -- then it goes up to like $280 million, $290 million on year-on-year impact and still about $0.03. And euro, at the level of where it was at quarter end and where it is now in that range, is consistent with our thinking about guidance. So those are the 2 parameters: 3 or a little less IT spending, and euro between where it is now and where it was at quarter end and. Again understand, relative to our growth rate, where it is now year-on-year, the euro is having about 150 basis points of year-on-year headwind growth on us.

And why is that a little bit different than VMware? I'd say you can always, on something like storage, push it off a bit. And there was a good question: So how long do you think customers can push it off? It's not forever because, eventually, information is going to grow, you need a place to put it. You need a place for it to live. You need it to be managed. So you can only put that off so long.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today.I'm pleased to report that we achieved our 10th consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue and EPS growth in Q2, with revenue up 10%, non-GAAP EPS up 11% and free cash flow up 36%",4198,"Thanks, Tony. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today.
I'm pleased to report that we achieved our 10th consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue and EPS growth in Q2, with revenue up 10%, non-GAAP EPS up 11% and free cash flow up 36%. Our ability to deliver these strong results is linked in large part to our strategy, which is to help companies use cloud technologies and Big Data assets in their trust environments.
In spite of what is clearly an unsettled macro-environment, our solid results this quarter are a testament to the soundness of our strategy, the flexibility of our business model and the ability of our team to execute. As usual, Joe will comment more on the environment and what we're hearing from our customers, but it's pretty clear that things have gotten a bit weaker over the last few months. We all read the same headlines about Europe, concerns about slowing in China and the U.S., tight government spending, et cetera, and these are having an effect.
While not immune to economic pressures, we do believe that important customer priorities such as virtualization, storage and security will continue to grow faster than IT overall. Customers need to continue to drive their businesses forward, improve competitiveness and reduce costs, and these are the areas where they will continue to invest.
This is evidenced in our Information Storage business where we grew 7%. Within this number, our reported storage product revenue growth was 3%. However, this product number includes other storage product revenue, some of which is outside of our strategic storage offerings. The biggest line in this other storage product bucket is third-party products that we resell, and another meaningful element is our consumer products business. In fact, the consumer products business was the biggest drag on this other storage bucket during the quarter due to the planned decline in revenues as we refocused the consumer business on lowering NAS and away from single-drive hardware.
To make things clearer for you, this quarter we're adding a new metric, networked storage platforms, which includes our high-end and mid-tier, to measure progress across our full family of complementary storage products, including scale block, scale file, unified and backup. In today's rapidly changing environment, customers increasingly take advantage of our entire line-up of offerings to accommodate their storage requirements. And as a result, it's helpful to monitor how this product portfolio as a whole performs, and this quarter we continue to perform well. Our networked storage platforms grew 7% year-on-year compared with 9% growth in Q1.
Within networked storage platforms, our mid-tier storage product revenue grew 10% in Q2, the result of year-on-year growth across all of our major mid-tier product lines. One of the hottest areas in storage right now is scale-out NAS. Companies seek solutions that can accommodate the explosive growth of unstructured data and do so simply and at scale. As a result, our scale-out file offering from Isilon continues to thrive as this is an excellent option for customers who are looking for a truly linear scale-out solution especially given the lack of compelling alternatives. Isilon remains well suited for extremely large-scale Big Data needs and, with continued technical innovation and the help of EMC's core sales force, is being deployed in mainstream data centers at some very large customers.
Jaguar Land Rover has standardized upon Isilon to drive their most demanding HPC environments for modeling, simulation and design testing. Hyundai Heavy Industries selected Isilon to support a significant virtualization initiative. And a large Japanese mobile phone service provider recently chose Isilon as the foundation of a mission-critical service for business smartphone users. And while Isilon is already very relevant to the enterprise data center, our OneFS Mavericks operating system, expected to launch later this year, will make it even more so. Mavericks will open new opportunities for large-scale home directory, and that's archiving workloads, and will tightly integrate with VMware, making it an outstanding choice for virtual environments.
Our Backup Recovery Systems business also continued to be a growth engine for EMC in Q2. Demand for our newly launched Data Domain 990 exceeded our high expectations. As customers re-architect their IT infrastructures, they're looking across the entire backup landscape and thinking differently about how backup can be done most effectively, and this is where EMC comes in. Not only do our offerings cover the full range of backup requirements, they integrate it with other technologies in the data center in ways that make a difference to the user. Avamar is a good example of this. Its most recent addition, Avamar 6.1, expanded support for Hyper-V environments and now delivers 3x the backup performance and 30x the recovery performance of its nearest competitor in VMware environments.
Our unified storage offerings, VNX and VNXe, also contributed to our growth in networked storage in Q2. The unified architecture of the VNX Family puts it at the top of the list for customers seeking a storage solution that is simple and efficient as our VNX Family boasts some of the broadest integration among EMC products as well as other vendors' technologies.
The VNX5300 has been certified for Microsoft's FastTrack as well as SAP's HANA platform. VNX has points of integration with Avamar, RecoverPoint and VPLEX. Such integration made a big difference for Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, who use a combination of VNX, Avamar and our Cloud Tiering Appliance to reclaim terabytes of primary storage while avoiding the need for more capacity for file shares and decreasing backup times by 90%.
We continue to enhance the features and functionality of VNX, as evidenced by a number of recent innovations. These include deeper integration with VMware's management suites to provide the most comprehensive performance analysis for VMware environments, as well as an upgrade to the VNX operating environment known as Inyo. Available today for download to existing systems and shipping on new systems soon, Inyo features more efficient storage utilization, automatic rebalancing of data when new drivers are added and added snapshot functionality, enhancing VNX for use cases such as test and dev, point-in-time backups and reporting or the re-purposing of data.
Growth of our high-end storage products rebounded in Q2, with revenue up 3% year-on-year. Undoubtedly, some of this growth was a direct result of the VMAX refresh we announced in May which refreshed our VMAXe and VMAX with the VMAX 10K and VMAX 20K, respectively, and introduced a new ultra-high performance VMAX 40K. By making available several options for our scale-out block offering, customers can more closely match high-end features and functionalities with their specific requirements and resources.
Common across all 3 additions is the new VMAX operating system which is available across all generations of the EMC VMAX family, including all VMAX and VMAXe arrays sold since 2009.
We are pleased with how this transition is progressing. Approximately 1/3 of our new VMAX systems revenue in the quarter was from the 10K, 20K, 40K family. This new release illustrates the increasing importance of software to the storage infrastructure. While the underlying hardware offers different processing and capacity across the 10K, 20K and 40K, depending upon need, a lot of the value to the customer comes from the software.
The new VMAX line utilizes Unisphere, the same user interface as VNX; integrates recover points across the entire VMAX family; offers the ability to extend fast capabilities to other vendors' arrays; and could now apply FAST VP to mainframe and IBM iSeries environments. To ensure customers can extract maximum value from their storage solutions, the VMAX family incorporates options for MLC Flash, as well as 2.5-inch SaaS drives.
All in, we've assembled a best-of-breed portfolio of storage offerings that covers a wide range of customer needs with technology that truly requires no compromise on behalf of our customers. Some of these technologies were recently acquired, some were developed in our labs. Either way, a key value proposition we've developed over the past several years is bringing a wide array of offerings together via common hardware, leveraging generally available and industry standard components. The benefits of this strategy are many: faster time to market, lower cost of goods sold, better quality, lower support costs, great efficiencies from engineering, better leverage of our supply chain and more efficient inventory managements.
On the software side of things, getting to a more holistic view makes customers growing and heterogeneous environments simpler. In addition to VMware integration that is unmatched by any other storage provider, we continue to enhance integration across our products elsewhere to generate more value for our customers. In March, we integrated ProSphere with FAST VP to automatically track the consumption of virtual pools and identify when new capacity will be required. In May, we announced our new DataBridge software. DataBridge mashes up IT operations data, turning silos of disparate compute, storage and network management information into used-case specific views for better visibility across the infrastructure as part of an IT-As-A-Service deployment. Recently, we acquired Watch4net, a leader in IT performance management. Watch4net solution consolidates and analyzes performance in one unified platform across multi-vendor, multi-technology environments and is already tightly integrated with our IT Operations Intelligence Suite.
As you can see through these many examples, our best-of-breed storage products, which are built on common hardware and united by common management interfaces with an ability to integrate with many environments, are central to our strategy. This approach drives our complexity and empowers customers looking for efficiency, control and choice with agility.
The way we've leveraged Flash technology is a great example of how we integrate industry standard components and then build software around it. Once the Flash hardware is strategically placed, the next step is leveraging its functionality with intelligent automated software that operates across the stack. This is the key to delivering value. Not only does this two-part approach results in an optimal cost-benefit outcome for the customer, it also enables us to address a wide variety of use cases in the contemporary data center.
For mixed workloads, customers use a hybrid array, with a small amount of Flash for the hottest data and the rest cost-effectively tiered to high-capacity drives. For situations where 100% of the data is hot, such as VDI or database test and development, customers can use an all-Flash array. Our acquisition of Extreme I/O gives us excellent technology here, as we've seen from the customer access programs that are currently underway.
For market segments that require a persistent data store for performance-intensive workloads such as high-frequency trading and online gaming, we're developing Project Thunder, a server network-attached appliance built entirely of high-speed PCIe Flash. Our early customer access program is underway here as well. And for applications that benefit from Flash in the server, customers use VFCache. VFCache has been embraced by more than 100 customers across industries for the dramatic performance improvements it enables. One of the largest retailers in the U.S. bought VFCache to accelerate the performance of their SQL production environments. The retailer had already doubled performance with FAST VP and can now triple that again by adding VFCache. In total, that's 6x the performance compared to environments before FAST VP and VFCache. We will be significantly expanding the use case potential for VFCache in the second half with the addition of in-line dedupe, support for larger PCIe cards, MLC Flash and support for UCS blade servers.
The value of Flash is resonating with our customers, and in Q2, we shipped a record amount of Flash capacity. Importantly, our Flash solutions work in conjunction with customers' network storage environments, bringing all the performance benefits of Flash without sacrificing the benefits of network storage like data protection and availability. In sum, EMC is developing the most comprehensive Flash portfolio across the industry and will be the only company capable of providing the right Flash solution across a variety of use cases.
The benefits of offering a full portfolio are not limited to storage. We've also been able to gain wallet share and add value to customer relationships with offerings in analytics, security, content management and virtualization.
Greenplum continues to reap the benefits of being in the thick of one of the hottest areas of IT right now. With its very rich Big Data tool sets spanning data science, social collaboration, SQL processing and Hadoop for the enterprise, Greenplum is a truly differentiated player in the space. As a result, we're winning new customers and gaining repeat business as customers add on to their existing analytics implementations. Wins from Q2 came from across verticals and for a variety of reasons. Some are looking to become truly predictive enterprises, some are looking for line-of-business implementation that can get up and running quickly, while others simply want the ability to do ad hoc queries to find the best answer to a specific question about the business. A notable win in the quarter came from the utility customer looking to create insight from the analysis of their customer usage patterns. We're very excited about seizing these fast-growing opportunities.
Like Big Data, security is also enjoying a position near the top of customer priority lists. And RSA is delivering, growing 13% in Q2. Customers understand that with IT security there's no longer a question of whether there will be an attack. Rather, the question in today's advanced threat environment is how quickly and effectively attacks can be thwarted. Because the threat landscape changes rapidly, customer defenses need the, agile, risk-based and contextual solutions that RSA offers. While our products do very well individually, customers are increasingly embracing the value of the integration across them. For example, NetWitness, Archer, enVision and DLP work together to provide controls and visibility functions that are based upon agile, predictive analytics and continuous monitoring of massive and growing amounts of data.
Additionally, there are integrations between RSA's Data Loss Prevention technology and VMWare's vShield, as well as between Archer and EMC's network and storage configuration managers and the vSphere, all enhancements to accelerate customers' journey to the cloud without sacrificing trust.
Revenue from our Information Intelligence Group was down 4% year-on-year. It is encouraging to see license revenue growing at 3% this quarter. We see value here and we're making investments we believe are needed to return IIG to the growth business we know it can be. To that end, we acquired Syncplicity, a cloud-based sync-and-share provider for businesses, and continue to roll out vertical specific offerings such as the Documentum for life science solution suite that was announced in early May.
VMware revenues grew 22% over last year's second quarter as companies continue to expand their virtual infrastructures both in the data center and on the desktop and add management capabilities to virtual infrastructures they've built on VMware. Having become the standard way of running server applications in the cloud era, VMware is very well positioned for its move to the next phase of cloud computing, the software-defined data center. Customers of a software-defined data center can have their own virtual data center with isolated collections of all the compute, storage, networking and security resources they need. VMware's acquisition of Nicira upon closing will expand VMware's software-defined networking portfolio across multiple hypervisors and cloud environments. VMware will continue to work with networking, compute, storage and security ecosystem partners to complement and support their continued innovations. 
Given VMware's strong foundation for future growth, EMC is focusing more resources than ever on VMware integration across our portfolio. This integration plays a major role in many of our wins, and we won a number of multimillion dollar orders in Q2 for virtualized environments, including a school system deploying a Vblock, VDI and Avamar; a large public-sector health organization deploying a Vblock, Data Domain; and a global energy company consolidating 15 arrays on the 2 VMAXes.
To take advantage of the fundamental trends of cloud and Big Data, we've not only made transformational changes to our product portfolio but we've also expanded our customers' options for how they buy IT as well. As a result, our go-to-market model has evolved considerably over the past several years. We've strengthened and expanded our lines of partnerships, invested heavily in our channel relationships, expanded our reseller base and sharpened our services capabilities to help our customers successfully transition to cloud architectures.
One of the greatest differences today compared with just a few years ago is the advent of IT service providers, and this is a trend that we've not only followed but fostered. We teamed up early with several key cloud service providers including CSC, Verizon Terremark, AT&T, Telefonica, Rackspace, Cable & Wireless, Colt, Telstra and many, many others. This early entry allowed us to pioneer this new space together and it's given us a head start on creating the technology solutions necessary to support enterprise cloud services. Some of the essentials we have found included giving our partners tools to support things like policy-based service levels and flexible disaster recovery service modules. The recently announced VMAX SP is an excellent example. As a result, many of these SPs are standardized on EMC's technology for their business class as a service offerings. We continue to see rapid growth from the service provider vertical.
The alliance we announced with Atos in February is an excellent example of how we work with our service provider partners to ensure customers have control, flexibility and choice. Atos' new cloud services company Canopy will provide a one-stop shop for cloud services, offering customers platform-as-a-service as well as a variety of applications available for a Software-as-a-Service model. Both of these are powered by best-of-breed technology from EMC and VMware. And in June, we announced a partnership with Verizon Terremark where they will standardize upon EMC technology for their private and hybrid cloud offerings as well as for public cloud offerings.
These joint collaborations enable EMC and our service partners to deliver dramatic customer value. The number of Software-as-a-Service offerings provided by our 50-plus primary partners increased over 100% from Q1. This rapid ramp reflects the strength of demand for enterprise-class public cloud offerings. As the technology provider to those looking to build their public cloud platforms on proven and trusted architectures, we expect to benefit as the world transitions to hybrid cloud over the next several years.
Our channel program has evolved considerably over the past 1.5 years as we set out to create a partner experience with EMC that's profitable, predictable and simple. The result has been incremental revenue to EMC and our partners alike. In fact, since we began the transformation of our channel program early last year, we've captured over $0.5 billion of revenue from these new partners, many of whom are small bars that used to be beyond our reach.
Vblock has continued to gain traction in enterprise data centers as well as in cloud service providers as demand continues to show very strong growth in Q2. Existing customers continue to expand their Vblock footprint, and VCE is winning new customers at a strong rate. VCE was recently selected to provide the infrastructure for Europe's first education cloud in Northern Ireland, which is a central repository of education materials accessible to 350,000 students and teachers in 1,200 schools. We remain on track to reach the $1 billion run rate for Vblocks.
Finally, we'd like to welcome Praveen Akkiraju, VCE's new CEO who previously was the GM of Cisco's routing technology group.
Our services organization continues to be instrumental in transitioning customers to cloud architectures, transforming IT and virtualizing their mission-critical applications. A greater focus on solution-selling in cooperation with VMware, VCE, RSA and Greenplum has also been beneficial to EMC as well as to our customers. And our focus on customer service has not gone unnoticed as we were honored with 3 TSIA Star Awards for service in excellence in Q2.
When customers think through how they want to build their cloud data centers, some choose to buy best-of-breed products sold separately, typically when the customer has specific requirements and prefers to configure a solution on their own. Some customers seek the ease and efficiency of our reference architecture with some flexibility on the server or networking side, which they can get with VSPEX, and over 400 partners have certified their VSPEX solutions.
Finally, there are situations where the customer know if they want to truly converge infrastructure with best-of-breed products and they want to deploy solutions rapidly as possible. These customers buy Vblocks. Our ability to provide these options gets us into more opportunities and is important to the customer. We're the only company that offers this degree of flexibility and choice.
In sum, our go-to-market model differentiates us from the competition as our approach makes the right tool for the job available to many types of customer in the way that makes the most sense for them. Our focus on the customer, which has guided our strategy for so many years, continues to serve us well, as we saw in our Q2 financial results. While macro headwinds, including the economies in Europe and the euro, increased during the quarter, we still grew the overall business by 10% year-over-year or 12% in constant currency. Within this, North America was up 14%; EMEA was down 1%, though up 5% in constant currency; APJ grew 14%; Latin America was up 2% and up 12% in constant currency; and BRIC plus 13 grew 20% or 24% in constant currency.
Now let's turn to the income statements. A useful way to understand how we achieve our EPS growth is to look at the various puts and takes driving the change in EPS year-on-year. To that end, we're providing a waterfall analysis to show how various income statement items have contributed to the non-GAAP EPS growth we achieved in Q2.
As has been the case for the last several quarters, gross margin improvement was an important factor. This quarter, non-GAAP gross margins were 64.4%, up 210 basis points from last year's Q2. The improvement here was driven primarily by an increase in volume and mix benefit of higher-margin products. As you can see in the waterfall charts, increase in gross margin dollars was the biggest contributor to our EPS growth. Non-GAAP operating margins were a solid 24%, up 90 basis points from Q2 of last year.
Within the operating expense line, SG&A grew a little slower than revenue and R&D grew faster than revenue as we continue to invest in our leading-edge product portfolio. As a result, growth in OpEx partially offset the robust gains from gross profits. Overall, our operating and financial model delivered solid EPS leverage this quarter.
Taking a look at a couple of other items that have a meaningful impact on EPS growth. Our tax rate was 25% compared to 22% in Q2 of 2011. We now expect our tax rate for the full year to be 22%, reflecting a higher mix of revenue and profits in the U.S. This assumes the U.S. R&D tax credit is passed in Q4.
The other important fact this quarter was share counts. In Q2, shares outstanding were about 58 million shares lower than in Q2 '11, a result of settling the first tranche of our converts, as well as share repurchases.
Other expense was $35 million non-GAAP. We've updated our full year guidance for other expense to reflect some gains from strategic investments in Q2. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.39, up 11% from last year.
These results are a great example of the resiliency of our model and the discipline of our execution.
Q2 free cash flow was $958 million, up 36% and $91 million higher than non-GAAP net income for the period. Contributing to this was continued strong growth in deferred revenues, up 30% year-on-year to $7.1 billion. We closed Q2 with $10.9 billion in cash and investments, and of this, $3.7 billion was U.S. cash, excluding VMware. We spent approximately $520 million on acquisitions in the quarter. We returned $260 million of our cash to shareholders via the repurchase of EMC stock in Q2 and we expect to buy $700 million worth of EMC shares in 2012.
Looking forward, we do not expect the economy to get better this year, but we do like how we've positioned the company near term and long term. We believe we have the right strategy in place to leverage the 3 major waves of change in IT: cloud, Big Data and trust. We have leadership positions in many of the key areas enabling these waves. We have a best-of-breed product portfolio with breadth and depth that is unique in the industry. We have a great track record of helping customers and very high customer loyalty and satisfaction. We have a solid operational and financial model that has demonstrated success across cycles. And we're fortunate to have a global EMC team that is second to none.
As a result of these and given our results so far in 2012, we expect to achieve $22 billion of revenues, $1.70 in non-GAAP EPS and $4.9 billion in free cash flow this year.
With that, I'll turn it over to Joe, who will give you more color on the quarter and the great opportunities that lie ahead of us. Joe?"

Thank you very much.I would like to take a moment to publicly congratulate David on his promotion to President and Chief Operating Officer of EMC. The board and I are e",864,"Thanks, David, and a warm welcome to all of you who have joined us for today's call. Thank you very much.
I would like to take a moment to publicly congratulate David on his promotion to President and Chief Operating Officer of EMC. The board and I are extremely confident in David's abilities and the people of EMC are solidly behind him. We know he will do a great job. David, as always, it's a pleasure working with you.
I would also like to sincerely and deeply thank Paul Maritz and Pat Gelsinger for the many, many contributions they have made towards the success of VMware and EMC, respectively, over the past several years and congratulate them as they take on their new roles. I look forward to continue to work closely with both of you also.
Focusing back on our Q2 results and accomplishments, I am pleased with our performance and our execution. We maintained double-digit top line growth, produced leverage on the bottom line and focused on our customer's success and satisfaction. Given the choppy global economic environment, these accomplishments were quite noteworthy. I'd like to congratulate and thank the more than 55,000 people of EMC and VMware around the world who produced these financial results while remaining dedicated to our customers. Well done.
I would now like to comment on what we are seeing in the global economy and its impact on IT spending. On the macro front, pretty much everywhere in the world we are seeing more caution and more scrutiny before any decisions to procure any IT product or service is made. There is an air of uncertainty that permeates the world stage right now. Customers want to ensure that they will get a good return on their investment in a shorter time frame. Despite this macro trend, customers do understand that they need to continue to better drive better productivity through the use of information technology. This helps to assure them a differentiation, a competitive advantage, and helps drive down their overall cost.
Translating all of this into IT spending metrics, we now expect global IT spending growth to be around 3% this year, possibly a tick less. Previously, we believed that 2012 IT spending growth would be in the higher end of the 3% to 4% range. Net-net against this backdrop in Q2, we grew our revenues in the Americas and APJ by 14% year-over-year while our business in EMEA declined 1%. But to give you a little more color, we showed several points of growth in Northern Europe and several points of decline in Southern Europe. And again, we saw our highest growth rates in the rapid-growth economies. Across our BRIC plus 13 countries, we grew approximately 20% in Q2 versus the same period last year.
Looking at our year-over-year growth from a vertical industry perspective. Our business with service providers, media, government and in financial services grew faster than our overall Q2 10% growth rate average while our growth in local government, education and to the service sector was considerably slower. Clearly, we at EMC and VMware are well positioned in markets such as virtualization, storage and security that are growing faster than the IT average and it is equally clear that we are gaining share. Undoubtedly, a key reason for our success is the well-placed strategy and focus we have in cloud computing, Big Data and trust.
But a company cannot rest on its past successes in this extremely fast-paced IT world we live in. And the best strategies, winning strategies: live, breathe, morph and grow. A winning strategy allows one's total addressable market or TAM to expand considerably and, when coupled with crisp execution, leads to profitable growth. In our case, EMC and VMware have enhanced and extended our strategies and have honed our focus on 3 core missions. Strategy one, which is VMware's primary mission, will focus on transforming data center infrastructures into truly automated software-defined data centers with cloud scale and style. Additionally, VMware will continue to have a strategic focus on supporting corporate end users in a multi-device post-PC world.
Strategy 2 will focus on the development community with technology, services and platform support to build out a new generation of cloud and Big Data applications. And strategy 3, which is EMC's primary mission, will focus on transforming the storage market with industry-leading products and services that feature game-changing technologies like FAST part, FAST software and Flash hardware.
And we at EMC will focus on extending our RSA security assets to assure trust in this new cloud and Big Data era. Doing this properly with visionary leadership and solid execution will drive a new wave of opportunity our way. So to that end, we have assigned 3 world-class IT leaders: Pat, Paul and David, respectively. They each lead 1 of these 3 major strategic vectors and each of them has a dedicated, talented team to help assure crisp execution. Getting this right will be critical to our future success, and I can assure you, we are maniacally focused on getting it right.
With that, I will now turn it back to Tony to moderate the Q&A portion of today's call."

So there is a drive in Europe for sure, just like there is here, for productivity. And if we can help customers with their productivity, as I said, gain competitive advantage, help control costs, get more intimate with their customers, they are investing. What they're doing is they're taking longer to invest, that they're being like the good carpenter, they're measuring twice, cutting once. And obviously, they're being -- they're buying just exactly what they need and not buying in excess. So it's not that we're down on Europe by any means, but it is we are feeling the effect. And I think this will be with us for a while. I don't think this is a short-term phenomena.

So there are -- a few factors are going on in mid-tier growth this quarter. First of all, as we said last quarter, we did expect from Q1 to Q2 the growth in mid-tier to come down because of the stronger compare. If you recall, last year it was -- in Q2 was the first full quarter of VNX and there was a fair amount of pent-up demand for that, so that caused a little bit of a reduction in growth rates. Also, a couple of other factors. Europe is actually overweight from a mix point of view towards mid-tier. So a higher percentage of total revenues are in Europe for mid-tier given the nature of that market. And of course with euro -- with Europe being down because of the economy, of course, with the euro effect, that has a slightly bigger impacts on mid-tier than it did on the overall business. A couple of other comments: The channel in mid-tier remains strong, which is important for us. All the key major parts of mid-tier family, the VNX Family, BRS, Isilon, all grew. And then if you look quarter-on-quarter, mid-tier actually grew 3%, which is quite respectable. So when you kind of put all that together, that's really the story on mid-tier. And finally, I think, when the dust settles and you look at our 10% and you look at how others are going to wind up reporting this quarter for that segment of the marketplace, I think we're going to look pretty good."

Ultimately, when it comes down to market share, it's all about math. I mean, you just need to get the math right. And I think there's been a little bit of confusion because of -- comparisons have included organic and inorganic growth, et cetera. The way to look -- the way we look at it is really very simple: We think the right way of looking at growth is, first of all, to kind of not break out individual products but look at the broad market performance of the different businesses. The other thing is to make sure you include a true what we would call apples-to-apples growth rates, so you include all the revenues from acquired companies as if you acquired them in prior periods. And then once you do that, here's how the math works out, it's really quite simple. If we look at NetApps and we look at the last 4 quarters of growth rate, including the guidance for their current quarter, their 4-quarter growth rate average is 4%. If you look at our business -- and by the way, that 4% includes services that have been growing faster than their products. If you look at our business and you just look at the mid-tier product category alone, that same 4-quarter apples-to-apples growth rate is 19%, and if you want to really stretch the case and include Symmetrix and include all of our storage products, it's 12%. So it's either 12% or 19% against 4%. I think that's the math."

So those are the 2 parameters: 3 or a little less IT spending, and euro between where it is now and where it was at quarter end and again understand, relative to our growth rate, where it is now year-on-year, the euro is having about 150 basis points of year-on-year headwind growth on us. So when you kind of compare this year versus last year, you're going to take that into account. So those are the assumptions that go into the guidance that we've given. And then relative to EMC versus VMware outside U.S., I'll let Joe take that one."

And we also said, Toni, that we did much better in the north than we did in the south. So where is it? So if you'll bring that down, where is the real problem? The real problem's in Southern Europe. And why is that a little bit different than VMware? I'd say you can always, on something like storage, push it off a bit. And there was a good question: So how long do you think customers can push it off? It's not forever because, eventually, information is going to grow, you need a place to put it. You need a place for it to live. You need it to be managed. So you can only put that off so long. But I think, on the shorter jam down the -- you can say, ""Look, I'm just going to get a little -- I'm just going to push it a little harder, get a little higher, raise the -- always cause -- get productivity tools and make sure you raise your utilization rates. And that's what we're seeing. So it really is that one spot in the world that's causing our problem."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today.I'm pleased to report that we achieved our 10th consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue and EPS growth in Q2, with revenue up 10%, non-GAAP EPS up 11% and free cash flow up 36%",4198,"Thanks, Tony. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today.
I'm pleased to report that we achieved our 10th consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue and EPS growth in Q2, with revenue up 10%, non-GAAP EPS up 11% and free cash flow up 36%. Our ability to deliver these strong results is linked in large part to our strategy, which is to help companies use cloud technologies and Big Data assets in their trust environments.
In spite of what is clearly an unsettled macro-environment, our solid results this quarter are a testament to the soundness of our strategy, the flexibility of our business model and the ability of our team to execute. As usual, Joe will comment more on the environment and what we're hearing from our customers, but it's pretty clear that things have gotten a bit weaker over the last few months. We all read the same headlines about Europe, concerns about slowing in China and the U.S., tight government spending, et cetera, and these are having an effect.
While not immune to economic pressures, we do believe that important customer priorities such as virtualization, storage and security will continue to grow faster than IT overall. Customers need to continue to drive their businesses forward, improve competitiveness and reduce costs, and these are the areas where they will continue to invest.
This is evidenced in our Information Storage business where we grew 7%. Within this number, our reported storage product revenue growth was 3%. However, this product number includes other storage product revenue, some of which is outside of our strategic storage offerings. The biggest line in this other storage product bucket is third-party products that we resell, and another meaningful element is our consumer products business. In fact, the consumer products business was the biggest drag on this other storage bucket during the quarter due to the planned decline in revenues as we refocused the consumer business on lowering NAS and away from single-drive hardware.
To make things clearer for you, this quarter we're adding a new metric, networked storage platforms, which includes our high-end and mid-tier, to measure progress across our full family of complementary storage products, including scale block, scale file, unified and backup. In today's rapidly changing environment, customers increasingly take advantage of our entire line-up of offerings to accommodate their storage requirements. And as a result, it's helpful to monitor how this product portfolio as a whole performs, and this quarter we continue to perform well. Our networked storage platforms grew 7% year-on-year compared with 9% growth in Q1.
Within networked storage platforms, our mid-tier storage product revenue grew 10% in Q2, the result of year-on-year growth across all of our major mid-tier product lines. One of the hottest areas in storage right now is scale-out NAS. Companies seek solutions that can accommodate the explosive growth of unstructured data and do so simply and at scale. As a result, our scale-out file offering from Isilon continues to thrive as this is an excellent option for customers who are looking for a truly linear scale-out solution especially given the lack of compelling alternatives. Isilon remains well suited for extremely large-scale Big Data needs and, with continued technical innovation and the help of EMC's core sales force, is being deployed in mainstream data centers at some very large customers.
Jaguar Land Rover has standardized upon Isilon to drive their most demanding HPC environments for modeling, simulation and design testing. Hyundai Heavy Industries selected Isilon to support a significant virtualization initiative. And a large Japanese mobile phone service provider recently chose Isilon as the foundation of a mission-critical service for business smartphone users. And while Isilon is already very relevant to the enterprise data center, our OneFS Mavericks operating system, expected to launch later this year, will make it even more so. Mavericks will open new opportunities for large-scale home directory, and that's archiving workloads, and will tightly integrate with VMware, making it an outstanding choice for virtual environments.
Our Backup Recovery Systems business also continued to be a growth engine for EMC in Q2. Demand for our newly launched Data Domain 990 exceeded our high expectations. As customers re-architect their IT infrastructures, they're looking across the entire backup landscape and thinking differently about how backup can be done most effectively, and this is where EMC comes in. Not only do our offerings cover the full range of backup requirements, they integrate it with other technologies in the data center in ways that make a difference to the user. Avamar is a good example of this. Its most recent addition, Avamar 6.1, expanded support for Hyper-V environments and now delivers 3x the backup performance and 30x the recovery performance of its nearest competitor in VMware environments.
Our unified storage offerings, VNX and VNXe, also contributed to our growth in networked storage in Q2. The unified architecture of the VNX Family puts it at the top of the list for customers seeking a storage solution that is simple and efficient as our VNX Family boasts some of the broadest integration among EMC products as well as other vendors' technologies.
The VNX5300 has been certified for Microsoft's FastTrack as well as SAP's HANA platform. VNX has points of integration with Avamar, RecoverPoint and VPLEX. Such integration made a big difference for Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, who use a combination of VNX, Avamar and our Cloud Tiering Appliance to reclaim terabytes of primary storage while avoiding the need for more capacity for file shares and decreasing backup times by 90%.
We continue to enhance the features and functionality of VNX, as evidenced by a number of recent innovations. These include deeper integration with VMware's management suites to provide the most comprehensive performance analysis for VMware environments, as well as an upgrade to the VNX operating environment known as Inyo. Available today for download to existing systems and shipping on new systems soon, Inyo features more efficient storage utilization, automatic rebalancing of data when new drivers are added and added snapshot functionality, enhancing VNX for use cases such as test and dev, point-in-time backups and reporting or the re-purposing of data.
Growth of our high-end storage products rebounded in Q2, with revenue up 3% year-on-year. Undoubtedly, some of this growth was a direct result of the VMAX refresh we announced in May which refreshed our VMAXe and VMAX with the VMAX 10K and VMAX 20K, respectively, and introduced a new ultra-high performance VMAX 40K. By making available several options for our scale-out block offering, customers can more closely match high-end features and functionalities with their specific requirements and resources.
Common across all 3 additions is the new VMAX operating system which is available across all generations of the EMC VMAX family, including all VMAX and VMAXe arrays sold since 2009.
We are pleased with how this transition is progressing. Approximately 1/3 of our new VMAX systems revenue in the quarter was from the 10K, 20K, 40K family. This new release illustrates the increasing importance of software to the storage infrastructure. While the underlying hardware offers different processing and capacity across the 10K, 20K and 40K, depending upon need, a lot of the value to the customer comes from the software.
The new VMAX line utilizes Unisphere, the same user interface as VNX; integrates recover points across the entire VMAX family; offers the ability to extend fast capabilities to other vendors' arrays; and could now apply FAST VP to mainframe and IBM iSeries environments. To ensure customers can extract maximum value from their storage solutions, the VMAX family incorporates options for MLC Flash, as well as 2.5-inch SaaS drives.
All in, we've assembled a best-of-breed portfolio of storage offerings that covers a wide range of customer needs with technology that truly requires no compromise on behalf of our customers. Some of these technologies were recently acquired, some were developed in our labs. Either way, a key value proposition we've developed over the past several years is bringing a wide array of offerings together via common hardware, leveraging generally available and industry standard components. The benefits of this strategy are many: faster time to market, lower cost of goods sold, better quality, lower support costs, great efficiencies from engineering, better leverage of our supply chain and more efficient inventory managements.
On the software side of things, getting to a more holistic view makes customers growing and heterogeneous environments simpler. In addition to VMware integration that is unmatched by any other storage provider, we continue to enhance integration across our products elsewhere to generate more value for our customers. In March, we integrated ProSphere with FAST VP to automatically track the consumption of virtual pools and identify when new capacity will be required. In May, we announced our new DataBridge software. DataBridge mashes up IT operations data, turning silos of disparate compute, storage and network management information into used-case specific views for better visibility across the infrastructure as part of an IT-As-A-Service deployment. Recently, we acquired Watch4net, a leader in IT performance management. Watch4net solution consolidates and analyzes performance in one unified platform across multi-vendor, multi-technology environments and is already tightly integrated with our IT Operations Intelligence Suite.
As you can see through these many examples, our best-of-breed storage products, which are built on common hardware and united by common management interfaces with an ability to integrate with many environments, are central to our strategy. This approach drives our complexity and empowers customers looking for efficiency, control and choice with agility.
The way we've leveraged Flash technology is a great example of how we integrate industry standard components and then build software around it. Once the Flash hardware is strategically placed, the next step is leveraging its functionality with intelligent automated software that operates across the stack. This is the key to delivering value. Not only does this two-part approach results in an optimal cost-benefit outcome for the customer, it also enables us to address a wide variety of use cases in the contemporary data center.
For mixed workloads, customers use a hybrid array, with a small amount of Flash for the hottest data and the rest cost-effectively tiered to high-capacity drives. For situations where 100% of the data is hot, such as VDI or database test and development, customers can use an all-Flash array. Our acquisition of Extreme I/O gives us excellent technology here, as we've seen from the customer access programs that are currently underway.
For market segments that require a persistent data store for performance-intensive workloads such as high-frequency trading and online gaming, we're developing Project Thunder, a server network-attached appliance built entirely of high-speed PCIe Flash. Our early customer access program is underway here as well. And for applications that benefit from Flash in the server, customers use VFCache. VFCache has been embraced by more than 100 customers across industries for the dramatic performance improvements it enables. One of the largest retailers in the U.S. bought VFCache to accelerate the performance of their SQL production environments. The retailer had already doubled performance with FAST VP and can now triple that again by adding VFCache. In total, that's 6x the performance compared to environments before FAST VP and VFCache. We will be significantly expanding the use case potential for VFCache in the second half with the addition of in-line dedupe, support for larger PCIe cards, MLC Flash and support for UCS blade servers.
The value of Flash is resonating with our customers, and in Q2, we shipped a record amount of Flash capacity. Importantly, our Flash solutions work in conjunction with customers' network storage environments, bringing all the performance benefits of Flash without sacrificing the benefits of network storage like data protection and availability. In sum, EMC is developing the most comprehensive Flash portfolio across the industry and will be the only company capable of providing the right Flash solution across a variety of use cases.
The benefits of offering a full portfolio are not limited to storage. We've also been able to gain wallet share and add value to customer relationships with offerings in analytics, security, content management and virtualization.
Greenplum continues to reap the benefits of being in the thick of one of the hottest areas of IT right now. With its very rich Big Data tool sets spanning data science, social collaboration, SQL processing and Hadoop for the enterprise, Greenplum is a truly differentiated player in the space. As a result, we're winning new customers and gaining repeat business as customers add on to their existing analytics implementations. Wins from Q2 came from across verticals and for a variety of reasons. Some are looking to become truly predictive enterprises, some are looking for line-of-business implementation that can get up and running quickly, while others simply want the ability to do ad hoc queries to find the best answer to a specific question about the business. A notable win in the quarter came from the utility customer looking to create insight from the analysis of their customer usage patterns. We're very excited about seizing these fast-growing opportunities.
Like Big Data, security is also enjoying a position near the top of customer priority lists. And RSA is delivering, growing 13% in Q2. Customers understand that with IT security there's no longer a question of whether there will be an attack. Rather, the question in today's advanced threat environment is how quickly and effectively attacks can be thwarted. Because the threat landscape changes rapidly, customer defenses need the, agile, risk-based and contextual solutions that RSA offers. While our products do very well individually, customers are increasingly embracing the value of the integration across them. For example, NetWitness, Archer, enVision and DLP work together to provide controls and visibility functions that are based upon agile, predictive analytics and continuous monitoring of massive and growing amounts of data.
Additionally, there are integrations between RSA's Data Loss Prevention technology and VMWare's vShield, as well as between Archer and EMC's network and storage configuration managers and the vSphere, all enhancements to accelerate customers' journey to the cloud without sacrificing trust.
Revenue from our Information Intelligence Group was down 4% year-on-year. It is encouraging to see license revenue growing at 3% this quarter. We see value here and we're making investments we believe are needed to return IIG to the growth business we know it can be. To that end, we acquired Syncplicity, a cloud-based sync-and-share provider for businesses, and continue to roll out vertical specific offerings such as the Documentum for life science solution suite that was announced in early May.
VMware revenues grew 22% over last year's second quarter as companies continue to expand their virtual infrastructures both in the data center and on the desktop and add management capabilities to virtual infrastructures they've built on VMware. Having become the standard way of running server applications in the cloud era, VMware is very well positioned for its move to the next phase of cloud computing, the software-defined data center. Customers of a software-defined data center can have their own virtual data center with isolated collections of all the compute, storage, networking and security resources they need. VMware's acquisition of Nicira upon closing will expand VMware's software-defined networking portfolio across multiple hypervisors and cloud environments. VMware will continue to work with networking, compute, storage and security ecosystem partners to complement and support their continued innovations. 
Given VMware's strong foundation for future growth, EMC is focusing more resources than ever on VMware integration across our portfolio. This integration plays a major role in many of our wins, and we won a number of multimillion dollar orders in Q2 for virtualized environments, including a school system deploying a Vblock, VDI and Avamar; a large public-sector health organization deploying a Vblock, Data Domain; and a global energy company consolidating 15 arrays on the 2 VMAXes.
To take advantage of the fundamental trends of cloud and Big Data, we've not only made transformational changes to our product portfolio but we've also expanded our customers' options for how they buy IT as well. As a result, our go-to-market model has evolved considerably over the past several years. We've strengthened and expanded our lines of partnerships, invested heavily in our channel relationships, expanded our reseller base and sharpened our services capabilities to help our customers successfully transition to cloud architectures.
One of the greatest differences today compared with just a few years ago is the advent of IT service providers, and this is a trend that we've not only followed but fostered. We teamed up early with several key cloud service providers including CSC, Verizon Terremark, AT&T, Telefonica, Rackspace, Cable & Wireless, Colt, Telstra and many, many others. This early entry allowed us to pioneer this new space together and it's given us a head start on creating the technology solutions necessary to support enterprise cloud services. Some of the essentials we have found included giving our partners tools to support things like policy-based service levels and flexible disaster recovery service modules. The recently announced VMAX SP is an excellent example. As a result, many of these SPs are standardized on EMC's technology for their business class as a service offerings. We continue to see rapid growth from the service provider vertical.
The alliance we announced with Atos in February is an excellent example of how we work with our service provider partners to ensure customers have control, flexibility and choice. Atos' new cloud services company Canopy will provide a one-stop shop for cloud services, offering customers platform-as-a-service as well as a variety of applications available for a Software-as-a-Service model. Both of these are powered by best-of-breed technology from EMC and VMware. And in June, we announced a partnership with Verizon Terremark where they will standardize upon EMC technology for their private and hybrid cloud offerings as well as for public cloud offerings.
These joint collaborations enable EMC and our service partners to deliver dramatic customer value. The number of Software-as-a-Service offerings provided by our 50-plus primary partners increased over 100% from Q1. This rapid ramp reflects the strength of demand for enterprise-class public cloud offerings. As the technology provider to those looking to build their public cloud platforms on proven and trusted architectures, we expect to benefit as the world transitions to hybrid cloud over the next several years.
Our channel program has evolved considerably over the past 1.5 years as we set out to create a partner experience with EMC that's profitable, predictable and simple. The result has been incremental revenue to EMC and our partners alike. In fact, since we began the transformation of our channel program early last year, we've captured over $0.5 billion of revenue from these new partners, many of whom are small bars that used to be beyond our reach.
Vblock has continued to gain traction in enterprise data centers as well as in cloud service providers as demand continues to show very strong growth in Q2. Existing customers continue to expand their Vblock footprint, and VCE is winning new customers at a strong rate. VCE was recently selected to provide the infrastructure for Europe's first education cloud in Northern Ireland, which is a central repository of education materials accessible to 350,000 students and teachers in 1,200 schools. We remain on track to reach the $1 billion run rate for Vblocks.
Finally, we'd like to welcome Praveen Akkiraju, VCE's new CEO who previously was the GM of Cisco's routing technology group.
Our services organization continues to be instrumental in transitioning customers to cloud architectures, transforming IT and virtualizing their mission-critical applications. A greater focus on solution-selling in cooperation with VMware, VCE, RSA and Greenplum has also been beneficial to EMC as well as to our customers. And our focus on customer service has not gone unnoticed as we were honored with 3 TSIA Star Awards for service in excellence in Q2.
When customers think through how they want to build their cloud data centers, some choose to buy best-of-breed products sold separately, typically when the customer has specific requirements and prefers to configure a solution on their own. Some customers seek the ease and efficiency of our reference architecture with some flexibility on the server or networking side, which they can get with VSPEX, and over 400 partners have certified their VSPEX solutions.
Finally, there are situations where the customer know if they want to truly converge infrastructure with best-of-breed products and they want to deploy solutions rapidly as possible. These customers buy Vblocks. Our ability to provide these options gets us into more opportunities and is important to the customer. We're the only company that offers this degree of flexibility and choice.
In sum, our go-to-market model differentiates us from the competition as our approach makes the right tool for the job available to many types of customer in the way that makes the most sense for them. Our focus on the customer, which has guided our strategy for so many years, continues to serve us well, as we saw in our Q2 financial results. While macro headwinds, including the economies in Europe and the euro, increased during the quarter, we still grew the overall business by 10% year-over-year or 12% in constant currency. Within this, North America was up 14%; EMEA was down 1%, though up 5% in constant currency; APJ grew 14%; Latin America was up 2% and up 12% in constant currency; and BRIC plus 13 grew 20% or 24% in constant currency.
Now let's turn to the income statements. A useful way to understand how we achieve our EPS growth is to look at the various puts and takes driving the change in EPS year-on-year. To that end, we're providing a waterfall analysis to show how various income statement items have contributed to the non-GAAP EPS growth we achieved in Q2.
As has been the case for the last several quarters, gross margin improvement was an important factor. This quarter, non-GAAP gross margins were 64.4%, up 210 basis points from last year's Q2. The improvement here was driven primarily by an increase in volume and mix benefit of higher-margin products. As you can see in the waterfall charts, increase in gross margin dollars was the biggest contributor to our EPS growth. Non-GAAP operating margins were a solid 24%, up 90 basis points from Q2 of last year.
Within the operating expense line, SG&A grew a little slower than revenue and R&D grew faster than revenue as we continue to invest in our leading-edge product portfolio. As a result, growth in OpEx partially offset the robust gains from gross profits. Overall, our operating and financial model delivered solid EPS leverage this quarter.
Taking a look at a couple of other items that have a meaningful impact on EPS growth. Our tax rate was 25% compared to 22% in Q2 of 2011. We now expect our tax rate for the full year to be 22%, reflecting a higher mix of revenue and profits in the U.S. This assumes the U.S. R&D tax credit is passed in Q4.
The other important fact this quarter was share counts. In Q2, shares outstanding were about 58 million shares lower than in Q2 '11, a result of settling the first tranche of our converts, as well as share repurchases.
Other expense was $35 million non-GAAP. We've updated our full year guidance for other expense to reflect some gains from strategic investments in Q2. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.39, up 11% from last year.
These results are a great example of the resiliency of our model and the discipline of our execution.
Q2 free cash flow was $958 million, up 36% and $91 million higher than non-GAAP net income for the period. Contributing to this was continued strong growth in deferred revenues, up 30% year-on-year to $7.1 billion. We closed Q2 with $10.9 billion in cash and investments, and of this, $3.7 billion was U.S. cash, excluding VMware. We spent approximately $520 million on acquisitions in the quarter. We returned $260 million of our cash to shareholders via the repurchase of EMC stock in Q2 and we expect to buy $700 million worth of EMC shares in 2012.
Looking forward, we do not expect the economy to get better this year, but we do like how we've positioned the company near term and long term. We believe we have the right strategy in place to leverage the 3 major waves of change in IT: cloud, Big Data and trust. We have leadership positions in many of the key areas enabling these waves. We have a best-of-breed product portfolio with breadth and depth that is unique in the industry. We have a great track record of helping customers and very high customer loyalty and satisfaction. We have a solid operational and financial model that has demonstrated success across cycles. And we're fortunate to have a global EMC team that is second to none.
As a result of these and given our results so far in 2012, we expect to achieve $22 billion of revenues, $1.70 in non-GAAP EPS and $4.9 billion in free cash flow this year.
With that, I'll turn it over to Joe, who will give you more color on the quarter and the great opportunities that lie ahead of us. Joe?"

I would like to take a moment to publicly congratulate David on his promotion to President and Chief Operating Officer of EMC. The board and I are extremely confident in David's abilities and the people of EMC are solidly behind him. We know he will do a great job. David, as always, it's a pleasure working with you.
I would also like to sincerely and deeply thank Paul Maritz and Pat Gelsinger for the many, many contributions they have made towards the success of VMware and EMC, respectively, over the past several years and congratulate them as they take on their new roles. I look forward to continue to work closely with both of you also.
Focusing back on our Q2 results and accomplishments, I am pleased with our performance and our execution. We maintained double-digit top line growth, produced leverage on the bottom line and focused on our customer's success and satisfaction. Given the choppy global economic environment, these accomplishments were quite noteworthy. I'd like to congratulate and thank the more than 55,000 people of EMC and VMware around the world who produced these financial results while remaining dedicated to our customers. Well done.
I would now like to comment on what we are seeing in the global economy and its impact on IT spending. On the macro front, pretty much everywhere in the world we are seeing more caution and more scrutiny before any decisions to procure any IT product or service is made. There is an air of uncertainty that permeates the world stage right now. Customers want to ensure that they will get a good return on their investment in a shorter time frame. Despite this macro trend, customers do understand that they need to continue to better drive better productivity through the use of information technology. This helps to assure them a differentiation, a competitive advantage, and helps drive down their overall cost.
Translating all of this into IT spending metrics, we now expect global IT spending growth to be around 3% this year, possibly a tick less. Previously, we believed that 2012 IT spending growth would be in the higher end of the 3% to 4% range. Net-net against this backdrop in Q2, we grew our revenues in the Americas and APJ by 14% year-over-year while our business in EMEA declined 1%. But to give you a little more color, we showed several points of growth in Northern Europe and several points of decline in Southern Europe. And again, we saw our highest growth rates in the rapid-growth economies. Across our BRIC plus 13 countries, we grew approximately 20% in Q2 versus the same period last year.
Looking at our year-over-year growth from a vertical industry perspective. Our business with service providers, media, government and in financial services grew faster than our overall Q2 10% growth rate average while our growth in local government, education and to the service sector was considerably slower. Clearly, we at EMC and VMware are well positioned in markets such as virtualization, storage and security that are growing faster than the IT average and it is equally clear that we are gaining share. Undoubtedly, a key reason for our success is the well-placed strategy and focus we have in cloud computing, Big Data and trust.
But a company cannot rest on its past successes in this extremely fast-paced IT world we live in. And the best strategies, winning strategies: live, breathe, morph and grow. A winning strategy allows one's total addressable market or TAM to expand considerably and, when coupled with crisp execution, leads to profitable growth. In our case, EMC and VMware have enhanced and extended our strategies and have honed our focus on 3 core missions. Strategy one, which is VMware's primary mission, will focus on transforming data center infrastructures into truly automated software-defined data centers with cloud scale and style. Additionally, VMware will continue to have a strategic focus on supporting corporate end users in a multi-device post-PC world.
Strategy two will focus on the development community with technology, services and platform support to build out a new generation of cloud and Big Data applications. And strategy three, which is EMC's primary mission, will focus on transforming the storage market with industry-leading products and services that feature game-changing technologies like FAST part, FAST software and Flash hardware.
And we at EMC will focus on extending our RSA security assets to assure trust in this new cloud and Big Data era. Doing this properly with visionary leadership and solid execution will drive a new wave of opportunity our way. So to that end, we have assigned 3 world-class IT leaders: Pat, Paul and David, respectively. They each lead 1 of these 3 major strategic vectors and each of them has a dedicated, talented team to help assure crisp execution. Getting this right will be critical to our future success, and I can assure you, we are maniacally focused on getting it right.
With that, I will now turn it back to Tony to moderate the Q&A portion of today's call."

So a lot of it -- a lot of the headwinds in Europe is currency, and from the news today it looks like that's continuing. So there is a drive in Europe for sure, just like there is here, for productivity. And if we can help customers with their productivity, as I said, gain competitive advantage, help control costs, get more intimate with their customers, they are investing. What they're doing is they're taking longer to invest, that they're being like the good carpenter, they're measuring twice, cutting once. And obviously, they're being -- they're buying just exactly what they need and not buying in excess. So it's not that we're down on Europe by any means, but it is we are feeling the effect. And I think this will be with us for a while. I don't think this is a short-term phenomena.

So there are -- a few factors are going on in mid-tier growth this quarter. First of all, as we said last quarter, we did expect from Q1 to Q2 the growth in mid-tier to come down because of the stronger compare. If you recall, last year it was -- in Q2 was the first full quarter of VNX and there was a fair amount of pent-up demand for that, so that caused a little bit of a reduction in growth rates. Also, a couple of other factors. Europe is actually overweight from a mix point of view towards mid-tier. So a higher percentage of total revenues are in Europe for mid-tier given the nature of that market. And of course with euro -- with Europe being down because of the economy, of course, with the euro effect, that has a slightly bigger impacts on mid-tier than it did on the overall business. A couple of other comments: The channel in mid-tier remains strong, which is important for us. All the key major parts of mid-tier family, the VNX Family, BRS, Isilon, all grew. And then if you look quarter-on-quarter, mid-tier actually grew 3%, which is quite respectable. So when you kind of put all that together, that's really the story on mid-tier. And finally, I think, when the dust settles and you look at our 10% and you look at how others are going to wind up reporting this quarter for that segment of the marketplace, I think we're going to look pretty good."

Ultimately, when it comes down to market share, it's all about math. I mean, you just need to get the math right. And I think there's been a little bit of confusion because of -- comparisons have included organic and inorganic growth, et cetera. The way to look -- the way we look at it is really very simple: We think the right way of looking at growth is, first of all, to kind of not break out individual products but look at the broad market performance of the different businesses. The other thing is to make sure you include a true what we would call apples-to-apples growth rates, so you include all the revenues from acquired companies as if you acquired them in prior periods. And then once you do that, here's how the math works out, it's really quite simple. If we look at NetApps and we look at the last 4 quarters of growth rate, including the guidance for their current quarter, their 4-quarter growth rate average is 4%. If you look at our business -- and by the way, that 4% includes services that have been growing faster than their products. If you look at our business and you just look at the mid-tier product category alone, that same 4-quarter apples-to-apples growth rate is 19%, and if you want to really stretch the case and include Symmetrix and include all of our storage products, it's 12%.

So we're getting out of the gate a little bit faster. I think that next quarter we'll probably get closer to 50%. So we've always said it takes between 2 and 3 quarters to get to a 50% transition on a new family. It looks like, in this case, we'll be there a little sooner. And relative to the macro, nothing really to add. As Joe said, it's impacting everybody, but we've been executing well against that so I don't think that particularly is a dynamic against the VMAX transition rate."

There's 4 things that are important when you consider storage. One is, what performance do you need for that information? And again, that's going to change over time, so the performance you need for an -- for that particular piece of information today might be less than the future usually is: the persistency of that information, the longevity of that information and how much you want to share that information. The answer to those questions tells you where to place your storage and what type of storage to use. We have software that seamlessly and agilely moves and fits that information across these storage types and medias that I just mentioned. And again, this is the key to when you talk about a software-defined data center. That's what you want to have happened. So it's not a ""one size fits all"" world, that's kind of yesterday's paradigm. The cloud paradigm is basically saying, what does the application need? What does it need to meet my SLAs? What does it need to meet my policies? And then, what type of device am I going to select, okay, what type of media? And then, where am I going to place that media? So I could take the storage and I could put it on a PCI card and put it right into the server. I can put it on the server side of the network, in a project like we have, like Thunder. We can put it, of course, in arrays and we can put both Flash -- memory Flash and storage -- spinning storage devices, media devices, in those arrays. And that's where we're playing. And we're all automating it through our FAST technology, and that's basically going to be root. I talked about one of the roots of the software-defined data center: How do you do that automatically? That's where we're spending our money. So it's -- that's the way we're playing the game, and a lot of the other stuff is just the bunk."

At the euro, when we put our numbers together -- first of all, let's just talk about the euro for a second and the impact that's having upon our business. If we look at Q2 quarter, Q2 year-end growth rates, it's about $250 million headwind year-on-year. And about $0.03 is the impact of the euro this year versus last year. Current spot rates, that includes -- then it goes up to like $280 million, $290 million on year-on-year impact and still about $0.03. And euro, at the level of where it was at quarter end and where it is now in that range, is consistent with our thinking about guidance. So those are the 2 parameters: 3 or a little less IT spending, and euro between where it is now and where it was at quarter end and again understand, relative to our growth rate, where it is now year-on-year, the euro is having about 150 basis points of year-on-year headwind growth on us.

And why is that a little bit different than VMware? I'd say you can always, on something like storage, push it off a bit. And there was a good question: So how long do you think customers can push it off? It's not forever because, eventually, information is going to grow, you need a place to put it. You need a place for it to live. You need it to be managed. So you can only put that off so long.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today.

This morning, we reported continued growth in revenue and earnings per share in Q3, with revenue up 6% and non-GAAP EPS up 8% over last year's Q3. Free cash flow grew 16% year-on-year. 
The environment in Q3 turned out to be more cautious than we had expected. There were several issues weighing on customers' minds, including uncertain global economic growth and the U.S. presidential election. The macro challenges translated into more spending scrutiny, longer deal cycles, additional approval requirements and the resulting delay in IT deals. While the macro factors caused EMC's growth to be less than expected, I'm pleased that we did show growth in this challenging environment and the tech industry results are reported, I believe EMC will be one of the stronger big companies and that we certainly gained share. 
We also showed EPS leverage and achieved a number of Q3 quarterly records, including record revenues, record non-GAAP operating income and record non-GAAP EPS. In the face of such headwinds, I believe that our strategy, balanced portfolio, operational model and ability to execute or paying off near term and positioning us well for the long term. 
While we need to navigate the short-term economic challenges, the longer-term secular changes offer an opportunity to be really successful. The shift to cloud, Big Data and trusted IT bode well for us as we've been at the forefront of these for some time. These trends are in full force because they enable companies to capture a better return on dollars invested in IT than ever before. Cloud architectures make the infrastructure more agile and efficient, whilst Big Data enables new insights that could help grow the top line, and all this must be done in a trusted way. At EMC, we understand the company that can best deliver this ROI wins and we continue to invest to make this happen. The result is innovative, practical, customer-focused additions to our product lines. 
And during times when spending is tight, our focus on high priority areas of the data center like virtualization, security and storage serve us well. Customers needing to be extra cautious about where they spend their budgets, first, direct their dollars to high-impact areas and most cost-efficient technology in those areas, in other words, to best-of-breed offerings like our own. 
The drive for greater efficiency in business value from IT extends beyond economic cycles and is gaining momentum as more customers shift more of their spending towards cloud architectures, private clouds, public clouds and hybrid clouds. When a cloud infrastructure means leveraging pools of network and storage and server resources, they are dynamically allocated to new and existing applications based on demand. This is not easy. And as a result, most companies building clouds, either private or public, have needed the full set of resources nor the IP to build these architectures themselves. A few do, but the rest seek an infrastructure that can get them there without having to compromise on important enterprise product features. These include capabilities like replication to ensure data availability and business continuity, efficiency features like tiering, deduplication compression, backup with best-in-class recovery points and recovery objectives, securities agile and risk-based and virtualization, a key component for achieving the control, efficiency and choice clouds can deliver. 
Our approach to using our own ancillary developed software integrated with industry-standard hardware has been tested and tuned, enabled us to deliver value to a customer that we believe is unparalleled amongst our peers. This formula is in lockstep with the transition to hybrid cloud and to keep us at the forefront of data center infrastructure. 
While we saw somewhat slower growth across the board due to the economy in Q3, we believe we are better positioned than our competitors to deliver value to our customers. As companies look to invest in the data center technologies that will support hybrid cloud architectures, they prefer storage solutions that will be optimized for the task at hand. We saw evidence of this in Q3 as our portfolio of complementary network storage platform parts was up 2% over last year's Q3. Having different storage functionality for different application and workload needs is an important part of our strategy, and we work diligently to create a full complement of scale-out block, scale-out NAS, unified and backup solutions. Companies in all sectors of all sizes and all sorts of IT challenges can look to us for a solution, which in many cases, in several different storage technologies with the same customer. While demand for there's technology may ebb and flow quarter-to-quarter, this broad portfolio enables us to sustain engage with customers as we work to solve their problems and it helps to drive our business over time. 
Our high-end storage products grew 5% over Q3 of last year. Our Symmetrix scale-up block solution had its first full quarter of availability for the refresh family of VMAX 10K, 20K and 40K and customers are embracing it. The new software functionality leverages the powerful standards-based hardware to deliver high-end reliability, availability and serviceability via an easy-to-use Unisphere interface. The transition to the new family continues to ramp well and we expect it to be essentially complete by year end. 
Our mid-tier storage, comprised of our scale-out file, unified and backup solutions, was flat year-over-year for Q3 and up over 10% year-to-date. This quarter, results were driven by the Isilon scale-out NAS business. Isilon continues to do well in its traditional area of strength such as media and life sciences whilst expanding its presence in more traditional enterprise environments. The upcoming new Isilon OneFS operating system, Mavericks, which is on track to ship before year end is designed to drive Isilon into new verticals and expanded use cases. 
For unified block and file environment customers continue to rely on the simple and efficient architecture of our VNX Family. Revenue in Q3 was down in the mid-single digits year-on-year. Given the environment, demand for the family was pretty good. However, due to the later-than-expected timing of some channel-related orders, we couldn't ship these orders in Q3 and had to move them to Q4. Well, what was encouraging, though, is that overall growth to our channel partners continued, driven in part by the popularity of VSPEX. In addition, our recently announced partnership with Lenovo will provide an incremental channel for the VNX Family over time, starting in China. 
Our purpose-built backup appliances, Avamar grew in Q3. It's worth noting that this business had a tough compare year-on-year and also suffered a bit from some delayed procured decisions by customers. While a pushout of these orders has an impact in Q3, we will really close several of these deals early in Q4. Customers need comprehensive and need backup solutions as part of the next generation data centers. A good example of how important the full backup portfolio is for a customer is Ocean Health System, which has gone tapers in combination with Avamar, Data Domain, Networker, Data Protection advisor and Disk Library for mainframe backup  a storing environment which is based on VMAX and VPLEX. 
This strategic value having a strong Information Storage portfolio is clear, as we see customers adopting a broad range of EMC solutions to optimize the application environments. In Q3, we won a deal with the government administration that needed to accommodate 80 terabytes of EM storage and 850 terabytes of scientific data, a combination of VNX with 6 terabytes of Flash capacity and Isilon provide the best value of the most efficient scalable and easy to manage solution. 
We closed another deal in Q3 with a large health care company. We're having the full portfolio storage solutions made the difference to the customer. This company needed a solid storage infrastructure to roll out several applications and 2013. However, they're all referring infrastructure storage left of the room to grow their backup solution with severe lacking. A combination of VNX, Data Domain, Isilon and recovery point handily beat the storage technology proposed by the incumbent server vendor. 
One of our more rewarding customer wins illustrates the full value of the portfolio was with cancer research U.K. With the combination of VFCache, VNX with Flash drives, vSphere, Data Domain and Networker, cancer research U.K. increased performance, improved efficiency and improve their disaster recovery capabilities. This example demonstrates the value Flash can have across the infrastructure and we've made Flash everywhere a  channel about data center strategy. 
We first introduced SSDs on storage rates back in 2008. We followed soon after that with the introduction of FAST software to also make the placement of data on to Flash, the hot data and to the different types of disk for Oracle data. And now 4 years after that introduction, these hybrid arrays have become the norm. Over 1/2 our arrays now shift with Flash drives and our FAST software. These intelligent, tiered network storage arrays provide a rich set of data services for data management, data efficiency and data availability. These intelligent arrays enable customers to derive more value, better performance, higher application availability and a low total cost of ownership from their storage infrastructure than ever before. 
We extended our Flash capabilities with these developments of VFCache, which is focused on turbocharging existing line of business applications interjection with storage arrays. In the case of cancer research U.K., adding VFCache to their Oracle CRM application allow them to reduce database query time by a factor of 6 and increase throughput by a factor of 3, allowing to complete 4 fundraising campaigns in the time it used to take them to complete 1. 
We continue to innovate here as recent enhancements to VFCache demonstrates. The addition to VFCache we introduced last quarter include cash deduplication for server Flash, the first in the industry; interoperability between VFCache and vMotion; enhanced integration with VMAX; an expanded capacity VFCache PCIe cards, as well as multiple PCIe cards per server, the larger cash sets and greater performance. 
While VFCache is a focused cash used case for server-based Flash, it provides impressive intangible performance benefits for customers' enterprise applications and the number of VFCache customers approximately doubled last quarter. There is much more to come as we continue to roll out our Flash everywhere strategy. And as we've previously stated next year, we expect to bring to market new technologies. We plan to broaden our focus on server-based Flash by introducing best-in-class, capacity and cost-optimized PCIe attached Dass for performance intensive applications that don't require storage data services. 
We'll introduce Project Thunder, an all Flash storage appliance that attaches to the server network and allows the sharing of Flash resources across multiple of these performance-intensive applications. Project Thunder leverages the same software we're developing for VFCache. 
We also introduced Project x, our innovative, all Flash scale-out storage array designed to offer the full data services of a storage array and the sub millisecond performance provided by Flash. This is ideal for applications where 100% of the data is hot or where the data is highly dedupable such as DDI or database demo environments. 
The customer access programs coming Flash technology is going very, very well and generating a lot of interest and excitement. Across all our Flash products, the magic that brings Flash to life is our software. A great example of this is FAST which automates the migration of data across tiered storage based on patterns of use, both within a hybrid array and even across the interconnect to the server tier. FAST is so efficient that in some cases, 1% to 2% of the total capacity in Flash with a hybrid array can process over 1/2 the -- of the entire array. 
Our foundational play in Big Data, Greenplum, continues to help customers exploit the growing potential of Big Data analytics. Wins in Q3 included deployments of web analytics for a large government organization, website analytics for one of the largest retailers in the U.S. and one of the largest mobile telecoms in the U.S., a large-scale implementation to decrease cost of data transformations in building analytics. In this case, the customer was able to displace the incumbent data warehouse it was using for ETL with a far less expensive Hadoop produced framework on Greenplum. 
Longtime EMC customers are also eager to capitalize on the data that they own as a large win with a global financial services company attests. As part of the purchase that also included Vblock, VNX, SourceOne and, this customer selected Greenplum for analytics of their e-mail. Greenplum continues to grow at strong double-digit rates. 
We're excited to have Paul Murry spending a lot more of this time on our Big Data and next generation application initiatives and look forward to expanding these initiatives in ways that will enable customers to take the full advantage of the potential Big Data offers. 
Like Big Data, security is also an area of focus with customers. As pro rata-based approaches to secure become increasingly ineffective, customers are seeking new technologies that can help them better understand risk and defend against today's advanced threats. RSA continues to benefit as a result, with revenue up 6% year-on-year in Q3. Revenue from our security management compliance business grew over 30%. The ability to manage risk and defend against advanced threats and inside the network is an extremely hot area right now. Our SMC business provides the security analytics and GOC solutions to stress the challenges were just about every organization it's phasing. 
Our Identity and Data Protection business was impacted by 2 factors, specific to our secure IT business. The slowdown in overall hiring and employment, especially in Europe and Asia, was a stronger headwind than we expected, while last year's remediation of tokens disruptive than normal renewal cycle more than we expected. A cycle of product introductions expected in early 2013 will enable us to deliver new form factors of authentication and better address the authentication needs for mobile and cloud computing. Customer movements towards risk-based approaches and to security deliver as a service present great potential for our IDP business. We are more confident on average in our security strategy which is centered in agile solutions to combat emerging threats is the right one. 
Revenue from our information intelligence group was down 2% in Q3. License revenue continue to grow sequentially. Energy is innovating, creating solutions that are easy to deploy, easy-to-use and highly aligned with customers' needs. We've been leveraging the services expertise developed in specific verticals to create Content Management payable solutions tailored to industry-specific requirements. A recent example is our integrated patient record solutions, which enables health care organizations to access shared and transform this group of patient data regardless of format or location and, importantly, lower costs in doing so. Our software developed especially for engineering plants and facilities management is also gaining traction. 
VMware revenue grew 20% over last year's third quarter as companies continue to expand their virtual infrastructures to reduce the overall cost of their IT infrastructures and to put them on the path to cloud computing. We continue to enhance our integration with VMware and this is making a difference with customers. As you can see here, the percentage of customer survey who preferred EMC further to virtualization environment has increased significantly in just the past 6 months. This will continue to be important as VMware moves in the direction of the software-defined data center, which is emerging as the clear path to cloud computing. While software-defined data center enables the dynamic creation of virtual infrastructure to leverage the underlying physical infrastructure, continued innovation in the infrastructure elements is essential in order to realize the full potential of a software-defined data center. We're excited to work towards reducing IT's complexity and costs via the automation, the software-defined data center enables. 
Our go-to-market model continues to evolve as customers' options to how to leverage IT expand. We offer 3 avenues to get our customers to hybrid cloud: best-of-breed infrastructure components, proven infrastructure through VSPEX and converged infrastructure with Vblocks. Our services organization uses all 3 of these approaches as they continue to transition customers to cloud architectures. While customers deferred some discretionary consulting projects last quarter and revenue from implementation of services was impacted by a lack of storage product revenue, our services team continues to demonstrate its value to EMC's business a strategy. 
Among the major EMC service wins achieved in Q3 was a 5-year enterprisewide IT and consolidation initiative based on Vblock, VMAX, VNX, Data Domain and Avamar. This win at a global pharmaceutical company, completely displaced an incumbent server vendor and storage vendors with solutions from EMC and VCE and qualifies one of the largest professional services deals ever. 
Our channel partners are also leveraging all 3 paths to the cloud and VSPEX is becoming especially popular. With a variety of configurations through our partners to accommodate customer preferences, including technology from Citrix, Microsoft, HP, Cisco, Brocade and VMware, VSPEX has a lot of freedom to create solutions they need and provide a lot of value for their end-user customers. In its first full quarter of availability since launching VSPEX in April, partners have sold well over 300  VSPEX systems, and because VSPEX solutions are simple, particularly profitable, we expect that number to continue to ramp. 
We have made enormous progress in truly teaming with our channel partners, and as a result, our channel program continues to earn accolades. In Q3, EMC was named a rising star by the global tech distribution counsel and we won 4 company of the year awards by CRN. With continued partner centered innovation like the Q3 enablement of the loss of distribution partners is to assemble VSPEX to resellers, we expect remain at favorable our partners. 
Our service provider program is an important part of our strategy to get customers to public cloud, and we continue to make progress here with the revenue from service provider program partners up over 40% from Q3 of last year. In Q3, CSC extended their well-established EMC powered business cloud offering into new vertical. Terremark, a Verizon company, completed their first EMC powered public cloud offerings on Vblocks. Telstra expanded their cloud services in the quarter on EMC infrastructure and Rackspace recently extended its global relationship with us to include Australia and New Zealand markets. EMC is the only external storage platform offered in Rackspace's new Sydney data center as Rackspace continues to make considerable investments in our storage technology. Our family of storage products from Atmos through to VMAX resonates with service providers as it enables them to offer a full range of service levels to their customers with EMC as their infrastructure partner with deep technology and support capabilities. 
Finally, accelerating customers' journey to the cloud is the aim of our joint venture VCE. VCE continues to do very well with the demand up approximately 30% year-on-year and approximately 20% quarter-on-quarter. This was obviously helpful to our year-on-year growth in Q3 as revenue from our components of every Vblock sold increases our storage and virtualization revenue. Vblocks continue to gain traction both in enterprise data centers as well as in service providers and we saw this in Q3. A U.S.-based chemical company purchased 4 Vblocks as part of a solution that also included Data Domain, Avamar and Atmos. A European insurance company purchased a Vblock alongside several VNXs. And a large construction equipment maker purchased Vblock with Data Domain and Avamar for Data Protection. Among service providers, CSC continues to expand our buildout of Vblocks, to power their public and private cloud businesses. Additionally, the second largest telco in Japan, SOFTBANK, will standardize on Vblock for their cloud-based offerings. SOFTBANK is already using Vblock systems for internal IT operations. In fact, 10 out of the top 15 global telcos are now Vblock customers. 
In sum, our go-to-market model enables us and our partners to make the right tool for the job available to many types of customer in the way that makes most sense for them. 
Our Q3 financial results was supported by our strong competitive position. While macro headwinds increased during the quarter, we still grew the overall business by 6% year-on-year. Within this, North America grew 9%, EMEA was flat, APJ grew 5% and Latin America grew 19%. Currency negatively impacted year-on-year revenue growth by about 150 basis points in Q3. 
Now let's turn to the income statement. We've once again put together a waterfall analysis to show how various income statement items contributed to the non-GAAP EPS growth we achieved in Q3 this year compared to Q3 of 2011. Gross margin continues to be an important factor. This quarter, non-GAAP gross margins were 64.1%, up 110 basis points from last year's Q3. The improvement here was driven by the increase in revenue mix and margin rate from VMware. As you can see in the waterfall chart, increase in gross margin dollars was the biggest contributor to our EPS growth. 
Non-GAAP operating margins were 24.3%, up 30 basis points from Q3 of last year. Within the operating expense line, SG&A expenses grew more slowly than revenue as we were careful with expense growth in the quarter. R&D grew faster than revenue as we continue to invest in our leading-edge product portfolio. So investment in OpEx offset much of the gains we achieved from gross profits. 
Two of our items had a meaningful impact on EPS growth but effectively offset each other. Nonoperating expense was $54 million non-GAAP, down approximately $16 million from last year's Q3. And our tax rate was 23.5%, up from 22% in Q3 of 2011. We now expect our tax rate for the full year to be 22.5%, reflecting a higher mix of profits in the U.S. This assumes the U.S. R&E tax credit is passed in Q4. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.40, up 8% from last year, 2 points higher than revenue growth. Free cash flow was a solid $1.1 billion up 16% and about $250 million higher than non-GAAP net income for Q3. Contributing to this was growth in deferred revenue, up 26% year-on-year to $7.2 billion. Deferred revenue has become an increasingly important part of the financial picture for us, improving visibility and predictability of at least a portion of our revenue stream and enhancing cash flows. 
Along with our ability to consistently generate strong cash flow comes a responsibility of allocating that capital wisely. We continue to make investments to keep us well positioned for the longer term while maintaining financial flexibility and returning cash to shareholders. Along those lines, we closed Q3 with $10.6 billion in cash and investments. Of this, $4 billion was U.S. cash, excluding VMware. We spent approximately $1.3 billion in the quarter on acquisitions that will greatly enhance our ability to make hybrid cloud a reality for our customers. We returned $150 million of our cash to shareholders via the purchase of EMC stock in Q3 and we continue to expect to buy back $700 million worth of EMC shares in 2012. We see this balanced allocation of capital as the correct formula right now given the opportunity we have ahead of us. However, we revisit it often and we will revise it accordingly when the time is right. 
Looking forward, we do not expect the economy to get better this year, but we do like how we position the company near term and long term. We have a strategy that's built to leverage the 3 major ways to change in IT: cloud, Big Data and trust, and we have what it takes to execute on this strategy, with leadership positions in storage, virtualization and security, a best-of-breed product portfolio with breadth and depth that's unique in the industry; a global EMC team that is second to none; and a solid operational and financial model that demonstrated success across cycles. These advantages are critical to our success regardless of what the spending environment turns out to be. For the moment, this is not very clear, and in light of this uncertainty, we're updating our revenue and earnings expectations for 2012. 
For the full year 2012, we expect to achieve revenue in the range of $21.6 billion to $21.75 billion, and non-GAAP earnings per share between $1.68 and $1.70. If the caution that characterize the end of Q3 continues through Q4, then we'd expect to be at the lower end of this range. If we experience the seasonal strength typical of a Q4, we'd expect to come in at the higher end of this range. 
In either case, we feel very good about the opportunity for our business. With the continued ramp-up new products like the Max, with the continued expansion of our channel partners with innovative offerings like VSPEX, with the penetration of EMC infrastructure into VMware environments, with the expansion of VMware's capabilities in these virtualized environments and with the overall value proposition of EMC portfolio, we believe we can continue to grow faster than our addressable markets whilst reinvesting our business and delivery leverage and earnings per share. We're confident we gained share in the first 3 quarters of 2012 and confident we'll continue to gain share in Q4. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Joe, who will give you more color on the macro, the quarter and the opportunities that lie ahead of us. Joe?"

We appreciate your interest in EMC.

We appreciate your interest in EMC. 
I would like to begin my formal remarks by clearly stating that we were disappointed that we did not quite meet our internal revenue expectations in Q3 and that we interrupted our string of 10 consecutive quarters of double-digit top and bottom line growth. But that said, I do believe that given the significant uncertainties that permeate the global stage right now and its negative impact on IT spending, we more than held our own. In fact, when all the reporting is in and I'm quite sure you will find that EMC gained share across the major IT markets in which we play. 
I know how hard my 55,000-plus colleagues at EMC and VMware worked, how dedicated they are to the success of our customers, how much they believe in our strategy, direction and future prospects. And for this, I want to deeply thank them and let them know how much I appreciate them. 
I would now like to comment on the uncertainty I just mentioned. First, there's economic uncertainty as demonstrated by the fact that most major markets around the world exhibited at least slightly lower GDP growth rates in Q3. In fact, one is hard-pressed to find a major country that grew faster in Q3 2012 than it did last quarter in Q2 or did in Q3 of 2011. This economic uncertainty has a twin brother called political uncertainty. Confidence in governments around the world that make productive and timely decisions on real pressing issues like deficit reductions and tax policies is at a low point. Collectively, these economic and political uncertainties are affecting business confidence and this is affecting IT spending rates. 
In Q3, we found an air of caution in IT spending. Decisions were being subjected to far more scrutiny and disclosed our bookings to be more back-end loaded than expected, resulting in more late orders, some too late to ship and some slippage out of the quarter. That said, to be clear, we still believe that IT spending in the second half of this year will show some year-on-year growth, albeit at a slower rate than was experienced in the first half of this year. 
To put growth rates around that statement, last quarter, we said we expected overall 2012 IT spending to be around 3%, possibly a tick less. We now expect 2012 global IT spending to be approximately 2%. Looking forward and assuming political cooperation and reasonableness prevails, we do expect that in Q4, IT spending has a potential to grow over Q3 in a fairly normal seasonal pattern. Obviously, this growth will now be coming off a lower Q3 baseline, and again, we believe that the overall IT market will exhibit some growth year-on-year in Q4. 
As customary, we will comment on 2013 IT spending on our January earnings call, but I will tell you that as we put together our 2013 business plan, our forecast calls for modest growth in the IT market as a whole. Net-net, against this backdrop in Q3, we grew our business year-over-year in North America by 9%; in APJ by 5%; by 19% in Latin America; and our business at EMEA was essentially flat. 
And as in past quarters, we saw our highest growth rates in the rapid growth economies. Across our BRIC + 13 countries, we grew over 10% in Q3 versus the same period last year. A few minutes ago, I expressed confidence that EMC is and will continue to gain market share, so a fair question is why, why the confidence? The first answer to that question is because we have confidence in our innovative strategies and products and we have all-important momentum. 
As a proof point, let's quickly review the key innovative strategies of EMC and VMware. We have a software-defined data center strategy that dramatically extends the benefit of virtualization. I truly believe this software technology will spark a revolution in the data center market to get tight integration and automation of compute, storage, network and security infrastructure assets. This will help customers receive unmatched efficiency, control, choice and agility. We have an end-user computing strategy called -- that helps our customers manage and secure their end-user computing environments in a multidevice post-PC world. We have a storage strategy for tomorrow's software-defined data centers and hybrid cloud environments. Stores that combines both Flash technology and hard drives, coupled with true automation for tiering and seamless flexible information management and protection. We have a Cloud Foundry strategy for working with developers on new approaches to building applications, as well as ones for helping customers renew and cloudify existing ones. We have a strategy for Big Data, one that will harness the vast sea of information in real-time to help make better decisions faster. This new approach works with both structured and unstructured information, not only from within one's own enterprise, but from public and semipublic data sources. And we have a strategy for security that is pervasive across all of our offerings. In other words, built-in, built in for today's era of cloud computing. 
So you can see why we are confident. In fact, I have never been more excited about our future growth prospects. But these compelling strategies alone are insufficient. What makes me even more confident in our future is our leadership team and the talent EMC and VMware has behind them. 
Pat Gelsinger has assumed the reins of VMware and he's being very well-received and doing a stellar job. Dave Goulden is leading EMC's information infrastructure business to new heights. David's grasp of the business and his leadership style is exemplary. Paul Maritz's innovative brilliance will help take our developers platform and our Big Data business to the next level. Both of these areas are high-growth opportunities for us. And the best news is our broader leadership team which Pat, David, Paul and I are blessed to work with is very strong, very talented and very focused. 
To help give you a clearer view of our innovation and strategies and for you to get to know our leadership team better, it is my pleasure to invite you to join us for a strategic forum which we will host for analysts and investors in Q1 of next year. We will get you the specifics of this form ASAP. 
I would now like to address one more topic before I turn it back to Tony to moderate the Q&A portion of today's call. I would like to comment on our relationship with Cisco and the future of our VCE joint venture. For the record, EMC and Cisco have benefited from a decade-long partnership. My close personal relationship with John Chambers goes back over 20 years and we enjoyed a friendship of trust and confidence in each other that is reflected in the way our teams work together. 
Some have called into question the viability of our relationship with Cisco and VCE because of VMware's entrance into the networking space. The reality is, that software defined networking complements the network infrastructure and EMC has no plans to drive deeper into networking by acquiring a network hardware company. We believe continued innovation and network infrastructure by the partner ecosystem will enable higher performance transformation of data in next-generation data centers. In short, we are committed to work closely and cooperatively with Cisco, our premier partner. 
VCE is a top strategic priority for EMC. We continue to ramp investments and VCE, which continues to meet and exceed our business objectives, approaching a $1 billion run rate in less than 3 years. There are now over 500 VCE customer deployments, including many in large Fortune 500 companies. These customers demanded and are receiving the benefits of rapid deployment, higher performance and higher availability, and very importantly, they are getting these benefits at a lower total cost of ownership. In short, we believe VCE represents the fastest and most cost-effective way for organizations to build out their cloud infrastructures and we are committed to VCE's success. Thank you, and now, back to Tony"

And then relative to Latin America, just a small market, but a strong bounce-back. We had not quite saw such a strong growth quarter in Q2 and a big bounce back in Q3. I'm and relative to the countries in Asia-Pac, Joe, do you want to comment on those?"

Over 50% of the new systems we sold in the quarter were actually the new family. We expect that transition to be essentially complete by the end of the year. A phenomenon that we're seeing in the high-end is particularly when customers are kind of scrutinizing their budgets, they're really looking for TCO and cost savings, we do see a phenomenal consolidation of multiple mid-tier systems into the high-end, so that helps as well. In terms of sequentially, yes, you're right, but it wasn't the only part of the business that was down sequentially from a product point of view. The macro and the factors we talked about impacted basically most parts of the business, so there's nothing really unique about the high-end in terms of being down sequentially. Typically, we will be more or less flat sequentially in the product arena from Q2 to Q3."

I think what are the things you'd be missing in those trends is how big the private cloud is going to be. And as David said, there are probably less than a handful of companies that are truly capable of having the resources to take components and build their own private cloud, like a Google could for instance. So obviously, what we're doing with the journey of virtualization into the software-defined data center is we're building that technology and that's going to be a great, I think a great driver for us. Also, our highest growth area, if you look at kind of on a vertical basis, would've been in the service providers. You heard on the VMware call yesterday where they said second time is on web services, there's the most number of apps running by 4 and the levers third is way, way, way behind that, running on the VMware infrastructure. Most of those infrastructures also read EMC's infrastructures, those service provider companies. So again, we are riding well on those 2 trends. Big Data is a good growth area for us and we don't see that as disruptive. A lot of these data mining applications do not run on that technology yesterday, so we think we could be a net winner there. And when you look at some of the things that are happening on private clouds -- or excuse me, public clouds on the service provider front, a lot of what they're attacking there is kind of shadow IT and that was never a big win for and some test and dev. So test and dev impacts us a little bit, but again, we're picking that up with our service provider partners and we never were a big winner with shadow IT. So I think we're in pretty good shape going forward here. I think we're in very good shape going forward. And if you looked at the 6 strategic areas that I outlined, which again, we will talk to you more about next quarter in real depth, our future is incredibly bright, in my opinion."

One is, that we had parlayed orders and we expected, which is there were more orders that we couldn't ship in the quarter than we expected that's going to help us in the fourth quarter. Similarly, but a little different, we had orders that we were expecting to win that got pushed down to the fourth quarter because customers pulling the extra decision cycle pushed those orders out. So again, now as those orders close and some of them already have, think it'll be out there, help us a little bit in the mid-tier. So it's really the macro, more on an execution issue. And for some of the factors that I just mentioned, we do think we're going to have a rebound in the mid-tier in the fourth quarter as a sector. And then relative to the overall markets, we feel good at the top level. We've been looking at our 6% growth versus IT spending. We actually gained market share relative to the storage business. We think that from what we saw in the field with our win rates, both the high-end of the mid-tier, we think that we'll still be in that share gain are there and you look at our network storage product revenues, against those other reported or how out there for consensus and we feel pretty good about that aspect of our growth.

One is that if you remember back in Q2, we had some benefits as we have closed out the RSA situation and reversed what was left of the charge. Some of that went to operating margins to gross margins that goes about 20 bps improvements. And also quarter-on-quarter, there were some additional amortization capitalized software.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. This morning, we reported continued growth in revenue and earnings per share in Q3, with revenue up 6% and non-GAAP EPS up 8% over last year's Q3. Free cash flow grew 16% year-on-ye",4226,"Thanks, Tony. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. This morning, we reported continued growth in revenue and earnings per share in Q3, with revenue up 6% and non-GAAP EPS up 8% over last year's Q3. Free cash flow grew 16% year-on-year. 
The environment in Q3 turned out to be more cautious than we had expected. There were several issues weighing on customers' minds, including uncertain global economic growth and the U.S. presidential election. The macro challenges translated into more spending scrutiny, longer deal cycles, additional approval requirements and the resulting delay in IT deals. While the macro factors caused EMC's growth to be less than expected, I'm pleased that we did show growth in this challenging environment. And as tech industry results are reported, I believe EMC will be one of the stronger big companies, and that we certainly gained share. 
We also showed EPS leverage and achieved a number of Q3 quarterly records, including record revenues, record non-GAAP operating income and record non-GAAP EPS. In the face of such headwinds, I believe that our strategy, balanced portfolio, operational model and ability to execute are paying off near term and position us well for the long term. 
While we need to navigate the short-term economic challenges, the longer-term secular changes offer an opportunity to be really successful. The shift to cloud, Big Data and Trusted IT bode well for us, as we've been at the forefront of these for some time. These trends are in full force, because they enable companies to capture a better return on dollars invested in IT than ever before. Cloud architectures make the infrastructure more agile and efficient, whilst Big Data enables new insights that can help grow the top line, and all this must be done in a trusted way. At EMC, we understand the company that can best deliver this ROI wins, and we continue to invest to make this happen. The result is innovative, practical, customer-focused additions to our product lines. 
And during times when spending is tight, our focus on high-priority areas of the data center like virtualization, security and storage serve us well. Customers needing to be extra cautious about where they spend their budgets, first, direct their dollars to high-impact areas and for most cost-efficient technology in those areas, in other words, to best-of-breed offerings like our own. 
The drive for great efficiency and business value from IT extends beyond economic cycles and is gaining momentum as more customers shift more of their spending towards cloud architectures, private clouds, public clouds and hybrid clouds. Running a cloud infrastructure means leveraging pools of network and storage and server resources that are dynamically allocated to new and existing applications based on demand. This is not easy. And as a result, most companies building clouds, either private or public, have needed the full set of resources nor the IP to build these architectures themselves. A few do, but the rest seek an infrastructure that can get them there without having to compromise on important enterprise product features. These include capabilities like replication to ensure data availability and business continuity; efficiency features like tiering, deduplication and compression; backup, with best-in-class recovery points and recovery time objectives; security that's agile and risk-based; and virtualization, a key component for achieving the control, efficiency and choice clouds can deliver. 
Our approach to using our own ancillary-developed software, integrated with industry-standard hardware, has been tested and tuned, enabled us to deliver value to a customer that we believe is unparalleled amongst our peers. This formula is in lockstep with the transition to hybrid cloud and to keep us at the forefront of data center infrastructure. 
While we saw somewhat slower growth across the board due to the economy in Q3, we believe we are better positioned than our competitors to deliver value to our customers. As companies look to invest in the data center technologies that will support hybrid cloud architectures, they prefer storage solutions that will be optimized for the task at hand. We saw evidence of this in Q3 as our portfolio of complementary network storage platform products was up 2% over last year's Q3. 
Having different storage functionality for different application and workload needs is an important part of our strategy, and we work diligently to create a full complement of scale-out block, scale-out NAS, unified and backup solutions. Companies in all sectors of all sizes and with all sorts of IT challenges can look to us for a solution, which in many cases, in several different storage technologies within the same customer.  While demand for various technology may ebb and flow quarter-to-quarter, this broad portfolio enables us to sustain gauge with customers as we work to solve their problems, and it helps to drive our business over time. 
Our high-end storage products grew 5% over Q3 of last year. Our Symmetrix scale-up block solution had its first full quarter of availability for the refreshed family of VMAX 10K, 20K and 40K, and customers are embracing it. The new software functionality leverages the powerful standards-based hardware to deliver high-end reliability, availability and serviceability via an easy-to-use Unisphere interface. The transition to the new family continue to ramp well, and we expect it to be essentially complete by year end. 
Our mid-tier storage, comprised of our scale-out file, unified and backup solutions, was flat year-over-year for Q3 and up over 10% year-to-date. This quarter, results were driven by the Isilon scale-out NAS business. Isilon continues to do well in its traditional area of strength such as media and life sciences whilst expanding its presence in more traditional enterprise environments. The upcoming new Isilon OneFS operating system, Mavericks, which is on track to ship before year end is designed to drive Isilon into new verticals and expanded use cases. 
For unified block and file environments, customers continue to rely on the simple and efficient architecture of our VNX Family. Revenue in Q3 was down in the mid-single digits year-on-year. Given the environment, demand for the family was pretty good. However, due to the later-than-expected timing of some channel-related orders, we couldn't ship these orders in Q3 and had to move them to Q4. What was encouraging though is that overall growth to our channel partners continued, driven in part by the popularity of VSPEX. In addition, our recently announced partnership with Lenovo will provide an incremental channel for the VNX Family over time, starting in China. 
Our purpose-built backup appliances, Data Domain and Avamar grew in Q3. It's worth noting that this business had a tough compare year-on-year and also suffered a bit from some delayed procured decisions by customers. While a pushout of these orders had an impact on Q3, we've already closed several of these deals early in Q4. 
Customers need comprehensive and leading-edge backup solutions as part of their next-generation data centers. A good example of how important the full backup portfolio is for a customer is Ochsner Health System, which has gone tapers [ph] with its combination of Avamar, Data Domain, NetWorker, Data Protection Advisor and Disk Library for mainframe backup and storing environment, which is based on VMAX and VPLEX.  This strategic value, having a strong Information Storage portfolio is clear, as we see customers adopting a broad range of EMC solutions to optimize the application environments. 
In Q3, we won a deal with the government administration that needed to accommodate 80 terabytes of VM storage and 850 terabytes of scientific data, a combination of VNX with 6 terabytes of Flash capacity and Isilon, provide the best value of the most efficient scalable and easy-to-manage solution. 
We closed another deal in Q3 with a large health care company. We're having the full portfolio of storage solutions made the difference to the customer. This company need a solid storage infrastructure to roll out several new applications in 2013. However, their old and failing storage infrastructure left them no room to grow, and their backup solution were severely lacking. A combination of VNX, Data Domain, Isilon and RecoverPoint handily beat the storage technology proposed by the incumbent server vendor. 
One of our more rewarding customer wins, illustrating the full value of the portfolio was with Cancer Research UK. With the combination of VFCache, VNX with Flash drives, vSphere, Data Domain and NetWorker, Cancer Research UK increased performance, improved efficiency and improved their disaster recovery capabilities. This example demonstrates the value of Flash can have across the infrastructure, and we've made ""Flash everywhere"" a  central tenet of our data center strategy. 
We first introduced SSDs on storage arrays back in 2008. We followed soon after that with the introduction of FAST software to also make the placement of data on to Flash, the hot data and on to the different types of disk form or cold data. And now 4 years after their introduction, these hybrid arrays have become the norm. Over 1/2 our arrays now shift with Flash drives and our FAST software. These intelligent, tiered network storage arrays provide a rich set of data services for data management, data efficiency and data availability. These intelligent arrays enable customers to derive more value, better performance, higher application availability and a low total cost of ownership from their storage infrastructure than ever before. 
We extended our Flash capabilities with the development of VFCache, which is focused on turbocharging existing line of business applications in conjunction with storage arrays. In the case of Cancer Research UK, adding VFCache to their Oracle CRM application allowed them to reduce database query time by a factor of 6 and increase throughput by a factor of 3, allowing to complete 4 fundraising campaigns in the time it used to take to complete 1. 
We continue to innovate here as recent enhancements to VFCache demonstrates. The addition to VFCache we introduced last quarter include cash deduplication for server Flash, the first in the industry; interoperability between VFCache and vMotion; enhanced integration with VMAX; an expanded capacity VFCache PCIe cards, as well as multiple PCIe cards per server, the larger cash sets and greater performance. 
While VFCache is a focused cache used case for server-based Flash, it provides impressive intangible performance benefits for customers' enterprise applications, and the number of VFCache customers approximately doubled last quarter. There is much more to come as we continue to roll out our ""Flash everywhere"" strategy. And as we've previously stated, next year, we expect to bring to market new technologies. We plan to broaden our focus on server-based Flash by introducing best-in-class, capacity and cost-optimized PCIe-attached DAS for performance-intensive applications that don't require storage data services. 
We'll introduce Project Thunder, an all-Flash storage appliance that attaches to the server network and allows the sharing of Flash resources across multiple of these performance-intensive applications. Project Thunder leverages the same software we're developing for VFCache. 
We'll also introduce Project X, our innovative, all-Flash, scale-out storage array designed to offer the full data services of a storage array and the sub-millisecond performance provided by Flash. This is ideal for applications where 100% of the data is hot, or where the data is highly dedupable such as VDI or database test and dev environments.  The customer access programs leads upcoming Flash technology going very, very well in generating a lot of interest and excitement. 
Across all our Flash products, the magic that brings Flash to life is our software. A great example of this is FAST, which automates the migration of data across tiering storage based on patterns of use, both within a hybrid array and even across the interconnect to the server tier. FAST is so efficient that in some cases, 1% to 2% of the total capacity in Flash within a hybrid array can process over 1/2 the IOCs of the entire array. 
Our foundational play in Big Data, Greenplum, continues to help customers exploit the growing potential of Big Data analytics. Wins in Q3 included deployment of web analytics for large government organization, website analytics for one of the largest retailers in the U.S. and one of the largest mobile telecoms in the U.S., a large-scale implementation to decrease the cost of data transformations in billing analytics. In this case, the customer was able to displace the incumbent data warehouse it was using for ETL with a far less expensive Hadoop map-reduce framework on Greenplum. 
Longtime EMC customers are also eager to capitalize on the data that they own as a large win at a global financial services company attests. As part of purchase that also included Vblock, VNX, SourceOne and Centera, this customer selected Greenplum for analytics of their e-mail. Greenplum continues to grow at strong double-digit rates. 
We're excited to have Paul Maritz spending a lot more of this time on our Big Data and next-generation application initiatives and look forward to expanding these initiatives in ways that will enable customers to take the full advantage of the potential Big Data offers. 
Like Big Data, security is also an area of focus with customers. As pro rata-based approaches to secure to become increasingly ineffective, customers are seeking new technologies that can help them better understand risk and defend against today's advanced threats. RSA continues to benefit as a result, with revenue up 6% year-on-year in Q3. Revenue from our security management and compliance business grew over 30%. The ability to manage risk and defend against advanced threats inside the network is an extremely hot area right now. Our SMC business provides the security analytics and GRC solutions to address these challenges, what just about every organization is facing. 
Our Identity & Data Protection business was impacted by 2 factors, specific to our secure IT business. The slowdown in overall hiring and employment, especially in Europe and Asia, was a stronger headwind than we expected, while last year's remediation of tokens disrupted the normal renewal cycle more than we expected. A cycle of product introductions expected in early 2013 will enable us to deliver new form factors of authentication and better address the authentication needs for mobile and cloud computing. Customer movements towards risk-based approaches and to security delivered as a service present great potential for our IDP business. We are more confident than ever with our security strategy, which is centered on agile solutions, to combat emerging threats is the right one. 
Revenue from our Information Intelligence Group was down 2% in Q3. License revenue continue to grow sequentially. IIG is innovating, creating solutions that are easy to deploy, easy to use and highly aligned with customers' needs. We've been leveraging the services expertise developed in specific verticals to create content-management-enabled solutions tailored to industry-specific requirements. A recent example is our Integrated Patient Record solutions, which enables health care organizations to access, share and transform disparate patient data, regardless of format or location and, importantly, lower cost in doing so. Our software developed especially for engineering plants and facilities management is also gaining traction. 
VMWare revenue grew 20% over last year's third quarter as companies continue to expand their virtual infrastructures to reduce the overall cost of their IT infrastructures and to put them on the path to cloud computing. We continue to enhance our integration with VMWare, and this is making a difference with customers. 
As you can see here, the percentage of customer survey who preferred EMC for their virtualized environments has increased significantly in just the past 6 months. This affinity will continue to be important, as VMWare moves into the direction of the software-defined data center, which is emerging as the clear path to cloud computing. While software-defined data center enables the dynamic creation of virtual infrastructure to leverage the underlying physical infrastructure, continued innovation in the infrastructure elements is essential in order to realize the full potential of a software-defined data center. We're excited to work towards reducing IT's complexity and costs via the automation the software-defined data center enables. 
Our go-to-market model continues to evolve as customers' options to how to leverage IT expand. We offer 3 avenues to get our customers to hybrid cloud: best-of-breed infrastructure components, proven infrastructure through VSPEX and converged infrastructure with Vblocks. Our services organization uses all 3 of these approaches as they continue to transition customers to cloud architectures. While customers deferred some discretionary consulting projects last quarter, and revenue from implementation services was impacted by a lag in storage product revenue, our services team continue to demonstrate its value to EMC's business strategy. 
Among the major EMC service wins achieved in Q3 was a 5-year enterprise-wide IT and consolidation initiative based on Vblock, VMAX, VNX, Data Domain and Avamar. This win at a global pharmaceutical company, completely displaced the incumbent server vendor and storage vendors with solutions from EMC and VCE and qualifies one of the largest professional services deals ever. 
Our channel partners are also leveraging all 3 paths to the cloud, and VSPEX is becoming especially popular. With a variety of configurations through our partners to accommodate customer preferences, including technology from Citrix, Microsoft, HP, Cisco, Brocade and VMWare, VSPEX partners have a lot of freedom to create solutions they need and provide a lot of value for their end-user customers. In its first full quarter of availability since launching VSPEX in April, partners have sold well over 300  VSPEX systems, and because VSPEX solutions are simple, predictable and profitable, we expect that number to continue to ramp. 
We have made enormous progress in truly teaming with our channel partners, and as a result, our channel program continues to earn accolades. In Q3, EMC was named a Rising Star by the Global Tech Distribution Council, and we won 4 Company of the Year awards by CRN. With continued partner-centered innovation like the Q3 enablement of the loss to [ph] distribution partners to assemble VSPEX to resellers, we expect to remain a favorite amongst our partners. 
Our service provider program is an important part of our strategy to get customers to public cloud, and we continue to make progress here with revenue from service provider program partners up over 40% from Q3 of last year. In Q3, CSC extended their well-established, EMC-powered BizCloud offering into a new vertical. Terremark, a Verizon company, completed their first EMC-powered public cloud offerings on Vblocks. Telstra expanded their cloud services in the quarter on EMC infrastructure. And Rackspace recently extended its global relationship with us to include Australia and New Zealand markets. EMC is the only external storage platform offered in Rackspace's new Sydney data center as Rackspace continues to make considerable investments in our storage technology. Our family of storage products from Atmos through to VMAX resonates with service providers, as it enable them to offer a full range of service levels to their customers with EMC as their infrastructure partner with deep technology and support capabilities. 
Finally, accelerating customers' journey to the cloud is the aim of our joint venture VCE. VCE continues to do very well with demand up approximately 30% year-on-year and approximately 20% quarter-on-quarter. This was obviously helpful to our year-on-year growth in Q3, as revenue from our components of every Vblock sold increases our storage and virtualization revenue. Vblocks continue to gain traction both in enterprise data centers as well as in service providers, and we saw this in Q3.  A U.S.-based chemical company purchased 4 Vblocks as part of a solution that also included Data Domain, Avamar and Atmos. A European insurance company purchased a Vblock, alongside several VNXs. And a large construction equipment maker purchased Vblock with Data Domain and Avamar for Data Protection. Among service providers, CSC continues to expand our buildout of Vblocks, to power their public and private cloud businesses. Additionally, the second largest telco in Japan, SoftBank, will standardize on Vblock for their cloud-based offerings. SoftBank is already using Vblock systems for internal IT operations. In fact, 10 out of top 15 global telcos are now Vblock customers. 
In sum, our go-to-market model enables us and our partners to make the right tool for the job available to many types of customer in the way that makes most sense for them.  Our Q3 financial results were supported by our strong competitive position. While macro headwinds increased during the quarter, we still grew the overall business by 6% year-on-year. Within this, North America grew 9%, EMEA was flat, APJ grew 5% and Latin America grew 19%. Currency negatively impacted year-on-year revenue growth by about 150 basis points in Q3. 
Now let's turn to the income statement. We once again put together a waterfall analysis to show how various income statement items contributed to the non-GAAP EPS growth we achieved in Q3 of this year compared to Q3 of 2011. Gross margin continues to be an important factor. This quarter, non-GAAP gross margins were 64.1%, up 110 basis points from last year's Q3. The improvement here was driven by the increase in revenue mix and margin rate from VMWare. As you can see in the waterfall chart, increase in gross margin dollars was the biggest contributor to our EPS growth. 
Non-GAAP operating margins were 24.3%, up 30 basis points from Q3 of last year. Within the operating expense line, SG&A expenses grew more slowly than revenue, as we were careful with expense growth in the quarter. R&D grew faster than revenue, as we continue to invest in our leading-edge product portfolio. So investment in OpEx offset much of the gains we achieved from gross profits. 
Two other items had a meaningful impact on EPS growth, but effectively offset each other. Nonoperating expense was $54 million non-GAAP, down approximately $16 million from last year's Q3. And our tax rate was 23.5%, up from 22% in Q3 of 2011. We now expect our tax rate for the full year to be 22.5%, reflecting a higher mix of profits in the U.S. This assumes the U.S. R&D tax credit is passed in Q4. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.40, up 8% from last year, 2 points higher than revenue growth. 
Free cash flow was a solid $1.1 billion up 16% and about $250 million higher than non-GAAP net income for Q3. Contributing to this was growth in deferred revenue, up 26% year-on-year at $7.2 billion. Deferred revenue has become an increasingly important part of the financial picture for us, improving visibility and predictability of at least a portion of our revenue stream and enhancing cash flows. 
Along with our ability to consistently generate strong cash flow, comes a responsibility of allocating that capital wisely. We continue to make investments to keep us well positioned for the longer term while maintaining financial flexibility and returning cash to shareholders. Along those lines, we closed Q3 with $10.6 billion in cash and investments. Of this, $4 billion was U.S. cash, excluding VMWare. We spent approximately $1.3 billion in the quarter on acquisitions that will greatly enhance our ability to make hybrid cloud a reality for our customers. We returned $150 million of our cash to shareholders via the purchase of EMC stock in Q3, and we continue to expect to buy back $700 million worth of EMC shares in 2012. We see this balanced allocation of capital as the correct formula right now, given the opportunities we have ahead of us. However, we revisit it often, and we'll revise it accordingly when the time is right. 
Looking forward, we do not expect the economy to get better this year, but we do like how we position the company near term and long term. We have a strategy that's built to leverage the 3 major way to change in IT: cloud, Big Data and Trust, and we have what it takes to execute on this strategy, with leadership positions in storage, virtualization and security, a best-of-breed product portfolio with breadth and depth that's unique in the industry; a global EMC team that's second to none; and a solid operational and financial model that demonstrated success across cycles. These advantages are critical to success regardless what the spending environment turns out to be. For the moment, this is not very clear, and in light of this uncertainty, we're updating our revenue and earnings expectations for 2012. 
For the full year 2012, we'd expect to achieve revenue in the range of $21.6 billion to $21.75 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share between $1.68 and $1.70. If the caution that characterize the end of Q3 continues through Q4, then we'd expect to be at the lower end of this range. If we experience the seasonal strength typical of a Q4, we'd expect to come in at the high end of this range.  In either case, we feel very good about the opportunity for our business. With the continued ramp of new products like VMAX, with the continued expansion of our channel partners with innovative offerings like VSPEX, with the penetration of EMC infrastructure into VMWare environments, with the expansion of VMWare's capabilities in these virtualized environments and with the overall value proposition of EMC portfolio, we believe we can continue to grow faster than our addressable markets whilst reinvesting our business and delivering leverage in earnings per share. We're confident we gained share in the first 3 quarters of 2012 and confident we'll continue to gain share in Q4. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Joe, who will give you more color on the macro, the quarter and the opportunities that lie ahead of us. Joe?"

We appreciate your interest in EMC. 
I would like to begin my formal remarks by clearly stating that we were disappointed that we did not quite meet our internal revenue expectations in Q3 and that we interrupted our string of 10 consecutive quarters of double-digit top and bottom line growth. But that said, I do believe that given the significant uncertainties that permeate the global stage right now and its negative impact on IT spending, we more than held our own. In fact, when all the reporting is in, and we're quite sure you'll find that EMC gained share across the major IT markets in which we play. 
I know how hard my 55,000-plus colleagues at EMC and VMWare worked, how dedicated they are to the success of our customers, how much they believe in our strategy, direction and future prospects. And for this, I want to deeply thank them and let them know how much I appreciate them. 
I would now like to comment on the uncertainty I just mentioned. First, there's economic uncertainty as demonstrated by the fact that most major markets around the world exhibited at least slightly lower GDP growth rates in Q3. In fact, one is hard pressed to find a major country that grew faster in Q3 in 2012 than it did last quarter in Q2 or did in Q3 of 2011. 
This economic uncertainty has a twin brother called political uncertainty. Confidence in governments around the world that make productive and timely decisions on real pressing issues like deficit reductions and tax policies is at a low point. Collectively, these economic and political uncertainties are affecting business confidence, and this is affecting IT spending rates. 
In Q3, we found an air of caution in IT spending. Decisions were being subjected to far more scrutiny and has closed our bookings to be more back-end loaded than expected, resulting in more late orders, some too late to ship and some slippage out of the quarter. That said, to be clear, we still believe that IT spending in the second half of this year will show some year-on-year growth, albeit at a slower rate than was experienced in the first half of this year. 
To put growth rates around that statement, last quarter, we said we expected overall 2012 IT spending to be around 3%, possibly a tick less. We now expect 2012 global IT spending to be approximately 2%. Looking forward, and assuming political cooperation and reasonableness prevails, we do expect that in Q4, IT spending has a potential to grow over Q3 in a fairly normal seasonal pattern. Obviously, this growth will now be coming off a lower Q3 baseline, and again, we believe that the overall IT market will exhibit some growth, year-on-year in Q4. 
As customary, we will comment on 2013 IT spending on our January earnings call, but I will tell you that as we put together our 2013 business plan, our forecast calls for modest growth in the IT market as a whole. Net-net, against this backdrop in Q3, we grew our business year-over-year in North America by 9%; in APJ by 5%; by 19% in Latin America; and our business at EMEA was essentially flat.  And as in past quarters, we saw our highest growth rates in the rapid growth economies. Across our BRIC plus 13 countries, we grew over 10% in Q3 versus the same period last year. 
A few minutes ago, I expressed confidence that EMC is and will continue to gain market share, so a fair question is why, why the confidence? The first answer to that question is, because we have confidence in our innovative strategies and products and we have all-important momentum.  As a proof point, let's quickly review the key innovative strategies of EMC and VMWare. We have a software-defined data center strategy that dramatically extends the benefit of virtualization. I truly believe this software technology will spark a revolution in the data center market to get tight integration and automation of compute, storage, network and security infrastructure assets. This will help customers receive unmatched efficiency, control, choice and agility. We have an end-user computing strategy called Horizon that helps our customers manage and secure their end-user computing environments in a multi-device, post-PC world. 
We have a storage strategy for tomorrow's software-defined data centers and hybrid cloud environments. Stores that combines both Flash technology and hard drives, coupled with true automation for tiering and seamless flexible information management and protection. We have a Cloud Foundry strategy for working with developers on new approaches to building new applications, as well as ones for helping customers renew and cloudify existing ones. We have a strategy for Big Data, one that will harness the vast sea of information in realtime to help make better decisions faster. This new approach works with both structured and unstructured information, not only from within one's own enterprise, but from public and semipublic data sources. And we have a strategy for security that is pervasive across all of our offerings. In other words, built in, built in for today's era of cloud computing. 
So you can see why we are confident. In fact, I have never been more excited about our future growth prospects. But these compelling strategies alone are insufficient, what makes me even more confident in our future is our leadership team and the talent EMC and VMWare has behind them.  Pat Gelsinger has assumed the reins of VMWare, and he's being very well received and doing a stellar job. David Goulden is leading EMC's information infrastructure business to new heights. David's grasp of the business and his leadership style is exemplary. Paul Maritz's innovative brilliance will help take our developers' platform and our Big Data business to the next level. Both of these areas are high-growth opportunities for us. And the best news is our broader leadership team which Pat, David, Paul and I are blessed to work with is very strong, very talented and very focused. 
To help give you a clearer view of our innovation and strategies and for you to get to know our leadership team better, it is my pleasure to invite you to join us for a strategic forum, which we will host for analysts and investors in Q1 of next year. We will get you the specifics of this form ASAP. 
I would now like to address one more topic before I turn it back to Tony to moderate the Q&A portion of today's call. I would like to comment on our relationship with Cisco and the future of our VCE joint venture. For the record, EMC and Cisco have benefited from a decade-long partnership. My close personal relationship with John Chambers goes back over 20 years, and we enjoy our friendship of trust and confidence in each other that is reflected in the way our teams work together. 
Some have called into question the viability of our relationship with Cisco and VCE because of VMWare's entrance into the networking space. The reality is that software-defined networking complements the network infrastructure, and EMC has no plans to drive deeper into networking by acquiring a network hardware company. We believe continued innovation and network infrastructure by the partner ecosystem will enable higher performance transmission of data in next-generation data centers. In short, we are committed to work closely and cooperatively with Cisco, our premier partner. 
VCE is a top strategic priority for EMC. We continue to ramp investments in VCE, which continues to meet and exceed our business objectives, approaching a $1 billion run rate in less than 3 years. There are now over 500 VCE customer deployments, including many in large Fortune 500 companies. These customers demanded and are receiving the benefits of rapid deployment, higher performance and higher availability, and very importantly, they are getting these benefits at a lower total cost of ownership. In short, we believe VCE represents the fastest and most cost-effective way for organizations to build out their cloud infrastructures, and we are committed to VCE's success. 
Thank you, and now, back to Tony."

Over 50% of the new systems we sold in the quarter were actually the new family. We expect that transition to be essentially complete by the end of the year. A phenomenon that we're seeing in the high end is particularly when customers are kind of scrutinizing their budgets, they're really looking for TCO and cost savings. We do see a phenomena of consolidation in multiple mid-tier systems into the high end, so that helps as well. In terms of sequentially -- yes, you're right, but it wasn't the only part of the business that was down sequentially from a product point of view. The macro and the factors we talked about impacted basically most parts of the business, so there's nothing really unique about the high-end in terms of being down sequentially. Typically, we will be more like flat sequentially in the product arena from Q2 to Q3."

Some of these use x86 commodity servers or JBoss and off-the-shelf NFS file systems. So I guess the question is, if you subscribe to that line of theory, how does EMC plan to grow with some of these sort of secular growth trends and offset what is somewhat deflationary for some of the tech incumbents."

I think one of the things you'd be missing in those trends is how big the private cloud is going to be. And as David said, there are probably less than a handful of companies that are truly capable of having the resources to take components and build their own private cloud, like a Google could for instance. So obviously, what we're doing with the journey of virtualization into the software-defined data center is we're building that technology, and that's going to be a great -- I think, a great driver for us. Also, our highest growth area, if you look at a kind of on a vertical basis, would've been in the service providers. You heard on the VMWare call yesterday, where they said second time is on web services, there's the most number of apps running by far, and whoever is third is way, way, way behind that, running on the VMWare infrastructure. Most of those infrastructures also run EMC's infrastructures, those service provider companies. So again, we are riding well on those 2 trends. Big Data is a big growth area for us, and we don't see that as disruptive. A lot of these data mining applications do not run on our technology yesterday, so we think we could be a net winner there. And when you look at some of the things that are happening on private clouds -- or excuse me, public clouds and on the service provider front, a lot of what they're attacking there is kind of shadow IT, and that was never a big win for -- in some test and dev. So test and dev impacts us a little bit, but again, we're picking that up with our service provider partners, and we never were a big winner with shadow IT. So I think we're in pretty good shape going forward here. I think we're in very good shape going forward. And if you looked at the 6 strategic areas that I outlined, which again, we'll talk to you more about next quarter in real depth, our future is incredibly bright, in my opinion."

It really was the macro. They were relative to our expectations. And the mid-tier product growth sector, there were 2 things that happened. One is that we had more late orders than we expected, which means there are more orders that we couldn't ship in the quarter than we expected, that's going to help us in the fourth quarter. Similarly, but a little different, we had orders that we were expecting to win that got pushed out to the fourth quarter, because customers pulling the extra decision cycle, pushed those orders out. So again, now as those orders close and some of them already have, think we're going to be out there [ph] will also help us a little bit in the mid-tier. So it's really the macro, more an execution issue. And for some of the factors that I just mentioned, we do think we're going to have a rebound in the mid-tier in the fourth quarter as a sector. And then relative to the overall market, we feel good at the top level. We're going to be looking our 6% growth versus IT spending. We actually gained market share relative to the storage business. We think that from what we saw in the field with our win rates, both the high-end and mid-tier, we think that we'll still be in that share gain there. And you look at our network storage product revenues, against those others that have been reported or held out there for consensus, and we feel pretty good about that aspect of our growth. So every way we look at it, we think we're a net  share gainer and is the macro here as opposed to any micro issues."

All that was due to EMC x VMWare, which was down 50 bps sequentially. So let me explain to you what was going on there. So from a competitive point of view, I'd say the pricing pressures were consistent with normal, so no -- not a difference in the landscape on a competitive point of view. What we did see is, we saw some incremental impact from our customers, as they applied extra scrutiny and kind of worked their transactions harder, so for those additional customer pressure, and we did see continuing benefits from mix, as you mentioned. Specifically, relative to quarter-to-quarter, there were 2 factors that drove the reduction. One is that, if you remember back in Q2, we had some benefits as we have closed out the RSA situation and reversed what was left of the charge. Some of that went to operating margins -- to gross margins, so that goes about 20 bps improvements. And also quarter-on-quarter, there were some additional amortization in capitalized software. You factor those out, and gross margins would have been flat quarter-on-quarter. And then if your volumes should be in kind of where we thought it would be at the start of the quarter, you've just seen an increase in gross margin sequentially, so that's the story, what's going on there."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. This morning, we reported continued growth in revenue and earnings per share in Q3, with revenue up 6% and non-GAAP EPS up 8% over last year's Q3. Free cash flow grew 16% year-on-ye",4234,"Thanks, Tony. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. This morning, we reported continued growth in revenue and earnings per share in Q3, with revenue up 6% and non-GAAP EPS up 8% over last year's Q3. Free cash flow grew 16% year-on-year. 
The environment in Q3 turned out to be more cautious than we had expected. There were several issues weighing on customers' minds, including uncertain global economic growth and the U.S. presidential election. The macro challenges translated into more spending scrutiny, longer deal cycles, additional approval requirements and the resulting delay in IT deals. While the macro factors caused EMC's growth to be less than expected, I'm pleased that we did show growth in this challenging environment. And as tech industry results are reported, I believe EMC will be one of the stronger big companies and that we certainly gained share. 
We also showed EPS leverage and achieved a number of Q3 quarterly records, including record revenues, record non-GAAP operating income and record non-GAAP EPS. In the face of such headwinds, I believe that our strategy, balanced portfolio, operational model and ability to execute are paying off near term and position us well for the long term. 
While we need to navigate the short-term economic challenges, the longer-term secular changes offer us an opportunity to be really successful. The shift to cloud, Big Data and Trusted IT bode well for us, as we've been at the forefront of these for some time. These trends are in full force, because they enable companies to capture a better return on dollars invested in IT than ever before. Cloud architectures make the infrastructure more agile and efficient, whilst Big Data enables new insights that could help grow the top line, and all this must be done in a trusted way. At EMC, we understand the company that can best deliver this ROI wins, and we continually invest to make this happen. The result is innovative, practical, customer-focused additions to our product lines. 
And during times when spending is tight, our focus on high-priority areas of the data center like virtualization, security and storage serve us well. Customers needing to be extra cautious about where they spend their budgets, first direct their dollars to high-impact areas and the most cost-efficient technology within those areas, in other words, to best-of-breed offerings like our own. 
The drive for great efficiency and business value from IT extends beyond economic cycles and is gaining momentum as more customers shift more of their spending towards cloud architectures, private clouds, public clouds and hybrid clouds. Running a cloud infrastructure means leveraging pools of network and storage and server resources that are dynamically allocated to new and existing applications based on demand. This is not easy. And as a result, most companies building clouds, either private or public, have neither the full set of resources nor the IP to build these architectures themselves. A few do, but the rest seek an infrastructure that can get them there without having to compromise on important enterprise class features. These include capabilities like replication to ensure data availability and business continuity; efficiency features like tiering, deduplication and compression; backup, with best-in-class recovery points and recovery time objectives; security that's agile and risk-based; and virtualization, a key component for achieving the control, efficiency and choice clouds can deliver. 
Our approach to using our own internally developed software, integrated with industry-standard hardware that has been tested and tuned, enables us to deliver value to a customer that we believe is unparalleled amongst our peers. This formula is in lockstep with the transition to hybrid cloud and should keep us at the forefront of data center infrastructure. 
While we saw somewhat slower growth across the board due to the economy in Q3, we believe we are better positioned than our competitors to deliver value to our customers. As companies look to invest in the data center technologies that will support hybrid cloud architectures, they prefer storage solutions that will be optimized for the task at hand. We saw evidence of this in Q3 as our portfolio of complementary network storage platform products was up 2% over last year's Q3. 
Having different storage functionality for different application and workload needs is an important part of our strategy, and we work diligently to create a full complement of scale-out block, scale-out NAS, unified and backup solutions. Companies in all sectors of all sizes and with all sorts of IT challenges can look to us for a solution, which in many cases, is several different storage technologies within the same customer. While demand for various technology may ebb and flow quarter-to-quarter, this broad portfolio enables us to stay engaged with customers as we work to solve their problems, and it helps to drive our business over time. 
Our high-end storage products grew 5% over Q3 of last year. Our Symmetrix scale-out block solution had its first full quarter of availability for the refreshed family of VMAX 10K, 20K and 40K, and customers are embracing it. The new software functionality leverages the powerful standards-based hardware to deliver high-end reliability, availability and serviceability via an easy-to-use Unisphere interface. The transition to the new family continues to ramp well, and we expect it to be essentially complete by year end. 
Our mid-tier storage, comprised of our scale-out file, unified and backup solutions, was flat year-over-year for Q3 and up over 10% year-to-date. This quarter, results were driven by the Isilon scale-out NAS business. Isilon continues to do well in its traditional area of strength such as media and life sciences whilst expanding its presence in more traditional enterprise environments. The upcoming new Isilon OneFS operating system, Mavericks, which is on track to ship before year end is designed to drive Isilon into new verticals and expanded use cases. 
For unified block and file environments, customers continue to rely on the simple and efficient architecture of our VNX Family. Revenue in Q3 was down in the mid-single digits year-on-year. Given the environment, demand for the family was pretty good. However, due to the later-than-expected timing of some channel-related orders, we couldn't ship these orders in Q3 and had to move them to Q4. What was encouraging though is that the overall growth to our channel partners continued, driven in part by the popularity of VSPEX. In addition, our recently announced partnership with Lenovo will provide an incremental channel for the VNX Family over time, starting in China. 
Our purpose-built backup appliances, Data Domain and Avamar grew in Q3. It's worth noting that this business had a tough compare year-on-year and also suffered a bit from some delayed procure decisions by customers. While a pushout of these orders has an impact on Q3, we've already closed several of these deals early in Q4. 
Customers need comprehensive and leading-edge backup solutions as part of their next-generation data centers. A good example of how important the full backup portfolio is for the customer is Ochsner Health System, which has gone tapeless with its combination of Avamar, Data Domain, NetWorker, Data Protection Advisor and Disk Library for mainframe backup and storage environment, which is based on VMAX and VPLEX. The strategic value of having a strong Information Storage portfolio is clear, as we see customers adopting a broad range of EMC solutions to optimize the application environments. 
In Q3, we won a deal with the government administration that needed to accommodate 80 terabytes of VM storage and 850 terabytes of scientific data. A combination of VNX with 6 terabytes of Flash capacity and Isilon, provide the best value and the most efficient, scalable and easy-to-manage solution. 
We closed another deal in Q3 with a large health care company where having the full portfolio of storage solutions made the difference to the customer. This company needs a solid storage infrastructure to roll out several new applications in 2013. However, their old and failing storage infrastructure left them no room to grow, and their backup solution was severely lacking. A combination of VNX, Data Domain, Isilon and RecoverPoint handily beat the storage technology proposed by the incumbent server vendor. 
One of our more rewarding customer wins, illustrating the full value of the portfolio was with Cancer Research UK. With the combination of VFCache, VNX with Flash drives, vSphere, Data Domain and NetWorker, Cancer Research UK increased performance, improved efficiency and improved their disaster recovery capabilities. This example demonstrates the value Flash can add across the infrastructure, and we've made ""Flash everywhere"" a central tenet of our data center strategy. 
We first introduced SSDs on storage arrays back in 2008. We followed soon after that with the introduction of FAST software to automate the placement of data onto Flash for hot data and onto different types of disk for warm or cold data. And now 4 years after their introduction, these hybrid arrays have become the norm. Over half our arrays now ship with Flash drives and our FAST software. These intelligent, tiered network storage arrays provide a rich set of data services for data management, data efficiency and data availability. These intelligent arrays enable customers to derive more value, better performance, higher application availability and a lower total cost of ownership from their storage infrastructure than ever before. 
We extended our Flash capabilities with the development of VFCache, which is focused on turbocharging existing line of business applications in conjunction with storage arrays. In the case of Cancer Research UK, adding VFCache to their Oracle CRM application allowed them to reduce database query time by a factor of 6 and increase throughput by a factor of 3, allowing to complete 4 fundraising campaigns in the time it used to take them to complete one. 
We continue to innovate here as recent enhancements to VFCache demonstrates. The additions to VFCache we introduced last quarter include cache deduplication for server Flash, the first in the industry; interoperability between VFCache and vMotion; enhanced integration with VMAX; an expanded capacity VFCache PCIe cards, as well as multiple PCIe cards per server, for larger cache sets and greater performance. 
While VFCache is a focused cache use case for server-based Flash, it provides impressive intangible performance benefits for customers' enterprise applications, and the number of VFCache customers approximately doubled last quarter. There is much more to come as we continue to roll out our ""Flash everywhere"" strategy. And as we've previously stated, next year, we expect to bring to market new technologies. We plan to broaden our focus on server-based Flash by introducing best-in-class capacity and cost-optimized PCIe-attached DAS for performance-intensive applications that don't require storage data services. 
We'll introduce Project Thunder, an all-Flash storage appliance that attaches to the server network and allows the sharing of Flash resources across a multiple of these performance-intensive applications. Project Thunder leverages the same software we're developing for VFCache. 
We'll also introduce Project X, our innovative, all-Flash, scale-out storage array designed to offer the full data services of a storage array and the sub-millisecond performance provided by Flash. This is ideal for applications where 100% of the data is hot, or where the data is highly dedupable such as VDI or database test and dev environments. The customer access programs for these upcoming Flash technologies are going very, very well and generating a lot of interest and excitement. 
Across all our Flash products, the magic that brings Flash to life is our software. A great example of this is FAST, which automates the migration of data across tiers of storage based on patterns of use, both within a hybrid array and even across the interconnect to the server tier. FAST is so efficient that in some cases, 1% to 2% of the total capacity in Flash within a hybrid array can process over half the IOCs of the entire array. 
Our foundational play in Big Data, Greenplum, continues to help customers exploit the growing potential of Big Data analytics. Wins in Q3 include the deployment of Web analytics for a large government organization, website analytics for one of the largest retailers in the U.S. and one of the largest mobile telecoms in the U.S., a large-scale implementation to decrease the cost of data transformations in billing analytics. In this case, the customer was able to displace the incumbent data warehouse it was using for ETL with a far less expensive Hadoop map-reduce framework on Greenplum. 
Longtime EMC customers are also eager to capitalize on the data that they own as a large win at a global financial services company attests. As part of purchase that also included Vblock, VNX, SourceOne and Centera, this customer selected Greenplum for analytics of their e-mail. Greenplum continues to grow at strong double-digit rates. 
We're excited to have Paul Maritz spending a lot more of his time on our Big Data and next-generation application initiatives and look forward to expanding these initiatives in ways that will enable customers to take the full advantage of the potential Big Data offers. 
Like Big Data, security is also an area of focus with customers. As pro rata-based approaches to security become increasingly ineffective, customers are seeking new technologies that can help them better understand risk and defend against today's advanced threats. RSA continues to benefit as a result, with revenue up 6% year-on-year in Q3. Revenue from our security management and compliance business grew over 30%. The ability to manage risk and defend against advanced threats inside a network is an extremely hot area right now. Our SMC business provides the security analytics and GRC solutions to address these challenges, that just about every organization is facing. 
Our Identity & Data Protection business was impacted by 2 factors, specific to our secure IT business. The slowdown in overall hiring and employment, especially in Europe and Asia, was a stronger headwind than we expected, while last year's remediation of tokens disrupted the normal renewal cycle more than we expected. A cycle of product introductions expected in early 2013 will enable us to deliver new form factors of authentication and better address the authentication needs for mobile and cloud computing. Customer movements towards risk-based approaches and to security delivered as a service present great potential for our IDP business. We are more confident than ever that our security strategy, which is centered on agile solutions to combat emerging threats, is the right one. 
Revenue from our Information Intelligence Group was down 2% in Q3. License revenue continued to grow sequentially. IIG is innovating, creating solutions that are easy to deploy, easy to use and highly aligned with customers' needs. We've been leveraging the services expertise developed in specific verticals to create content-management-enabled solutions tailored to industry-specific requirements. A recent example is our Integrated Patient Record solutions, which enables health care organizations to access, share and transform disparate patient data, regardless of format or location and, importantly, lower cost in doing so. Our software developed especially for engineering plants and facilities management is also gaining traction. 
VMWare revenue grew 20% over last year's third quarter as companies continue to expand their virtual infrastructures to reduce the overall cost of their IT infrastructures and to put them on the path to cloud computing. We continue to enhance our integration with VMWare, and this is making a difference with customers. 
As you can see here, the percentage of customers survey who preferred EMC for their virtualized environments has increased significantly in just the past 6 months. This affinity will continue to be important, as VMWare moves in the direction of the software-defined data center, which is emerging as a clear path to cloud computing. While software-defined data center enables the dynamic creation of virtual infrastructure to leverage the underlying physical infrastructure, continued innovation in the infrastructure elements is essential in order to realize the full potential of a software-defined data center. We're excited to work towards reducing IT's complexity and costs via the automation the software-defined data center enables. 
Our go-to-market model continues to evolve as customers' options for how to leverage IT expand. We offer 3 avenues to get our customers to hybrid cloud: best-of-breed infrastructure components, proven infrastructure through VSPEX and converged infrastructure with Vblocks. Our services organization uses all 3 of these approaches as they continue to transition customers to cloud architectures. While customers deferred some discretionary consulting projects last quarter, and revenue from implementation services was impacted by a lighter storage product revenue, our services team continues to demonstrate its value to EMC's business strategy. 
Among the major EMC services wins achieved in Q3 was a 5-year enterprise-wide IT and consolidation initiative based on Vblock, VMAX, VNX, Data Domain and Avamar. This win at a global pharmaceutical company, completely displaced the incumbent server vendor and storage vendors with solutions from EMC and VCE and qualifies as one of the largest professional services deals ever. 
Our channel partners are also leveraging all 3 paths to the cloud, and VSPEX has become especially popular. With a variety of configurations through our partners to accommodate customer preferences, including technology from Citrix, Microsoft, HP, Cisco, Brocade and VMWare, VSPEX partners have a lot of freedom to create solutions they need and provide a lot of value for their end-user customers. In its first full quarter of availability since launching VSPEX in April, partners have sold well over 300 VSPEX systems, and because VSPEX solutions are simple, predictable and profitable, we expect that number to continue to ramp. 
We have made enormous progress in truly teaming with our channel partners, and as a result, our channel program continues to earn accolades. In Q3, EMC was named a Rising Star by the Global Tech Distribution Council, and we won 4 Company of the Year awards by CRN. With continued partner-centered innovation like the Q3 enablement of the Velocity [ph] distribution partners to assemble VSPEX for resellers, we expect to remain a favorite amongst our partners. 
Our service provider program is an important part of our strategy to get customers to public cloud, and we continue to make progress here with revenue from service provider program partners up over 40% from Q3 of last year. In Q3, CSC extended their well-established, EMC-powered BizCloud offering into a new vertical. Terremark, a Verizon company, completed their first EMC-powered public cloud offerings on Vblocks. Telstra expanded their cloud services in the quarter on EMC infrastructure. And Rackspace recently extended its global relationship with us to include Australia and New Zealand markets. EMC is the only external storage platform offered in Rackspace's new Sydney data center as Rackspace continues to make considerable investments in our storage technology. Our family of storage products from Atmos through to VMAX resonates with service providers, as it enables them to offer a full range of service levels to their customers with EMC as their infrastructure partner with deep technology and support capabilities. 
Finally, accelerating customers' journey to the cloud is the aim of our joint venture VCE. VCE continues to do very well with demand up approximately 30% year-on-year and approximately 20% quarter-on-quarter. This was obviously helpful to our year-on-year growth in Q3, as revenue from our components of every Vblock sold increases our storage and virtualization revenue. Vblocks continues to gain traction both in enterprise data centers as well as in service providers, and we saw this in Q3. A U.S.-based chemical company purchased 4 Vblocks as part of a solution that also included Data Domain, Avamar and Atmos. A European insurance company purchased a Vblock, alongside several VNXs. And a large construction equipment maker purchased Vblock with Data Domain and Avamar for Data Protection. Among service providers, CSC continues to expand their build out of Vblocks to power their public and private cloud businesses. Additionally, the second largest telco in Japan, SoftBank, will standardize on Vblock for their cloud-based offerings. SoftBank is already using Vblock systems for internal IT operations. In fact, 10 out of the top 15 global telcos are now Vblock customers. 
In sum, our go-to-market model enables us and our partners to make the right tool for the job available to many types of customer in the way that makes most sense for them. Our Q3 financial results were supported by our strong competitive position. While macro headwinds increased during the quarter, we still grew the overall business by 6% year-on-year. Within this, North America grew 9%, EMEA was flat, APJ grew 5% and Latin America grew 19%. Currency negatively impacted year-on-year revenue growth by about 150 basis points in Q3. 
Now let's turn to the income statement. We once again put together a waterfall analysis to show how various income statement items contributed to the non-GAAP EPS growth we achieved in Q3 of this year compared to Q3 of 2011. Gross margin continues to be an important factor. This quarter, non-GAAP gross margins were 64.1%, up 110 basis points from last year's Q3. The improvement here was driven by the increase in revenue mix and margin rate from VMWare. As you can see in the waterfall chart, increase in gross margin dollars was the biggest contributor to our EPS growth. 
Non-GAAP operating margins were 24.3%, up 30 basis points from Q3 of last year. Within the operating expense line, SG&A expenses grew more slowly than revenue, as we were careful with expense growth in the quarter. R&D grew faster than revenue, as we continue to invest in our leading-edge product portfolio. So investment in OpEx offset much of the gains we achieved from gross profits. 
Two other items had a meaningful impact on EPS growth, but effectively offset each other. Nonoperating expense was $54 million non-GAAP, down approximately $16 million from last year's Q3. And our tax rate was 23.5%, up from 22% in Q3 of 2011. We now expect our tax rate for the full year to be 22.5%, reflecting a higher mix of profits in the U.S. This assumes the U.S. R&D tax credit is passed in Q4. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.40, up 8% from last year, 2 points higher than revenue growth. 
Free cash flow was a solid $1.1 billion up 16% and about $250 million higher than non-GAAP net income for Q3. Contributing to this was growth in deferred revenue, up 26% year-on-year at $7.2 billion. Deferred revenue has become an increasingly important part of the financial picture for us, improving visibility and predictability of at least a portion of our revenue stream and enhancing cash flows. 
Along with our ability to consistently generate strong cash flow, comes a responsibility of allocating that capital wisely. We continue to make investments to keep us well positioned for the longer term while maintaining financial flexibility and returning cash to shareholders. Along those lines, we closed Q3 with $10.6 billion in cash and investments. Of this, $4 billion was U.S. cash, excluding VMWare. We spent approximately $1.3 billion in the quarter on acquisitions that will greatly enhance our ability to make hybrid cloud a reality for our customers. We returned $150 million of our cash to shareholders via the purchase of EMC stock in Q3, and we continue to expect to buy back $700 million worth of EMC shares in 2012. We see this balanced allocation of capital as the correct formula right now, given the opportunities we have ahead of us. However, we revisit it often, and we'll revise it accordingly when the time is right. 
Looking forward, we do not expect the economy to get better this year, but we do like how we've positioned the company near term and long term. We have a strategy that's built to leverage the 3 major waves of change in IT: cloud, Big Data and Trust, and we have what it takes to execute on this strategy, with leadership positions in storage, virtualization and security, a best-of-breed product portfolio with breadth and depth that's unique in the industry; a global EMC team that's second to none; and a solid operational and financial model that has demonstrated success across cycles. These advantages are critical to success regardless what the spending environment turns out to be. For the moment, this is not very clear, and in light of this uncertainty, we're updating our revenue and earnings expectations for 2012. 
For the full year 2012, we'd expect to achieve revenue in the range of $21.6 billion to $21.75 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share between $1.68 and $1.70. If the caution that characterized the end of Q3 continues through Q4, then we'd expect to be at the lower end of this range. If we experience the seasonal strength typical of a Q4, we'd expect to come in at the high end of this range. In either case, we feel very good about the opportunity for our business. With the continued ramp of new products like VMAX, with the continued expansion from our channel partners with innovative offerings like VSPEX, with the penetration of EMC infrastructure into VMWare environments, with the expansion of VMWare's capabilities within these virtualized environments and with the overall value proposition of the EMC portfolio, we believe we can continue to grow faster than our addressable markets whilst reinvesting our business and delivering leverage in earnings per share. We're confident we gained share in the first 3 quarters of 2012 and confident we'll continue to gain share in Q4. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Joe, who will give you more color on the macro, the quarter and the opportunities that lie ahead of us. Joe?"

We appreciate your interest in EMC. 
I would like to begin my formal remarks by clearly stating that we were disappointed that we did not quite meet our internal revenue expectations in Q3 and that we interrupted our string of 10 consecutive quarters of double-digit top and bottom line growth. But that said, I do believe that given the significant uncertainties that permeate the global stage right now and its negative impact on IT spending, we more than held our own. In fact, when all the reporting is in, and we're quite sure you'll find that EMC gained share across the major IT markets in which we play. 
I know how hard my 55,000-plus colleagues at EMC and VMWare worked, how dedicated they are to the success of our customers, how much they believe in our strategy, direction and future prospects. And for this, I want to deeply thank them and let them know how much I appreciate them. 
I would now like to comment on the uncertainty I just mentioned. First, there's economic uncertainty as demonstrated by the fact that most major markets around the world exhibited at least slightly lower GDP growth rates in Q3. In fact, one is hard pressed to find a major country that grew faster in Q3 2012 than it did last quarter in Q2 or it did in Q3 of 2011. 
This economic uncertainty has a twin brother called political uncertainty. Confidence in governments around the world that make productive and timely decisions on real pressing issues like deficit reductions and tax policies is at a low point. Collectively, these economic and political uncertainties are affecting business confidence, and this is affecting IT spending rates. 
In Q3, we found an air of caution in IT spending. Decisions were being subjected to far more scrutiny and this caused our bookings to be more back-end loaded than expected, resulting in more late orders, some too late to ship and some slippage out of the quarter. That said, to be clear, we still believe that IT spending in the second half of this year will show some year-on-year growth, albeit at a slower rate than was experienced in the first half of this year. 
To put growth rates around that statement, last quarter, we said we expected overall 2012 IT spending to be around 3%, possibly a tick less. We now expect 2012 global IT spending to be approximately 2%. Looking forward, and assuming political cooperation and reasonableness prevails, we do expect that in Q4, IT spending has a potential to grow over Q3 in a fairly normal seasonal pattern. Obviously, this growth will now be coming off a lower Q3 baseline, and again, we believe that the overall IT market will exhibit some growth, year-on-year in Q4. 
As customary, we will comment on 2013 IT spending on our January earnings call, but I will tell you that as we put together our 2013 business plan, our forecast calls for modest growth in the IT market as a whole. Net-net, against this backdrop in Q3, we grew our business year-over-year in North America by 9%; in APJ by 5%; by 19% in Latin America; and our business at EMEA was essentially flat. And as in past quarters, we saw our highest growth rates in the rapid growth economies. Across our BRIC plus 13 countries, we grew over 10% in Q3 versus the same period last year. 
A few minutes ago, I expressed confidence that EMC is and will continue to gain market share, so a fair question is why, why the confidence? The first answer to that question is, because we have confidence in our innovative strategies and products and we have all-important momentum. As a proof point, let's quickly review the key innovative strategies of EMC and VMWare. We have a software-defined data center strategy that dramatically extends the benefits of virtualization. I truly believe this software technology will spark a revolution in the data center market through the tight integration and automation of compute, storage, network and security infrastructure assets. This will help customers receive unmatched efficiency, control, choice and agility. We have an end-user computing strategy called Horizon that helps our customers manage and secure their end-user computing environments in a multi-device, post-PC world. 
We have a storage strategy for tomorrow's software-defined data centers and hybrid cloud environments. Storage that combines both Flash technology and hard drives, coupled with true automation for tiering and seamless flexible information management and protection. We have a Cloud Foundry strategy for working with developers on new approaches to building new applications, as well as ones for helping customers renew and cloudify existing ones. We have a strategy for Big Data, one that will harness the vast sea of information in realtime to help customers make better decisions faster. This new approach works with both structured and unstructured information, not only from within one's own enterprise, but from public and semipublic data sources. And we have a strategy for security that is pervasive across all of our offerings. In other words, built in, built in for today's era of cloud computing. 
So you can see why we are confident. In fact, I have never been more excited about our future growth prospects. But these compelling strategies alone are insufficient, what makes me even more confident in our future is our leadership team and the talent EMC and VMWare has behind them. Pat Gelsinger has assumed the reins of VMWare, and he's being very well received and doing a stellar job. David Goulden is leading EMC's information infrastructure business to new heights. David's grasp of the business and his leadership style is exemplary. Paul Maritz's innovative brilliance will help take our developers' platform and our Big Data business to the next level. Both of these areas are high-growth opportunities for us. And the best news is our broader leadership team which Pat, David, Paul and I are blessed to work with is very strong, very talented and very focused. 
To help give you a clearer view of our innovation and strategies and for you to get to know our leadership team better, it is my pleasure to invite you to join us for a strategic forum, which we will host for analysts and investors in Q1 of next year. We will get you the specifics of this forum ASAP. 
I would now like to address one more topic before I turn it back to Tony to moderate the Q&A portion of today's call. I would like to comment on our relationship with Cisco and the future of our VCE joint venture. For the record, EMC and Cisco have benefited from a decade-long partnership. My close personal relationship with John Chambers goes back over 20 years, and we enjoy our friendship of trust and confidence in each other that is reflected in the way our teams work together. 
Some have called into question the viability of our relationship with Cisco and VCE because of VMWare's entrance into the networking space. The reality is that software-defined networking complements the network infrastructure, and EMC has no plans to drive deeper into networking by acquiring a network hardware company. We believe continued innovation and network infrastructure by the partner ecosystem will enable higher performance transmission of data in next-generation data centers. In short, we are committed to work closely and cooperatively with Cisco, our premier partner. 
VCE is a top strategic priority for EMC. We continue to ramp investments in VCE, which continues to meet and exceed our business objectives, approaching a $1 billion run rate in less than 3 years. There are now over 500 VCE customer deployments, including many in large Fortune 500 companies. These customers demanded and are receiving the benefits of rapid deployment, higher performance and higher availability, and very importantly, they are getting these benefits at a lower total cost of ownership. In short, we believe VCE represents the fastest and most cost-effective way for organizations to build out their cloud infrastructures, and we are committed to VCE's success. 
Thank you, and now back to Tony."

A phenomenon that we're seeing in the high end is particularly when customers are kind of scrutinizing their budgets, they're really looking for TCO and cost savings, we do see a phenomena of consolidation in multiple mid-tier systems into the high end, so that helps as well. In terms of sequentially -- yes, you're right, but it wasn't the only part of the business that was down sequentially from a product point of view. The macro and the factors we talked about impacted basically most parts of the business, so there's nothing really unique about the high end in terms of being down sequentially.

I think one of the things you'd be missing in those trends is how big the private cloud is going to be. And as David said, there are probably less than a handful of companies that are truly capable of having the resources to take components and build their own private cloud, like a Google could for instance. So obviously, what we're doing with the journey of virtualization into the software-defined data center is we're building that technology, and that's going to be a great -- I think, a great driver for us. Also, our highest growth area, if you looked at it kind of on a vertical basis, would have been in the service providers. You heard on the VMWare call yesterday, where they said second time is on Web services, there's the most number of apps running by far, and whoever's third is way, way, way behind that, running on the VMWare infrastructure. Most of those infrastructures also run EMC's infrastructures, those service provider companies. So again, we are riding well on those 2 trends. Big Data is a big growth area for us, and we don't see that that's disruptive. A lot of these data mining applications did not run on our technology yesterday, so we think we could be a net winner there. And when you look at some of the things that are happening on private clouds -- or excuse me, public clouds and on the service provider front, a lot of what they're attacking there is kind of shadow IT, and that was never a big win for -- in some test and dev. So test and dev impacts us a little bit, but again, we're picking that up with our service provider partners, and we never were a big winner with shadow IT. So I think we're in pretty good shape going forward here. I think we're in very good shape going forward. And if you looked at the 6 strategic areas that I outlined, which again, we'll talk to you more about next quarter in real depth, our future is incredibly bright, in my opinion."

It really was the macro. They were relative to our expectations. And the mid-tier product growth sector, there were 2 things that happened. One is that we had more late orders than we expected, which means there are more orders that we couldn't ship in the quarter than we expected, that's going to help us in the fourth quarter. Similarly, but a little different, we had orders that we were expecting to win that got pushed out to the fourth quarter, because customers pulling the extra decision cycle, pushed those orders out. So again, now as those orders close and some of them already have, particularly in the BRS area, will also help us a little bit in the mid-tier. So it's really the macro, more than a execution issue. And for some of the factors that I just mentioned, we do think we're going to have a rebound in the mid-tier in the fourth quarter as a sector. And then relative to the overall market, we feel good at the top level. When we look at our 6% growth versus IT spending, we absolutely gained market share. Relative to the storage business, we think that from what we saw in the field with our win rates, both the high-end and the mid-tier, we think that we'll still be a net share gainer there. And you look at our network storage product revenues, against those that others have either reported or have out there for consensus, and we feel pretty good about that aspect of our growth. So every way we look at it, we think we're a net share gainer and it's the macro here as opposed to any micro issues."

So from a competitive point of view, I'd say the pricing pressures were consistent with normal, so no massive difference in the landscape on a competitive point of view. What we did see is, we saw some incremental impact from our customers, as they applied extra scrutiny and kind of worked their transactions harder, so there was additional customer pressure, and we did see continuing benefits from mix, as you mentioned. Specifically, relative to quarter-to-quarter, there were 2 factors that drove the reduction. One is that, if you remember back in Q2, we had some benefits as we have closed out the RSA situation and reversed what was left of the charge. Some of that went to operating margins -- to gross margins, sorry, that gave us about 20 bps improvement. And also quarter-on-quarter, there were some additional amortization in capitalized software. You factor those out, and gross margins would have been flat quarter-on-quarter. And then if volumes had been kind of where we thought they would be at the start of the quarter, you'd have seen an increase in gross margin sequentially, so that's the story, what's going on there."
