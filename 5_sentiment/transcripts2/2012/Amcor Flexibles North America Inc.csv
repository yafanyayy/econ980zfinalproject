I want to begin by recapping our 2011 performance and take some time to talk through our facility consolidation program.In 2011, we continued to successfully integrate our expanded manufacturing footprin",691,"Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I want to begin by recapping our 2011 performance and take some time to talk through our facility consolidation program.
In 2011, we continued to successfully integrate our expanded manufacturing footprint and eliminate duplicative specifications. In addition, we successfully acquired Mayor Packaging in China, which gives us a high barrier footprint focused on the growing food packaging market in that region.
In December, we bought a small operation in North America that gives us access to the high barrier bulk liquid market from which we intend to expand. These acquisitions both position us to go into new markets.
I am pleased that we are able to accomplish these important strategic actions, and we entered 2012 with a clear path to grow our operating profit in the future on a global basis.
During 2011, we faced a number of market challenges that led to unsatisfactory financial performance. I'd like to explain the impact of 3 specific challenges we faced in 2011 and why we feel more confident as we look ahead to 2012 and beyond, namely: dramatic resin price increases, challenging customer pricing terms and volume decline. 
First, resin prices increased dramatically during the first half of the year. These increases were related to a number of market pressures, some of which were unique to particularly specialty resins. While commodity resin costs weaken during the second half, offering some relief, our specialty resin costs remain flat. Due to the time late built into our customer pricing agreements that delays our ability to pass along changes in raw material costs, we realized the decline in our profitability throughout the year.
The second major challenge in 2011 was unfavorable price adjustment formulas in certain of our customer agreements, which delayed our ability to pass along higher raw material costs. We expect to have improved most of our customer pricing agreements to more favorable terms by the end of 2012.
Lastly, during the second half of 2011, unit sales volumes softened and high barrier packaging for meat and cheese, Derian liquids, specialty food products, this volume decrease was modest, and we believe it was related to the consumer responds to higher retail prices in the grocery stores.
We expect these high barrier packaging volumes to grow modestly in 2012 with the commercialization of new business. 
In sales of packaging for applications such as confectionery, snack, bakery, pet food and hygiene products, the decline in unit sales volume during the second half of the year was reflective of a combination of weaker consumer demand and specific pricing actions that we had taken to improve our sales mix to generate higher profits.
In the fourth quarter, we began a facility consolidation that includes 3 main categories of activities: plant closings, improved sales mix, rightsizing of administrative work force. 
We recently announced the closure of 5 North American facilities. These facilities are smaller in size and, therefore, more expensive to support with appropriate levels of engineering and administrative talent. We are closing 3 legacy Bemis plants and 2 legacy outcome plans. Production from these facilities is being transferred to more efficient facilities.
In North America, Latin America and Europe, we reduced our administrative and production workforce in 2011 to match our workforce to meet current production needs. 
Some of the benefits of our facility consolidation program will be reflected in 2012. The majority of the benefits will be recognized beginning in 2013, including improved production efficiency, better sales mix and lower fixed costs.
We're also making investments in technologies and geographies where we will continue to see increased demand. In 2012, we will expand our newly acquired facility in China to meet the growing demand from current customers and accommodate the increasing opportunities for our business in that region. In North America, we are also investing at our high barrier affordable sheets for barrier concentrates where our capacity is nearly sold-out.
During the next 12 months, we will improve our expense structure, shut down lower margin capacity and increase our production efficiency to drive better performance and cash flow in the future.
Now Scott will review the financial results."

Today, I will walk through the results of the quarter, as well as the financial details of the facilities consolidation program and then discuss our 2012 guidance.In the fourth quarter of 2011, excluding specia",1257,"Thanks, Henry, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will walk through the results of the quarter, as well as the financial details of the facilities consolidation program and then discuss our 2012 guidance.
In the fourth quarter of 2011, excluding special charges, adjusted earnings per share was $0.45. This exceeded our guidance of $0.36 to $0.42 per share as we experienced stronger-than-expected orders in our Mayor Packaging business in China, tight cost controls and Europe, slightly lower polyethylene costs at the end of the quarter and lower than expected benefit costs.
Looking specifically at the operating results of the quarter, and excluding special charges, the 1.7% increase in net sales reflects the impact of the acquisitions of Mayor and Shield Pack. 
Comparing our fourth quarter fixable packaging sales to the same quarter of 2010, selling prices were generally higher across the business and response to the significant raw material cost increases that we experienced during the first half of 2011 and passed through to customers in Q4.
The impact of higher selling price during the fourth quarter was completely offset by lower unit sales volumes in most product categories across our North American, Latin American and European operations. In North and South America, the volume decrease primarily reflects soft demand trends for certain customer products, including pet food, bakery, Confectionery, snacks and health and hygiene products.
In Europe, our fixable packaging business experienced double-digit volume declines, while sales mix improved, reflecting our decisions to take pricing action in certain low margin relationships and focus on business that delivers better returns on sales.
As a result of these volume trends, operating profit declined in North and South America due principally to lower overhead absorption, while profitability moved higher in our European business reflecting our improve sales mix and expense control. In total, and excluding the impact of special charges, flexible packaging operating profit was $111.4 million or 9.8% of net sales in 2011 compared to $119.7 million or 10.8% of net sales during the fourth quarter of 2010.
During the fourth quarter of 2011, we began a facility consolidation program that resulted in our fourth quarter charge of $38.4 million. This charge is higher than our initial estimate due to our ability to accelerate consolidation activities into the fourth quarter. Of this total, $26.3 million related to employee costs, and the remaining $12.1 million was associated with the write-down of fixed assets and the relocation of equipment.
The program is expected to be completed by early 2013, and the total estimated cost is expected to be approximately $83 million, including employee-related costs of about $28 million. Most of which were included in the fourth quarter, as I mentioned. The remaining $55 million of costs represent charges associated with the write-down of fixed assets, lease, termination costs, accelerated depreciation and equipment move costs.
Cash payments related to the facility consolidation program are expected to total nearly $60 million, of which $3.1 million was paid in 2011. 
Future savings associated with this program are expected to be approximately $40 million per year. A portion of these annualized savings will be recognized during 2012, but we expect increased costs associated with the transition of production to new facilities to offset these savings.
The full benefit of the savings is expected to be achieved in each year, beginning in 2013.
Turning to guidance. We're entering 2012 with some favorable financial momentum. We repurchased 5 million shares of stock in 2011, added earnings from 3 acquisitions, and we plan to refinance our bond with lower rate commercial paper in the second quarter of 2012.
By the end of 2012, we should start to realize some of the benefits of the facilities' closures. But this positive momentum is offset by volume concerns, higher pension expense, a weakening European economic outlook and the expected weaker real. The net result is our 2012 adjusted earnings per share guidance of $2.05 to $2.20, which excludes the impact of any of the facility consolidation or other special charges.
For the first quarter, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.43 to $0.49. Where we will fall on that range will depend on the sales volume levels and the start up of production move from closed plants.
Our first quarter is generally one of the slowest volume quarters of the year, while the second end 3rd quarters our seasonally stronger. Our first quarter guidance assumes that soft demand conditions continue, but we expect that volumes will increase modestly during the year.
As Henry explained, some of the capacity consolidation efforts underway will result in deliberate volume reductions, offsetting the impact of our volume growth and high barrier sales.
With respect to raw material costs, our first quarter guidance incorporates the impact of the recent $0.11 polyethylene cost increases announced in the market, and our total year guidance assumes that any other changes in raw material costs will be passed along to customers, which in reality will depend of the timing of the raw material increases.
With regard to selling, general and administrative expenses, in 2012, we recorded and increased pension expense of about $15 million and we will make will make a pension contribution of $30 million. With this contribution, we maintained pension funded status above 90% for 2012.
In October of 2011, we issued a $400 million 10-year bond in advance of our upcoming bond maturity in 2012. The proceeds of that bond issue was were used to reduce our commercial paper balance outstanding. We expect to refinance our $300 million bond that matures in April 2012 using commercial paper, which will lower our interest cost on that debt from about 4.9% to less than 1%.
Commercial paper can also be readily repaid, which will allow us to reduce our outstanding debt during 2012.
At year-end 2011, our ratio of net debt to adjusted earnings before interest taxes, depreciation and amortization was 2.3x compared to 1.9x at the end of 2010. Debt increased in connection with a approximately $240 million reinvested in 3 acquisitions in 2011, which represent high values strategic moves for Bemis. The repurchase of the outstanding shares of our Dixie Toga subsidiary, the acquisition of Mayor Packaging in China and the acquisition of Shield Pack.
Over time, we are managing the balance sheet to a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of about 2x, which is about where we expect to be by the end of 2012.
We have remaining board authorization to repurchase up to 4.5 million shares of common stock, which we will do opportunistically in conjunction with our other priorities for capital spending. In 2012, after paying our dividend and funding capital expenditures, our priority is debt production.
The tax rate we have used for our 2012 guidance is consistent with our 2011 rate of 36.2%. Depreciation and amortization is expected to be close to $230 million in 2012, with capital expenditures at approximately $175 million.
Cash flow from operations for the total year 2011 was $416.6 million, a 13.2% increase from 2010. Cash flow from operations for 2012 is expected to be approximately $350 million, which incorporates an estimated $35 million for the facility consolidation program.
With our improved expense structure and the completion of our facility consolidation program, we expect cash flow from operations to continue to grow and exceed $500 million by 2014. Our disciplined use of capital will also help drive improvement in our return on capital and shareholder value over the long term.
Now operator, we'll be pleased to take any questions."

I want to begin by recapping our 2011 performance and take some time to talk through our facility consolidation program.In 2011, we continued to successfully integrate our expanded manufacturing footprin",695,"Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I want to begin by recapping our 2011 performance and take some time to talk through our facility consolidation program.
In 2011, we continued to successfully integrate our expanded manufacturing footprint and eliminate duplicative specifications. In addition, we successfully acquired Mayor Packaging in China, which gives us a high barrier footprint focused on the growing food packaging market in that region.
In December, we bought a small operation in North America that gives us access to the high barrier bulk liquid market from which we intend to expand. These acquisitions both position us to grow in new markets.
I am pleased that we are able to accomplish these important strategic actions, and we entered 2012 with a clear path to grow our operating profit in the future on a global basis.
During 2011, we faced a number of market challenges that led to unsatisfactory financial performance. I'd like to explain the impact of 3 specific challenges we faced in 2011 and why we feel more confident as we look ahead to 2012 and beyond, namely: dramatic resin price increases, challenging customer pricing terms and volume decline. 
First, resin prices increased dramatically during the first half of the year. These increases were related to a number of market pressures, some of which were unique to particularly specialty resins. While commodity resin costs weakened during the second half, offering some relief, our specialty resin costs remained flat. Due to the time lag built into our customer pricing agreements that delays our ability to pass along changes in raw material costs, we realized the decline in our profitability throughout the year.
The second major challenge in 2011 was unfavorable price adjustment formulas in certain of our customers' agreements, which delayed our ability to pass along higher raw material costs. We expect to have improved most of our customer pricing agreements to more favorable terms by the end of 2012.
Lastly, during the second half of 2011, unit sales volumes softened in high barrier packaging for meat and cheese, dairy and liquids, specialty food products. This volume decrease was modest, and we believe it was related to the consumer response to higher retail prices in the grocery stores.
We expect these high barrier packaging volumes to grow modestly in 2012 with the commercialization of new business. 
In sales of packaging for applications such as confectionery, snack, bakery, pet food and hygiene products, the decline in unit sales volume during the second half of the year was reflective of a combination of weaker consumer demand and specific pricing actions that we have taken to improve our sales mix to generate higher profits.
In the fourth quarter, we began a facility consolidation that includes 3 main categories of activities: plant closings, improved sales mix, rightsizing of administrative work force. 
We recently announced the closure of 5 North American facilities. These facilities are smaller in size and, therefore, more expensive to support with appropriate levels of engineering and administrative talent. We are closing 3 legacy Bemis plants and 2 legacy Alcan plants. Production from these facilities is being transferred to more efficient facilities.
In North America, Latin America and Europe, we reduced our administrative and production workforce in 2011 to match our workforce to meet current production needs. 
Some of the benefits of our facility consolidation program will be reflected in 2012. The majority of the benefits will be recognized beginning in 2013, including improved production efficiency, better sales mix and lower fixed costs.
We are also making investments in technologies and geographies where we will continue to see increased demand. In 2012, we will expand our newly acquired facility in China to meet the growing demand from current customers and accommodate the increasing opportunities for our business in that region. In North America, we are also investing at our high barrier thermoformable sheets for barrier cups and trays, where our capacity is nearly sold-out.
During the next 12 months, we will improve our expense structure, shut down lower margin capacity and increase our production efficiency to drive better performance and cash flow in the future.
Now Scott will review the financial results."
255132,146284721,210598,"Bemis Company, Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Jan 25, 2012",2012-01-25,"Earnings Calls","Amcor Flexibles North America Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Henry, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will walk through the results of the quarter, as well as the financial details of the facilities consolidation program, and then discuss our 2012 guidance.In the fourth quarter of 2011, excluding speci",1254,"Thanks, Henry, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will walk through the results of the quarter, as well as the financial details of the facilities consolidation program, and then discuss our 2012 guidance.
In the fourth quarter of 2011, excluding special charges, adjusted earnings per share was $0.45. This exceeded our guidance of $0.36 to $0.42 per share, as we experienced stronger-than-expected orders in our Mayor Packaging business in China, tight cost controls in Europe, slightly lower polyethylene costs at the end of the quarter and lower than expected benefit costs.
Looking specifically at the operating results of the quarter and excluding special charges, the 1.7% increase in net sales reflects the impact of the acquisitions of Mayor and Shield Pack. 
Comparing our fourth quarter flexible packaging sales to the same quarter of 2010, selling prices were generally higher across the business in response to the significant raw material cost increases that we experienced during the first half of 2011 and passed through to customers in Q4.
The impact of higher selling price during the fourth quarter was completely offset by lower unit sales volumes in most product categories across our North American, Latin American and European operations. In North and South America, the volume decrease primarily reflects soft demand trends for certain customer products, including pet food, bakery, confectionery, snacks and health and hygiene products.
In Europe, our fixable packaging business experienced double-digit volume declines, while sales mix improved, reflecting our decisions to take pricing action in certain low margin relationships and focus on business that delivers better returns on sales.
As a result of these volume trends, operating profit declined in North and South America due principally to lower overhead absorption, while profitability moved higher in our European business reflecting our improve sales mix and expense control. In total, and excluding the impact of special charges, flexible packaging operating profit was $111.4 million or 9.8% of net sales in 2011 compared to $119.7 million or 10.8% of net sales during the fourth quarter of 2010.
During the fourth quarter of 2011, we began a facility consolidation program that resulted in our fourth quarter charge of $38.4 million. This charge is higher than our initial estimate due to our ability to accelerate consolidation activities into the fourth quarter. Of this total, $26.3 million related to employee costs and the remaining $12.1 million was associated with the write-down of fixed assets and the relocation of equipment.
The program is expected to be completed by early 2013, and the total estimated cost is expected to be approximately $83 million, including employee-related costs of about $28 million. Most of which were included in the fourth quarter, as I mentioned. The remaining $55 million of costs represent charges associated with the write-down of fixed assets, lease, termination costs, accelerated depreciation and equipment move costs.
Cash payments related to the facility consolidation program are expected to total nearly $60 million, of which $3.1 million was paid in 2011. 
Future savings associated with this program are expected to be approximately $40 million per year. A portion of these annualized savings will be recognized during 2012, but we expect increased costs associated with the transition of production to new facilities to offset these savings.
The full benefit of the savings is expected to be achieved in each year, beginning in 2013.
Turning to guidance. We're entering 2012 with some favorable financial momentum. We repurchased 5 million shares of stock in 2011, added earnings from 3 acquisitions, and we plan to refinance a bond with lower-rate commercial paper in the second quarter of 2012.
By the end of 2012, we should start to realize some of the benefits of the facilities' closures. But this positive momentum is offset by volume concerns, higher pension expense, a weakening European economic outlook and the expected weaker real. The net result is our 2012 adjusted earnings per share guidance of $2.05 to $2.20, which excludes the impact of any of the facility consolidation or other special charges.
For the first quarter, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.43 to $0.49. Where we will fall on that range will depend on the sales volume levels and the start-up of production move from closed plants.
Our first quarter is generally one of the slowest volume quarters of the year, while the second and third quarters are seasonally stronger. Our first quarter guidance assumes that soft demand conditions continue, but we expect that volumes will increase modestly during the year.
As Henry explained, some of the capacity consolidation efforts underway will result in deliberate volume reductions, offsetting the impact of our volume growth in high barrier sales.
With respect to raw material costs, our first quarter guidance incorporates the impact of the recent $0.11 polyethylene cost increases announced in the market, and our total year guidance assumes that any other changes in raw material costs will be passed along to customers, which in reality will depend on the timing of the raw material increases.
With regard to selling, general and administrative expenses, in 2012, we will record an increase in pension expense of about $15 million, and we will make a pension contribution of $30 million. With this contribution, we maintain pension funded status above 90% for 2012.
In October of 2011, we issued a $400 million 10-year bond in advance of our upcoming bond maturity in 2012. The proceeds of that bond issuance were used to reduce our commercial paper balance outstanding. We expect to refinance our $300 million bond that matures in April 2012 using commercial paper, which will lower our interest cost on that debt from about 4.9% to less than 1%. Commercial paper can also be readily repaid, which will allow us to reduce our outstanding debt during 2012.
At year end 2011, our ratio of net debt to adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization was 2.3x compared to 1.9x at the end of 2010. Debt increased in connection with  approximately $240 million we invested in 3 acquisitions in 2011, which represent high-value strategic moves for Bemis: the repurchase of the outstanding shares of our Dixie Toga subsidiary, the acquisition of Mayor Packaging in China and the acquisition of Shield Pack.
Over time, we are managing the balance sheet to a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of about 2x, which is about where we expect to be by the end of 2012.
We have remaining board authorization to repurchase up to 4.5 million shares of common stock, which we will do opportunistically in conjunction with our other priorities for capital spending. In 2012, after paying our dividend and funding capital expenditures, our priority is debt production.
The tax rate we have used for our 2012 guidance is consistent with our 2011 rate of 36.2%. Depreciation and amortization is expected to be close to $230 million in 2012, with capital expenditures at approximately $175 million.
Cash flow from operations for the total year 2011 was $416.6 million, a 13.2% increase from 2010. Cash flow from operations for 2012 is expected to be approximately $350 million, which incorporates an estimated $35 million for the facility consolidation program.
With our improved expense structure and the completion of our facility consolidation program, we expect cash flow from operations to continue to grow and exceed $500 million by 2014. Our disciplined use of capital will also help drive improvement in our return on capital and shareholder value over the long term.
Now operator, we'll be pleased to take any questions."

And that would've occurred really in our polyethylene division, where the time lag from when the resin goes in place to when it is actually passed on to the consumer. Mostly because it is a very straightforward business of making film and then printing it and selling it, it doesn't have the work in process and the complications of some of our higher barrier operations. So those resins flow through better. So we got a little bit of a bump,  a little -- more than we expected in the fourth quarter and that small segment of our business, in that specific segment of our business. We know -- do know that there are announced price increases. We will start to feel some of those effects, I think, late first quarter. We could have a little bit of carryover of the reduction in polyethylene prices in the first part, but I think that's going to kind of neutralize itself. As far as long-term, specialty resins, we have in our guidance here for the full year that they will be relatively flat. My only comment I can make to you is we follow benzene prices and in a lot of benzene, what caused benzene drives a lot of those specialty resins. And it has some upward momentum, so I don't know how that's all going to play out."

I want to begin by recapping our 2011 performance and take some time to talk through our facility consolidation program.In 2011, we continued to successfully integrate our expanded manufacturing footprin",695,"Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I want to begin by recapping our 2011 performance and take some time to talk through our facility consolidation program.
In 2011, we continued to successfully integrate our expanded manufacturing footprint and eliminate duplicative specifications. In addition, we successfully acquired Mayor Packaging in China, which gives us a high barrier footprint focused on the growing food packaging market in that region.
In December, we bought a small operation in North America that gives us access to the high barrier bulk liquid market from which we intend to expand. These acquisitions both position us to grow in new markets.
I am pleased that we were able to accomplish these important strategic actions, and we enter 2012 with a clear path to grow our operating profit in the future on a global basis.
During 2011, we faced a number of market challenges that led to unsatisfactory financial performance. I'd like to explain the impact of 3 specific challenges we faced in 2011 and why we feel more confident as we look ahead to 2012 and beyond, namely: dramatic resin price increases, challenging customer pricing terms and volume decline. 
First, resin prices increased dramatically during the first half of the year. These increases were related to a number of market pressures, some of which were unique to particularly specialty resins. While commodity resin costs weakened during the second half, offering some relief, our specialty resin costs remained flat. Due to the time lag built into our customer pricing agreements that delays our ability to pass along changes in raw material costs, we realized a decline in our profitability throughout the year.
The second major challenge in 2011 was unfavorable price adjustment formulas in certain of our customers' agreements, which delayed our ability to pass along higher raw material costs. We expect to have improved most of our customer pricing agreements to more favorable terms by the end of 2012.
Lastly, during the second half of 2011, unit sales volumes softened in high barrier packaging for meat and cheese, dairy and liquids, specialty food products. This volume decrease was modest, and we believe it was related to the consumer response to higher retail prices in the grocery stores.
We expect these high barrier packaging volumes to grow modestly in 2012 with the commercialization of new business. 
In sales of packaging for applications such as confectionery, snack, bakery, pet food and hygiene products, the decline in unit sales volume during the second half of the year was reflective of a combination of weaker consumer demand and specific pricing actions that we have taken to improve our sales mix to generate higher profits.
In the fourth quarter, we began a facility consolidation that includes 3 main categories of activities: plant closings, improved sales mix, rightsizing of administrative work force. 
We recently announced the closure of 5 North American facilities. These facilities are smaller in size and, therefore, more expensive to support with appropriate levels of engineering and administrative talent. We are closing 3 legacy Bemis plants and 2 legacy Alcan plants. Production from these facilities is being transferred to more efficient facilities.
In North America, Latin America and Europe, we reduced our administrative and production workforce in 2011 to match our workforce to meet current production needs. 
Some of the benefits of our facility consolidation program will be reflected in 2012. The majority of the benefits will be recognized beginning in 2013, including improved production efficiency, better sales mix and lower fixed costs.
We are also making investments in technologies and geographies where we will continue to see increased demand. In 2012, we will expand our newly acquired facility in China to meet the growing demand from current customers and accommodate the increasing opportunities for our business in that region. In North America, we are also investing in our high barrier thermoformable sheets for barrier cups and trays, where our capacity is nearly sold-out.
During the next 12 months, we will improve our expense structure, shut down low margin capacity and increase our production efficiency to drive better performance and cash flow in the future.
Now Scott will review the financial results."
255132,146284721,210625,"Bemis Company, Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Jan 25, 2012",2012-01-25,"Earnings Calls","Amcor Flexibles North America Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Henry, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will walk through the results of the quarter, as well as the financial details of the facilities consolidation program and then discuss our 2012 guidance.In the fourth quarter of 2011, excluding specia",1250,"Thanks, Henry, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will walk through the results of the quarter, as well as the financial details of the facilities consolidation program and then discuss our 2012 guidance.
In the fourth quarter of 2011, excluding special charges, adjusted earnings per share was $0.45. This exceeded our guidance of $0.36 to $0.42 per share, as we experienced stronger-than-expected orders in our Mayor Packaging business in China, tight cost controls in Europe, slightly lower polyethylene costs at the end of the quarter and lower-than-expected benefit costs.
Looking specifically at the operating results of the quarter and excluding special charges, the 1.7% increase in net sales reflects the impact of the acquisitions of Mayor and Shield Pack. 
Comparing our fourth quarter flexible packaging sales to the same quarter of 2010, selling prices were generally higher across the business in response to the significant raw material cost increases that we experienced during the first half of 2011 and passed through to customers in Q4.
The impact of higher selling price during the fourth quarter was completely offset by lower unit sales volumes in most product categories across our North American, Latin American and European operations. In North and South America, the volume decrease primarily reflects soft demand trends for certain customer products, including pet food, bakery, confectionery, snacks and health and hygiene products.
In Europe, our fixable packaging business experienced double-digit volume declines, while sales mix improved, reflecting our decisions to take pricing action in certain low margin relationships and focus on business that delivers better returns on sales.
As a result of these volume trends, operating profit declined in North and South America due principally to lower overhead absorption, while profitability moved higher in our European business, reflecting our improve sales mix and expense control. In total, and excluding the impact of special charges, flexible packaging operating profit was $111.4 million or 9.8% of net sales in 2011 compared to $119.7 million or 10.8% of net sales during the fourth quarter of 2010.
During the fourth quarter of 2011, we began a facility consolidation program that resulted in a fourth quarter charge of $38.4 million. This charge is higher than our initial estimate due to our ability to accelerate consolidation activities into the fourth quarter. Of this total, $26.3 million related to employee costs and the remaining $12.1 million was associated with the write-down of fixed assets and the relocation of equipment.
The program is expected to be completed by early 2013, and the total estimated cost is expected to be approximately $83 million, including employee-related costs of about $28 million, most of which were included in the fourth quarter, as I mentioned. The remaining $55 million of costs represent charges associated with the write-down of fixed assets, lease termination costs, accelerated depreciation and equipment move costs.
Cash payments related to the facility consolidation program are expected to total nearly $60 million, of which $3.1 million was paid in 2011. 
Future savings associated with this program are expected to be approximately $40 million per year. A portion of these annualized savings will be recognized during 2012, but we expect increased costs associated with the transition of production to new facilities to offset these savings.
The full benefit of the savings is expected to be achieved each year, beginning in 2013.
Turning to guidance. We're entering 2012 with some favorable financial momentum. We repurchased 5 million shares of stock in 2011, added earnings from 3 acquisitions, and we plan to refinance a bond with lower-rate commercial paper in the second quarter of 2012.
By the end of 2012, we should start to realize some of the benefits of the facilities' closures. But this positive momentum is offset by volume concerns, higher pension expense, a weakening European economic outlook and the expected weaker real. The net result is our 2012 adjusted earnings per share guidance of $2.05 to $2.20, which excludes the impact of any of the facility consolidation or other special charges.
For the first quarter, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.43 to $0.49. Where we will fall in that range will depend on the sales volume levels and the start-up of production moved from closed plants.
Our first quarter is generally one of the slowest volume quarters of the year, while the second and third quarters are seasonally stronger. Our first quarter guidance assumes that soft demand conditions continue, but we expect that volumes will increase modestly during the year.
As Henry explained, some of the capacity consolidation efforts underway will result in deliberate volume reductions, offsetting the impact of our volume growth in high barrier sales.
With respect to raw material costs, our first quarter guidance incorporates the impact of the recent $0.11 polyethylene cost increases announced in the market, and our total year guidance assumes that any other changes in raw material costs will be passed along to customers, which in reality will depend on the timing of the raw material increases.
With regard to selling, general and administrative expenses, in 2012, we will record an increase in pension expense of about $15 million, and we will make a pension contribution of $30 million. With this contribution, we maintain pension funded status above 90% for 2012.
In October of 2011, we issued a $400 million 10-year bond in advance of our upcoming bond maturity in 2012. The proceeds of that bond issuance were used to reduce our commercial paper balance outstanding. We expect to refinance our $300 million bond that matures in April 2012 using commercial paper, which will lower our interest cost on that debt from about 4.9% to less than 1%. Commercial paper can also be readily repaid, which will allow us to reduce our outstanding debt during 2012.
At year-end 2011, our ratio of net debt to adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization was 2.3x compared to 1.9x at the end of 2010. Debt increased in connection with approximately $240 million we invested in 3 acquisitions in 2011, which represent high-value strategic moves for Bemis: the repurchase of the outstanding shares of our Dixie Toga subsidiary, the acquisition of Mayor Packaging in China and the acquisition of Shield Pack.
Over time, we are managing the balance sheet to a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of about 2x, which is about where we expect to be by the end of 2012.
We have remaining board authorization to repurchase up to 4.5 million shares of common stock, which we will do opportunistically in conjunction with our other priorities for capital spending. In 2012, after paying our dividend and funding capital expenditures, our priority is debt reduction.
The tax rate we have used for our 2012 guidance is consistent with our 2011 rate of 36.2%. Depreciation and amortization is expected to be close to $230 million in 2012, with capital expenditures at approximately $175 million.
Cash flow from operations for the total year 2011 was $416.6 million, a 13.2% increase from 2010. Cash flow from operations for 2012 is expected to be approximately $350 million, which incorporates an estimated $35 million for the facility consolidation program.
With our improved expense structure and the completion of our facility consolidation program, we expect cash flow from operations to continue to grow and exceed $500 million by 2014. Our disciplined use of capital will also help drive improvement in our return on capital and shareholder value over the long term.
Now operator, we'll be pleased to take any questions."

And that would've occurred really in our polyethylene division, where the time lag from when the resin goes in place to when it is actually passed on to the consumer, mostly because it is a very straightforward business of making film and then printing it and selling it. It doesn't have the work in process and the complications of some of our higher barrier operations. So those resins flow through better. So we got a little bit of a bump, a little -- more than we expected in the fourth quarter in that small segment of our business, in that specific segment of our business. We know -- do know that there are announced price increases. We will start to feel some of those effects, I think, late first quarter. We could have a little bit of carryover of the reduction in polyethylene prices into the first part, but I think that's going to kind of neutralize itself. As far as long-term, specialty resins, we have in our guidance here for the full year that they will be relatively flat.

There's a lot of yogurt sales there, and we are a big provider to that market and ice cream packages, things like that. So there are some refrigerated foods, but it's really not the meat and cheese business that we have here in the U.S. When we look at our North American business, roughly 25% to 30% of our sales in North America are into meat and cheese markets and then an additional, say, 10% to 12% in dairy and liquids. And those are refrigerated products that are high barrier, higher-margin, good business for us that we invest in heavily. On the Brazil side, those are still small. The meat and cheese is less than 10% of their total sales. And while dairy and liquids is important to them, there's still opportunity for that to grow in the future. So as we move forward, as Henry said, we're making investments in moving some of our high-barrier technology down to Brazil in order to ensure that we have the right capacity to match those volumes as they continue to grow over the next couple of years."

My comments today will address the current market environment, what we expect for the rest of this year and our progress on initiatives to improve profitability and return on invested capital.With respect to the current market environment,",619,"Good morning. My comments today will address the current market environment, what we expect for the rest of this year and our progress on initiatives to improve profitability and return on invested capital.
With respect to the current market environment, the generally weak levels of demand that we experienced during the second half of 2011 has continued to 2012 as expected. There are pockets of growth in certain product areas but overall demand is reflecting careful grocery stores and some trading down by customers to less expensive options that may not use flexible packaging.
That said, the growth initiatives of our customers include promotions, as well as new product extensions to be launched in a flexible format. We're also starting to see new business ramp up, which should help to boost volumes during the second half of the year. 
During the first quarter, our suppliers announced a number of raw material cost increases. None of these increases is of the magnitude that we saw during the first half of 2011. But they will put modest pressure on operating margins in the second and third quarters until all selling prices can be adjusted.
So as we look forward to the rest of the year, we expect raw material cost increases to subside and level out for a while and we expect customer demand to increase as we move into the second half of 2012. 
We have made progress and modifying the price agreements with some customers and will continue this initiative as contracts come for renewal. These changes will shorten the time that takes to adjust the seller process and raw materials cost change, reducing the impact of raw material cost changes on our operating performance and cash flows. 
We continued to implement specific pricing actions to address poor profitability on some products and we are willing to walk away from business if necessary. We have made progress with our facility consolidation program and expect to complete the closure of 2 of our North American facilities during the second quarter. Our teams are doing a great job of transferring production to new facilities while keeping an eye on our costs.
At the same time, we are expanding our footprint in China to meet the growing demand from that region. This capital investment will be ramping up commercial production during the second half of this year. In Latin America, we are expanding our capabilities in Brazil to deliver our high barrier technology to our Latin American customers. This market continues to be challenged with slowing economic growth and a relatively strong currency.
We have a lot of opportunities for expansion in that region of the world and our business teams are focused on leveraging our global scale to create a competitive advantage and drive growth.
We have been constantly managing cost in our European operations as we continuously experience sluggish unit sales volumes in the face of a weak European economy. We expect this economic environment to continue through the rest of the year.
We are currently working out a number of innovative new products that we are gaining attention from our customers. In addition to our current sales in the dairy segment, we are finding new applications for our rigid sheet film and other liquid products including pudding, yogurt and baby food. Customers are excited about our recyclable solution that reduce environmentally unfriendly materials from packaging. In another example our Peel Reseal technology is providing customers with a cost beneficial solution that uses a combination of our easy peel and our pressure sensitive adhesive technologies, which provide easy open and reclosable features. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Scott to review the financial performance for the quarter."
255132,204625166,289702,"Bemis Company, Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2012",2012-04-26,"Earnings Calls","Amcor Flexibles North America Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Henry. Good morning, everyone. This quarter, we recorded adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.49 at the top of our guidance range and $0.02 better than the first quarter of 2011.

This quarter, we recorded adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.49 at the top of our guidance range and $0.02 better than the first quarter of 2011. The primary driver for this improvement was a better ratio of selling prices to raw material costs in 2012. In late 2010 and early 2011, we were experiencing dramatic increases in raw material costs that negatively impacted our price to cost ratio through the first 3 quarters in 2011. While we have adjusted our selling prices to reflect higher raw material price increases, our flexible packaging volumes have tracked the generally weak volumes of our customers. This trend began in the second half of 2011 and we expect it to continue to the first half of 2012. 
Unit sales volumes were lower in total, but they were not lower across the board. I'll give you some examples and then provide some views about what is driving these results. Compared to the first quarter of 2011, volumes were up in packaging applications for meat, dairy products, coffee, dry foods, condiments, stick packs and over wrap for packaged beverages.
Volumes were lower in other application categories, including cheese, bakery, confectionery and snacks, quick preparation meals, pet food, health and hygiene products, the pharmaceuticals. You can take away a few themes from this quarter's end market volumes. 
First, consumers have been willing to trade down in product quality to lower-priced products. For example, at frozen pizza. Along the same lines, consumers have exhibited careful buying patterns, including shifting away from more expensive prepared meal packaging formats. We've also seen examples of consumers purchasing lower-priced products that do not come in flexible packaging. For example, dry pasta. 
It's also clear that food pricing, which is in the groceries stores shelves are constraining consumer demands but some of our customers expect the sticker shock to abate this consumers get used to higher price points.
Volumes in our flexible packaging business will be an important factor in our ability to continue to grow earnings. And our facilities consolidation program, combined with our world-class manufacturing initiatives should deliver positive momentum in waste management and productivity. These benefits are expected to be realized next year.
Shifting to our pressure sensitive material segment. Volumes in total were better same as last year's first quarter and financial results were roughly consistent with last year's first quarter. Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $3 million compared to the first quarter of 2011, reflecting increased pension costs. Research and development expenses increased $3.3 million over the first quarter of 2011 and still remain below 1% of net sales. 
Our investment in R&D reflect our commitment to drive innovative packaging and decent technologies that offer valuable solutions to customers. Looking at adjusted operating profits of the fixable packaging business segment, the 10.2% margin was a 30% basis point improvement from the first quarter of 2011 and a 40 basis point improvement from the fourth quarter. This improvement also reflects the benefits of a closer alignment between the prices we charge for our products and the costs we incur to purchase raw materials.
In the pressure sensitive materials business segment, operating margins were relatively consistent with the first quarter of 2011 at about 6.7%. This is 180 basis points better than the fourth quarter of 2011, reflecting nice results in our technical products business, which is one of our focus areas for profitable growth in our pressure sensitive material segment.
Summarizing the financial impact of our facilities consolidation, we recorded $8.3 million of related expenses during the first quarter, which is divided between $1.2 million for employee costs and $7.1 million of costs associated with writing down fixed assets.
We expect the total remaining expenses of the facilities consolidation program to be approximately $37 million, most of which will be expensed during 2012. Keep in mind that some of these facilities consolidation expenses are noncash charges and others require the use of cash. There are also timing differences. For example, with severance expenses between when we booked charges and when we pay out cash.
Cash payed for facilities consolidation costs during the first quarter totaled $8 million. This cash outlay represented employees's severance and other costs for expenses incurred in the fourth quarter of 2011, as well as the first quarter of 2012. We expect to use another $24 million in cash during 2012 and about $17 million in cash in 2013.
Our effective tax rate was 35.3% for the first quarter. This was an aberration and we expect our effective tax rate for full year to be approximately 36%, consistent with recent years. The lower tax rate did not affect our operating profit, net income or cash taxes. 
Cash provided by operating activities totaled $48.7 million for first quarter. Working capital increased by about  $62 million, reflecting the normal build of inventory as we enter our seasonally strong second quarter, as well as the increase in accounts receivables since the balance reflects stronger net sales for the month of March compared to the month of December.
Looking ahead, our guidance for the second quarter is $0.51 to $0.57 in earnings per share. We expect the first quarter raw material cost increases to impact the second quarter but no additional increases have been reflected in our full year guidance, which we are maintaining at $2.05 to $2.20 per share. 
While we are up in that range will be driven largely by volumes in our flexible packaging business, our full year guidance assumes strengthening volumes in the second half of the year versus volumes we have seen so far this year, but I want to make an important qualifier. The volumes did not improve meaningfully. Earnings may be in the low end of our 2012 EPS guidance.
On April 2, we used commercial paper to repay $300 million of bonds that matured. So interest expense is expected to come down by about $3 million per quarter as we reduce the rate from the commercial paper rate of about 40 basis points. We also intend to use excess cash generated in 2012 to reduce outstanding commercial paper in line with our target net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of approximately 2x. We continue to expect capital expenditures for 2012 to be in the $175 million range and cash flow from operations to exceed $350 million.
Now we will open the call for questions."

My comments today will address the current market environment, what we expect for the rest of this year and our progress on initiatives to improve profitability and return on invested capital.With respect to the current market environment,",623,"Good morning. My comments today will address the current market environment, what we expect for the rest of this year and our progress on initiatives to improve profitability and return on invested capital.
With respect to the current market environment, the generally weak levels of demand that we experienced during the second half of 2011 has continued into 2012 as expected. There are pockets of growth in certain product areas, but overall demand is reflecting careful buying at grocery stores and some trading down by customers to less expensive options that may not use flexible packaging.
That said, the growth initiatives of our customers include promotions, as well as new product extensions to be launched in a flexible format. We're also starting to see new business ramp up, which should help to boost volumes during the second half of the year. 
During the first quarter, our suppliers announced a number of raw material cost increases. None of these increases is of the magnitude that we saw during the first half of 2011. But they will put modest pressure on operating margins in the second and third quarters until all selling prices can be adjusted.
So as we look forward to the rest of the year, we expect raw material cost increases to subside and level out for a while and we expect customer demand to increase as we move into the second half of 2012. 
We have made progress in modifying the price agreements with some customers and we'll continue this initiative as contracts come up for renewal. These changes will shorten the time that takes to adjust selling prices when raw materials cost change, reducing the impact of raw material cost changes on our operating performance and cash flows. 
We continued to implement specific pricing actions to address poor profitability on some products and we are willing to walk away from business if necessary. We have made progress with our facility consolidation program and expect to complete the closure of 2 of our North American facilities during the second quarter. Our teams are doing a great job of transferring production to new facilities while keeping an eye on costs.
At the same time, we are expanding our footprint in China to meet the growing demand from that region. This capital investment will be ramping up commercial production during the second half of this year. In Latin America, we are expanding our capabilities in Brazil to deliver our high barrier technology to our Latin American customers. This market continues to be challenged with slowing economic growth and a relatively strong currency. We have a lot of opportunities for expansion in that region of the world and our business teams are focused on leveraging our global scale to create a competitive advantage and drive growth. We have been closely managing cost in our European operations as we continued to experience sluggish unit sales volumes in the face of a weak European economy. We expect this economic environment to continue through the rest of the year.
We are currently working out a number of innovative new products that we are gaining attention from our customers. In addition to our current sales in the dairy segment, we are finding new applications for our rigid sheet film and other liquid products, including pudding, yogurt and baby food. Customers are excited about our recyclable solution that removes environmentally unfriendly polyvinylidene chloride materials from packaging. In another example, our Peel Reseal technology is providing customers with a cost beneficial solution that uses a combination of our easy peel and our pressure sensitive adhesive technologies, which provide easy open and reclosable features. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Scott to review the financial performance for the quarter."

This quarter, we recorded adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.49 at the top of our guidance range and $0.02 better than the first quarter of 2011. The primary driver for this improvement was a better ratio of selling prices to raw material costs in 2012. In late 2010 and early 2011, we were experiencing dramatic increases in raw material costs that negatively impacted our price-to-cost ratio through the first 3 quarters of 2011. While we have adjusted our selling prices to reflect higher raw material prices, our flexible packaging volumes have tracked the generally weak volumes of our customers. This trend began in the second half of 2011 and we expect it to continue through the first half of 2012. 
Unit sales volumes were lower in total, but they were not lower across the board. I'll give you some examples and then provide some views about what is driving these results. Compared to the first quarter of 2011, volumes were up in packaging applications for meat, dairy products, coffee, dry foods, condiments, stick packs and overwrap for packaged beverages. Volumes were lower in other application categories, including cheese, bakery, confectionery and snacks, quick preparation meals, pet food, health and hygiene products and pharmaceuticals. You can take away a few themes from this quarter's end market volumes.
First, consumers have been willing to trade down in product quality to lower-priced products, for example, in frozen pizza. Along the same lines, consumers have exhibited careful buying patterns, including shifting away from more expensive prepared meal packaging formats. We have also seen examples of consumers purchasing lower-priced products that do not come in flexible packaging, for example, dry pasta. 
It's also clear that food price increases on the grocery store shelf are constraining consumer demand, but some of our customers expect the sticker shock to abate as consumers get used to higher price points.
Volumes in our flexible packaging business will be an important factor in our ability to continue to grow earnings. And our facilities consolidation program, combined with our world-class manufacturing initiatives, should deliver positive momentum in waste management and productivity. These benefits are expected to be realized next year.
Shifting to our pressure sensitive material segment. Volumes in total were about the same as last year's first quarter and financial results were roughly consistent with last year's first quarter. Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $3 million compared to the first quarter of 2011, reflecting increased pension costs. Research and development expenses increased $3.3 million over the first quarter of 2011 and still remain below 1% of net sales. Our investments in R&D reflect our commitment to drive innovative packaging and adhesive technologies that offer valuable solutions to customers. 
Looking at adjusted operating profits of the flexible packaging business segment, the 10.2% margin was a 30% basis point improvement from the first quarter of 2011 and a 40 basis point improvement from the fourth quarter. This improvement also reflects the benefits of a closer alignment between the prices we charge for our products and the costs we incur to purchase raw materials.
In the pressure sensitive materials business segment, operating margins were relatively consistent with the first quarter of 2011 at about 6.7%. This is 190 basis points better than the fourth quarter of 2011, reflecting nice results in our technical products business, which is one of our focus areas for profitable growth in our pressure sensitive material segment.
Summarizing the financial impact of our facilities consolidation, we recorded $8.3 million of related expenses during the first quarter, which is divided between $1.2 million for employee costs and $7.1 million of costs associated with writing down fixed assets.
We expect the total remaining expenses for the facilities consolidation program to be approximately $37 million, most of which will be expensed during 2012. Keep in mind that some of these facilities consolidation expenses are noncash charges and others require the use of cash. There are also timing differences, for example, with severance expenses between when we booked charges and when we pay out cash.
Cash paid for facilities consolidation costs during the first quarter totaled $8 million. This cash outlay represented employees' severance and other costs for expenses incurred in the fourth quarter of 2011, as well as the first quarter of 2012. We expect to use another $24 million in cash during 2012 and about $17 million in cash in 2013.
Our effective tax rate was 35.3% for the first quarter. This was an aberration and we expect our effective tax rate for the full year to be approximately 36%, consistent with recent years. The lower tax rate did not affect operating profit, net income or cash taxes. 
Cash provided by operating activities totaled $48.7 million for first quarter. Working capital increased by about $62 million, reflecting the normal build of inventory as we enter our seasonally strong second quarter, as well as the increase in accounts receivables since the balance reflects stronger net sales for the month of March compared to the month of December.
Looking ahead, our guidance for the second quarter is $0.51 to $0.57 in earnings per share. We expect the first quarter raw material cost increases to impact the second quarter, but no additional increases have been reflected in our full year guidance, which we are maintaining at $2.05 to $2.20 per share. 
Where we end up in that range will be driven largely by volumes in our flexible packaging business, our full year guidance assumes strengthening volumes in the second half of the year versus volumes we have seen so far this year, but I want to make an important qualifier. The volumes do not improve meaningfully. Earnings may be on the low end of our 2012 EPS guidance.
On April 2, we used commercial paper to repay $300 million of bonds that matured. So interest expense is expected to come down by about $3 million per quarter as we reduce the rate from the commercial paper rate of about 40 basis points. We also intend to use excess cash generated in 2012 to reduce outstanding commercial paper in line with our target net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of approximately 2x. We continue to expect capital expenditures for 2012 to be in the $175 million range and cash flow from operations to exceed $350 million.
Now we will open the call for questions."

My comments today will address the current market environment, what we expect for the rest of this year and our progress on initiatives to improve profitability and return on invested capital.With respect to the current market environment,",623,"Good morning. My comments today will address the current market environment, what we expect for the rest of this year and our progress on initiatives to improve profitability and return on invested capital.
With respect to the current market environment, the generally weak levels of demand that we experienced during the second half of 2011 has continued into 2012 as expected. There are pockets of growth in certain product areas, but overall demand is reflecting careful buying at grocery stores and some trading down by customers to less expensive options that may not use flexible packaging.
That said, the growth initiatives of our customers include promotions, as well as new product extensions to be launched in a flexible format. We're also starting to see new business ramp up, which should help to boost volumes during the second half of the year. 
During the first quarter, our suppliers announced a number of raw material cost increases. None of these increases is of the magnitude that we saw during the first half of 2011. But they will put modest pressure on operating margins in the second and third quarters until all selling prices can be adjusted.
So as we look forward to the rest of the year, we expect raw material cost increases to subside and level out for a while and we expect customer demand to increase as we move into the second half of 2012. 
We have made progress in modifying the price agreements with some customers and we'll continue this initiative as contracts come up for renewal. These changes will shorten the time that takes to adjust selling prices when raw materials cost change, reducing the impact of raw material cost changes on our operating performance and cash flows. 
We continued to implement specific pricing actions to address poor profitability on some products and we are willing to walk away from business if necessary. We have made progress with our facility consolidation program and expect to complete the closure of 2 of our North American facilities during the second quarter. Our teams are doing a great job of transferring production to new facilities while keeping an eye on costs.
At the same time, we are expanding our footprint in China to meet the growing demand from that region. This capital investment will be ramping up commercial production during the second half of this year. In Latin America, we are expanding our capabilities in Brazil to deliver our high barrier technology to our Latin American customers. This market continues to be challenged with slowing economic growth and a relatively strong currency. We have a lot of opportunities for expansion in that region of the world and our business teams are focused on leveraging our global scale to create a competitive advantage and drive growth. We have been closely managing cost in our European operations as we continued to experience sluggish unit sales volumes in the face of a weak European economy. We expect this economic environment to continue through the rest of the year.
We are currently working out a number of innovative new products that we are gaining attention from our customers. In addition to our current sales in the dairy segment, we are finding new applications for our rigid sheet film in other liquid products, including pudding, yogurt and baby food. Customers are excited about our recyclable solution that removes environmentally unfriendly polyvinylidene chloride materials from packaging. In another example, our Peel Reseal technology is providing customers with a cost beneficial solution that uses a combination of our easy peel and our pressure sensitive adhesive technologies, to provide easy open and reclosable features. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Scott to review the financial performance for the quarter."
255132,204625166,290536,"Bemis Company, Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2012",2012-04-26,"Earnings Calls","Amcor Flexibles North America Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Henry. Good morning, everyone. This quarter, we recorded adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.49 at the top of our guidance range and $0.02 better than the first quarter of 2011.

This quarter, we recorded adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.49 at the top of our guidance range and $0.02 better than the first quarter of 2011. The primary driver for this improvement was a better ratio of selling prices to raw material costs in 2012. In late 2010 and early 2011, we were experiencing dramatic increases in raw material costs that negatively impacted our price-to-cost ratio through the first 3 quarters of 2011. While we have adjusted our selling prices to reflect higher raw material prices, our flexible packaging volumes have tracked the generally weak volumes of our customers. This trend began in the second half of 2011 and we expect it to continue through the first half of 2012. 
Unit sales volumes were lower in total, but they were not lower across the board. I'll give you some examples and then provide some views about what is driving these results. Compared to the first quarter of 2011, volumes were up in packaging applications for meat, dairy products, coffee, dry foods, condiments, stick packs and overwrap for packaged beverages. Volumes were lower in other application categories, including cheese, bakery, confectionery and snacks, quick preparation meals, pet food, health and hygiene products and pharmaceuticals. You can take away a few themes from this quarter's end market volumes.
First, consumers have been willing to trade down in product quality to lower-priced products, for example, in frozen pizza. Along the same lines, consumers have exhibited careful buying patterns, including shifting away from more expensive prepared meal packaging formats. We have also seen examples of consumers purchasing lower-priced products that do not come in flexible packaging, for example, dry pasta. 
It's also clear that food price increases on the grocery store shelf are constraining consumer demand, but some of our customers expect the sticker shock to abate as consumers get used to higher price points.
Volumes in our flexible packaging business will be an important factor in our ability to continue to grow earnings. And our facilities consolidation program, combined with our world-class manufacturing initiatives, should deliver positive momentum in waste management and productivity. These benefits are expected to be realized next year.
Shifting to our pressure sensitive material segment. Volumes in total were about the same as last year's first quarter and financial results were roughly consistent with last year's first quarter. Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $3 million compared to the first quarter of 2011, reflecting increased pension costs. Research and development expenses increased $3.3 million over the first quarter of 2011 and still remain below 1% of net sales. Our investments in R&D reflect our commitment to drive innovative packaging and adhesive technologies that offer valuable solutions to customers. 
Looking at adjusted operating profits of the flexible packaging business segment, the 10.2% margin was a 30% basis point improvement from the first quarter of 2011 and a 40 basis point improvement from the fourth quarter. This improvement also reflects the benefits of a closer alignment between the prices we charge for our products and the costs we incur to purchase raw materials.
In the pressure sensitive materials business segment, operating margins were relatively consistent with the first quarter of 2011 at about 6.7%. This is 190 basis points better than the fourth quarter of 2011, reflecting nice results in our technical products business, which is one of our focus areas for profitable growth in our pressure sensitive material segment.
Summarizing the financial impact of our facilities consolidation, we recorded $8.3 million of related expenses during the first quarter, which was divided between $1.2 million for employee costs and $7.1 million of costs associated with writing down fixed assets.
We expect the total remaining expenses for the facilities consolidation program to be approximately $37 million, most of which will be expensed during 2012. Keep in mind that some of these facilities consolidation expenses are noncash charges and others require the use of cash. There are also timing differences, for example, with severance expenses between when we booked charges and when we pay out cash.
Cash paid for facilities consolidation costs during the first quarter totaled $8 million. This cash outlay represented employees' severance and other costs for expenses incurred in the fourth quarter of 2011, as well as the first quarter of 2012. We expect to use another $24 million in cash during 2012 and about $17 million in cash in 2013.
Our effective tax rate was 35.3% for the first quarter. This was an aberration and we expect our effective tax rate for the full year to be approximately 36%, consistent with recent years. The lower tax rate did not affect operating profit, net income or cash taxes. 
Cash provided by operating activities totaled $48.7 million for first quarter. Working capital increased by about $62 million, reflecting the normal build of inventory as we enter our seasonally strong second quarter, as well as the increase in accounts receivables since the balance reflects stronger net sales for the month of March compared to the month of December.
Looking ahead, our guidance for the second quarter is $0.51 to $0.57 in earnings per share. We expect the first quarters raw material cost increases to impact the second quarter, but no additional increases have been reflected in our full year guidance, which we are maintaining at $2.05 to $2.20 per share. 
Where we end up in that range will be driven largely by volumes in our flexible packaging business, our full year guidance assumes strengthening volumes in the second half of the year versus volumes we have seen so far this year, but I want to make an important qualifier. If volumes do not improve meaningfully. Earnings may be on the low end of our 2012 EPS guidance.
On April 2, we used commercial paper to repay $300 million of bonds that matured. So interest expense is expected to come down by about $3 million per quarter as we reduce the rate from the commercial paper rate of about 40 basis points. We also intend to use excess cash generated in 2012 to reduce outstanding commercial paper in line with our target net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of approximately 2x. We continue to expect capital expenditures for 2012 to be in the $175 million range and cash flow from operations to exceed $350 million.
Now we will open the call for questions."

My comments today will address the current market environment, what we expect for the rest of this year and our progress on initiatives to improve profitability and return on invested capital.With respect to the current market environment,",623,"Good morning. My comments today will address the current market environment, what we expect for the rest of this year and our progress on initiatives to improve profitability and return on invested capital.
With respect to the current market environment, the generally weak levels of demand that we experienced during the second half of 2011 has continued into 2012 as expected. There are pockets of growth in certain product areas, but overall demand is reflecting careful buying at grocery stores and some trading down by customers to less expensive options that may not use flexible packaging.
That said, the growth initiatives of our customers include promotions, as well as new product extensions to be launched in a flexible format. We're also starting to see new business ramp up, which should help to boost volumes during the second half of the year. 
During the first quarter, our suppliers announced a number of raw material cost increases. None of these increases is of the magnitude that we saw during the first half of 2011. But they will put modest pressure on operating margins in the second and third quarters until all selling prices can be adjusted.
So as we look forward to the rest of the year, we expect raw material cost increases to subside and level out for a while and we expect customer demand to increase as we move into the second half of 2012. 
We have made progress in modifying the price agreements with some customers and we'll continue this initiative as contracts come up for renewal. These changes will shorten the time that takes to adjust selling prices when raw materials cost change, reducing the impact of raw material cost changes on our operating performance and cash flows. 
We continued to implement specific pricing actions to address poor profitability on some products and we are willing to walk away from business if necessary. We have made progress with our facility consolidation program and expect to complete the closure of 2 of our North American facilities during the second quarter. Our teams are doing a great job of transferring production to new facilities while keeping an eye on costs.
At the same time, we are expanding our footprint in China to meet the growing demand from that region. This capital investment will be ramping up commercial production during the second half of this year. In Latin America, we are expanding our capabilities in Brazil to deliver our high barrier technology to our Latin American customers. This market continues to be challenged with slowing economic growth and a relatively strong currency. We have a lot of opportunities for expansion in that region of the world and our business teams are focused on leveraging our global scale to create a competitive advantage and drive growth. We have been closely managing cost in our European operations as we continued to experience sluggish unit sales volumes in the face of a weak European economy. We expect this economic environment to continue through the rest of the year.
We are currently working out a number of innovative new products that we are gaining attention from our customers. In addition to our current sales in the dairy segment, we are finding new applications for our rigid sheet film in other liquid products, including pudding, yogurt and baby food. Customers are excited about our recyclable solution that removes environmentally unfriendly polyvinylidene chloride materials from packaging. In another example, our Peel Reseal technology is providing customers with a cost beneficial solution that uses a combination of our easy peel and our pressure sensitive adhesive technologies, to provide easy open and reclosable features. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Scott to review the financial performance for the quarter."
255132,204625166,290642,"Bemis Company, Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2012",2012-04-26,"Earnings Calls","Amcor Flexibles North America Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Henry. Good morning, everyone. This quarter, we recorded adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.49 at the top of our guidance range and $0.02 better than the first quarter of 2011. The primary driver for this improvement was a better ratio of s",1068,"Thanks, Henry. Good morning, everyone. This quarter, we recorded adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.49 at the top of our guidance range and $0.02 better than the first quarter of 2011. The primary driver for this improvement was a better ratio of selling prices to raw material costs in 2012. In late 2010 and early 2011, we were experiencing dramatic increases in raw material costs that negatively impacted our price-to-cost ratio through the first 3 quarters of 2011. While we have adjusted our selling prices to reflect higher raw material prices, our flexible packaging volumes have tracked the generally weak volumes of our customers. This trend began in the second half of 2011 and we expect it to continue through the first half of 2012. 
Unit sales volumes were lower in total, but they were not lower across the board. I'll give you some examples and then provide some views about what is driving these results. Compared to the first quarter of 2011, volumes were up in packaging applications for meat, dairy products, coffee, dry foods, condiments, stick packs and overwrap for packaged beverages. Volumes were lower in other application categories, including cheese, bakery, confectionery and snacks, quick preparation meals, pet food, health and hygiene products and pharmaceuticals. You can take away a few themes from this quarter's end market volumes.
First, consumers have been willing to trade down in product quality to lower-priced products, for example, in frozen pizza. Along the same lines, consumers have exhibited careful buying patterns, including shifting away from more expensive prepared meal packaging formats. We have also seen examples of consumers purchasing lower-priced products that do not come in flexible packaging, for example, dry pasta. 
It's also clear that food price increases on the grocery store shelf are constraining consumer demand, but some of our customers expect the sticker shock to abate as consumers get used to higher price points.
Volumes in our flexible packaging business will be an important factor in our ability to continue to grow earnings. And our facilities consolidation program, combined with our world-class manufacturing initiatives, should deliver positive momentum in waste management and productivity. These benefits are expected to be realized next year.
Shifting to our pressure sensitive material segment. Volumes in total were about the same as last year's first quarter and financial results were roughly consistent with last year's first quarter. Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $3 million compared to the first quarter of 2011, reflecting increased pension costs. Research and development expenses increased $3.3 million over the first quarter of 2011 and still remain below 1% of net sales. Our investments in R&D reflect our commitment to drive innovative packaging and adhesive technologies that offer valuable solutions to customers. 
Looking at adjusted operating profits of the flexible packaging business segment, the 10.2% margin was a 30% basis point improvement from the first quarter of 2011 and a 40 basis point improvement from the fourth quarter. This improvement also reflects the benefits of a closer alignment between the prices we charge for our products and the costs we incur to purchase raw materials.
In the pressure sensitive materials business segment, operating margins were relatively consistent with the first quarter of 2011 at about 6.7%. This is 190 basis points better than the fourth quarter of 2011, reflecting nice results in our technical products business, which is one of our focus areas for profitable growth in our pressure sensitive material segment.
Summarizing the financial impact of our facilities consolidation, we recorded $8.3 million of related expenses during the first quarter, which was divided between $1.2 million for employee costs and $7.1 million of costs associated with writing down fixed assets.
We expect the total remaining expenses for the facilities consolidation program to be approximately $37 million, most of which will be expensed during 2012. Keep in mind that some of these facilities consolidation expenses are noncash charges and others require the use of cash. There are also timing differences, for example, with severance expenses between when we booked charges and when we pay out cash.
Cash paid for facilities consolidation costs during the first quarter totaled $8 million. This cash outlay represented employees' severance and other costs for expenses incurred in the fourth quarter of 2011, as well as the first quarter of 2012. We expect to use another $24 million in cash during 2012 and about $17 million in cash in 2013.
Our effective tax rate was 35.3% for the first quarter. This was an aberration and we expect our effective tax rate for the full year to be approximately 36%, consistent with recent years. The lower tax rate did not affect operating profit, net income or cash taxes. 
Cash provided by operating activities totaled $48.7 million for first quarter. Working capital increased by about $62 million, reflecting the normal build of inventory as we enter our seasonally strong second quarter, as well as the increase in accounts receivables since the balance reflects stronger net sales for the month of March compared to the month of December.
Looking ahead, our guidance for the second quarter is $0.51 to $0.57 in earnings per share. We expect the first quarters raw material cost increases to impact the second quarter, but no additional increases have been reflected in our full year guidance, which we are maintaining at $2.05 to $2.20 per share. 
Where we end up in that range will be driven largely by volumes in our flexible packaging business, our full year guidance assumes strengthening volumes in the second half of the year versus volumes we have seen so far this year, but I want to make an important qualifier. If volumes do not improve meaningfully, earnings may be on the low end of our 2012 EPS guidance.
On April 2, we used commercial paper to repay $300 million of bonds that matured. So interest expense is expected to come down by about $3 million per quarter as we reduce the rate from the commercial paper rate of about 40 basis points. We also intend to use excess cash generated in 2012 to reduce outstanding commercial paper in line with our target net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of approximately 2x.

And so we're adding production to adjusting facilities. So really we don't expect see any net cost benefits in 2012 and they'll show up in 2013. Obviously, there's not a hard line at December 31 and January 1, but that's the way to think about it for 2012."

This morning, we announced earnings of $0.54 per share in the middle of our guidance. We are pleased to have delivered performance improvements in the face of a difficult operating environment at the same time. At the same time, we are revis",1119,"Good morning. This morning, we announced earnings of $0.54 per share in the middle of our guidance. We are pleased to have delivered performance improvements in the face of a difficult operating environment at the same time. At the same time, we are revising our outlook for volume for the total you. Based upon a commentary of our large customers, back in April we had expected our volume levels to increase during the second half of this year. We are now revising this expectation and believe volume for the second half of the year will be approximately the same as the first half. Overall volume in 2012 is expected to decline by about 2% to 3% compared to the total year 2011. As a result, we expect to report earnings for the total year around the low end of our original guidance. With volume levels expected to remain low for the remainder of 2012, our business teams have accelerated commercialization and qualification of new business that is ramping up. Let me give you some examples. 
Commercialization of patented order scavenging films for the poultry market is solving a long-term issue for our customers. Previously, one of containing was open, customer would be presented with an offensive odor. This new patented film scavenges this odor so that the customer never experiences it. Another example is our packaging for frozen sandwiches that are microwavable in the package. The technology in our films allow the sandwich to be warmed in the microwave, while maintaining the crispness of the bread. 
In addition, we recently developed a breakthrough medical device package for artificial joints. For example, new replacements need to be packaged extensively to protect them before they are placed in a thermoformed container. We have developed a polyester package with polyurethane coating that protects the new replacement, eliminates the need for additional packaging and substantially reduces damage during distribution. 
While economic conditions are negatively impacting volumes across all regions as consumers spending, wherever they can. Our food packaging markets will be more stable than most, and we will to continue to focus on new business opportunities and prudent cost management to position Bemis for earnings growth in the feature. 
There are a number of additional factors impacting our performance and our revised guidance this quarter, and I'd like to take some time to go through each of these factors with you. These factors include the impact of raw material costs, sales mix and currency. First, let's talk about raw material cost. The resin costs headwinds that impacted results in 2011 have been relatively calm during the first half of 2012, and we expect modest raw material cost tailwinds during the second half of this year. The costs of commodity raw materials such as polyethylene had increased during the first quarter of this year but began to soften again during the second quarter. Overall, we expect commodity resin costs to remain flat during the third quarter, providing short-term benefits before selling prices are adjusted. We expect modest commodity resin cost increases later in the year. 
We are not seeing that same softness in the cost of our specialty raw materials. Mix improvements in 2012 reflect the impact of new business commercialization and value-added product lines, coupled with volume declines in less complex product lines. 
Scott will get into the details of our volume numbers for the quarter, but it is important to note that about 1/2 of our flexible packaging application areas, we have a technological advantage with unique film structures. In these application areas, we experienced modest growth in volume compared to last year second quarter. 
In total, volume in the second quarter was about 5.5% below volume levels of the second quarter 2011 as predicted, with the decrease coming primarily from the lower value-added products, resulting in improved sales mix. 
The last factor is currency. During the second quarter, the average very the rate of the Brazilian real weakened by almost 20% compared to the second quarter of 2011. Our guidance assumes that the reai will remain cautious for the rest of 2012 and as a result, will be revise our guidance to $2 to $2.10. 
We continue to take pricing actions to improve our margins and performance metrics in those parts of our business that do not give us an appropriate level of return. We are executing our facility consolidation program, aimed at improving the efficiency of our global manufacturing operations. We have also identified 3 other manufacturing locations to be closed in France, Mexico and Brazil. 
With regard to our pressure sensitive materials business segment, we continue to actively manage our cost structure to match demand levels in North America and in Europe. Despite about 45% of this business being centered on the European markets, we were able to deliver operating profit levels in the high-single-digit range during the second quarter. This is about even with the second quarter of 2011 and then the highest increase sequentially from the first quarter. Going forward, our focus will continue to be to match our cost structure with market demand and improve our sales mix. 
Lastly, I'll let you touch upon capital investment plans for 2012. We continue to be pleased with the performance and opportunities for increased sales from our newly acquired flexible packaging operation in China. Our expansion of our making capacity in China is well underway and represents a niche market that we are confident we will be able to fill. We believe our expression positions us to be increasing demand for these products and does not depend on future growth in the Chinese market. our Latin American investment in multilayer film capacity is on track for a completion by the end of this year, and we expect this to provide us with new sales opportunities for meat packaging applications that have been historically been a small part of our Latin American mix. 
We have lowered our total estimate of capital expenditures for 2012 by $25 million to approximately $150 million for the year. This decrease reflects the fact that we are postponing investments in areas where we no longer need additional capacity. In all, we're making the necessary adjustments our capacity to maintain a sales mix that promotes improvement in profitability and growth going forward. We are expanding in key growth areas and managing our cost structure to achieve our profitability objectives. Expect to begin to benefit from the savings our facility consolidation program in 2013, and we will continue to look for opportunities to expand our product reach to new applications, innovate our existing product lines and improve our performance metrics in the future. Now I'll turn the call over to Scott for his comments on the financials."

Good morning, everyone. Adjusted earnings per share for the second quarter was $0.54, an increase of about 6% over last year's second quarter, a 10% increase sequentially from the first quarter of this year and in the middle of our guidance range. 
My comments this morning will cover the financial tables attached to today's press release, and I'll provide additional color with respect to the drivers of this quarter's performance. 
Starting with our flexible packaging segment and excluding the impact of currency and acquisitions. Net sales decreased about 1/2 of 1% reflecting a 5.5% decrease in volume, partially offset by increases in price and mix. Specifically, volume increased modestly in several of our high value-added product areas, such as packaging for meat and cheese, dairy and liquids, dry foods and medical and pharmaceutical applications. In our other product areas, volumes were generally down, with the exception of overwrap for bottled water, which was up due to the hot weather conditions in North America. We experienced volume declines in a number of product areas, such as packaging for bakery, confectionery and snack, beverage, PET care, specialty food, and health and hygiene applications. Some of this volume decline was self-directed, as we have chosen to strategically priced products to meet our profit margin objectives. 
Looking at net sales from another perspective, trends varied considerably by geographic region. For flexible packaging sales in North America, which represents about 70% sales in the segment, we experienced a modest decline in net sales as mid-single-digit volume declines overall were partially offset by price, mix improvements. In Latin America, net sales, excluding currency, increased by about 10%, principally driven by increasing prices, reflecting higher raw material costs. The weakening of the reai has significantly hurt our results as translated into U.S. dollars. In relation to total Bemis net sales, the devaluation of the reai reduced reported revenues by over 3%. 
European flexible packaging represent less than 2% of our total flexible packaging segment operating profit. It's not a significant factor driving our results, so I won't spend much time here, other than to say that we have a strong medical device packaging business in Europe that is nicely profitable. While our food packaging business continues to operate in a low growth, low-margin weak demand environment. 
Moving onto the pressure sensitive materials business segment. Unit volumes were down slightly in label products and decreased almost 5% each in graphic and technical products. Result in this business segment continued to reflect the impact of its significant exposure to the European region. Price and mix were neutral to net sales. Consolidated gross margins improved to 17.8% in the second quarter of this year, up from 17.4% in the second quarter 2011. This reflected our improved alignment between the cost of raw materials and our selling prices to customers. This improvement in our price cost ratio was partially offset by the negative impact of lower volume levels on fixed cost absorption. We are executing our facility consolidation program on schedule and as planned. In addition, we expanded the program to include 3 locations outside the U.S. and one additional location in the U.S. With the U.S. and now the non-U.S. programs in progress, we do not expect any further closings in the foreseeable future. With these additional locations, we increased the overall total program cost from $83 million to $141 million, of which $96 million is expected to be cash payments, up from the original cash estimate of $51 million. 
During the second quarter specifically, charges of $20 million were incurred and cash payments totaled $4.5 million. You can see the programs complete financial timing and expenses details on Page 2 of our press release. Previously, we announced that our facility consolidation program was expected to deliver approximately $40 million annually, beginning in 2013. We now expect the program in total to generate approximately $50 million annualized, which represents about a 2-year payback on the $96 million in cash we are spending. Of the 9 total locations impacted, 4 were already closed by the end of June and close the remaining locations by the end of the year. 
Turning back to the income statement. Selling, general and administrative expenses in 2012  will continue to fluctuate, reflecting the impact of changes related to the facility consolidation program, the addition of acquired businesses and the adjustments of incentive compensation in response to business performance expectations. We expect total year 2012 SG&A to average 9.5% to 10% of net sales, and current initiatives are expected to reduce SG&A expenses in 2013. Adjusted operating profit flexible packaging business segment increased 60 basis points to 10.1% compared to 9.5% in the second quarter of 2011. This improvement reflects the impact of an improved price cost ratio compared to the second quarter of 2011, when raw material costs had increased dramatically in advance of our selling price increases. This improvement was partially offset by the impact of lower fixed cost absorption due to lower sales volumes in certain product areas. 
In the pressure sensitive materials business segment, operating profit margins improved 100 basis points over the first quarter of this year, reflecting aggressive cost management in the face of modest volume declines. 
Our effective tax rate was 36.4% for the second quarter, and we continue to expect the effective tax rate for the total year 2012 to be 36%. 
Moving onto the statement of cash flows. Cash provided by operating activities totaled $94.5 million for the second quarter. Working capital was neutral, although when compared to last year's second quarter, pension contributions reduced cash from operating activities by about $24 million, and facility consolidation payments used an additional $4.5 million in cash. We expect cash provided by operating activities to be in the range of $350 million for the full year 2012. This will be influenced by the timing of cash payments associated with the now-expanded facility closures program. As Henry explained, capital expenditures and dividend payments are expected to be used about $250 million. The remaining cash will be focused principally on short-term debt reduction. Our guidance for the second half of 2012 and assumes volume will continue to be flat with the first half, which will also be about equal to the volume levels of the second half of 2011. As Henry explained, our previous 2012 EPS guidance was based on the assumption of volumes in the second half would improve. We based this assumption on volume outlooks from our key customers, who are now predicting demand to remain soft through this year. As a result, we are lowering our total year adjusted EPS guidance to $2.10 per share, and we expect the third quarter adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.51 to $0.57. These ranges assume constant currency exchange rates and modest raw material cost benefits during the second half of the year. 
I'll close by summarizing our focus for the balance of 2012, which is to continue to grow sales of our high-technology packaging products, aggressively manage costs, improve our profit margins, execute our facility consolidation program and generate cash.

This morning, we announced earnings of $0.54 per share in the middle of our guidance. We are pleased to have delivered performance improvements in the face of a difficult operating environment.

We are pleased to have delivered performance improvements in the face of a difficult operating environment. At the same time, we are revising our outlook for volume for the total year. Based upon a commentary of our large customers, back in April we had expected our volume levels to increase during the second half of this year. We are now revising this expectation and believe volume for the second half of the year will be approximately the same as the first half. Overall volume in 2012 is expected to decline by about 2% to 3% compared to the total year 2011. As a result, we expect to report earnings for the total year around the low end of our original guidance. With volume levels expected to remain low for the remainder of 2012, our business teams are accelerating the commercialization and qualification of new business that is ramping up. Let me give you some examples. 
Commercialization, a patented order scavenging films for the poultry market is solving a long-term issue for our meat customers. Previously, when a barrier package containing poultry was open, the customer would be presented with an offensive odor. This new patented film scavenges this odor so that the customer never experiences it. Another example is our packaging for frozen sandwiches that are microwavable in the package. The technology in our films allow the sandwich to be warmed in the microwave, while maintaining the crispness of the bread. 
In addition, we recently developed a breakthrough medical device package for artificial joints. For example, new replacements need to be packaged extensively to protect them before they are placed in a thermoformed container. We have developed a polyester package with a polyurethane coating that protects the new replacement, eliminates the need for additional packaging and substantially reduces damage during distribution. 
While economic conditions are negatively impacting volumes across all regions as consumers curve spending, wherever they can. Our food packaging markets will be more stable than the most, and we will to continue to focus on new business opportunities and prudent cost management to position Bemis for earnings growth in the feature. 
There are a number of additional factors impacting our performance and our revised guidance this quarter, and I'd like to take some time to go through each of these factors with you. These factors include the impact of raw material costs, sales mix and currency. First, let's talk about raw material cost. 
The resin costs headwinds that impacted results in 2011 have been relatively calm during the first half of 2012, and we expect modest raw material cost tailwinds during the second half of this year. The costs of commodity raw materials such as polyethylene had increased during the first quarter of this year but began to soften again during the second quarter. Overall, we expect commodity resin costs to remain flat during the third quarter, providing short-term benefits before selling prices are adjusted. We expect modest commodity resin cost increases later in the year. 
We are not seeing that same softness in the cost of our specialty raw materials. Mix improvements in 2012 reflect the impact of new business commercialization and value-added product lines, coupled with volume declines in less complex product lines. 
Scott will get into the details of our volume numbers for the quarter, but it is important to note that about 1/2 of our flexible packaging application areas, we have a technological advantage with unique film structures. In these application areas, we experienced modest growth in volume compared to last year second quarter. 
In total, volume in the second quarter was about 5.5% below volume levels of the second quarter 2011 as predicted, with the decrease coming primarily from the lower value-added products, resulting in improved sales mix. 
The last factor is currency. During the second quarter, the average currency rate of the Brazilian reais weakened by almost 20% compared to the second quarter of 2011. Our guidance assumes that the reais will remain constant for the rest of 2012 and as a result, we have revised our guidance to $2 to $2.10. 
We continue to take pricing actions to improve our margins and performance metrics in those parts of our business that do not give us an appropriate level of return. We are executing our facility consolidation program, aimed at improving the efficiency of our global manufacturing operations. We have also identified 3 other manufacturing locations to be closed in France, Mexico and Brazil. 
With regard to our Pressure Sensitive Materials business segment, we continue to actively manage our cost structure to match demand levels in North America and in Europe. Despite of about 45% of this business being centered on the European markets, we were able to deliver operating profit levels in the high-single-digit range during the second quarter. This is about even with the second quarter of 2011 and the highest increase sequentially from the first quarter. Going forward, our focus will continue to be to match our cost structure with market demand and improve our sales mix. 
Lastly, I'd like to touch upon our capital investment plans for 2012. We continue to be pleased with the performance and opportunities for increased sales from our newly acquired flexible packaging operation in China. Our expansion of our package making capacity in China is well underway and represents a niche market that we are confident we will be able to fill. We believe our expansion positions us to meet existing demand for these products and does not depend on future growth in the Chinese market. 
Our Latin American investment in multilayer film capacity is on track for a completion by the end of this year, and we expect this to provide us with new sales opportunities for meat packaging applications that have historically been a small part of our Latin American mix. 
We have lowered our total estimate of capital expenditures for 2012 by $25 million to approximately $150 million for the year. This decrease reflects the fact that we are postponing investments in areas where we no longer need additional capacity. 
In all, we are making the necessary adjustments to capacity to maintain a sales mix that promotes improvement in profitability and growth going forward. We are expanding in key growth areas and managing our cost structure to achieve our profitability objectives. We expect to begin to benefit from the savings of facility consolidation program in 2013, and we will continue to look for opportunities to expand our product reach to new applications, innovate our existing product lines and improve our performance metrics in the future. Now I'll turn the call over to Scott for his comments on the financials."

Good morning, everyone. Adjusted earnings per share for the second quarter was $0.54, an increase of about 6% over last year's second quarter, a 10% increase sequentially from the first quarter of this year and in the middle of our guidance range. 
My comments this morning will cover the financial tables attached to today's press release, and I'll provide additional color with respect to the drivers of this quarter's performance. 
Starting with our Flexible Packaging segment and excluding the impact of currency and acquisitions, net sales decreased about 1/2 of 1% reflecting a 5.5% decrease in volume, partially offset by increases in price and mix. Specifically, volume increased modestly in several of our high value-added product areas, such as packaging for meat and cheese, dairy and liquids, dry foods and medical and pharmaceutical applications. In our other product areas, volumes were generally down, with the exception of over-wrap for bottled water, which was up due to the hot weather conditions in North America. We experienced volume declines in a number of product areas, such as packaging for bakery, confectionery and snack, beverage, PET care, specialty food, and health and hygiene applications. Some of this volume decline was self-directed, as we have chosen to strategically priced products to meet our profit margin objectives. 
Looking at net sales from another perspective, trends varied considerably by geographic region. For Flexible Packaging sales in North America, which represents about 70% sales in the segment, we experienced a modest decline in net sales as mid-single-digit volume declines overall were partially offset by price mix improvements. In Latin America, net sales, excluding currency, increased by about 10%, principally driven by increasing prices, reflecting higher raw material costs. The weakening of the reais has significantly hurt our results as translated into U.S. dollars. In relation to total Bemis net sales, the devaluation of the reais reduced reported revenues by over 3%. 
European Flexible Packaging represent less than 2% of our total Flexible Packaging segment operating profit. It's not a significant factor driving our results, so I won't spend much time here, other than to say that we have a strong medical device packaging business in Europe that is nicely profitable, while our food packaging business continues to operate in a low growth, low-margin weak demand environment. 
Moving onto the Pressure Sensitive Materials business segment. Unit volumes were down slightly in label products and decreased almost 5% each in graphic and technical products. Result in this business segment continued to reflect the impact of its significant exposure to the European region. Price and mix were neutral to net sales. Consolidated gross margins improved to 17.8% in the second quarter of this year, up from 17.4% in the second quarter 2011. This reflected our improved alignment between the cost of raw materials and our selling prices to customers. This improvement in our price cost ratio was partially offset by the negative impact of lower volume levels on fixed cost absorption. 
We are executing our facility consolidation program on schedule and as planned. In addition, we expanded the program to include 3 locations outside the U.S. and one additional location in the U.S. With the U.S. and now the non-U.S. programs in progress, we do not expect any further closings in the foreseeable future. With these additional locations, we increased the overall total program cost from $83 million to $141 million, of which $96 million is expected to be cash payments, up from the original cash estimate of $51 million. 
During the second quarter, specifically, charges of $20 million were incurred and cash payments totaled $4.5 million. You can see the program's complete financial timing and expenses -- expense details on Page 2 of our press release. 
Previously, we announced that our facility consolidation program was expected to deliver approximately $40 million annually, beginning in 2013. We now expect the program in total to generate approximately $50 million annualized, which represents about a 2-year payback on the $96 million in cash we are spending. Of the 9 total locations impacted, 4 were already closed by the end of June and we'll finally close the remaining locations by the end of the year. 
Turning back to the income statement. Selling, general and administrative expenses in 2012  will continue to fluctuate, reflecting the impact of changes related to the facility consolidation program, the addition of acquired businesses and the adjustments of incentive compensation in response to business performance expectations. 
We expect total year 2012 SG&A to average 9.5% to 10% of net sales, and current initiatives are expected to reduce SG&A expenses in 2013. Adjusted operating profit of Flexible Packaging business segment increased 60 basis points to 10.1% compared to 9.5% in the second quarter of 2011. This improvement reflects the impact of an improved price cost ratio compared to the second quarter of 2011, when raw material costs had increased dramatically in advance of our selling price increases. This improvement was partially offset by the impact of lower fixed cost absorption due to lower sales volumes in certain product areas. 
In the Pressure Sensitive Materials business segment, operating profit margins improved 100 basis points over the first quarter of this year, reflecting aggressive cost management in the face of modest volume declines. 
Our effective tax rate was 36.4% for the second quarter, and we continue to expect the effective tax rate for the total year 2012 to be 36%. 
Moving onto the statement of cash flows. Cash provided by operating activities totaled $94.5 million for the second quarter. Working capital was neutral, although compared to last year's second quarter, pension contributions reduced cash from operating activities by about $24 million, and facility consolidation payments used an additional $4.5 million in cash. We expect cash provided by operating activities to be in the range of $350 million for the full year 2012. This will be influenced by the timing of cash payments associated with the now-expanded facility closures program. As Henry explained, capital expenditures and dividend payments are expected to be used about $250 million. The remaining cash will be focused principally on short-term debt reduction. 
Our guidance for the second half of 2012 assumes volume will continue to be flat with the first half, which will also be about equal to the volume levels of the second half of 2011. As Henry explained, our previous 2012 EPS guidance was based on the assumption of volumes in the second half would improve. We based this assumption on volume outlooks from our key customers, who are now predicting demand to remain soft through this year. As a result, we are lowering our total year adjusted EPS guidance to $2 -- to $2.10 per share, and we expect the third quarter adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.51 to $0.57. These ranges assume constant currency exchange rates and modest raw material cost benefits during the second half of the year. 
I'll close by summarizing our focus for the balance of 2012, which is to continue to grow sales of our high-technology packaging products, aggressively manage costs, improve our profit margins, execute our facility consolidation program and generate cash. And now, we'll open the call for questions."

It's the right way to continue to capitalize the ongoing manufacturing facilities we have in place, but the short term bank cash on return is not as positive as -- for the ones we announced previously."

This morning, we announced earnings of $0.54 per share in the middle of our guidance. We are pleased to have delivered performance improvements in the face of a difficult operating environment. At the same time, we are revising our outlook f",1126,"Good morning. This morning, we announced earnings of $0.54 per share in the middle of our guidance. We are pleased to have delivered performance improvements in the face of a difficult operating environment. At the same time, we are revising our outlook for volume for the total year. Based upon a commentary of our large customers, back in April we had expected our volume levels to increase during the second half of this year. We are now revising this expectation and believe volume for the second half of the year will be approximately the same as the first half. Overall volume in 2012 is expected to decline by about 2% to 3% compared to the total year 2011. As a result, we expect to report earnings for the total year around the low end of our original guidance. With volume levels expected to remain low for the remainder of 2012, our business teams are accelerating the commercialization and qualification of new business that is ramping up. Let me give you some examples. 
Commercialization of patented order scavenging films for the poultry market is solving a long-term issue for our meat customers. Previously, when a barrier package containing poultry was open, the customer would be presented with an offensive odor. This new patented film scavenges this odor so that the customer never experiences it. Another example is our packaging for frozen sandwiches that are microwavable in the package. The technology in our films allow the sandwich to be warmed in the microwave, while maintaining the crispness of the bread. 
In addition, we recently developed a breakthrough medical device package for artificial joints. For example, knee replacements need to be packaged extensively to protect them before they are placed in a thermoformed container. We have developed a polyester package with a polyurethane coating that protects the knee replacement, eliminates the need for additional packaging and substantially reduces damage during distribution. 
While economic conditions are negatively impacting volumes across all regions as consumers curb spending wherever they can, our food packaging markets will be more stable than most, and we will to continue to focus on new business opportunities and prudent cost management to position Bemis for earnings growth in the feature. 
There are a number of additional factors impacting our performance and our revised guidance this quarter, and I'd like to take some time to go through each of these factors with you. These factors include the impact of raw material costs, sales mix and currency. First let's talk about raw material cost. 
The resin costs headwinds that impacted results in 2011 have been relatively calm during the first half of 2012, and we expect modest raw material cost tailwinds during the second half of this year. The costs of commodity raw materials such as polyethylene had increased during the first quarter of this year, but began to soften again during the second quarter. Overall, we expect commodity resin costs to remain flat during the third quarter, providing short-term benefits before selling prices are adjusted. We expect modest commodity resin cost increases later in the year. 
We are not seeing that same softness in the cost of our specialty raw materials. Mix improvements in 2012 reflect the impact of new business commercialization and value-added product lines, coupled with volume declines in less complex product lines. 
Scott will get into the details of our volume numbers for the quarter, but it is important to note that in about 1/2 of our flexible packaging application areas, we have a technological advantage with unique film structures. In these application areas, we experienced modest growth in volume compared to last year second quarter. 
In total, volume in the second quarter was about 5.5% below volume levels of the second quarter 2011 as predicted, with the decrease coming primarily from the lower value-added products, resulting in improved sales mix. 
The last factor is currency. During the second quarter, the average currency rate of the Brazilian reais weakened by almost 20% compared to the second quarter of 2011. Our guidance assumes that the reais will remain constant for the rest of 2012 and as a result, we have revised our guidance to $2 to $2.10. 
We continue to take pricing actions to improve our margins and performance metrics in those parts of our business that do not give us an appropriate level of return. We are executing our facility consolidation program, aimed at improving the efficiency of our global manufacturing operations. We have also identified 3 other manufacturing locations to be closed in France, Mexico and Brazil. 
With regard to our Pressure Sensitive Materials business segment, we continue to actively manage our cost structure to match demand levels in North America and in Europe. Despite of about 45% of this business being centered on the European markets, we were able to deliver operating profit levels in the high-single-digit range during the second quarter. This is about even with the second quarter of 2011 and the highest increase sequentially from the first quarter. Going forward, our focus will continue to be to match our cost structure with market demand and improve our sales mix. 
Lastly, I'd like to touch upon our capital investment plans for 2012. We continue to be pleased with the performance and opportunities for increased sales from our newly acquired flexible packaging operation in China. Our expansion of our package making capacity in China is well underway and represents a niche market that we are confident we will be able to fill. We believe our expansion positions us to meet existing demand for these products and does not depend on future growth in the Chinese market. 
Our Latin American investment in multilayer film capacity is on track for completion by the end of this year, and we expect this to provide us with new sales opportunities for meat packaging applications that have historically been a small part of our Latin American mix. 
We have lowered our total estimate of capital expenditures for 2012 by $25 million to approximately $150 million for the year. This decrease reflects the fact that we are postponing investments in areas where we no longer need additional capacity. 
In all, we are making the necessary adjustments to capacity to maintain a sales mix that promotes improvement in profitability and growth going forward. We are expanding in key growth areas and managing our cost structure to achieve our profitability objectives. We expect to begin to benefit from the savings of facility consolidation program in 2013, and we will continue to look for new opportunities to expand our product reach to new applications, innovate our existing product lines and improve our performance metrics in the future. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Scott for his comments on the financials."

Adjusted earnings per share for the second quarter was $0.54, an increase of about 6% over last year's second quarter, a 10% increase sequentially from the first quarter of this year and in the middle of our guidance",1198,"Thanks, Henry. Good morning, everyone. Adjusted earnings per share for the second quarter was $0.54, an increase of about 6% over last year's second quarter, a 10% increase sequentially from the first quarter of this year and in the middle of our guidance range. 
My comments this morning will cover the financial tables attached to today's press release, and I'll provide additional color with respect to the drivers of this quarter's performance. 
Starting with our Flexible Packaging segment and excluding the impact of currency and acquisitions, net sales decreased about 1/2 of 1% reflecting a 5.5% decrease in volume, partially offset by increases in price and mix. Specifically, volume increased modestly in several of our high value-added product areas, such as packaging for meat and cheese, dairy and liquids, dry foods and medical and pharmaceutical applications. In our other product areas, volumes were generally down with the exception of over-wrap for bottled water, which was up due to the hot weather conditions in North America. We experienced volume declines in a number of product areas such as packaging for bakery, confectionery and snack, beverage, pet care, specialty food, and health and hygiene applications. Some of this volume decline was self-directed, as we have chosen to strategically price products to meet our profit margin objectives. 
Looking at net sales from another perspective, trends varied considerably by geographic region. For Flexible Packaging sales in North America, which represents about 70% sales in the segment, we experienced a modest decline in net sales as mid-single-digit volume declines overall were partially offset by price mix improvements. In Latin America, net sales excluding currency increased by about 10%, principally driven by increasing prices, reflecting higher raw material costs. The weakening of the reais has significantly hurt our results as translated into U.S. dollars. In relation to total Bemis net sales, the devaluation of the reais reduced reported revenues by over 3%. 
European Flexible Packaging represent less than 2% of our total Flexible Packaging segment operating profit. It's not a significant factor driving our results, so I won't spend much time here other than to say that we have a strong medical device packaging business in Europe that is nicely profitable, while our food packaging business continues to operate in a low growth, low-margin weak demand environment. 
Moving onto the Pressure Sensitive Materials business segment. Unit volumes were down slightly in label products and decreased almost 5% each in graphic and technical products. Results in this business segment continued to reflect the impact of its significant exposure to the European region. Price and mix were neutral to net sales. Consolidated gross margins improved to 17.8% in the second quarter of this year, up from 17.4% in the second quarter 2011. This reflected our improved alignment between the cost of raw materials and our selling prices to customers. This improvement in our price cost ratio was partially offset by the negative impact of lower volume levels on fixed cost absorption. 
We are executing our facility consolidation program on schedule and as planned. In addition, we expanded the program to include 3 locations outside the U.S. and one additional location in the U.S. With the U.S. and now the non-U.S. programs in progress, we do not expect any further closings in the foreseeable future. With these additional locations, we increased the overall total program cost from $83 million to $141 million, of which $96 million is expected to be cash payments, up from the original cash estimate of $51 million. 
During the second quarter specifically, charges of $20 million were incurred and cash payments totaled $4.5 million. You can see the program's complete financial timing and expenses -- expense details on Page 2 of our press release. 
Previously, we announced that our facility consolidation program was expected to deliver approximately $40 million annually, beginning in 2013. We now expect the program in total to generate approximately $50 million annualized, which represents about a 2-year payback on the $96 million in cash we are spending. Of the 9 total locations impacted, 4 were already closed by the end of June and we plan to close the remaining locations by the end of the year. 
Turning back to the income statement. Selling, general and administrative expenses in 2012 will continue to fluctuate, reflecting the impact of changes related to the facility consolidation program, the addition of acquired businesses and the adjustments of incentive compensation in response to business performance expectations. 
We expect total year 2012 SG&A to average 9.5% to 10% of net sales, and current initiatives are expected to reduce SG&A expenses in 2013. Adjusted operating profit of Flexible Packaging business segment increased 60 basis points to 10.1% compared to 9.5% in the second quarter of 2011. This improvement reflects the impact of an improved price cost ratio compared to the second quarter of 2011, when raw material costs had increased dramatically in advance of our selling price increases. This improvement was partially offset by the impact of lower fixed cost absorption due to lower sales volumes in certain product areas. 
In the Pressure Sensitive Materials business segment, operating profit margins improved 100 basis points over the first quarter of this year, reflecting aggressive cost management in the face of modest volume declines. 
Our effective tax rate was 36.4% for the second quarter, and we continue to expect the effective tax rate for the total year 2012 to be 36%. 
Moving onto the statement of cash flows. Cash provided by operating activities totaled $94.5 million for the second quarter. Working capital was neutral, although compared to last year's second quarter, pension contributions reduced cash from operating activities by about $24 million, and facility consolidation payments used an additional $4.5 million in cash. We expect cash provided by operating activities to be in the range of $350 million for the full year 2012. This will be influenced by the timing of cash payments associated with the now-expanded facility closures program. As Henry explained, capital expenditures and dividend payments are expected to use about $250 million. The remaining cash will be focused principally on short-term debt reduction. 
Our guidance for the second half of 2012 assumes volume will continue to be flat with the first half, which will also be about equal to the volume levels of the second half of 2011. As Henry explained, our previous 2012 EPS guidance was based on the assumption that volumes in the second half would improve. We based this assumption on volume outlooks from our key customers, who are now predicting demand to remain soft through this year. As a result, we are lowering our total year adjusted EPS guidance to $2 -- to $2.10 per share, and we expect the third quarter adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.51 to $0.57. These ranges assume constant currency exchange rates and modest raw material cost benefits during the second half of the year. 
I'll close by summarizing our focus for the balance of 2012, which is to continue to grow sales of our high-technology packaging products, aggressively manage costs, improve our profit margins, execute our facility consolidation program and generate cash. And now we'll open the call for questions."

Today, we are pleased to announce adjusted earnings per share of $0.06 per third quarter. This was above our guidance range and reflected higher sales volumes for barrier packaging products, compared to our original expectations. As we look",804,"Good morning. Today, we are pleased to announce adjusted earnings per share of $0.06 per third quarter. This was above our guidance range and reflected higher sales volumes for barrier packaging products, compared to our original expectations. As we look at the quarter, there are a number of factors that positively impacted performance.
First, we experienced unit volume increase of 3% to 5% for high barrier packaging for meat and cheese, dairy and liquid products, and dry foods, including coffee. These products require more top layer film technology to protect shelf life and provide high performance sealing strength. The increase in meat and cheese packaging reflects the successful ramp up of new business compared to last year's third quarter. 
As I discussed last quarter, we're also winning new dairy and liquid packaging business with our high performance semirigid cups and building materials, which provide an environmentally friendly solutions to customers, looking to eliminate PVC from packaging.
Both single-serve and bulk coffee packaging volumes also increased compared to last year's third quarter.
The second positive factor was the resin costs were relatively stable during the third quarter, with some benefit early in the quarter from lower commodity resin cost offset by stable and the increasing specialty resin costs. We anticipate resin cost to have a negligible effect on results for the rest of the year.
Last year, we are about halfway complete with our facility consolidation program, which will improve the efficiency of our global manufacturing operations by consolidating the business from 9 different locations into other facilities.
We have closed 49 [ph] locations through the end of the third quarter. During the third quarter, we started to realize some of the cost savings associated with this progress to date. The remaining 5 facilities will be closed during the fourth quarter of 2012 or the first quarter of 2013. We expect almost all of the remaining business relocation activity to occur during the fourth quarter. So as we had to the fourth quarter, looks but to maintain the sales mix and cost-saving improvements we realized during the quarter. With some of these benefits will be offset by increased inefficiencies, associated with the transition of production from the remaining facilities being closed. Our teams have worked diligently to provide customers with a smooth transition as production is moved to other locations and I am pleased with the progress we have made.
As I have said in the past, we continue to take pricing actions to improve our margins and performance metrics in those pieces of business that did not give us an appropriate level of return. This is not a broad action but it is surgical, related only to those specific business of the business that did not meet our margin requirements. To date, these actions are accomplishing our goals.
Briefly highlighting our business outside of North America, our Latin American operations are managing through a challenging economic environment that is impacting our customers in that region. We continue to see customers on track to modernize the products using flexible packaging to reduce waste and improve shelf life, as well as consumer appeal and convenience features. 
In Europe, our medical device packaging operations are enjoying increasing volume levels capped compared to 2011. But customers remain cautious about predicting future demand. Our other European base, flexible packaging operations, continue to face a difficult environment in which customers are hesitant to invest and competitors are desperate for volume. In this environment, we are carefully managing our customer relationships and adjusting our cost structures as needed to accomplish specific volume declines.
Our business in the Asia Pacific is expanding with the additional capacity added to our food packaging plant in China and the acquisition of 2 small distributorships in the Australia and New Zealand market. As we further develop our capabilities in this region, we are focusing on value-added products such as barrier packaging for food products, packaging and polyester making, as well as medical device packaging. As we have said in the past, it is not our intent to be the largest in the Asia Pacific region. Instead, we want to grow our Asia Pacific presence with unique products that position us over the long term for a leadership position in packaging solutions and protect food safety and sterility.
Our Pressure Sensitive Materials business segment is performing well in this challenging economic environment. The third quarter is a seasonally slower period for this business, and sales and profit continue to match prior year levels. Going forward, we are expanding our plan to deliver consistently improving performance metrics with initiatives that leverage our scale, identifying investments in focus growth areas and accelerate innovation to deliver value to our customers and improved profitability to Bemis.
Now I'll turn it the call over to Scott for his comments on the financials."
255132,223160228,369918,"Bemis Company, Inc., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2012",2012-10-25,"Earnings Calls","Amcor Flexibles North America Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Henry. Good morning, everyone. Our appetite adjusted diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of $0.60 represented an increase of about 7% over last year's third quarter and 11% increase sequentially from second quarter and was above our g",1189,"Thanks, Henry. Good morning, everyone. Our appetite adjusted diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of $0.60 represented an increase of about 7% over last year's third quarter and 11% increase sequentially from second quarter and was above our guidance range of $0.51 to $0.57. 
I'll start this morning by commenting on volumes. We are especially pleased with our earnings performance because we've done it despite having to overcome tough volumes all year. Recall, we started the year expecting stronger volumes for the second half, based upon our customers forecasts of end market demand and their pricing and promotional plans. By the end of the second quarter this year, our expectation was reduced to flat second half volumes. And now, at the end of the third quarter, we've seen volumes actually turn negative year-over-year.
In spite of the volume headwinds, we drove solid earnings by improving sales mix and delivering cost savings. Starting with Flexible Packaging and excluding the impact of currency and acquisitions, net sales decreased about 1.8%, reflecting a 3.7% increase in volume, partially offset by increases in price and mix. Specifically, volume increased in several of our high-value-added product areas such as packaging for meat and cheese, dairy and liquids and dry foods. Now in our other product areas, volumes were generally down with the exception of pet products and fresh produce where new business increased volumes modestly compared to last year.
We experienced volume declines in a number of product areas such as packaging for bakery, confectionery and snack, beverage, specialty food and health and hygiene applications.
Dividing these trends by geography, in North America, net sales decreased by about 3.5% due entirely to overall volume declines. Sales mix generally reflected the overall trends that I just mentioned. In Latin America, net sales excluding currency increased by about 6%, principally driven by increasing prices reflecting higher raw material costs compared to the third quarter of 2011. Sales mix also improved but was more than offset by lower sales volumes.
European Flexible Packaging volumes were higher in our medical device packaging business while our food packaging business continues to experience lower year-over-year volume levels. 
Moving on to the Pressure Sensitive Materials business segment, unit volumes were up about 3% in label products, partially offset by a decrease of over 5% each in graphic and technical products. Since the label products continues to represent over half of the sales in this business segment, the overall positive unit sales volume driven by growth in label products was more than offset by a negative impact from pricing mix during the quarter.
Bemis consolidated gross margins improved from 16.5% in the third quarter of 2011 to 19.2% in the third quarter of this year. Again, this improvement reflects improved sales mix, a better alignment between the cost of raw materials and our selling prices to customers compared to the third quarter of 2011 and some savings associated with the facility consolidation activities completed so far this year. 
Now I'm going to provide an update on our facility consolidation program. As Henry mentioned, we started realizing net cost savings benefits in the third quarter, which is earlier than we originally planned, driven by 2 factors. Number one, we've talked previously about the fact that the cost savings that hit in 2012 this year, would be largely offset by short-term inefficiencies such as lower machine productivity and increased waste when we restart equipment. As it turned out, the expected inefficiencies will be deferred to future quarters.
Number two, our teams have done an excellent job of delivering cost savings ahead of schedule for the plans we've already closed. Based upon our assessment of savings, specifically associated with actions taken today, approximately $5 million of cost savings were realized during this quarter. This purpose of annualized cost savings achieved of approximately $20 million as compared to our total program estimate of $50 million in annualized savings.
During the third quarter, we incurred charges of $21.4 million and cash payments totaled $11.2 million. You can see the facility consolidation programs complete financial timing and expense details on Page 2 of this morning's press release.
Continuing to the income statement, selling, general and administrative expenses in 2012 will continue to fluctuate, reflecting the impact of changes related to the facilities consolidation program, the addition of businesses we already acquired and the adjustments of incentive compensation in response to business performance expectations. We expect total year 2012 SG&A to average 9.5% to 10% of net sales.
Adjusted operating profit for the Flexible Packaging business segment increased 170 basis points to 11.5% compared to 9.8% in the third quarter of last year and 10.1% in the second quarter of this year.
In the Pressure Sensitive Materials business segment, operating profit margins were very close to the levels of 2011, reflecting our focus on prudent cost management in this challenging volume environment. Our effective tax rate was 36.1% in the third quarter and we continue to expect the effective tax rate for the total year 2012 to be 36%.
Moving on to the statement of cash flows. Cash provided by operating committees totaled $147 million for the third quarter. Working capital provided $42 million of cash flow during the third quarter while facility consolidation payments used an additional $11 million of cash. 
Reiterating our expectations for future cash flows, we expect cash provided by operating activities to be in the range of $350 million for this full year, growing to $500 million annually, beginning in 2014. Our adjusted earnings per share guidance for the fourth quarter of 2012 is $0.47, $0.52 per share, which would mean full year adjusted earnings per share guidance of $2.10 to $2.15. In this range, 2012 would be the first or second best year of earnings in Bemis history. There are some specific headwinds and tailwinds that will influence our earnings in the fourth quarter. If we can maintain the sales mix improvement and continue to deliver the cost savings ahead of our original forecast, we could end up at the top end of our range. Of course, that means there will be fewer incremental savings coming in 2013 since we're starting to recognize them in 2012.
Aside from our typical seasonal slowdown in the fourth quarter, the biggest hurdle we are trying to clear is continuing weak volumes in many of our end markets. Mix improvements and cost savings are helping fuel earnings growth in a declining point environment but we can't cost cot our way to profit growth over the long-term. Our customers, especially the CBG and food companies, are battling declining volumes and so we are to and expected food cost inflation won't help drive consumer demand. So our business teams are vigorously chasing down profitable revenue opportunities are on the road and Bemis' industry-leading products are helping us compete against others in our industry who are chasing the same volumes.
One last thought before we open the call for questions. Our EPS guidance range assumes no further weakening in the Brazilian and European currencies and no raw material spikes.
And now, operator, please open the call for questions."

Today, we are pleased to announce adjusted earnings per share of $0.60 for the third quarter. This was above our guidance range and reflected higher sales volumes for barrier packaging products, compared to our original expectations. As we look at the quarter, there are a number of factors that positively impacted performance.
First, we experienced unit volume increase of 3% to 5% for high barrier packaging for meat and cheese, dairy and liquid products, and dry foods, including coffee. These products require multi-layer film technology to protect shelf life and provide high-performance sealant strength. The increase in meat and cheese packaging reflects the successful ramp-up of new business compared to last year's third quarter. 
As I discussed last quarter, we're also winning new dairy and liquid packaging business with our high performance semi-rigid cups and liquid materials, which provide an environmentally friendly solution to customers looking to eliminate PVdC from packaging. Both single-serve and bulk coffee packaging volumes also increased compared to last year's third quarter. 
The second positive factor was that resin costs were relatively stable during the third quarter, with some benefit early in the quarter from lower commodity resin costs offset by stable and the increase in specialty resin costs. We anticipate resin cost to have a negligible effect on results through the rest of the year.
Lastly, we're about halfway complete with our facility consolidation program, which will improve the efficiency of our global manufacturing operations by consolidating the business from 9 different locations into other facilities. We have closed 4 of the 9 locations through the end of the third quarter. During the third quarter, we started to realize some of the cost savings associated with this progress to date. The remaining 5 facilities will be closed during the fourth quarter of 2012 or the first quarter of 2013. We expect almost all of the remaining business relocation activity to occur during the fourth quarter. 
So as we head into the fourth quarter, we expect to maintain the sales mix and cost-saving improvements we realized during the third quarter. But some of this benefit will be offset by increased inefficiencies associated with the transition of production from the remaining facilities being closed. Our teams have worked diligently to provide customers with a smooth transition as production is moved to other locations and I am pleased with the progress we have made.
As I have said in the past, we continue to take pricing actions to improve our margins and performance metrics in those pieces of business that did not give us an appropriate level of return. This is not a broad action but is surgical and related only to those specific pieces of business that did not meet our margin requirements. To date, these actions are accomplishing our goals.
Briefly highlighting our business outside of North America, our Latin American operations are managing through a challenging economic environment that is impacting our customers in that region. We continue to see customers on track to modernize their products, using flexible packaging to reduce waste and improve shelf life, as well as consumer appeal and convenience features.  
In Europe, our medical device packaging operations are enjoying increasing volume levels capped compared to 2011. But customers remain cautious about predicting future demand. Our other European base, flexible packaging operations, continue to face a difficult environment in which customers are hesitant to invest and competitors are desperate for volume. In this environment, we are carefully managing our customer relationships and adjusting our cost structures as needed to accomplish specific volume declines.
Our business in Asia Pacific is expanding with the additional capacity added to our food packaging plant in China and the acquisition of 2 small distributorships in the Australia and New Zealand market. As we further develop our capabilities in this region, we are focusing on value-added products such as barrier packaging for food products, retort packaging and pouch making, as well as medical device packaging. As we have said in the past, it is not our intent to be the largest in Asia Pacific region. Instead, we want to grow our Asia Pacific presence with unique products that position us over the long term for a leadership position in packaging solutions that protect food safety and sterility.
Our pressure sensitive materials business segment is performing well in this challenging economic environment. The third quarter is a seasonally slower period for this business, and sales and profit continue to match the prior year levels. Going forward, we are executing our plan to deliver consistently improving performance metrics with initiatives that leverage our scale, identify investments in focused growth areas and accelerate innovation to deliver value to our customers and improve profitability to Bemis.
Now I'll turn the call over to Scott for his comments on the financials."
255132,223160228,370133,"Bemis Company, Inc., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2012",2012-10-25,"Earnings Calls","Amcor Flexibles North America Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Henry. Good morning, everyone. Our record high adjusted diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of $0.60 represented an increase of about 7% over last year's third quarter, an 11% increase sequentially from second quarter and was above ou",1185,"Thanks, Henry. Good morning, everyone. Our record high adjusted diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of $0.60 represented an increase of about 7% over last year's third quarter, an 11% increase sequentially from second quarter and was above our guidance range of $0.51 to $0.57.  
I'll start this morning by commenting on volumes. We are especially pleased with our earnings performance because we've done it despite having to overcome tough volumes all year. Recall, we started the year expecting stronger volumes for the second half, based upon our customers forecasts of end-market demand and their pricing and promotional plans. By the end of the second quarter this year, our expectation was reduced to flat second half volumes. And now, at the end of the third quarter, we've seen volumes actually turn negative year-over-year. 
In spite of the volume headwinds, we drove solid earnings by improving sales mix and delivering cost savings. Starting with flexible packaging and excluding the impact of currency and acquisitions, net sales decreased about 1.8%, reflecting a 3.7% decrease in volume, partially offset by increases in price and mix. Specifically, volume increased in several of our high-value-added product areas such as packaging for meat and cheese, dairy and liquids and dry foods. In our other product areas, volumes were generally down with the exception of pet products and fresh produce where new business increased volumes modestly compared to last year. We experienced volume declines in a number of product areas such as packaging for bakery, confectionery and snack, beverage, specialty food and health and hygiene applications. 
Dividing these trends by geography, in North America, net sales decreased by about 3.5% due entirely to overall volume declines. Sales mix generally reflected the overall trends that I just mentioned. In Latin America, net sales excluding currency increased by about 6%, principally driven by increasing prices reflecting higher raw material costs compared to the third quarter of 2011. Sales mix also improved but was more than offset by lower sales volumes. European Flexible Packaging volumes were higher in our medical device packaging business while our food packaging business continues to experience lower year-over-year volume levels. 
Moving on to the pressure sensitive materials business segment, unit volumes were up about 3% in label products, partially offset by a decrease of over 5% each in graphic and technical products. Since label products continues to represent over half of the sales in this business segment, the overall positive unit sales volume driven by growth in label products was more than offset by a negative impact from price and mix during the quarter. 
Bemis consolidated gross margins improved from 16.5% in the third quarter of 2011 to 19.2% in the third quarter of this year. Again, this improvement reflects improved sales mix, a better alignment between the cost of raw materials and our selling prices to customers compared to the third quarter of 2011 and some savings associated with the facility consolidation activities completed so far this year. 
Now I'm going to provide an update on our facility consolidation program. As Henry mentioned, we started realizing net cost savings benefits in the third quarter, which is earlier than we originally planned, driven by 2 factors. #1, we've talked previously about the fact that the cost savings that hit in 2012 this year, would be largely offset by short-term inefficiencies such as lower machine productivity and increased waste when we restart equipment. As it turned out, the expected inefficiencies will be deferred to future quarters. 
#2, our teams have done an excellent job of delivering cost savings ahead of schedule for the plants we've already closed. Based upon our assessment of savings, specifically associated with actions taken to date, approximately $5 million of cost savings were realized during this quarter. This represents annualized cost savings achieved of approximately $20 million as compared to our total program estimate of $50 million in annualized savings.  
During the third quarter, we incurred charges of $21.4 million and cash payments totaled $11.2 million. You can see the facility consolidation programs complete financial timing and expense details on Page 2 of this morning's press release. 
Continuing through the income statement, selling, general and administrative expenses in 2012 will continue to fluctuate, reflecting the impact of changes related to the facilities consolidation program, the addition of businesses we already acquired and the adjustments of incentive compensation in response to business performance expectations. We expect total year 2012 SG&A to average 9.5% to 10% of net sales. 
Adjusted operating profit for the flexible packaging business segment increased 170 basis points to 11.5% compared to 9.8% in the third quarter of last year and 10.1% in the second quarter of this year. In the pressure sensitive materials business segment, operating profit margins were very close to the levels of 2011, reflecting our focus on prudent cost management in this challenging volume environment. Our effective tax rate was 36.1% for the third quarter and we continue to expect the effective tax rate for the total year 2012 to be 36%. 
Moving on to the statement of cash flows. Cash provided by operating activities totaled $147 million for the third quarter. Working capital provided $42 million of cash flow during the third quarter while facility consolidation payments used an additional $11 million of cash. Reiterating our expectations for future cash flows, we expect cash provided by operating activities to be in the range of $350 million for this full year, growing to $500 million annually beginning in 2014. Our adjusted earnings per share guidance for the fourth quarter of 2012 is $0.47 to $0.52 per share, which would mean full year adjusted earnings per share guidance of $2.10 to $2.15. 
In this range, 2012 would be the first or second best year of earnings in Bemis history. There are some specific headwinds and tailwinds that will influence our earnings in the fourth quarter. If we can maintain the sales mix improvement and continue to deliver the cost savings ahead of our original forecasts, we could end up at the top end of our range. Of course, that means there will be fewer incremental savings coming in 2013 since we're starting to recognize them in 2012. 
Aside from our typical season's slowdown in the fourth quarter, the biggest hurdle we are trying to clear is continuing weak volumes in many of our end markets. Mix improvements and cost savings are helping fuel earnings growth in a declining volume environment but we can't cost cut our way to profit growth over the long-term. Our customers, especially the CPG and food companies, are battling declining volumes and so we are too, and expected food-cost inflation won't help drive consumer demand. So our business teams are vigorously chasing down profitable revenue opportunities around the world and Bemis' industry-leading products are helping us compete against others in our industry who are chasing the same volumes. 
One last note before we open the call for questions. Our EPS guidance range assumes no further weakening in the Brazilian and European currencies and no raw material spikes. And now, operator, please open the call for questions."

Today, we are pleased to announce adjusted earnings per share of $0.60 for the third quarter.

Today, we are pleased to announce adjusted earnings per share of $0.60 for the third quarter. This was above our guidance range and reflected higher sales volumes for barrier packaging products compared to our original expectations. As we look at the quarter, there are a number of factors that positively impacted performance.
First, we experienced unit volume increase of 3% to 5% for high barrier packaging for meat and cheese, dairy and liquid products and dry foods, including coffee. These products require multi-layer film technology to protect shelf life and provide high-performance sealant strength. The increase in meat and cheese packaging reflects the successful ramp-up of new business compared to last year's third quarter. 
As I discussed last quarter, we're also winning new dairy and liquid packaging business with our high performance semi-rigid cups and lidding materials, which provide an environmentally friendly solution to customers looking to eliminate PVdC from packaging. Both single-serve and bulk coffee packaging volumes also increased compared to last year's third quarter. 
The second positive factor was that resin costs were relatively stable during the third quarter, with some benefit early in the quarter from lower commodity resin costs offset by stable and the increase in specialty resin costs. We anticipate resin cost to have a negligible effect on results through the rest of the year.
Lastly, we're about halfway complete with our facility consolidation program, which will improve the efficiency of our global manufacturing operations by consolidating the business from 9 different locations into other facilities. We have closed 4 of the 9 locations through the end of the third quarter. During the third quarter, we started to realize some of the cost savings associated with this progress to date. The remaining 5 facilities will be closed during the fourth quarter of 2012 or the first quarter of 2013. We expect almost all of the remaining business relocation activity to occur during the fourth quarter. 
So as we head into the fourth quarter, we expect to maintain the sales mix and cost-saving improvements we realized during the third quarter. But some of this benefit will be offset by increased inefficiencies associated with the transition of production from the remaining facilities being closed. Our teams have worked diligently to provide customers with a smooth transition as production is moved to other locations, and I am pleased with the progress we have made.
As I have said in the past, we continue to take pricing actions to improve our margins and performance metrics in those pieces of business that did not give us an appropriate level of return. This is not a broad action but is surgical and related only to those specific pieces of business that did not meet our margin requirements. To date, these actions are accomplishing our goals.
Briefly highlighting our business outside of North America, our Latin American operations are managing through a challenging economic environment that is impacting our customers in that region. We continue to see customers on track to modernize their products, using flexible packaging to reduce waste and improve shelf life, as well as consumer appeal and convenience features.  
In Europe, our medical device packaging operations are enjoying increasing volume levels capped compared to 2011. But customers remain cautious about predicting future demand. Our other European base, Flexible Packaging operations, continue to face a difficult environment in which customers are hesitant to invest and competitors are desperate for volume. In this environment, we are carefully managing our customer relationships and adjusting our cost structures as needed to account for specific volume declines.
Our business in Asia Pacific is expanding with the additional capacity added to our food packaging plant in China and the acquisition of 2 small distributorships in the Australia and New Zealand market. As we further develop our capabilities in this region, we are focusing on value-added products such as barrier packaging for food products, retort packaging and pouch making, as well as medical device packaging. As we have said in the past, it is not our intent to be the largest in Asia-Pacific region. Instead, we want to grow our Asia-Pacific presence with unique products that position us over the long term for a leadership position in packaging solutions that protect food safety and sterility.
Our pressure sensitive materials business segment is performing well in this challenging economic environment. The third quarter is a seasonally slower period for this business, and sales and profit continue to match the prior year levels. Going forward, we are executing our plan to deliver consistently improving performance metrics with initiatives that leverage our scale, identify investments in focused growth areas and accelerate innovation to deliver value to our customers and improve profitability to Bemis.
Now I'll turn the call over to Scott for his comments on the financials."
255132,223160228,370333,"Bemis Company, Inc., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2012",2012-10-25,"Earnings Calls","Amcor Flexibles North America Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Henry. Good morning, everyone. Our record-high adjusted diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of $0.60 represented an increase of about 7% over last year's third quarter, an 11% increase sequentially from second quarter, and was above o",1186,"Thanks, Henry. Good morning, everyone. Our record-high adjusted diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of $0.60 represented an increase of about 7% over last year's third quarter, an 11% increase sequentially from second quarter, and was above our guidance range of $0.51 to $0.57.  
I'll start this morning by commenting on volumes. We are especially pleased with our earnings performance because we've done it despite having to overcome tough volumes all year. Recall, we started the year expecting stronger volumes for the second half based upon our customers' forecasts of end-market demand and their pricing and promotional plans. By the end of the second quarter this year, our expectation was reduced to flat second half volumes. And now, at the end of the third quarter, we've seen volumes actually turn negative year-over-year. 
In spite of the volume headwinds, we drove solid earnings by improving sales mix and delivering cost savings. Starting with flexible packaging and excluding the impact of currency and acquisitions, net sales decreased about 1.8%, reflecting a 3.7% decrease in volume, partially offset by increases in price and mix. Specifically, volume increased in several of our high-value-added product areas, such as packaging for meat and cheese, dairy and liquids and dry foods. In our other product areas, volumes were generally down with the exception of pet products and fresh produce, where new business increased volumes modestly compared to last year. We experienced volume declines in a number of product areas, such as packaging for bakery, confectionery and snack, beverage, specialty food and health and hygiene applications. 
Dividing these trends by geography, in North America, net sales decreased by about 3.5% due entirely to overall volume declines. Sales mix generally reflected the overall trends that I just mentioned. In Latin America, net sales excluding currency increased by about 6%, principally driven by increasing prices reflecting higher raw material costs compared to the third quarter of 2011. Sales mix also improved but was more than offset by lower sales volumes. European Flexible Packaging volumes were higher in our medical device packaging business, while our food packaging business continues to experience lower year-over-year volume levels. 
Moving on to the pressure sensitive materials business segment, unit volumes were up about 3% in label products, partially offset by a decrease of over 5% each in graphic and technical products. Since label products continues to represent over half of the sales in this business segment, the overall positive unit sales volume driven by growth in label products was more than offset by a negative impact from price and mix during the quarter. 
Bemis' consolidated gross margins improved from 16.5% in the third quarter of 2011 to 19.2% in the third quarter of this year. Again, this improvement reflects improved sales mix, a better alignment between the cost of raw materials and our selling prices to customers compared to the third quarter of 2011 and some savings associated with the facility consolidation activities completed so far this year. 
Now I'm going to provide an update on our facility consolidation program. As Henry mentioned, we started realizing net cost savings benefits in the third quarter, which is earlier than we originally planned, driven by 2 factors. Number one, we've talked previously about the fact that the cost savings that hit in 2012 this year would be largely offset by short-term inefficiencies such as lower machine productivity and increased waste when we restart equipment. As it turned out, the expected inefficiencies will be deferred to future quarters. 
Number two, our teams have done an excellent job of delivering cost savings ahead of schedule for the plants we've already closed. Based upon our assessment of savings specifically associated with actions taken to date, approximately $5 million of cost savings were realized during this quarter. This represents annualized cost savings achieved of approximately $20 million as compared to our total program estimate of $50 million in annualized savings.  
During the third quarter, we incurred charges of $21.4 million and cash payments totaled $11.2 million. You can see the facility consolidation programs' complete financial timing and expense details on Page 2 of this morning's press release. 
Continuing through the income statement, selling, general and administrative expenses in 2012 will continue to fluctuate, reflecting the impact of changes related to the facilities consolidation program, the addition of businesses we already acquired and the adjustments of incentive compensation in response to business performance expectations. We expect total year 2012 SG&A to average 9.5% to 10% of net sales. 
Adjusted operating profit for the flexible packaging business segment increased 170 basis points to 11.5% compared to 9.8% in the third quarter of last year and 10.1% in the second quarter of this year. In the pressure sensitive materials business segment, operating profit margins were very close to the levels of 2011, reflecting our focus on prudent cost management in this challenging volume environment. Our effective tax rate was 36.1% for the third quarter, and we continue to expect the effective tax rate for the total year 2012 to be 36%. 
Moving on to the statement of cash flows. Cash provided by operating activities totaled $147 million for the third quarter. Working capital provided $42 million of cash flow during the third quarter, while facility consolidation payments used an additional $11 million of cash. Reiterating our expectations for future cash flows, we expect cash provided by operating activities to be in the range of $350 million for this full year, growing to $500 million annually beginning in 2014. Our adjusted earnings per share guidance for the fourth quarter of 2012 is $0.47 to $0.52 per share, which would mean full year adjusted earnings per share guidance of $2.10 to $2.15. 
In this range, 2012 would be the first or second best year of earnings in Bemis history. There are some specific headwinds and tailwinds that will influence our earnings in the fourth quarter. If we can maintain the sales mix improvement and continue to deliver the cost savings ahead of our original forecasts, we could end up at the top end of our range. Of course, that means there will be fewer incremental savings coming in 2013 since we're starting to recognize them in 2012. 
Aside from our typical season slowdown in the fourth quarter, the biggest hurdle we are trying to clear is continuing weak volumes in many of our end markets. Mix improvements and cost savings are helping fuel earnings growth in a declining volume environment but we can't cost cut our way to profit growth over the long-term. Our customers, especially the CPG and food companies, are battling declining volumes and so we are too, and expected food-cost inflation won't help drive consumer demand. So our business teams are vigorously chasing down profitable revenue opportunities around the world, and Bemis' industry-leading products are helping us compete against others in our industry who are chasing the same volumes. 
One last note before we open the call for questions. Our EPS guidance range assumes no further weakening in the Brazilian and European currencies and no raw material spikes. And now, operator, please open the call for questions."
