Now is a good time of the year to reflect on the past year as well as our goals for 2012. You will recall that throughout 2011, we have had to primarily objectives, optimizing existing businesses and efficiently deploying capital. In 2011, we executed well against both of these goals. We've now integrated 5 acquisitions since 2010 and taken out more cut of costs that were estimated at the time of each transaction. Integrations and systems conversions have become a core competency for this organization. Further, we've become very focused on organic loan and deposit growth, having entered the large new markets of the Boston and New York City MSAs. Our momentum is based on our 170-year-old brand and outstanding customer service throughout the financial crisis. We offer the full breadth of products and services our customers needs while providing a true relationship-based solution. All of this was accomplished while retaining strong asset quality, solid capital levels and a 5% dividend yield. 
Our 2011 financial results show substantial improvement. Operating earnings grew $112 million or 89% year-over-year. Likewise, our operating return on average assets was 91 basis points, up 34 basis points or 60% over 2010.
The primary driver behind our improvement has been and continues to be loan and deposit growth per share. During 2011, loans per share grew 20%, and deposits per share grew 18%.
I want to share 6 goals for 2012: First, grow loans in the mid-single digit to low double digits; second, increase deposits in the mid-single digits; third, strive to maintain a net interest margin above 4% for the first half of the year and minimize the decline below 4% for the second half; fourth, reduce operating expenses a run rate of $790 million to $810 million. Kirk will provide more detail. But at the highest level, we've accomplished 2 things, we have completed benchmarking process for the entire company and instituted a number of organizational changes. And second, we've established an expense management committee, which will manage costs from a horizontal perspective in addition to the traditional vertical business unit perspective. Fifth, we will work to offset 40% to 60% of the impact of Dodd-Frank. We believe we've offset 20% already. And sixth, maintain a fortress balance sheet with continuing excellent credit quality and strong capital levels.
We know that if we execute on our intermediate term goals, we will on our own, without M&A or interest-rate improvement, reach our 55% efficiency ratio goal in mid-2013 and our 125 basis point return on average assets goal in 2014. We believe that there will be significant regulatory undertakings for all institutions in 2012 and later years as the numerous regulations are enacted under Dodd-Frank.
As we've said in the past, this is a significant task in the industry, and we'll inevitably contribute to the fatigue factor particularly among smaller players, specially in light of the additional loss revenue and the higher compliance costs related to Dodd-Frank. We know we can hit our financial goals on our own through organic growth, dividends and share repurchases, but we'll also be working diligently to get there faster via industry consolidation. Global deleveraging and the rising level of fatigue within the U.S. banking industry would provide acquisition opportunities in 2012 and 2013.
With that, I'll pass it to Kirk to discuss the quarter and the expense management initiatives in more detail. Kirk?"

On Slide 4, we provide an overview of our fourth quarter results. For the quarter, operating earnings were $58.7 million or $0.17 per share, with net income of $43 million or $0.12 per share. The net interest margin improved to 4.16% compared t",2757,"Thank you. On Slide 4, we provide an overview of our fourth quarter results. For the quarter, operating earnings were $58.7 million or $0.17 per share, with net income of $43 million or $0.12 per share. The net interest margin improved to 4.16% compared to 4.11% in the third quarter. The improvement in the reported level is the result of cost recovery income resulting from better-than-expected performance, uncertain acquired loans in the Bank of Smithtown portfolio. 
Operating net interest margin, excluding cost recovery income, was 4.07% for the quarter compared to 4.11% in the third quarter. Total loan growth including runoffs and the acquired portfolios amounted to 5% on an annualized basis, which was entirely funded by deposit growth. Deposit rates declined by another 6 basis points to 50 basis points in the quarter. The efficiency ratio for the quarter improved to 62.7% from 63.1% in the third quarter. 
Capital ratios remain strong. We continue to deploy capital through organic growth. The tangible equity ratio stands at 12% as of the fourth quarter 2011.
On Slide 5, we discussed recent revenue growth initiatives. We continue to focus on commercial lending growth given our strength throughout the financial crisis, our larger balance sheet, broad operational capabilities and our expansion into new markets. Our goal is to leverage our expanded footprint in both the Boston MSA and Long Island in order to build upon renewed commercial residential mortgage in Home Equity momentum and drive asset-based lending.
Another key to revenue growth will be the ability to leverage our broad fee income product set, which includes cash management, asset management, brokerage, insurance, merchant and payroll services. We are also actively redesigning our incentive plans to objectively reward cross-selling within and across division lines.
On Slide 6, we move to an overview of recent expense initiatives. You'll see a clear emphasis on cost reduction. As we mentioned in October, we successfully completed the Danvers Core System conversion the fourth quarter, our fourth successful Core System conversion in 2011 and our sixth over the past 2 years. 
During the fourth quarter, we further right sized our employee base, following the 4 acquisitions we closed in 2010 and the Danvers transaction in 2011. The combined actions announced in the third and fourth quarter will result in compensation savings of $13 million in 2012 and over $15 million annualized as some of that savings will come later in the year.
We continue to realign our branch network following the acquisitions of Butler, RiverBank, Smithtown and Danvers and the de novo success we've enjoyed in Westchester and Boston. We expect to consolidate approximately 15 branches during 2012, which will result in $4 million of operating expense savings and approximately $5 million annualized. But again, some of that savings coming later in the year.
We're also actively working on real estate consolidation efforts to best utilize existing office space across the franchise. Further, we've identified IT contractor and other consultant savings of approximately $3 million in 2012. 
Lastly, we've identified another approximately $9 million of annual cost savings throughout the franchise. We strongly believe that these savings will not impede revenue growth.
Everyone at People's United is focused on continued steady progress as we move forward with a constant goal of increasing our recurring operating income. 
On Slide 7, you can see a breakdown of the elements contributing to our 4.16% margin results for the quarter. As you'll recall, third quarter net interest margin was 4.11%. The effects of lower loan yields reduced margin by 10 basis points. We picked up 9 basis points in the Bank of Smithtown cost recovery income and experienced the benefit of 6 basis points as a result of lower deposit rates and the fourth quarter benefit from the payoff of acquired FHLB advances, which occurred late in the third quarter.
On Slide 8, you can see that our operating net interest margin declined slightly in the quarter as a result of a continued environment of low interest rates and pricing pressure in the market. The differences between reported margin and operating margin this quarter is due to the 9 basis points of cost recovery income associated with certain Bank of Smithtown acquired loans. Our strong margin is a product of our low-cost stable funding, good loan mix and solid capital levels. All of which means we do not need to stretch our credit. In addition, our margin is and will continue to be supported by $1.3 billion of accretable yield resulting from 5 acquisitions closed within the last 2 years.
Let me provide you a little more detail on the next Slide. Slide 9 links closely with our discussion in the net interest margin. For the quarter, interest accretion on acquired loans total approximately $68 million, and the carrying amount of acquired loans at period end totaled $3.6 billion. 
As a reminder, the carrying amount of acquired loans is based on expected cash flows and reflects an inherent discount attributable to both the accretable yield and the non-accretable difference. These expect the cash flows are regularly reassessed as they were in this quarter for the Bank of Smithtown portfolio. 
Generally speaking, expected cash flows are impacted by the following: Changes in expected PNI payments, I would estimate the life of the loan, which may be attributable to the changes in our credit outlook or a result of loan modifications; changes in prepayment assumptions, which may change the amount of interest expected to be collected; and changes in interest rate indices for variable rate loans as expected cash flows are based on the rates and effect of the time and the cash flow reassessment.
As a result, the portfolios accretable yield and non-accretable difference are subject to change throughout the life of the portfolio as the estimate of expected cash flows is updated. These changes may be favorable or unfavorable. Such variability can increase when there's a significant level of loan sale, settlement and payout activity, as has been the case with the Smithtown portfolio. We'll provide some further color on the Smithtown reassessment on Slide 10.
Before we do that, as you can see in the table, the carrying amount in the acquired loan portfolio at December 31, 2011 reflects $1.3 billion in accretable yield and nearly $250 million in non-accretable difference, which compares favorably to a level of acquired NPLs at that same date.
The Smithtown portfolio is initially set up for accounting purposes as 6 loan pools, which are aggregate based on common risk characteristics and 147 individual loans. The loans accounted for individually, which had an initial carrying amount of $131 million, represent a construction and CRE loans in nonperforming status as of the acquisition date. These loans are were at various stages of project completion at uncertain prospects for effective loan resolution, and as a result, possess unique risk and credit quality considerations. 
During the quarter, we reassessed the cash flows in the Smithtown portfolio and noted the following results: The 6 loan pools, each of which is accounted for as a single asset, have generally performed within our initial range of expectations established at the acquisition date; loans accounted for individually resulted in the recognition of $5 million of cost recovery income associated with specific credits that have experienced better-than-expected cash flows; and $7.4 million of impairments associated with specific credits that have experienced worse-than-expected cash flow. The cost recovery income has reflected net interest income, and accounts for the incremental 9 basis points in the margin referred to earlier. The impairment charge is reflected in our loan loss provision and serves to establish an allowance for loan losses on the underlying loans.
Not surprisingly, these loans accounted for individually represent the population of loans subject to our more aggressive loan workout efforts during the past year. As a result of those efforts, as of December 31, 2011, the population of loans accounted for individually total approximately 70, and represented a carrying amount of less than $40 million. As such, we believe the level of specific -- of loan-specific risks inherent in this population of loans has been greatly reduced. 
For the full year, the impact on earnings stemming from activity within the Smithtown portfolio, exclusive of normal interest accretion, was a $5.1 million benefit. This benefit is comprised of $5 million of cost recovery income and a $7.5 million net gain on sale of acquired loans, partially offset by a $7.4 million of impairment. Accordingly, we continue to believe that the challenges inherent in this portfolio are manageable.
Slide 11 provides a breakdown of the elements contributing to our net increase in the gross loans. The loan portfolios produced total loan growth of 5% quarter-over-quarter annualized or 15.3% quarter-over-quarter annualized of originated loan growth. This marks the fourth consecutive quarter of originated loan growth greater than 10%, which reflects a strong momentum within the franchise. We believe we operate in the best commercial banking market in the United States, and are one of the few banks that can credibly offer the full product suite of a large bank while maintaining the outstanding customer service standards of a small bank. Importantly, our customers and others within the market recognize that we did not pull back in the last economic crisis and supported them over the last few years. So much of the growth is word-of-mouth referrals from our long-term customers.
Originated loan growth for the quarter totaled $620 million. As in prior quarters, growth came from a variety of products and geographic areas. We continue to expand into new markets via new products. Commercial real estate contributed 39% or $182 million. The portfolio remains very broadly diversified with most relationships well below $25 million. 
C&I contributed 37% or $172 million. Within C&I, we saw strength across all categories, but I would highlight 2 businesses, PCLC, our equipment finance business grew $69 million in the quarter, and People's United equipment finance increased $47 million. Residential mortgage added 36% or $168 million. Of the residential mortgage originations, approximately 95% were hybrid adjustable rate mortgages. 60% of the pipeline is jumbo product. Fourth quarter of '11 originations average loan size of 616,000. The average FIFO score for 4Q '11 originations was 757 with an average LTV of 68%.
Also within the retail category, new Home Equity commitment closed totaled $150 million compared to $179 million in the third quarter of '11. In terms of recent originations, the average loan or line size of the fourth quarter originations was 125,000. The average FICO scores for the fourth quarter was 757, with an average combined loan-to-value of 54%. 100% of our Home Equity loans are retail originated.
You notice those numbers didn't add 100%. That's because our consumer segment shank by $17.6 million, almost entirely the result of expected runoff in indirect auto loan business, which we exited in the third quarter. As a reminder, our consumer loan segment is 92% Home Equity loans, which were essentially flat in the quarter, growing by 800,000.
You can see on Slide 12 a breakdown of the elements contributing to our net increase in deposits. This is the first time we've broken out the deposit business out this way, but we feel it better reflects the way we manage the business. In any given quarter, 1 segment may be more volatile than another, but we feel good about our deposit base and our ability to grow from here. 
Our consumer deposit base grew $98 million while the commercial base increased $231 million. This growth occurred while overall deposit cost fell by 6 basis points to 50 basis points. In addition, we continue to manage a mix shift from time to demand in savings or money market deposits within the acquired institutions. As of December 31, 2011, commercial deposits represented 25% of our deposit base. We expect commercial deposits to grow more than 10% this year, bolstered by 2 large initiatives that are underway, which we expect will result in over $300 million of deposit recapture and products that are previously externally managed. 
In addition, incentive-based compensation is expected to further foster commercial deposit growth. By way of update, our Westchester franchise totaled 6 branches, grew by $43 million in the quarter and total deposit stand at $522 million as of year end. Our 5 de novo branches in the Boston market grew by $38 million in the quarter, and total deposits stand at $124 million as of year end. Not bad for 12 months.
Most importantly, annualized deposit growth was a bit more than loan growth. As you have heard me say before, loan growth is funded entirely by deposit growth is the best way to drive earnings.
Slide 13 is an important lens for us to think about the growth as it occurred in the company and will occur in the quarters ahead. We have managed to successfully grow loans and deposits while maintaining excellent asset quality. We know that if we grow loans, deposit per share, increased fee income and continue to reduce costs, we will produce greater recurring earnings per share. It is really very simple. Over the past 2 years, loans per share and deposits per share have grown at compounded annual rate of 18% and 14%, respectively.
Slide 14 provides a breakdown of noninterest income. Our noninterest income declined by $13 million quarter-over-quarter. The largest quarter-over-quarter changes were reduced income from third quarter security gains of $8.6 million and a $5 million decline in interchange fees as a result of the first full quarter of the Durbin amendment. First quarter and third quarter are the seasonally stronger periods for insurance as we have discussed previously. 
Additionally, we experienced a $2.7 million reduction in prepayments fees, which we noted in last quarter's commentary are difficult to predict. Last quarter, we recognized $4.8 million of losses in acquired loan sales compared to a loss of just $400,000 in the fourth quarter.
On Slide 15, you can see that our noninterest expense numbers, as well as operating expenses, was essentially flat. We had nonoperating expenses at $23 million in the quarter, the largest components of not operating expense this quarter were $13.3 million of merger-related expenses associated with the Danvers conversion, which occurred in October 17 followed by $4.8 million of charges associated with the planned consolidation of selective branches and other office space. General severance and other termination-related cost totaled $4.9 million.
As we think about noninterest expense, we are focused on the recurring noninterest expense base and believe that when we normalize for items that we feel are nonrecurring that weren't called out is not operating, our run rate expense based approximates $205 million. We expect that during the course of 2012, we will be steadily walking the quarterly run rate down, such as our targeted full-year operating expense base should be in the range we previously discussed.
On Slide 16, the efficiency ratio decreased to 62.7% for the fourth quarter compared to 63.1% in the third quarter. As we mentioned, we remain on track to reach our 55% efficiency ratio run rate goal in mid-2013.
Slide 17 and 18 are a quick reminder of our excellent credit quality. Nonperforming assets at 2% of originated loans and REO remain well below our peer group and Top 50 banks. NPAs increased from $305 million to $337 million, a $32 million increase. 2 relationships accounted for $25 million of this increase. We seem to hover in the 1.75% to 2% range since level of NPAs are so low that 1 or 2 loans will move us up or down in that range.
Looking at Slide 18, net charge-offs remained essentially flat at 29 basis points, approximately 30% of our peers. This is not a new trend, and reflects a minimal loss content in our nonperforming assets.
On Slide 19, you can see the detail for the allowance for loan losses by loan category. A few items to note: Our allowance to loan losses to commercial loans is approximately 1.4% while the coverage ratio is 77% of commercial NPLs. The allowance for loan losses on retail loans increased slightly this quarter. As you all know, we have strict loan loss allowance methodology that is consistently applied. Mixed shift to new originations explained the modest decline in the overall coverage ratio from the prior quarter. 
After excluding the $7.4 million increase in the provision, which related to the impairment of  uncertain Bank of Smithtown loans, the provision was down slightly for the third quarter 2011.
Now I'll pass it back over to Jack."

On Slide 20, you can see our operating return on average assets for the fourth quarter was 86 basis points. As we've outlined, the primary reasons for the decline are a reduced noninterest related income and a larger average balance sheet",370,"Thank you, Kurt. On Slide 20, you can see our operating return on average assets for the fourth quarter was 86 basis points. As we've outlined, the primary reasons for the decline are a reduced noninterest related income and a larger average balance sheet. Clearly, the low rate environment is limiting the positive effect of our organic growth. In addition, regulatory reform is negatively impacting our fee income. However, we're making progress in offsetting loss fee income resulting from regulatory reform, and expect to make up a majority of the negative impact of financial reform during 2012 by accelerating growth of other fee income products. As we've outlined, we're undertaking a number of initiatives to right size our cost base, and believe we will reach our 125 basis points return on average asset target in 2014, assuming the current interest rates and economic environment.
On Slide 21, we expect to see an increase in return on average tangible equity as we improve profitability and thoughtfully deploy capital. Our significant capital levels remained approximately 425 basis points above peers, which produces below industry return on average tangible equity. Normalizing our equity base shows that the core bank is performing well at 11% return on average tangible equity.
On Slide 22, consistent with the outline of some of our financial targets, we expect to see our operating dividend payout ratio trend lower through 2012.
On Slide 23, we have updated our capital ratios for both the holding company and the bank. Capital levels remain very strong with our tangible common equity ratio at 12% and our Tier 1 common ratio at 14.3%, which compares well to our peers at 7.7% and 11% as of the third quarter, respectively.
Slide 24 summarizes 2011 illustrates the power of our sustainable competitive advantage. Despite the low growth, low rate environment and increased regulatory headwinds, we delivered return on average asset improvement that is likely to be in the top quartile of our peers. It is our outstanding people and platform in the related momentum, which positions us so well for the quarters and years ahead. This concludes our presentation.

If you think about where our run rate was in the third quarter, which included a full quarter of Danvers, it was about $210 million or it would've been $840 million for the year.

Now is a good time of the year to reflect on the past year, as well as our goals for 2012. You will recall that throughout 2011, we have had 2 primary objectives: optimizing existing businesses and efficiently deploying capital. In 2011, we executed well against both of these goals. We've now integrated 5 acquisitions since 2010 and taken out more cuts -- costs than were estimated at the time of each transaction. Integration and systems conversions have become a core competency for this organization. Further, we've become very focused on organic loan and deposit growth, having entered the large new markets of the Boston and New York City MSAs. Our momentum is based on our 170-year-old brand and outstanding customer service throughout the financial crisis. We offer the full breadth of products and services our customers need while providing a true relationship-based solution. All of this was accomplished while retaining strong asset quality, solid capital levels and a 5% dividend yield. 
Our 2011 financial results show substantial improvement. Operating earnings grew $112 million or 89% year-over-year. Likewise, our operating return on average assets was 91 basis points, up 34 basis points or 60% over 2010.
The primary driver behind our improvement has been and continues to be loan and deposit growth per share. During 2011, loans per share grew 20%, and deposits per share grew 18%.
I want to share 6 goals for 2012: first, grow loans in the mid-single digit to low double digits; second, increase deposits in the mid-single digits; third, strive to maintain a net interest margin above 4% for the first half of the year and minimize the decline below 4% for the second half; fourth, reduce operating expenses to a run rate of $790 million to $810 million. Kirk will provide more detail. But at the highest level, we've accomplished 2 things: We have completed benchmarking process for the entire company and instituted a number of organizational changes. And second, we've established an expense management committee, which will manage costs from a horizontal perspective in addition to the traditional vertical business unit perspective; fifth, we will work to offset 40% to 60% of the impact of Dodd-Frank. We believe we've offset 20% already; and sixth, maintain a fortress balance sheet with continuing excellent credit quality and strong capital levels.
We know that if we execute on our intermediate-term goals, we will on our own, without M&A or interest rate improvement, reach our 55% efficiency ratio goal in mid-2013 and our 125 basis point return on average asset goal in 2014. We believe that there will be significant regulatory undertakings for all institutions in 2012 and later years as the numerous regulations are enacted under Dodd-Frank.
As we've said in the past, this is a significant tax on the industry, and we'll inevitably contribute to the fatigue factor, particularly among smaller players, specially in light of the additional lost revenue and the higher compliance costs related to Dodd-Frank. We know we can hit our financial goals on our own through organic growth, dividends and share repurchases, but we'll also be working diligently to get there faster via industry consolidation. Global deleveraging and the rising level of fatigue within the U.S. banking industry would provide acquisition opportunities in 2012 and 2013.
With that, I'll pass it to Kirk to discuss the quarter and the expense management initiatives in more detail. Kirk?"

On Slide 4, we provide an overview of our fourth quarter results. For the quarter, operating earnings were $58.7 million, or $0.17 per share, with a net income of $43 million, or $0.12 per share.

For the quarter, operating earnings were $58.7 million, or $0.17 per share, with a net income of $43 million, or $0.12 per share. The net interest margin improved to 4.16% compared to 4.11% in the third quarter. The improvement in the reported level is the result of cost recovery income resulting from better-than-expected performance, uncertain acquired loans in the Bank of Smithtown portfolio. 
Operating net interest margin, excluding cost recovery income, was 4.07% for the quarter compared to 4.11% in the third quarter. Total loan growth including runoffs in the acquired portfolios amounted to 5% on an annualized basis, which was entirely funded by deposit growth. Deposit rates declined by another 6 basis points to 50 basis points in the quarter. The efficiency ratio for the quarter improved to 62.7% from 63.1% in the third quarter. 
Capital ratios remain strong. We continue to deploy capital through organic growth. The tangible equity ratio stands at 12% as of fourth quarter 2011.
On Slide 5, we discuss the recent revenue growth initiatives. We continue to focus on commercial lending growth given our strength throughout the financial crisis, our larger balance sheet, broad operational capabilities and our expansion into new markets. Our goal is to leverage our expanded footprint in both the Boston MSA and Long Island in order to build upon renewed commercial, residential mortgage and Home Equity momentum and drive asset-based lending.
Another key to revenue growth will be the ability to leverage our broad fee income product set, which includes cash management, asset management, brokerage, insurance, merchant and payroll services. We are also actively redesigning our incentive plans to objectively reward cross-selling within and across division lines.
On Slide 6, we move to an overview of recent expense initiatives. You'll see a clear emphasis on cost reduction. As we mentioned in October, we successfully completed the Danvers core system conversion the fourth quarter, our fourth successful Core System conversion in 2011 and our sixth over the past 2 years. 
During the fourth quarter, we further rightsized our employee base following the 4 acquisitions we closed in 2010 and the Danvers transaction in 2011. The combined actions announced in the third and fourth quarter will result in compensation savings of $13 million in 2012 and over $15 million annualized as some of that savings will come later in the year.
We continue to realign our branch network following the acquisitions of Butler, RiverBank, Smithtown and Danvers and the de novo success we've enjoyed in Westchester and Boston. We expect to consolidate approximately 15 branches during 2012, which will result in $4 million of operating expense savings and approximately $5 million annualized. But again, some of that savings coming later in the year.
We are also actively working on real estate consolidation efforts to best utilize existing office space across the franchise. Further, we've identified IT contractor and other consultant savings of approximately $3 million in 2012. 
Lastly, we've identified another approximately $9 million of annual cost savings throughout the franchise. We strongly believe that these savings will not impede revenue growth.
Everyone at People's United is focused on continued steady progress as we move forward with a constant goal of increasing our recurring operating income. 
On Slide 7, you can see a breakdown of the elements contributing to our 4.16% margin results for the quarter. As you'll recall, third quarter net interest margin was 4.11%. The effects of lower loan yields reduced the margin by 10 basis points. We picked up 9 basis points in the Bank of Smithtown cost recovery income and experienced the benefit of 6 basis points as a result of lower deposit rates and the fourth quarter benefit from the payoff of acquired FHLB advances, which occurred late in the third quarter.
On Slide 8, you can see that our operating net interest margin declined slightly in the quarter as a result of a continued environment of low interest rates and pricing pressure in the market. The differences between reported margin and operating margin this quarter is due to the 9 basis points of cost recovery income associated with certain Bank of Smithtown acquired loans. Our strong margin is the product of our low-cost stable funding, good loan mix and solid capital levels, all of which means we do not need to stretch our credit. In addition, our margin is and will continue to be supported by $1.3 billion of accretable yield resulting from 5 acquisitions closed within the last 2 years.
Let me provide you a little more detail on the next Slide. Slide 9 links closely with our discussion in the net interest margin. For the quarter, interest accretion on acquired loans total approximately $68 million, and the carrying amount of acquired loans at period end totaled $3.6 billion. 
As a reminder, the carrying amount of acquired loans is based on expected cash flows and reflects an inherent discount attributable to both the accretable yield and the nonaccretable difference. These expected cash flows are regularly reassessed as they were in this quarter for the Bank of Smithtown portfolio. 
Generally speaking, expected cash flows are impacted by the following: changes in expected P&I payments over the estimated life of the loan, which may be attributable to the changes in our credit outlook or a result of loan modifications; changes in prepayment assumptions, which may change the amount of interest expected to be collected; and changes in interest rate indices for variable rate loans as expected cash flows are based on the rates and effect of the time and the cash flow reassessment.
As a result, the portfolio's accretable yield and nonaccretable difference are subject to change throughout the life of the portfolio as the estimate of expected cash flows is updated. These changes may be favorable or unfavorable. Such variability can increase when there's a significant level of loan sale, settlement and payoff activity, as has been the case with the Smithtown portfolio. We'll provide some further color on the Smithtown reassessment on Slide 10.
Before we do that, as you can see in the table, the carrying amount in the acquired loan portfolio at December 31, 2011, reflects $1.3 billion in accretable yield and nearly $250 million in nonaccretable difference, which compares favorably to a level of acquired NPLs at that same date.
The Smithtown portfolio is initially set up for accounting purposes as 6 loan pools, which are aggregate based on common risk characteristics and 147 individual loans. The loans accounted for individually, which had an initial carrying amount of $131 million, represented construction and CRE loans in nonperforming status as of the acquisition date. These loans were at various stages of project completion at uncertain prospects for effective loan resolution and, as a result, possessed unique risk and credit quality considerations. 
During the quarter, we reassessed the cash flows in the Smithtown portfolio and noted the following results: the 6 loan pools, each of which is accounted for as a single asset, have generally performed within our initial range of expectations established at the acquisition date; loans accounted for individually resulted in the recognition of $5 million of cost recovery income associated with specific credits that have experienced better-than-expected cash flows; and $7.4 million of impairments associated with specific credits that have experienced worse-than-expected cash flow. The cost recovery income has reflected net interest income and accounts for the incremental 9 basis points in the margin referred to earlier. The impairment charge is reflected in our loan loss provision and serves to establish an allowance for loan losses on the underlying loans.
Not surprisingly, these loans accounted for individually represent the population of loans subject to our more aggressive loan workout efforts during the past year. As a result of those efforts, as of December 31, 2011, the population of loans accounted for individually total approximately 70, and represented a carrying amount of less than $40 million. As such, we believe the level of specific -- of loan-specific risk inherent in this population of loans has been greatly reduced. 
For the full year, the impact on earnings stemming from activity within the Smithtown portfolio, exclusive of normal interest accretion, was a $5.1 million benefit. This benefit is comprised of $5 million of cost recovery income and a $7.5 million net gain on sale of acquired loans, partially offset by $7.4 million of impairment. Accordingly, we continue to believe that the challenges inherent in this portfolio are manageable.
Slide 11 provides a breakdown of the elements contributing to our net increase in the gross loans. The loan portfolios produced total loan growth of 5% quarter-over-quarter annualized or 15.3% quarter-over-quarter annualized of originated loan growth. This marks the fourth consecutive quarter of originated loan growth greater than 10%, which reflects a strong momentum within the franchise. We believe we operate in the best commercial banking market in the United States and are one of the few banks that can credibly offer the full product suite of a large bank while maintaining the outstanding customer service standards of a small bank. Importantly, our customers and others within the market recognize that we did not pull back in the last economic crisis and supported them over the last few years. So much of the growth is word-of-mouth referrals from our long-term customers.
Originated loan growth for the quarter totaled $620 million. As in prior quarters, growth came from a variety of products and geographic areas. We continue to expand into new markets via new products. Commercial real estate contributed 39% or $182 million. The portfolio remains very broadly diversified with most relationships well below $25 million. 
C&I contributed 37% or $172 million. Within C&I, we saw strength across all categories, but I would highlight 2 businesses: PCLC, our equipment finance business, grew $69 million in the quarter; and People's United equipment finance increased $47 million. Residential mortgage added 36% or $168 million. Of the residential mortgage originations, approximately 95% were hybrid adjustable rate mortgages. 60% of the pipeline is Jumbo Product. Fourth quarter of '11 originations, average loan size was 616,000. The average FICO score for 4Q '11 originations was 757 with an average LTV of 68%.
Also within the retail category, new Home Equity commitment closed totaled $150 million compared to $179 million in the third quarter of '11. In terms of recent originations, the average loan or line size of the fourth quarter originations was 125,000. The average FICO scores for the fourth quarter was 757, with an average combined loan-to-value of 54%. 100% of our Home Equity loans are retail originated.
You'll notice those numbers didn't add to 100%. That's because our consumer segment shrank by $17.6 million, almost entirely the result of expected runoff in indirect auto loan business, which we exited in the third quarter. As a reminder, our consumer loan segment is 92% Home Equity loans, which were essentially flat in the quarter, growing by 800,000.
You can see on Slide 12 a breakdown of the elements contributing to our net increase in deposits. This is the first time we've broken the deposit business out this way, but we feel it better reflects the way we manage the business. In any given quarter, one segment may be more volatile than another, but we feel good about our deposit base and our ability to grow from here. 
Our consumer deposit base grew $98 million while the commercial base increased $231 million. This growth occurred while overall deposit cost fell by 6 basis points to 50 basis points. In addition, we continue to manage a mix shift from time to demand in savings or money market deposits within the acquired institutions. As of December 31, 2011, commercial deposits represented 25% of our deposit base. We expect commercial deposits to grow more than 10% this year, bolstered by 2 large initiatives that are underway, which we expect will result in over $300 million of deposit recapture and products that were previously externally managed. 
In addition, incentive-based compensation is expected to further foster commercial deposit growth. By way of update, our Westchester franchise totaled 6 branches, grew by $43 million in the quarter and total deposits stand at $522 million as of year end. Our 5 de novo branches in the Boston market grew by $38 million in the quarter and total deposits stand at $124 million as of year end. Not bad for 12 months.
Most importantly, annualized deposit growth was a bit more than loan growth. As you have heard me say before, loan growth funded entirely by deposit growth is the best way to drive earnings.
Slide 13 is an important lens for us to think about the growth as it occurred in the company and will occur in the quarters ahead. We have managed to successfully grow loans and deposits while maintaining excellent asset quality. We know that if we grow loans, deposit per share, increased fee income and continue to reduce cost, we will produce greater recurring earnings per share. It is really very simple. Over the past 2 years, loans per share and deposits per share have grown at compound annual rates of 18% and 14%, respectively.
Slide 14 provides a breakdown of noninterest income. Our noninterest income declined by $13 million quarter-over-quarter. The largest quarter-over-quarter changes were reduced income from third quarter security gains of $8.6 million and a $5 million decline in interchange fees as a result of the first full quarter of the Durbin Amendment. First quarter and third quarter are the seasonally stronger periods for insurance as we have discussed previously. 
Additionally, we experienced a $2.7 million reduction in prepayments fees, which we noted in last quarter's commentary are difficult to predict. Last quarter, we recognized $4.8 million of losses in acquired loan sales compared to a loss of just $400,000 in the fourth quarter.
On Slide 15, you can see that our noninterest expense numbers, as well as operating expenses, were essentially flat. We had nonoperating expenses of $23 million in the quarter. The largest components of nonoperating expense this quarter were $13.3 million of merger-related expenses associated with the Danvers conversion, which occurred on October 17, followed by $4.8 million of charges associated with the planned consolidation of selective branches and other office space. General severance and other termination-related costs totaled $4.9 million.
As we think about noninterest expense, we're focused on the recurring noninterest expense base and believe that when we normalize for items that we feel are nonrecurring but weren't called out as nonoperating, our run rate expense base approximates $205 million. We expect that during the course of 2012, we will be steadily walking the quarterly run rate down, such as our targeted full year operating expense base should be in the range we previously discussed.
On Slide 16, the efficiency ratio decreased to 62.7% for the fourth quarter compared to 63.1% in the third quarter. As we mentioned, we remain on track to reach our 55% efficiency ratio run rate goal in mid-2013.
Slides 17 and 18 are a quick reminder of our excellent credit quality. Nonperforming assets at 2% of originated loans and REO remain well below our peer group and Top 50 banks. NPAs increased from $305 million to $337 million, a $32 million increase. Two relationships accounted for $25 million of this increase. We seem to hover in the 1.75% to 2% range since the level of NPAs are so low that 1 or 2 loans will move us up or down in that range.
Looking at Slide 18, net charge-offs remained essentially flat at 29 basis points, approximately 30% of our peers. This is not a new trend and reflects a minimal loss content in our nonperforming assets.
On Slide 19, you can see the detail for the allowance for loan losses by loan category. A few items to note: Our allowance for loan losses to commercial loans is approximately 1.4% with a coverage ratio of 77% of commercial NPLs. The allowance for loan losses on retail loans increased slightly this quarter. As you all know, we have strict loan loss allowance methodology which is consistently applied. Mix shift to new originations explained the modest decline in the overall coverage ratio from the prior quarter. 
After excluding the $7.4 million increase in the provision, which related to the impairment on  uncertain Bank of Smithtown loans, the provision was down slightly for the third quarter 2011.
Now I'll pass it back to Jack."

As we've outlined, the primary reasons for the decline are reduced noninterest-related income and a larger average balance sheet.",368,"Thank you, Kirk. On Slide 20, you can see our operating return on average assets for the fourth quarter was 86 basis points. As we've outlined, the primary reasons for the decline are reduced noninterest-related income and a larger average balance sheet. Clearly, the low rate environment is limiting the positive effect of our organic growth. In addition, regulatory reform is negatively impacting our fee income. However, we're making progress in offsetting lost fee income resulting from regulatory reform and expect to make up a majority of the negative impact of financial reform during 2012 by accelerating growth of other fee income products. As we've outlined, we're undertaking a number of initiatives to rightsize our cost base and believe we will reach our 125 basis point return on average asset target in 2014, assuming the current interest rate and economic environment.
On Slide 21, we expect to see an increase in return on average tangible equity as we improve profitability and thoughtfully deploy capital. Our significant capital levels remain approximately 425 basis points above peers, which produces below industry return on average tangible equity. Normalizing our equity base shows that the core bank is performing well at 11% return on average tangible equity.
On Slide 22, consistent with the outline of some of our financial targets, we expect to see our operating dividend payout ratio trend lower through 2012.
On Slide 23, we have updated our capital ratios for both the holding company and the bank. Capital levels remain very strong with our tangible common equity ratio at 12% and our Tier 1 common ratio at 14.3%, which compares well to our peers at 7.7% and 11% as of the third quarter, respectively.
Slide 24 summarizes -- 2011 illustrates the power of our sustainable competitive advantage. Despite the low growth, low rate environment and increased regulatory headwinds, we delivered return on average asset improvement that is likely to be in the top quartile of our peers. It is our outstanding people and platform and the related momentum, which positions us so well for the quarters and years ahead.

Now is a good time of the year to reflect on the past year, as well as our goals for 2012. You will recall that throughout 2011, we have had 2 primary objectives: optimizing existing businesses and efficiently deploying capital. In 2011, we executed well against both of these goals. We've now integrated 5 acquisitions since 2010 and taken out more cuts -- costs than were estimated at the time of each transaction. Integration and systems conversions have become a core competency for this organization. 
Further, we've become very focused on organic loan and deposit growth, having entered the large new markets of the Boston and New York City MSAs. Our momentum is based on our 170-year-old brand and outstanding customer service throughout the financial crisis. We offer the full breadth of products and services our customers need while providing a true relationship-based solution. All of this was accomplished while retaining strong asset quality, solid capital levels and a 5% dividend yield. 
Our 2011 financial results show substantial improvement. Operating earnings grew $112 million or 89% year-over-year. Likewise, our operating return on average assets was 91 basis points, up 34 basis points or 60% over 2010.
The primary driver behind our improvement has been and continues to be loan and deposit growth per share. During 2011, loans per share grew 20%, and deposits per share grew 18%.
I want to share 6 goals for 2012. First, grow loans in the mid-single digit to low double digits. Second, increase deposits in the mid-single digits. Third, strive to maintain a net interest margin above 4% for the first half of the year and minimize the decline below 4% for the second half. Fourth, reduce operating expenses to a run rate of $790 million to $810 million. Kirk will provide more detail. But at the highest level, we've accomplished 2 things. We have completed benchmarking process for the entire company and instituted a number of organizational changes; and second, we've established an expense management committee, which will manage costs from a horizontal perspective in addition to the traditional vertical business unit perspective. Fifth, we will work to offset 40% to 60% of the impact of Dodd-Frank. We believe we've offset 20% already. And sixth, maintain a fortress balance sheet with continuing excellent credit quality and strong capital levels.
We know that if we execute on our intermediate-term goals, we will on our own, without M&A or interest rate improvement, reach our 55% efficiency ratio goal in mid-2013; and our 125 basis point return on average asset goal in 2014. We believe that there will be significant regulatory undertakings for all institutions in 2012 and later years as the numerous regulations are enacted under Dodd-Frank.
As we've said in the past, this is a significant tax on the industry, and we'll inevitably contribute to the fatigue factor, particularly among smaller players, specially in light of the additional lost revenue and the higher compliance costs related to Dodd-Frank. We know we can hit our financial goals on our own through organic growth, dividends and share repurchases, but we'll also be working diligently to get there faster via industry consolidation. Global deleveraging and the rising level of fatigue within the U.S. banking industry would provide acquisition opportunities in 2012 and 2013.
With that, I'll pass it to Kirk to discuss the quarter and the expense management initiatives in more detail. Kirk?"

On Slide 4, we provide an overview of our fourth quarter results. For the quarter, operating earnings were $58.7 million, or $0.17 per share; with a net income of $43 million, or $0.12 per share. The net interest margin improved to 4.16% compar",2752,"Thank you. On Slide 4, we provide an overview of our fourth quarter results. For the quarter, operating earnings were $58.7 million, or $0.17 per share; with a net income of $43 million, or $0.12 per share. The net interest margin improved to 4.16% compared to 4.11% in the third quarter. The improvement in the reported level is the result of cost recovery income resulting from better-than-expected performance on certain acquired loans in the Bank of Smithtown portfolio. 
Operating net interest margin, excluding cost recovery income, was 4.07% for the quarter compared to 4.11% in the third quarter. Total loan growth including runoffs in the acquired portfolios amounted to 5% on an annualized basis, which was entirely funded by deposit growth. Deposit rates declined by another 6 basis points to 50 basis points in the quarter. The efficiency ratio for the quarter improved to 62.7% from 63.1% in the third quarter. 
Capital ratios remain strong. We continue to deploy capital through organic growth. The tangible equity ratio stands at 12% as of fourth quarter 2011.
On Slide 5, we discuss recent revenue growth initiatives. We continue to focus on commercial lending growth given our strength throughout the financial crisis, our larger balance sheet, broad operational capabilities and our expansion into new markets. Our goal is to leverage our expanded footprint in both the Boston MSA and Long Island in order to build upon renewed commercial, residential mortgage and Home Equity momentum and drive asset-based lending.
Another key to revenue growth will be the ability to leverage our broad fee income product set, which includes cash management, asset management, brokerage, insurance, merchant and payroll services. We are also actively redesigning our incentive plans to objectively reward cross-selling within and across division lines.
On Slide 6, we move to an overview of recent expense initiatives. You'll see a clear emphasis on cost reduction. As we mentioned in October, we successfully completed the Danvers core system conversion in the fourth quarter, our fourth successful Core System conversion in 2011 and our sixth over the past 2 years. 
During the fourth quarter, we further rightsized our employee base following the 4 acquisitions we closed in 2010 and the Danvers transaction in 2011. The combined actions announced in the third and fourth quarter will result in compensation savings of $13 million in 2012, and over $15 million annualized as some of that savings will come later in the year.
We continue to realign our branch network following the acquisitions of Butler, RiverBank, Smithtown and Danvers and the de novo success we've enjoyed in Westchester and Boston. We expect to consolidate approximately 15 branches during 2012, which will result in $4 million of operating expense savings and approximately $5 million annualized. But again, some of that savings coming later in the year.
We are also actively working on real estate consolidation efforts to best utilize existing office space across the franchise. Further, we've identified IT contractor and other consultant savings of approximately $3 million in 2012. 
Lastly, we've identified another approximately $9 million of annual cost savings throughout the franchise. We strongly believe that these savings will not impede revenue growth.
Everyone at People's United is focused on continued steady progress as we move forward with a constant goal of increasing our recurring operating income. 
On Slide 7, you can see a breakdown of the elements contributing to our 4.16% margin results for the quarter. As you'll recall, third quarter net interest margin was 4.11%. The effects of lower loan yields reduced the margin by 10 basis points. We picked up 9 basis points in the Bank of Smithtown cost recovery income and experienced the benefit of 6 basis points as a result of lower deposit rates and the fourth quarter benefit from the payoff of acquired FHLB advances, which occurred late in the third quarter.
On Slide 8, you can see that our operating net interest margin declined slightly in the quarter as a result of a continued environment of low interest rates and pricing pressure in the market. The differences between reported margin and operating margin this quarter is due to the 9 basis points of cost recovery income associated with certain Bank of Smithtown acquired loans. 
Our strong margin is the product of our low-cost stable funding, good loan mix and solid capital levels, all of which means we do not need to stretch our credit. In addition, our margin is and will continue to be supported by $1.3 billion of accretable yield resulting from 5 acquisitions closed within the last 2 years.
Let me provide you a little more detail on the next Slide. Slide 9 links closely with our discussion in the net interest margin. For the quarter, interest accretion on acquired loans total approximately $68 million, and the carrying amount of acquired loans at period end totaled $3.6 billion. 
As a reminder, the carrying amount of acquired loans is based on expected cash flows and reflects an inherent discount attributable to both the accretable yield and the nonaccretable difference. These expected cash flows are regularly reassessed as they were in this quarter for the Bank of Smithtown portfolio. 
Generally speaking, expected cash flows are impacted by the following: changes in expected P&I payments over the estimated life of the loan, which may be attributable to the changes in our credit outlook or a result of loan modifications; changes in prepayment assumptions, which may change the amount of interest expected to be collected; and changes in interest rate indices for variable rate loans as expected cash flows are based on the rates and effect of the time and the cash flow reassessment.
As a result, the portfolio's accretable yield and nonaccretable difference are subject to change throughout the life of the portfolio as the estimate of expected cash flows is updated. These changes may be favorable or unfavorable. Such variability can increase when there's a significant level of loan sale, settlement and payoff activity, as has been the case with the Smithtown portfolio. We'll provide some further color on the Smithtown reassessment on Slide 10.
Before we do that, as you can see in the table, the carrying amount in the acquired loan portfolio at December 31, 2011, reflects $1.3 billion in accretable yield and nearly $250 million in nonaccretable difference, which compares favorably to a level of acquired NPLs at that same date.
The Smithtown portfolio is initially set up for accounting purposes as 6 loan pools, which are aggregated based on common risk characteristics and 147 individual loans. The loans accounted for individually, which had an initial carrying amount of $131 million, represented construction and CRE loans in nonperforming status as of the acquisition date. These loans were at various stages of project completion at uncertain prospects for effective loan resolution and, as a result, possessed unique risk and credit quality considerations. 
During the quarter, we reassessed the cash flows in the Smithtown portfolio and noted the following results: the 6 loan pools, each of which is accounted for as a single asset, have generally performed within our initial range of expectations established at the acquisition date; loans accounted for individually resulted in the recognition of $5 million of cost recovery income associated with specific credits that have experienced better-than-expected cash flows; and $7.4 million of impairments associated with specific credits that have experienced worse-than-expected cash flow. The cost recovery income has reflected net interest income and accounts for the incremental 9 basis points in the margin referred to earlier. The impairment charge is reflected in our loan loss provision and serves to establish an allowance for loan losses on the underlying loans.
Not surprisingly, these loans accounted for individually represent the population of loans subject to our more aggressive loan workout efforts during the past year. As a result of those efforts, as of December 31, 2011, the population of loans accounted for individually total approximately 70, and represented a carrying amount of less than $40 million. As such, we believe the level of specific -- of loan-specific risk inherent in this population of loans has been greatly reduced. 
For the full year, the impact on earnings stemming from activity within the Smithtown portfolio, exclusive of normal interest accretion, was a $5.1 million benefit. This benefit is comprised of $5 million of cost recovery income and a $7.5 million net gain on sale of acquired loans, partially offset by $7.4 million of impairment. Accordingly, we continue to believe that the challenges inherent in this portfolio are manageable.
Slide 11 provides a breakdown of the elements contributing to our net increase in the gross loans. The loan portfolios produced total loan growth of 5% quarter-over-quarter annualized or 15.3% quarter-over-quarter annualized of originated loan growth. This marks the fourth consecutive quarter of originated loan growth greater than 10%, which reflects a strong momentum within the franchise. We believe we operate in the best commercial banking market in the United States and are one of the few banks that can credibly offer the full product suite of a large bank while maintaining the outstanding customer service standards of a small bank. Importantly, our customers and others within the market recognize that we did not pull back in the last economic crisis and supported them over the last few years. So much of the growth is word-of-mouth referrals from our long-term customers.
Originated loan growth for the quarter totaled $620 million. As in prior quarters, growth came from a variety of products and geographic areas. We continue to expand into new markets via new products. Commercial real estate contributed 39% or $182 million. The portfolio remains very broadly diversified with most relationships well below $25 million. 
C&I contributed 37% or $172 million. Within C&I, we saw strength across all categories, but I would highlight 2 businesses: PCLC, our equipment finance business, grew $69 million in the quarter; and People's United equipment finance increased $47 million. Residential mortgage added 36% or $168 million. Of the residential mortgage originations, approximately 95% were hybrid adjustable rate mortgages. 60% of the pipeline is Jumbo Product. Fourth quarter '11 originations, average loan size was 616,000. The average FICO score for 4Q '11 originations was 757 with an average LTV of 68%.
Also within the retail category, new Home Equity commitment closings totaled $150 million compared to $179 million in the third quarter of '11. In terms of recent originations, the average loan or line size of the fourth quarter originations was 125,000. The average FICO scores for the fourth quarter was 757, with an average combined loan-to-value of 54%. 100% of our Home Equity loans are retail originated.
You'll notice those numbers didn't add to 100%. That's because our consumer segment shrank by $17.6 million, almost entirely the result of expected runoff in indirect auto loan business, which we exited in the third quarter. As a reminder, our consumer loan segment is 92% Home Equity loans, which were essentially flat in the quarter, growing by 800,000.
You can see on Slide 12 a breakdown of the elements contributing to our net increase in deposits. This is the first time we've broken the deposit business out this way, but we feel it better reflects the way we manage the business. In any given quarter, one segment may be more volatile than another, but we feel good about our deposit base and our ability to grow from here. 
Our consumer deposit base grew $98 million while the commercial base increased $231 million. This growth occurred while overall deposit cost fell by 6 basis points to 50 basis points. In addition, we continue to manage a mix shift from time to demand in savings or money market deposits within the acquired institutions. As of December 31, 2011, commercial deposits represented 25% of our deposit base. We expect commercial deposits to grow more than 10% this year, bolstered by 2 large initiatives that are underway, which we expect will result in over $300 million of deposit recapture and products that were previously externally managed. 
In addition, incentive-based compensation is expected to further foster commercial deposit growth. By way of update, our Westchester franchise totaled 6 branches, grew by $43 million in the quarter and total deposits stand at $522 million as of year end. Our 5 de novo branches in the Boston market grew by $38 million in the quarter and total deposits stand at $124 million as of year end. Not bad for 12 months.
Most importantly, annualized deposit growth was a bit more than loan growth. As you have heard me say before, loan growth funded entirely by deposit growth is the best way to drive earnings.
Slide 13 is an important lens for us to think about the growth as it occurred in the company and will occur in the quarters ahead. We have managed to successfully grow loans and deposits while maintaining excellent asset quality. We know that if we grow loans and deposits per share, increase fee income and continue to reduce cost, we will produce greater recurring earnings per share. It is really very simple. Over the past 2 years, loans per share and deposits per share have grown at compound annual rates of 18% and 14%, respectively.
Slide 14 provides a breakdown of noninterest income. Our noninterest income declined by $13 million quarter-over-quarter. The largest quarter-over-quarter changes were reduced income from third quarter security gains of $8.6 million and a $5 million decline in interchange fees as a result of the first full quarter of the Durbin Amendment. First quarter and third quarter are the seasonally stronger periods for insurance as we have discussed previously. 
Additionally, we experienced a $2.7 million reduction in prepayments fees, which we noted in last quarter's commentary are difficult to predict. Last quarter, we recognized $4.8 million of losses in acquired loan sales compared to a loss of just $400,000 in the fourth quarter.
On Slide 15, you can see that our noninterest expense numbers, as well as operating expenses, were essentially flat. We had nonoperating expenses of $23 million in the quarter. The largest components of nonoperating expense this quarter were $13.3 million of merger-related expenses associated with the Danvers conversion, which occurred on October 17, followed by $4.8 million of charges associated with the planned consolidation of selected branches and other office space. General severance and other termination-related costs totaled $4.9 million.
As we think about noninterest expense, we're focused on the recurring noninterest expense base and believe that when we normalize for items that we feel are nonrecurring but weren't called out as nonoperating, our run rate expense base approximates $205 million. We expect that during the course of 2012, we will be steadily walking the quarterly run rate down, such as our targeted full year operating expense base should be in the range we previously discussed.
On Slide 16, the efficiency ratio decreased to 62.7% for the fourth quarter compared to 63.1% in the third quarter. As we mentioned, we remain on track to reach our 55% efficiency ratio run rate goal in mid-2013.
Slides 17 and 18 are a quick reminder of our excellent credit quality. Nonperforming assets at 2% of originated loans and REO remain well below our peer group and Top 50 banks. NPAs increased from $305 million to $337 million, a $32 million increase. Two relationships accounted for $25 million of this increase. We seem to hover in the 1.75% to 2% range since the level of NPAs are so low that 1 or 2 loans will move us up or down in that range.
Looking at Slide 18, net charge-offs remained essentially flat at 29 basis points, approximately 30% of our peers. This is not a new trend and reflects a minimal loss content in our nonperforming assets.
On Slide 19, you can see the detail for the allowance for loan losses by loan category. A few items to note: Our allowance for loan losses to commercial loans is approximately 1.4% with a coverage ratio of 77% of commercial NPLs. The allowance for loan losses on retail loans increased slightly this quarter. As you all know, we have strict loan loss allowance methodology which is consistently applied. Mix shift to new originations explained the modest decline in the overall coverage ratio from the prior quarter. 
After excluding the $7.4 million increase in the provision, which related to the impairment on  uncertain Bank of Smithtown loans, the provision was down slightly for the third quarter 2011.
Now I'll pass it back to Jack."

On Slide 20, you can see our operating return on average assets for the fourth quarter was 86 basis points. As we've outlined, the primary reasons for the decline are reduced noninterest-related income and a larger average balance sheet. Clearly, the low rate environment is limiting the positive effect of our organic growth. In addition, regulatory reform is negatively impacting our fee income. However, we're making progress in offsetting lost fee income resulting from regulatory reform, and expect to make up a majority of the negative impact of financial reform during 2012 by accelerating growth of other fee income products. As we've outlined, we're undertaking a number of initiatives to rightsize our cost base, and believe we will reach our 125 basis point return on average asset target in 2014 assuming the current interest rate and economic environment.
On Slide 21, we expect to see an increase in return on average tangible equity as we improve profitability and thoughtfully deploy capital. Our significant capital levels remain approximately 425 basis points above peers, which produces below industry return on average tangible equity. Normalizing our equity base shows that the core bank is performing well at 11% return on average tangible equity.
On Slide 22, consistent with the outline of some of our financial targets, we expect to see our operating dividend payout ratio trend lower through 2012.
On Slide 23, we have updated our capital ratios for both the holding company and the bank. Capital levels remain very strong with our tangible common equity ratio at 12% and our Tier 1 common ratio at 14.3%, which compares well to our peers at 7.7% and 11% as of the third quarter, respectively.
Slide 24 summarizes -- 2011 illustrates the power of our sustainable competitive advantage. Despite the low growth, low rate environment and increased regulatory headwinds, we delivered return on average asset improvement that is likely to be in the top quartile of our peers. It is our outstanding people and platform and the related momentum, which positions us so well for the quarters and years ahead.

Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today. On Slide 2, we provide an overview of our first quarter results. For the quarter, operating earnings were $60.6 million or $0.18 per share with net income of $58.6 million or $0",756,"Thank you, Peter. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today. On Slide 2, we provide an overview of our first quarter results. For the quarter, operating earnings were $60.6 million or $0.18 per share with net income of $58.6 million or $0.17 per share. As was somewhat expected, operating net interest margin declined to 4.01% compared to 4.07% operating margin in the fourth quarter. The decline in the margin is the result of lower loan yields due to continued repricing of the originated loan portfolio and deposit growth outstripping loan growth, which was partially offset by lower funding cost.
Total loan growth including runoff in the acquired portfolios amounted to 1.7% on an annualized basis, which was entirely funded by deposit growth. Originated loan growth was strong and amounted to 7.5% on an annualized basis. Deposit growth for the quarter reached 8.7% on an annualized basis. Deposit rates declined by another 6 basis points to 44 basis points in the quarter. Noninterest income improved compared to the fourth quarter due to growth in the gain on sale of residential loans, investment management fees, brokerage commissions and insurance, which was partially offset by decreases in loan prepayment fees and service charges.
The efficiency ratio rose to 63.2% from 61.8% in the fourth quarter. This is a result of seasonally higher operating expenses and lower net interest income due to slower loan growth and a decline in the net interest margin. Capital ratios remained strong. We continue to deploy capital thoughtfully through organic growth, dividends, share repurchases and our acquisition strategy. The tangible equity ratios stands at 11.7% as of first quarter 2012, which is well in excess of our peers.
On Slide 3, we discuss several recent initiatives. First, we launched our brand messaging, What know-how can do, during the quarter and have received strong positive feedback throughout our footprint. We continue to roll out this messaging through various media channels including our website, billboards and television commercials. Second, as was announced in our press release, we increased our dividend for the 20th consecutive year. As of yesterday's closing price, and adjusting for the new dividend rate of $0.64 per share annually, the annual dividend yield on our common stock is 5%. Third, we repurchased 4.5 million shares, or $56 million, at a weighted average price of $12.54 per share. This results in approximately $3 million of annual dividend savings. We have 13.5 million shares remaining in our existing share repurchase authorization.
Next, we announced the acquisition of 56 citizens branches in the New York metro area on February 28. 52 of the branches are situated in Stop & Shop supermarkets and four are traditional branches. 29 are located on Long Island, 8 in Westchester County and 6 are in the boroughs of the New York City. All of which are key areas of focus for People's United. A substantial opportunity exists to expand the acquired deposit base as citizens branches have average in-store deposits of $4 million. Our current Connecticut in-store franchise averages $29 million in deposits based on the location of the original account opening or $40 million in deposits if you account for where the customers conduct their banking activity. We look forward to closing this transaction in late June and begin to address in earnest the growth potential that exists in our New York metro franchise.
Fifth, and perhaps most importantly, as we discussed and as demonstrated in our originated loan and deposit growth and certain fee income business lines, this franchise has momentum. We are particularly pleased with the momentum across wealth management, insurance, brokerage, cash management and payroll service product lines. We have every reason to believe that the momentum will continue as we attract and retain top talent while remaining completely focused on best serving our customers adn maintaining our competitive, conservative credit culture. 
Along these lines, we recently hired additional talent to support our New York commercial lending unit. This unit will benefit from a deepening presence afforded by the upcoming acquisition of select citizens branches in New York metro area. For years now, we have participated in New York commercial real estate lending market. However, as with our asset-based lending portfolio, is underrepresented relative to the size and geography of our franchise. Our asset-based lending business has made significant progress and is up 18% on a quarter-over-quarter basis. We also recently strengthened our wealth management team, deepening our talent in both Fairfield County and the Boston market.
Now I'd like to turn it over to Kirk."

On Slide 4, you can see a breakdown of the elements contributing to our 4.01% reported in operating margin for the quarter. As you recall, our fourth quarter operating net interest margin was 4.07%, and the GAAP margin was 4.16%. The difference was attributable to 9 basis points of cost recovery income related to Bank of Smithtown as a result of our fourth quarter reassessment. The effects of lower loan yields further reduced the margin by 9 basis points. Finally, we had one less calendar day in the quarter, which adversely affected the margin by 3 basis points. Partially offsetting these negatives was a benefit of 6 basis points due to lower funding rates.
On Slide 5, you can see that our operating net interest margin declined to 4.01% in the quarter. The decline was somewhat expected and is primarily a result of the continued low interest rate environment where loan repricing or outpacing our ability to lower deposit costs. We also experienced increased deposit growth alongside slower loan growth.
Our strong margin is a product of our low-cost stable funding, good loan mix and solid capital levels, all of which means that we do not need to stretch on credit. In addition, our margin is and will continue to be supported by $1.3 billion of accretable yield resulting from 5 acquisitions closed within the last 2 years. Let me provide a little more detail on the next slide.
Slide 6 links closely with our discussion of the net interest margin. For the quarter, interest accretion on acquired loans totaled approximately $60 million, down from $68 million in the fourth quarter. And the carrying amount of acquired loans at period end totaled $3.4 billion.
Slide 7 provides a breakdown in the elements contributing to our net increase in loans. As Jack noted earlier, the loan portfolio produced 7.5% quarter-over-quarter annualized originated loan growth or total loan growth of 1.7% quarter-over-quarter annualized. We believe we operate in the best commercial banking market in the United States and are one of the few banks that can credibly offer the full product suite of a large bank while maintaining our outstanding customer service standards. Originated loan growth for the quarter totaled $314 million. As in prior quarters, growth came from a variety of products in geographic areas. Originated commercial loans increased $187 million quarter-over-quarter, which included increases of $153 million and $73 million from C&I and equipment financing, respectively and a $39 million decline in commercial real estate originated loans. 
Within C&I, we saw strength across all categories, but I would highlight 2 businesses, in particular, PCLC, one of our equipment financing businesses, grew originated loans $19 million in the quarter. And encouragingly, People's United equipment finance grew originated loans $54 million. With strong pipelines, we feel loan towards momentum will continue to build in the second quarter.
Originated residential mortgages grew by $156 million or 20% annualized. Of the residential mortgage originations, approximately 87% were hybrid adjustable-rate mortgages. 64% of the pipeline is jumbo product. First quarter 2012 originations to average loan size was $599,000. The average FICO score for the first quarter originations was 754 with an average LTV of 62%. Originated Home Equity loans declined by $11 million. We are in the market with a promotion right now and are seeing good traction. 
Loan closings totaled $126 million in commitments compared to $150 million in the fourth quarter of '11. In terms of recent originations, the average line size of the first quarter '12 originations was 121,000. Average FICO score for the first quarter was 759 with an average combined loan-to-value of 57%. 100% of Home Equity loans are retail originated.
You can see on Slide 8 a breakdown of the elements contributing to our net increase in deposits. We break out the deposits into retail and commercial, which reflects the way we manage the business. At any given quarter, one segment may be more volatile than another, but we feel good about our deposit base and our ability to grow from here, especially given overall growth of 8.7% for the quarter. Deposit growth was partially impacted by bringing $275 million in deposits onto the balance sheet. This balance consisted of $135 million from a new cash suite product, $57 million from checking accounts and $83 million from customer credit balances of people's securities, all of which impacted commercial deposits. 
Our consumer deposit base grew $310 million while the commercial deposit base increased $142 million. All of this occurred while overall deposit costs fell by 6 basis points to 44 basis points. This decrease was experienced across all product lines. In addition, we continue to manage a mix shift from time to demand and savings or money market deposits   within the acquired institutions. Deposit mix improved as non-interest-bearing and savings deposits represented 74.4% of total average deposits in the first quarter versus 73.7% in the fourth quarter of 2011. Average total deposits were up $246 million quarter-over-quarter. Annualized deposit growth was greater than annualized loan growth.
As you heard me say before, loan growth funded entirely by deposit growth is best way to drive earnings. We believe the second and third quarter will be seasonally stronger from a loan origination perspective making good use of the additional deposit funding we gathered this quarter.
Slide 9 is an important lens for us as we think about the growth that has occurred in the company and will occur in the quarters ahead. We have managed to successfully grow loans and deposits while maintaining excellent asset quality. We know that if we grow loans and deposits per share, increase the income and continue to reduce costs, we will produce greater recurring earnings per share. It is really very simple.
For the past 2 years, loans per share and deposits per share have grown at compound annual rates of 16% and 18%, respectively.
Slide 10 provides a breakout of noninterest income. Our noninterest income increased slightly from the fourth quarter. Loan prepayment fees and bank service charges declined by a total of $3.2 million, which was offset by higher gain on sale of residential loans of $1.9 million, increased insurance revenue of $1.2 million and increased trust and brokerage fees of $900,000. Additional fee income areas that have demonstrated momentum are cash management and payroll services, which increased 20% and 68%, respectively on a quarter-over-quarter annualized basis. Some seasonality was noted in insurance business. The first and third quarters are always seasonally stronger.
On Slide 11, you can see that our noninterest expense base improved to $209 million from $230 million last quarter. The largest part of this decrease was in non-operating expenses, which declined $20 million to $3 million in the current quarter. This quarter, non-operating expenses including -- included $2.4 million of severance and $600,000 of other onetime charges. In addition, as part of our ongoing efforts to maximize our work, we recently announced the sale of our Leominster branch at a reasonable deposit premium.
As we think about noninterest expense, we're focused on the operating noninterest expense base. The first quarter run rate expense base was $205.6 million, down from $207.2 million last quarter. We expect that during the course of 2012, we will be steadily walking the quarterly run rate down such that are targeted full year operating expense base should be in the range of $800 million to $830 million, which includes the impact of the citizens branch transaction.
Going forward, positive expense reduction initiatives include a favorable trend in fraud related charges, lower-than-anticipated rent expense, reduced depreciation expense, savings and check processing charges and courier fees due to negotiating contract reductions and a reduction in core processing IT expense.
On Slide 11, we provide a historical perspective of our efficiency ratio. As you may have noted in our non-GAAP reconciliation contained within the earnings release, we have made a change in the calculation of the efficiency ratio in order to treat purchase accounting related fair value adjustments more consistently. In recent years, total noninterest expense, the numerator was adjusted to exclude the effects of fair value adjustments related to acquired premises and equipment while total revenue, the denominator, was suggested to exclude the effects of fair value adjustments related to liabilities assumed.
Prior to the adoption of FASB statement 141R in 2009, total revenue was also adjusted to exclude the effects of fair value adjustments related to acquired loans. This practice, however, became impractical under the accretable yield accounting model for acquired loans, which has been applied to all portfolios acquired since that date. In the interest of simplicity and transparency, beginning this quarter, the efficiency ratio will no longer reflect any purchase accounting related adjustments other than normal amortization of intangibles. All prior periods have been adjusted so as to be presented on a comparable basis. The impact of this change in the efficiency ratio for each of the periods presented was a favorable 80 to 90 basis points.
The efficiency ratio rose to 63.2% for the first quarter compared to 61.8% in the fourth quarter but was down from 65.4% in the first quarter of 2011. This is essentially the result of seasonally higher operating expenses and lower revenue growth driven by slower loan growth and a declining net interest margin. However, loan pipeline carries significantly stronger this quarter than last quarter, and we are seeing higher utilization rates on commercial lines consistent with improved borrower confidence. We remain on track to reach our 55% efficiency rate, run rate goal in 2013.
Slides 13 and 14 are a reminder of our excellent credit quality. We did see an improvement in nonperforming assets this quarter. NPAs decreased from $336 million to $316 million, a $20 million decrease. Nonperforming assets at 1.85% of originated loans and REO remained well below our peer group and Top 50 banks.
Looking at Slide 14, net charge-offs improved to 22 basis points compared to 29 basis points last quarter and remain at approximately 30% of our peers. These levels continue to reflect the minimal loss content in our nonperforming assets. Over the last 4 quarters, charge-offs against specific reserves represent approximately 45% of total charge-offs. As such, we understand our credit issues well and typically have very few new credit events each quarter. The largest component this quarter charge-offs relate to one out of market real estate Shared National Credit, which represents approximately 40% of net charge-offs for the period.
On Slide 15, you can see the detail for the allowance for loan losses by loan category. A few items of note. Our allowance for loan losses to commercial loans is 1.34%, with the coverage ratio 79% of commercial NPLs. As we have stated previously, we have a strict loan loss allowance methodology, which is consistently applied. That said, mixed shift and new originations can result in modest changes and the overall coverage ratio in any given quarter. Provision for loan losses reflects $11.2 million in charge-offs including $4.8 million with previously established specific reserves, $4.8 million of additional allowance build in response loan growth and $300,000 of impairment associated with acquired loans.
Now I'll pass it back to Jack."

On Slide 16, you can see our operating return on average assets for the first quarter was 0.88%, up slightly from the fourth quarter. As we talked about earlier, we have momentum. We expect that momentum to accelerate as we continue to attract and retain top talent while remaining focus on best serving our customers and maintaining our conservative credit culture. Additionally, progress on our expense initiatives for the year will result in improved return profile for the franchise.
On Slide 17, we expect to see an increasing return on average tangible equity as we improved profitability and thoughtfully deploy capital. Our significant capital levels remain approximately 370 basis points above peers, which produced below industry return on average tangible equity. Normalizing our equity base shows that the core bank is performing well at 11.7% and return on average tangible equity.
On Slide 18, consistent with the outline of our financial targets, we expect to see our operating dividend payout ratio trend lower through 2012.
On Slide 19, we have updated our capital ratios for both the holding company and the bank. Capital levels remained very strong with our tangible common equity ratio at 11.7% and Tier 1 common at 14%. This compares well to our peers at 8% and 10.9% as of the fourth quarter, respectively.
The group -- excuse me, the GAAP narrows as we deploy capital in our peers build capital. While our tangible equity common ratio remains much higher than our peers, on a total risk-based capital basis, we are much closer to peers. We really are a commercial bank and as a result, have a large amount of 100% risk-weighted assets.
And on Slide 20, our robust pipelines and strong originated loan growth contribute to our continued momentum with the franchise, which we accept to accelerate in the coming quarters. The strength of our platform continues to allow us to attract and retain exceptional talent and provide the sustainable competitive advantage. This concludes our presentation. And now, we'll be happy to answer any questions that you may have. Operator, we're ready for questions."

So that's a couple of things on the acquired loans that I think we've talked about in the fourth quarter. And certainly, we have a lot of detail out there on. In terms of the originated books, I think we continue to see good loan growth there, probably a little slower than what we did. On the latter part of last year, we are optimistic with the pipelines we have as that kicks in smart the seasonally stronger periods for us of second and third quarter. But overall, I think we face the same challenges as others in terms of the low interest rate environment. Some level of loan repricing is continuing on in the book that we're continuing to manage through.

So that initially coming in and out of the chute, will be a bit of a push in there. As we grow those, you may see their costs, cost of funds in those branches go up a little bit as we run promotions in different things. On the other side, we are still bringing down the cost of funds on the Bank of Smithtown, Danvers acquisitions, which still hover around 1%. So we have a little bit of effect on both sides. In terms of the branches themselves, we would need to get them to about $10 million on deposits for a breakeven. The guidance we've given is that we felt that it would be a negative to the tune of $0.01 a share for this year and the next and a breakeven into '14. And effectively, by '14, we expect them paying the freight and then we'll leverage from there. I would remind you that the our average brand size, if you look at where our customers branch or Stop & Shop branches, it's a little over $40 million. And so we think the opportunity is significant. We've been in this business a long time, and we feel very optimistic about growing -- having these branches and having being able to grow them both other deposit side as well as the loan side."

Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today. On Slide 2, we provide an overview of our first quarter results. For the quarter, operating earnings were $60.6 million or $0.18 per share with net income of $58.6 million or $0",761,"Thank you, Peter. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today. On Slide 2, we provide an overview of our first quarter results. For the quarter, operating earnings were $60.6 million or $0.18 per share with net income of $58.6 million or $0.17 per share. As was somewhat expected, the operating net interest margin declined to 4.01% compared to 4.07% operating margin in the fourth quarter. The decline in the margin is the result of lower loan yields due to continued repricing of the originated loan portfolio and deposit growth outstripping loan growth, which was partially offset by lower funding costs.
Total loan growth, including runoff in the acquired portfolios amounted to 1.7% on an annualized basis, which was entirely funded by deposit growth. Originated loan growth was strong and amounted to 7.5% on an annualized basis. Deposit growth for the quarter reached 8.7% on an annualized basis. Deposit rates declined by another 6 basis points to 44 basis points in the quarter. Noninterest income improved compared to the fourth quarter due to growth in the gain on sale of residential loans, investment management fees, brokerage commissions and insurance, which was partially offset by decreases in loan prepayment fees and service charges.
The efficiency ratio rose to 63.2% from 61.8% in the fourth quarter. This is a result of seasonally higher operating expenses and lower net interest income due to a slower loan growth and a decline in the net interest margin. Capital ratios remained strong. We continue to deploy capital thoughtfully through organic growth, dividends, share repurchases and our acquisition strategy. The tangible equity ratio stands at 11.7% as of first quarter 2012, which is well in excess of our peers.
On Slide 3, we discuss several recent initiatives. First, we launched our brand messaging,""What know-how can do,"" during the quarter and have received strong positive feedback throughout our footprint. We continue to roll out this messaging through various media channels including our website, billboards and television commercials. Second, as what was announced in our press release, we increased our dividend for the 20th consecutive year. As of yesterday's closing price, and adjusting for the new dividend rate of $0.64 per share annually, the annual dividend yield on our common stock is 5%. Third, we repurchased 4.5 million shares, or $56 million, at a weighted average price of $12.54 per share. This results in approximately $3 million of annual dividend savings. We have 13.5 million shares remaining in our existing share repurchase authorization.
Next, we announced the acquisition of 56 Citizens branches in the New York metro area on February 28. 52 of the branches are situated in Stop & Shop supermarkets and 4 are traditional branches. 29 are located on Long Island, 8 are in Westchester County and 6 are in the boroughs of the New York City. All of which are key areas of focus for People's United. A substantial opportunity exists to expand the acquired deposit base as Citizens branches had average in-store deposits of $4 million. Our current Connecticut in-store franchise averages $29 million in deposits based on the location of the original account opening or $40 million in deposits if you account for where the customers conduct their banking activity. We look forward to closing this transaction in late June and begin to address in earnest the growth potential that exists in our New York metro franchise.
Fifth, and perhaps most importantly, as we discussed and as demonstrated in our originated loan and deposit growth and certain fee income business lines, this franchise has momentum. We are particularly pleased with the momentum across wealth management, insurance, brokerage, cash management and payroll service product lines. We have every reason to believe that the momentum will continue as we attract and retain top talent while remaining completely focused on best serving our customers and maintaining our competitive, conservative credit culture. 
Along these lines, we recently hired additional talent to support our New York commercial lending unit. This unit will benefit from the deepening presence afforded by the upcoming acquisition of select Citizens branches in New York metro area. For years now, we have participated in the New York Commercial Real Estate lending market. However, as with our asset-based lending portfolio, it is underrepresented relative to the size and geography of our franchise. Our asset-based lending business has made significant progress and is up 18% on a quarter-over-quarter basis. We also recently strengthened our wealth management team, deepening our talent in both Fairfield County and the Boston market.
Now I'd like to turn it over to Kirk."

On Slide 4, you can see a breakdown of the elements contributing to our 4.01% reported and operating margin for the quarter.

On Slide 4, you can see a breakdown of the elements contributing to our 4.01% reported and operating margin for the quarter. As you recall, our fourth quarter operating net interest margin was 4.07%, and the GAAP margin was 4.16%. The difference was attributable to 9 basis points of cost recovery income related to Bank of Smithtown as a result of our fourth quarter reassessment. The effects of lower loan yields further reduced the margin by 9 basis points. Finally, we had one less calendar day in the quarter, which adversely affected the margin by 3 basis points. Partially offsetting these negatives was a benefit of 6 basis points due to lower funding rates.
On Slide 5, you can see that our operating net interest margin declined to 4.01% in the quarter. The decline was somewhat expected and is primarily a result of the continued low interest rate environment where loan reprices are or outpacing our ability to lower deposit costs. We also experienced increased deposit growth alongside slower loan growth.
Our strong margin is a product of our low-cost stable funding, good loan mix and solid capital levels, all of which means that we do not need to stretch on credit. In addition, our margin is and will continue to be supported by $1.3 billion of accretable yield resulting from 5 acquisitions closed within the last 2 years. Let me provide a little more detail on the next slide.
Slide 6 links closely with our discussion of the net interest margin. For the quarter, interest accretion on acquired loans totaled approximately $60 million, down from $68 million in the fourth quarter. And the carrying amount of acquired loans at period end totaled $3.4 billion.
Slide 7 provides a breakdown and the elements contributing to our net increase in loans. As Jack noted earlier, the loan portfolios produced 7.5% quarter-over-quarter annualized originated loan growth or total loan growth of 1.7% quarter-over-quarter annualized. We believe we operate in the best commercial banking market in the United States and are one of the few banks that can credibly offer the full product suite of a large bank while maintaining our outstanding customer service standards. 
Originated loan growth for the quarter totaled $314 million. As in prior quarters, growth came from a variety of products in geographic areas. Originated commercial loans increased to $187 million quarter-over-quarter, which included increases of $153 million and $73 million from C&I and equipment financing, respectively and a $39 million decline in commercial real estate originated loans. 
Within C&I, we saw strength across all categories, but I would highlight 2 businesses. In particular, PCLC, one of our equipment financing businesses, grew originated loans $19 million in the quarter. And encouragingly, People's United Equipment Finance grew originated loans $54 million. With strong pipelines, we feel our loan growth momentum will continue to build in the second quarter.
Originated residential mortgages grew by $156 million or 20% annualized. Of the residential mortgage originations, approximately 87% were hybrid adjustable-rate mortgages. 64% of the pipeline is jumbo product. First quarter 2012 origination to average loan size was $599,000. The average FICO score for the first quarter originations was 754 with an average LTV of 62%. Originated Home Equity loans declined by $11 million. We are in the market with a promotion right now and are seeing good traction. 
Loan closings totaled $126 million in commitments compared to $150 million in the fourth quarter of '11. In terms of recent originations, the average line size of the first quarter '12 originations was 121,000. The average FICO score for the first quarter was 759 with an average combined loan-to-value of 57%. 100% of Home Equity loans are retail originated.
You can see on Slide 8 a breakdown of the elements contributing to our net increase in deposits. We break out the deposits into retail and commercial, which reflects the way we manage the business. In any given quarter, one segment may be more volatile than another, but we feel good about our deposit base and our ability to grow from here, especially given overall growth of 8.7% for the quarter. Deposit growth was partially impacted by bringing $275 million in deposits onto the balance sheet. This balance consisted of $135 million from a new cash suite product, $57 million from checking accounts and $83 million from customer credit balances of people's securities, all of which impacted commercial deposits. 
Our consumer deposit base grew $310 million while the commercial deposit base increased $142 million. All of this occurred while overall deposit costs fell by 6 basis points to 44 basis points. This decrease was experienced across all product lines. In addition, we continue to manage a mix shift from time to demand and savings or money market deposits   within the acquired institutions. Deposit mix improved as non-interest-bearing and savings deposits represented 74.8% of total average deposits in the first quarter versus 73.7% in the fourth quarter of 2011. Average total deposits were up $246 million quarter-over-quarter. Annualized deposit growth was greater than annualized loan growth.
As you heard me say before, loan growth funded entirely by deposit growth is the best way to drive earnings. We believe the second and third quarter will be seasonally stronger from a loan origination perspective, making good use of the additional deposit funding we gathered this quarter.
Slide 9 is an important lens for us as we think about the growth that has occurred in the company and will occur in the quarters ahead. We have managed to successfully grow loans and deposits while maintaining excellent asset quality. We know that if we grow loans and deposits per share, increase the income and continue to reduce costs, we will produce greater recurring earnings per share. It is really very simple. Over the past 2 years, loans per share and deposits per share have grown at compound annual rates of 16% and 18%, respectively.
Slide 10 provides a breakout of noninterest income. Our noninterest income increased slightly from the fourth quarter. Loan prepayment fees and bank service charges declined by a total of $3.2 million, which was offset by higher gain on sale of residential loans of $1.9 million, increased insurance revenue of $1.2 million and increased trust and brokerage fees of $900,000. Additional fee income areas that have demonstrated momentum are cash management and payroll services, which increased 20% and 68%, respectively on a quarter-over-quarter annualized basis. Some seasonality was noted in the insurance business. The first and third quarters are always seasonally stronger.
On Slide 11, you can see that our noninterest expense base improved to $209 million from $230 million last quarter. The largest part of this decrease was in non-operating expenses, which declined $20 million to $3 million in the current quarter. This quarter, non-operating expenses including -- included $2.4 million of severance and $600,000 of other one-time charges. In addition, as part of our ongoing effort to maximize that work, we recently announced the sale of our Leominster branch at a reasonable deposit premium.
As we think about noninterest expense, we're focused on the operating noninterest expense base. The first quarter run rate expense base was $205.6 million, down from $207.2 million last quarter. We expect that during the course of 2012, we will be steadily walking the quarterly run rate down such that are targeted full-year operating expense base should be in the range of $800 million to $830 million, which includes the impact of the Citizens branch transaction.
Going forward, positive expense reduction initiatives include a favorable trend in fraud-related charges, lower-than-anticipated rent expense, reduced depreciation expense, savings and check processing charges and courier fees due to negotiated contract reductions and a reduction in core processing IT expense.
On Slide 11, we provide a historical perspective of our efficiency ratio. As you may have noted in our non-GAAP reconciliation contained within the earnings release, we have made a change in the calculation of the efficiency ratio in order to treat purchase accounting related fair value adjustments more consistently. In recent years, total noninterest expense, the numerator, was adjusted to exclude the effects of fair value adjustments related to acquired premises and equipment while total revenue, the denominator, was suggested to exclude the effects of fair value adjustments related to liabilities assumed.
Prior to the adoption of FASB statement 141R in 2009, total revenue was also adjusted to exclude the effects of fair value adjustments related to acquired loans. This practice, however, became impractical under the accretable yield accounting model for acquired loans, which has been applied to all portfolios acquired since that date. In the interest of simplicity and transparency, beginning this quarter, the efficiency ratio will no longer reflect any purchase accounting-related adjustments other than normal amortization of intangibles. All prior periods have been adjusted so as to be presented on a comparable basis. The impact of this change in the efficiency ratio for each of the periods present was a favorable 80 to 90 basis points.
The efficiency ratio rose to 63.2% for the first quarter compared to 61.8% in the fourth quarter, but was down from 65.4% in the first quarter of 2011. This is essentially the result of seasonally higher operating expenses and lower revenue growth driven by slower loan growth and a decline in net interest margin. However, loan pipeline turns significantly stronger this quarter than last quarter, and we are seeing higher utilization rates on commercial lines consistent with improved borrower confidence. We remain on track to reach our 55% efficiency rate, run rate goal in 2013.
Slides 13 and 14 are a reminder of our excellent credit quality. We did see an improvement in nonperforming assets this quarter. NPAs decreased from $336 million to $316 million, a $20 million decrease. Nonperforming assets at 1.85% of originated loans and REO remained well below our peer group and Top 50 banks.
Looking at Slide 14, net charge-offs improved to 22 basis points compared to 29 basis points last quarter and remain at approximately 30% of our peers. These levels continue to reflect the minimal loss content in our nonperforming assets. Over the last 4 quarters, charge-offs against specific reserves represent approximately 45% of total charge-offs. As such, we understand our credit issues well and typically have very few new credit events each quarter. The largest component to this quarter's charge-offs relate to one out-of-market real estate Shared National Credit, which represents approximately 40% of net charge-offs for the period.
On Slide 15, you can see the detail for the allowance for loan losses by loan category. A few items of note. Our allowance for loan losses to commercial loans is 1.34%, with a coverage ratio of 79% of commercial NPLs. As we have stated previously, we have a strict loan loss allowance methodology, which is consistently applied. That said, mixed shift and new originations can result in modest changes in the overall coverage ratio in any given quarter. Provision for loan losses reflects $11.2 million in charge-offs, including $4.8 million with previously established specific reserves, $4.8 million of additional allowance build in response to loan growth and $300,000 of impairment associated with acquired loans.
Now I'll pass it back to Jack."

On Slide 16, you can see our operating return on average assets for the first quarter was 0.88%, up slightly from the fourth quarter. As we've talked about earlier, we have momentum. We expect that momentum to accelerate as we continue to attract and retain top talent while remaining focused on best serving our customers and maintaining our conservative credit culture. Additionally, progress on our expense initiatives for the year will result in improved return profile for the franchise.
On Slide 17, we expect to see an increase in return on average tangible equity as we improve profitability and thoughtfully deploy capital. Our significant capital levels remain approximately 370 basis points above peers, which produced below industry return on average tangible equity. Normalizing our equity base shows that the core bank is performing well at 11.7% when we turn on average tangible equity. On Slide 18, consistent with the outline of our financial targets, we expect to see our operating dividend payout ratio to trend lower through 2012.
On Slide 19, we have updated our capital ratios for both the holding company and the bank. Capital levels remained very strong with our tangible common equity ratio at 11.7% and Tier 1 Common at 14%, which compares well to our peers at 8% and 10.9% as of the fourth quarter, respectively.
The group -- excuse me, the GAAP narrows as we deploy capital and our peers build capital. While our tangible common equity ratio remains much higher than our peers, on a total risk-based capital basis, we are much closer to peers. We really are a commercial bank and as a result, have a large amount of 100% risk-weighted assets.
And on Slide 20, our robust pipelines and strong originated loan growth contribute to our continued momentum with the franchise, which we expect to accelerate in the coming quarters. The strength of our platform continues to allow us to attract and retain exceptional talent and provide us a sustainable competitive advantage. This concludes our presentation.

First, I think in terms of net interest income, on the loan side, we need to remember that we are fighting, and you can see it easily in our charts, the continued heavy prepayments on the acquired loans. And part of that relates to the old Fin Fed book, which really had an average life of about 3 years. And we're in the third year of that at this point. And so that is something that continues to come through, and that obviously is that continues to pay down and impacts the accretion that we're able to book quarter-over-quarter. So that's a couple of things on the acquired loans that I think we've talked about in the fourth quarter. And certainly, we have a lot of detail out there on. In terms of the originated books, I think we continue to see good loan growth there, probably a little slower than what we did. On the latter part of last year, we are optimistic with the pipelines we have as that kicks in to more of the seasonally stronger periods for us of the second and third quarter. But overall, I think we face the same challenges as others in terms of the low interest rate environment. Some level of loan repricing is continuing on in the book that we're continuing to manage through. To your question on the securities portfolio, I think we've by and large held it pretty flat, maybe up a bit. And we had some stuff to settle in the fourth quarter that's increased in averages.

But the overall cost of operating an in-store branch is about 1/3 less than a traditional branch. And I think the other item to note, which most people don't understand, is we do get a nice chunk of loan volume through those branches. If you look at our Connecticut operation, which is a very strong operation, which we have a little over 80 in-store branches, about 1/2 of our consumer checking accounts that are opened in Connecticut are opened in those branches. But interestingly enough, if you look on the loan side, 30% of our Home Equities, 30% of our mortgage loans and almost 30% of business banking loans come through those branches, including about 30% of our investment sales. So we've had a good mix of business that tends to come into those that overall makes them profitable and a real plus.

Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today. On Slide 2, we provide an overview of our first quarter results. For the quarter, operating earnings were $60.6 million or $0.18 per share with net income of $58.6 million or $0",759,"Thank you, Peter. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today. On Slide 2, we provide an overview of our first quarter results. For the quarter, operating earnings were $60.6 million or $0.18 per share with net income of $58.6 million or $0.17 per share. As was somewhat expected, the operating net interest margin declined to 4.01% compared to 4.07% operating margin in the fourth quarter. The decline in the margin is the result of lower loan yields due to continued repricing of the originated loan portfolio and deposit growth outstripping loan growth, which was partially offset by lower funding costs.
Total loan growth, including runoff in the acquired portfolios amounted to 1.7% on an annualized basis, which was entirely funded by deposit growth. Originated loan growth was strong and amounted to 7.5% on an annualized basis. Deposit growth for the quarter reached 8.7% on an annualized basis. Deposit rates declined by another 6 basis points to 44 basis points in the quarter. Noninterest income improved compared to the fourth quarter due to growth in the gain on sale of residential loans, investment management fees, brokerage commissions and insurance, which was partially offset by decreases in loan prepayment fees and service charges.
The efficiency ratio rose to 63.2% from 61.8% in the fourth quarter. This is a result of seasonally higher operating expenses and lower net interest income due to slower loan growth and a decline in the net interest margin. Capital ratios remained strong. We continue to deploy capital thoughtfully through organic growth, dividends, share repurchases and our acquisition strategy. The tangible equity ratio stands at 11.7% as of first quarter 2012, which is well in excess of our peers.
On Slide 3, we discuss several recent initiatives. First, we launched our brand messaging,""What know-how can do,"" during the quarter and have received strong positive feedback throughout our footprint. We continue to roll out this messaging through various media channels including our website, billboards and television commercials. Second, as was announced in our press release, we increased our dividend for the 20th consecutive year. As of yesterday's closing price, and adjusting for the new dividend rate of $0.64 per share annually, the annual dividend yield on our common stock is 5%. Third, we repurchased 4.5 million shares, or $56 million, at a weighted average price of $12.54 per share. This results in approximately $3 million of annual dividend savings. We have 13.5 million shares remaining in our existing share repurchase authorization.
Next, we announced the acquisition of 56 Citizens branches in the New York metro area on February 28. 52 of the branches are situated in Stop & Shop supermarkets and 4 are traditional branches. 29 are located on Long Island, 8 are in Westchester County and 6 are in the boroughs of the New York City. All of which are key areas of focus for People's United. A substantial opportunity exists to expand the acquired deposit base as Citizens branches had average in-store deposits of $4 million. Our current Connecticut in-store franchise averages $29 million in deposits based on the location of the original account opening or $40 million in deposits if you account for where the customers conduct their banking activity. We look forward to closing this transaction in late June and begin to address in earnest the growth potential that exists in our New York metro franchise.
Fifth, and perhaps most importantly, as we discussed and as demonstrated in our originated loan and deposit growth and certain fee income business lines, this franchise has momentum. We are particularly pleased with the momentum across wealth management, insurance, brokerage, cash management and payroll service product lines. We have every reason to believe that the momentum will continue as we attract and retain top talent while remaining completely focused on best serving our customers and maintaining our competitive, conservative credit culture. 
Along these lines, we recently hired additional talent to support our New York commercial lending unit. This unit will benefit from the deepening presence afforded by the upcoming acquisition of select Citizens branches in New York metro area. For years now, we have participated in the New York Commercial Real Estate lending market. However, as with our asset-based lending portfolio, it is underrepresented relative to the size and geography of our franchise. Our asset-based lending business has made significant progress and is up 18% on a quarter-over-quarter basis. We also recently strengthened our wealth management team, deepening our talent in both Fairfield County and the Boston market.
Now I'd like to turn it over to Kirk."

On Slide 4, you can see a breakdown of the elements contributing to our 4.01% reported and operating margin for the quarter. As you'll recall, our fourth quarter operating net interest margin was 4.07%, and the GAAP margin was 4.16%. The",1862,"Thank you, Jack. On Slide 4, you can see a breakdown of the elements contributing to our 4.01% reported and operating margin for the quarter. As you'll recall, our fourth quarter operating net interest margin was 4.07%, and the GAAP margin was 4.16%. The difference was attributable to 9 basis points of cost recovery income related to Bank of Smithtown as a result of our fourth quarter reassessment. The effects of lower loan yields further reduced the margin by 9 basis points. Finally, we had one less calendar day in the quarter, which adversely affected the margin by 3 basis points. Partially offsetting these negatives was a benefit of 6 basis points due to lower funding rates.
On Slide 5, you can see that our operating net interest margin declined to 4.01% in the quarter. The decline was somewhat expected and is primarily a result of the continued low interest rate environment where loan repricings are outpacing our ability to lower deposit costs. We also experienced increased deposit growth alongside slower loan growth.
Our strong margin is a product of our low-cost stable funding, good loan mix and solid capital levels, all of which means that we do not need to stretch on credit. In addition, our margin is and will continue to be supported by $1.3 billion of accretable yield resulting from 5 acquisitions closed within the last 2 years. Let me provide a little more detail on the next slide.
Slide 6 links closely with our discussion of the net interest margin. For the quarter, interest accretion on acquired loans totaled approximately $60 million, down from $68 million in the fourth quarter. And the carrying amount of acquired loans at period end totaled $3.4 billion.
Slide 7 provides a breakdown and the elements contributing to our net increase in loans. As Jack noted earlier, the loan portfolios produced 7.5% quarter-over-quarter annualized originated loan growth or total loan growth of 1.7% quarter-over-quarter annualized. We believe we operate in the best commercial banking market in the United States and are one of the few banks that can credibly offer the full product suite of a large bank while maintaining our outstanding customer service standards. 
Originated loan growth for the quarter totaled $314 million. As in prior quarters, growth came from a variety of products in geographic areas. Originated commercial loans increased $187 million quarter-over-quarter, which included increases of $153 million and $73 million from C&I and equipment financing, respectively and a $39 million decline in commercial real estate originated loans. 
Within C&I, we saw strength across all categories, but I would highlight 2 businesses. In particular, PCLC, one of our equipment financing businesses, grew originated loans $19 million in the quarter. And encouragingly, People's United Equipment Finance grew originated loans $54 million. With strong pipelines, we feel loan growth momentum will continue to build in the second quarter.
Originated residential mortgages grew by $156 million, or 20% annualized. Of the residential mortgage originations, approximately 87% were hybrid adjustable-rate mortgages. 64% of the pipeline is jumbo product. First quarter 2012 origination to average loan size was $599,000. The average FICO score for the first quarter originations was 754 with an average LTV of 62%. Originated Home Equity loans declined by $11 million. We are in the market with a promotion right now and are seeing good traction. 
Loan closings totaled $126 million in commitments compared to $150 million in the fourth quarter of '11. In terms of recent originations, the average line size of the first quarter '12 originations was 121,000. The average FICO score for the first quarter was 759 with an average combined loan-to-value of 57%. 100% of Home Equity loans are retail originated.
You can see on Slide 8 a breakdown of the elements contributing to our net increase in deposits. We break out the deposits into retail and commercial, which reflects the way we manage the business. In any given quarter, one segment may be more volatile than another, but we feel good about our deposit base and our ability to grow from here, especially given overall growth of 8.7% for the quarter. Deposit growth was partially impacted by bringing $275 million in deposits onto the balance sheet. This balance consisted of $135 million from a new cash suite product, $57 million from checking accounts and $83 million from customer credit balances of people's securities, all of which impacted commercial deposits. 
Our consumer deposit base grew $310 million while the commercial deposit base increased $142 million. All of this occurred while overall deposit costs fell by 6 basis points to 44 basis points. This decrease was experienced across all product lines. In addition, we continue to manage a mix shift from time to demand and savings or money market deposits   within the acquired institutions. Deposit mix improved as non-interest-bearing and savings deposits represented 74.8% of total average deposits in the first quarter versus 73.7% in the fourth quarter of 2011. Average total deposits were up $246 million quarter-over-quarter. Annualized deposit growth was greater than annualized loan growth.
As you heard me say before, loan growth funded entirely by deposit growth is the best way to drive earnings. We believe the second and third quarter will be seasonally stronger from a loan origination perspective, making good use of the additional deposit funding we gathered this quarter.
Slide 9 is an important lens for us as we think about the growth that has occurred in the company and will occur in the quarters ahead. We have managed to successfully grow loans and deposits while maintaining excellent asset quality. We know that if we grow loans and deposits per share, increase the income and continue to reduce costs, we will produce greater recurring earnings per share. It is really very simple. Over the past 2 years, loans per share and deposits per share have grown at compound annual rates of 16% and 18%, respectively.
Slide 10 provides a breakout of noninterest income. Our noninterest income increased slightly from the fourth quarter. Loan prepayment fees and bank service charges declined by a total of $3.2 million, which was offset by higher gain on sale of residential loans of $1.9 million, increased insurance revenue of $1.2 million and increased trust and brokerage fees of $900,000. Additional fee income areas that have demonstrated momentum are cash management and payroll services, which increased 20% and 68%, respectively on a quarter-over-quarter annualized basis. Some seasonality was noted in the insurance business. The first and third quarters are always seasonally stronger.
On Slide 11, you can see that our noninterest expense base improved to $209 million from $230 million last quarter. The largest part of this decrease was in non-operating expenses, which declined $20 million to $3 million in the current quarter. This quarter, non-operating expenses including -- included $2.4 million of severance and $600,000 of other one-time charges. In addition, as part of our ongoing effort to maximize that work, we recently announced the sale of our Leominster branch at a reasonable deposit premium.
As we think about noninterest expense, we're focused on the operating noninterest expense base. The first quarter run rate expense base was $205.6 million, down from $207.2 million last quarter. We expect that during the course of 2012, we will be steadily walking the quarterly run rate down such that are targeted full-year operating expense base should be in the range of $800 million to $830 million, which includes the impact of the Citizens branch transaction.
Going forward, positive expense reduction initiatives include a favorable trend in fraud-related charges, lower-than-anticipated rent expense, reduced depreciation expense, savings and check processing charges and courier fees due to negotiated contract reductions and a reduction in core processing IT expense.
On Slide 11, we provide a historical perspective of our efficiency ratio. As you may have noted in our non-GAAP reconciliation contained within the earnings release, we have made a change in the calculation of the efficiency ratio in order to treat purchase accounting related fair value adjustments more consistently. In recent years, total noninterest expense, the numerator, was adjusted to exclude the effects of fair value adjustments related to acquired premises and equipment while total revenue, the denominator, was suggested to exclude the effects of fair value adjustments related to liabilities assumed.
Prior to the adoption of FASB statement 141R in 2009, total revenue was also adjusted to exclude the effects of fair value adjustments related to acquired loans. This practice, however, became impractical under the accretable yield accounting model for acquired loans, which has been applied to all portfolios acquired since that date. In the interest of simplicity and transparency, beginning this quarter, the efficiency ratio will no longer reflect any purchase accounting-related adjustments other than normal amortization of intangibles. All prior periods have been adjusted so as to be presented on a comparable basis. The impact of this change in the efficiency ratio for each of the periods present was a favorable 80 to 90 basis points.
The efficiency ratio rose to 63.2% for the first quarter compared to 61.8% in the fourth quarter, but was down from 65.4% in the first quarter of 2011. This is essentially the result of seasonally higher operating expenses and lower revenue growth driven by slower loan growth and a declining net interest margin. However, loan pipeline turns significantly stronger this quarter than last quarter, and we are seeing higher utilization rates on commercial lines consistent with improved borrower confidence. We remain on track to reach our 55% efficiency rate, run rate goal in 2013.
Slides 13 and 14 are a reminder of our excellent credit quality. We did see an improvement in nonperforming assets this quarter. NPAs decreased from $336 million to $316 million, a $20 million decrease. Nonperforming assets at 1.85% of originated loans and REO remained well below our peer group and Top 50 banks.
Looking at Slide 14, net charge-offs improved to 22 basis points compared to 29 basis points last quarter and remain at approximately 30% of our peers. These levels continue to reflect the minimal loss content in our nonperforming assets. Over the last 4 quarters, charge-offs against specific reserves represent approximately 45% of total charge-offs. As such, we understand our credit issues well and typically have very few new credit events each quarter. The largest component to this quarter's charge-offs relates to one out-of-market real estate Shared National Credit, which represents approximately 40% of net charge-offs for the period.
On Slide 15, you can see the detail for the allowance for loan losses by loan category. A few items of note. Our allowance for loan losses to commercial loans is 1.34%, with a coverage ratio of 79% of commercial NPLs. As we have stated previously, we have a strict loan loss allowance methodology, which is consistently applied. That said, mixed shift and new originations can result in modest changes in the overall coverage ratio in any given quarter. Provision for loan losses reflects $11.2 million in charge-offs, including $4.8 million with previously established specific reserves, $4.8 million of additional allowance build in response to loan growth and $300,000 of impairment associated with acquired loans.

Normalizing our equity base shows that the core bank is performing well at 11.7% when we turn on average tangible equity. On Slide 18, consistent with the outline of our financial targets, we expect to see our operating dividend payout ratio to trend lower through 2012.
On Slide 19, we have updated our capital ratios for both the holding company and the bank. Capital levels remain very strong with our tangible common equity ratio at 11.7% and Tier 1 Common at 14%, which compares well to our peers at 8% and 10.9% as of the fourth quarter, respectfully.
The group -- excuse me, the GAAP narrows as we deploy capital and our peers build capital. While our tangible common equity ratio remains much higher than our peers, on a total risk-based capital basis, we are much closer to peers. We really are a commercial bank and as a result, have a large amount of 100% risk-weighted assets.
And on Slide 20, our robust pipelines and strong originated loan growth contribute to our continued momentum with the franchise, which we expect to accelerate in the coming quarters. The strength of our platform continues to allow us to attract and retain exceptional talent and provide us a sustainable competitive advantage. This concludes our presentation. 
And now, we'll be happy to answer any questions that you may have. Operator, we're ready for questions."

First, I think in terms of net interest income, on the loan side, we need to remember that we are fighting, and you can see it easily in our charts, the continued heavy prepayments on the acquired loans. And part of that relates to the old Fin Fed book, which really had an average life of about 3 years. And we're in the third year of that at this point. And so that is something that continues to come through, and that obviously is that continues to pay down and impacts the accretion that we're able to book quarter-over-quarter. So that's a couple of things on the acquired loans that I think we've talked about in the fourth quarter. And certainly, we have a lot of detail out there on. In terms of the originated books, I think we continue to see good loan growth there, probably a little slower than what we did on the latter part of last year. We are optimistic with the pipelines we have as that kicks in to more of the seasonally stronger periods for us of the second and third quarter. But overall, I think we face the same challenges as others in terms of the low interest rate environment. Some level of loan repricing is continuing on in the book that we're continuing to manage through. To your question on the securities portfolio, I think we've by and large held it pretty flat, maybe up a bit. And we had some stuff to settle in the fourth quarter that's increased in averages.

On the Citizen's acquisition, which we expect to close at the end of the quarter, their overall cost of funds is 42 basis points. And so we have a cost of funds of 44 basis points. So that initially coming in out of the chute will be a bit of a push in there. As we grow those, you may see their costs, the cost of funds in those branches go up a little bit as we run promotions and different things. On the other side, we are still bringing down the cost of funds on the Bank of Smithtown, Danvers acquisitions, which still hover around 1%. So we'll have a little bit of effect on both sides. In terms of the branches themselves, we would need to get them to about $10 million on deposits for a breakeven. The guidance we've given is that we felt that it'd be a negative to the tune of $0.01 a share for this year and next and a breakeven in '14. So effectively, by '14, we'd expect they're paying the freight and then we'd leverage from there. I would remind you that the -- our average brand size, if you look at where our customers branch or Stop & Shop branches, it's a little over $40 million. And so we think the opportunity is significant. We've been in this business a long time, and we feel very optimistic about growing -- having these branches and being able to grow them both on the deposit side as well as the loan side."

Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today. On Slide 2, we provide an overview of our first quarter results. For the quarter, operating earnings were $60.6 million or $0.18 per share with net income of $58.6 million or $0",760,"Thank you, Peter. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today. On Slide 2, we provide an overview of our first quarter results. For the quarter, operating earnings were $60.6 million or $0.18 per share with net income of $58.6 million or $0.17 per share. As was somewhat expected, the operating net interest margin declined to 4.01% compared to 4.07% operating margin in the fourth quarter. The decline in the margin is the result of lower loan yields due to continued repricing of the originated loan portfolio and deposit growth outstripping loan growth, which was partially offset by lower funding costs.
Total loan growth, including runoff in the acquired portfolios amounted to 1.7% on an annualized basis, which was entirely funded by deposit growth. Originated loan growth was strong and amounted to 7.5% on an annualized basis. Deposit growth for the quarter reached 8.7% on an annualized basis. Deposit rates declined by another 6 basis points to 44 basis points in the quarter. Noninterest income improved compared to the fourth quarter due to growth in the gain on sale of residential loans, investment management fees, brokerage commissions and insurance, which was partially offset by decreases in loan prepayment fees and service charges.
The efficiency ratio rose to 63.2% from 61.8% in the fourth quarter. This is a result of seasonally higher operating expenses and lower net interest income due to slower loan growth and a decline in the net interest margin. Capital ratios remained strong. We continue to deploy capital thoughtfully through organic growth, dividends, share repurchases and our acquisition strategy. The tangible equity ratio stands at 11.7% as of first quarter 2012, which is well in excess of our peers.
On Slide 3, we discuss several recent initiatives. First, we launched our brand messaging, ""What know-how can do,"" during the quarter and have received strong positive feedback throughout our footprint. We continue to roll out this messaging through various media channels including our website, billboards and television commercials. Second, as was announced in our press release, we increased our dividend for the 20th consecutive year. As of yesterday's closing price, and adjusting for the new dividend rate of $0.64 per share annually, the annual dividend yield on our common stock is 5%. Third, we repurchased 4.5 million shares, or $56 million, at a weighted average price of $12.54 per share. This results in approximately $3 million of annual dividend savings. We have 13.5 million shares remaining in our existing share repurchase authorization.
Next, we announced the acquisition of 56 Citizens branches in the New York metro area on February 28. 52 of the branches are situated in Stop & Shop supermarkets and 4 are traditional branches. 29 are located on Long Island, 8 are in Westchester County and 6 are in the boroughs of the New York City. All of which are key areas of focus for People's United. A substantial opportunity exists to expand the acquired deposit base as Citizens branches had average in-store deposits of $4 million. Our current Connecticut in-store franchise averages $29 million in deposits based on the location of the original account opening or $40 million in deposits if you account for where the customers conduct their banking activity. We look forward to closing this transaction in late June and begin to address in earnest the growth potential that exists in our New York metro franchise.
Fifth, and perhaps most importantly, as we discussed and as demonstrated in our originated loan and deposit growth and certain fee income business lines, this franchise has momentum. We are particularly pleased with the momentum across wealth management, insurance, brokerage, cash management and payroll service product lines. We have every reason to believe that the momentum will continue as we attract and retain top talent while remaining completely focused on best serving our customers and maintaining our competitive, conservative credit culture. 
Along these lines, we recently hired additional talent to support our New York commercial lending unit. This unit will benefit from the deepening presence afforded by the upcoming acquisition of select Citizens branches in New York metro area. For years now, we have participated in the New York Commercial Real Estate lending market. However, as with our asset-based lending portfolio, it is underrepresented relative to the size and geography of our franchise. Our asset-based lending business has made significant progress and is up 18% on a quarter-over-quarter basis. We also recently strengthened our wealth management team, deepening our talent in both Fairfield County and the Boston market.
Now I'd like to turn it over to Kirk."

The effects of lower loan yields further reduced the margin by 9 basis points. Finally, we had one less calendar day in the quarter, which adversely affected the margin by 3 basis points. Partially offsetting these negatives was a benefit of 6 basis points due to lower funding rates.
On Slide 5, you can see that our operating net interest margin declined to 4.01% in the quarter. The decline was somewhat expected and is primarily a result of the continued low interest rate environment where loan repricings are outpacing our ability to lower deposit costs. We also experienced increased deposit growth alongside slower loan growth.
Our strong margin is a product of our low-cost stable funding, good loan mix and solid capital levels, all of which means that we do not need to stretch on credit. In addition, our margin is and will continue to be supported by $1.3 billion of accretable yield resulting from 5 acquisitions closed within the last 2 years. Let me provide a little more detail on the next slide.
Slide 6 links closely with our discussion of the net interest margin. For the quarter, interest accretion on acquired loans totaled approximately $60 million, down from $68 million in the fourth quarter. And the carrying amount of acquired loans at period end totaled $3.4 billion.
Slide 7 provides a breakdown and the elements contributing to our net increase in loans. As Jack noted earlier, the loan portfolios produced 7.5% quarter-over-quarter annualized originated loan growth or total loan growth of 1.7% quarter-over-quarter annualized. We believe we operate in the best commercial banking market in the United States and are one of the few banks that can credibly offer the full product suite of a large bank while maintaining our outstanding customer service standards. 
Originated loan growth for the quarter totaled $314 million. As in prior quarters, growth came from a variety of products in geographic areas. Originated commercial loans increased $187 million quarter-over-quarter, which included increases of $153 million and $73 million from C&I and equipment financing, respectively and a $39 million decline in commercial real estate originated loans. 
Within C&I, we saw strength across all categories, but I would highlight 2 businesses. In particular, PCLC, one of our equipment financing businesses, grew originated loans $19 million in the quarter. And encouragingly, People's United Equipment Finance grew originated loans $54 million. With strong pipelines, we feel loan growth momentum will continue to build in the second quarter.
Originated residential mortgages grew by $156 million, or 20% annualized. Of the residential mortgage originations, approximately 87% were hybrid adjustable-rate mortgages. 64% of the pipeline is jumbo product. First quarter 2012 origination to average loan size was $599,000. The average FICO score for the first quarter originations was 754 with an average LTV of 62%. Originated Home Equity loans declined by $11 million. We are in the market with a promotion right now and are seeing good traction. 
Loan closings totaled $126 million in commitments compared to $150 million in the fourth quarter of '11. In terms of recent originations, the average line size of the first quarter '12 originations was 121,000. The average FICO score for the first quarter was 759 with an average combined loan-to-value of 57%. 100% of Home Equity loans are retail originated.
You can see on Slide 8 a breakdown of the elements contributing to our net increase in deposits. We break out the deposits into retail and commercial, which reflects the way we manage the business. In any given quarter, one segment may be more volatile than another, but we feel good about our deposit base and our ability to grow from here, especially given overall growth of 8.7% for the quarter. Deposit growth was partially impacted by bringing $275 million in deposits onto the balance sheet. This balance consisted of $135 million from a new cash suite product, $57 million from checking accounts and $83 million from customer credit balances of people's securities, all of which impacted commercial deposits. 
Our consumer deposit base grew $310 million while the commercial deposit base increased $142 million. All of this occurred while overall deposit costs fell by 6 basis points to 44 basis points. This decrease was experienced across all product lines. In addition, we continue to manage a mix shift from time to demand and savings or money market deposits   within the acquired institutions. Deposit mix improved as non-interest-bearing and savings deposits represented 74.8% of total average deposits in the first quarter versus 73.7% in the fourth quarter of 2011. Average total deposits were up $246 million quarter-over-quarter. Annualized deposit growth was greater than annualized loan growth.
As you heard me say before, loan growth funded entirely by deposit growth is the best way to drive earnings. We believe the second and third quarter will be seasonally stronger from a loan origination perspective, making good use of the additional deposit funding we gathered this quarter.
Slide 9 is an important lens for us as we think about the growth that has occurred in the company and will occur in the quarters ahead. We have managed to successfully grow loans and deposits while maintaining excellent asset quality. We know that if we grow loans and deposits per share, increase the income and continue to reduce costs, we will produce greater recurring earnings per share. It is really very simple. Over the past 2 years, loans per share and deposits per share have grown at compound annual rates of 16% and 18%, respectively.
Slide 10 provides a breakout of noninterest income. Our noninterest income increased slightly from the fourth quarter. Loan prepayment fees and bank service charges declined by a total of $3.2 million, which was offset by higher gain on sale of residential loans of $1.9 million, increased insurance revenue of $1.2 million and increased trust and brokerage fees of $900,000. Additional fee income areas that have demonstrated momentum are cash management and payroll services, which increased 20% and 68%, respectively on a quarter-over-quarter annualized basis. Some seasonality was noted in the insurance business. The first and third quarters are always seasonally stronger.
On Slide 11, you can see that our noninterest expense base improved to $209 million from $230 million last quarter. The largest part of this decrease was in non-operating expenses, which declined $20 million to $3 million in the current quarter. This quarter, non-operating expenses including -- included $2.4 million of severance and $600,000 of other one-time charges. In addition, as part of our ongoing effort to maximize that work, we recently announced the sale of our Leominster branch at a reasonable deposit premium.
As we think about noninterest expense, we're focused on the operating noninterest expense base. The first quarter run rate expense base was $205.6 million, down from $207.2 million last quarter. We expect that during the course of 2012, we will be steadily walking the quarterly run rate down such that are targeted full-year operating expense base should be in the range of $800 million to $830 million, which includes the impact of the Citizens branch transaction.
Going forward, positive expense reduction initiatives include a favorable trend in fraud-related charges, lower-than-anticipated rent expense, reduced depreciation expense, savings and check processing charges and courier fees due to negotiated contract reductions and a reduction in core processing IT expense.
On Slide 11, we provide a historical perspective of our efficiency ratio. As you may have noted in our non-GAAP reconciliation contained within the earnings release, we have made a change in the calculation of the efficiency ratio in order to treat purchase accounting related fair value adjustments more consistently. In recent years, total noninterest expense, the numerator, was adjusted to exclude the effects of fair value adjustments related to acquired premises and equipment while total revenue, the denominator, was suggested to exclude the effects of fair value adjustments related to liabilities assumed.
Prior to the adoption of FASB statement 141R in 2009, total revenue was also adjusted to exclude the effects of fair value adjustments related to acquired loans. This practice, however, became impractical under the accretable yield accounting model for acquired loans, which has been applied to all portfolios acquired since that date. In the interest of simplicity and transparency, beginning this quarter, the efficiency ratio will no longer reflect any purchase accounting-related adjustments other than normal amortization of intangibles. All prior periods have been adjusted so as to be presented on a comparable basis. The impact of this change in the efficiency ratio for each of the periods present was a favorable 80 to 90 basis points.
The efficiency ratio rose to 63.2% for the first quarter compared to 61.8% in the fourth quarter, but was down from 65.4% in the first quarter of 2011. This is essentially the result of seasonally higher operating expenses and lower revenue growth driven by slower loan growth and a declining net interest margin. However, loan pipeline turns significantly stronger this quarter than last quarter, and we are seeing higher utilization rates on commercial lines consistent with improved borrower confidence. We remain on track to reach our 55% efficiency rate, run rate goal in 2013.
Slides 13 and 14 are a reminder of our excellent credit quality. We did see an improvement in nonperforming assets this quarter. NPAs decreased from $336 million to $316 million, a $20 million decrease. Nonperforming assets at 1.85% of originated loans and REO remained well below our peer group and Top 50 banks.
Looking at Slide 14, net charge-offs improved to 22 basis points compared to 29 basis points last quarter and remain at approximately 30% of our peers. These levels continue to reflect the minimal loss content in our nonperforming assets. Over the last 4 quarters, charge-offs against specific reserves represent approximately 45% of total charge-offs. As such, we understand our credit issues well and typically have very few new credit events each quarter. The largest component to this quarter's charge-offs relates to one out-of-market real estate Shared National Credit, which represents approximately 40% of net charge-offs for the period.
On Slide 15, you can see the detail for the allowance for loan losses by loan category. A few items of note. Our allowance for loan losses to commercial loans is 1.34%, with a coverage ratio of 79% of commercial NPLs. As we have stated previously, we have a strict loan loss allowance methodology, which is consistently applied. That said, mixed shift and new originations can result in modest changes in the overall coverage ratio in any given quarter. Provision for loan losses reflects $11.2 million in charge-offs, including $4.8 million with previously established specific reserves, $4.8 million of additional allowance build in response to loan growth and $300,000 of impairment associated with acquired loans.
Now I'll pass it back to Jack."

On Slide 16, you can see our operating return on average assets for the first quarter was 0.88%, up slightly from the fourth quarter. As we've talked about earlier, we have momentum. We expect that momentum to accelerate as we continue to attract and retain top talent while remaining focused on best serving our customers and maintaining our conservative credit culture. Additionally, progress on our expense initiatives for the year will result in improved return profile for the franchise.
On Slide 17, we expect to see an increase in return on average tangible equity as we improve profitability and thoughtfully deploy capital. Our significant capital levels remain approximately 370 basis points above peers, which produced below industry return on average tangible equity. Normalizing our equity base shows that the core bank is performing well at 11.7% when we turn on average tangible equity. On Slide 18, consistent with the outline of our financial targets, we expect to see our operating dividend payout ratio to trend lower through 2012.
On Slide 19, we have updated our capital ratios for both the holding company and the bank. Capital levels remain very strong with our tangible common equity ratio at 11.7% and Tier 1 Common at 14%, which compares well to our peers at 8% and 10.9% as of the fourth quarter, respectively.
The group -- excuse me, the GAAP narrows as we deploy capital and our peers build capital. While our tangible common equity ratio remains much higher than our peers, on a total risk-based capital basis, we are much closer to peers. We really are a commercial bank and as a result, have a large amount of 100% risk-weighted assets.
And on Slide 20, our robust pipelines and strong originated loan growth contribute to our continued momentum with the franchise, which we expect to accelerate in the coming quarters. The strength of our platform continues to allow us to attract and retain exceptional talent and provide us a sustainable competitive advantage. This concludes our presentation.

So that's a couple of things on the acquired loans that I think we've talked about in the fourth quarter. And certainly, we have a lot of detail out there on. In terms of the originated books, I think we continue to see good loan growth there, probably a little slower than what we did on the latter part of last year. We are optimistic with the pipelines we have as that kicks in to more of the seasonally stronger periods for us of the second and third quarter. But overall, I think we face the same challenges as others in terms of the low interest rate environment.

As we grow those, you may see their costs, the cost of funds in those branches go up a little bit as we run promotions and different things. On the other side, we are still bringing down the cost of funds on the Bank of Smithtown, Danvers acquisitions, which still hover around 1%. So we'll have a little bit of effect on both sides. In terms of the branches themselves, we would need to get them to about $10 million on deposits for a breakeven. The guidance we've given is that we felt that it'd be a negative to the tune of $0.01 a share for this year and next and a breakeven in '14. So effectively, by '14, we'd expect they're paying the freight and then we'd leverage from there. I would remind you that the -- our average brand size, if you look at where our customers branch or Stop & Shop branches, it's a little over $40 million.

We appreciate you joining us today. On Slide 2, we provide an overview of our second quarter results. For the quarter, operating earnings were $67.2 million or $0.20 per share, up from $60.6 million or $0.18",675,"Thank you, Peter, and good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today. On Slide 2, we provide an overview of our second quarter results. For the quarter, operating earnings were $67.2 million or $0.20 per share, up from $60.6 million or $0.18 per share in the first quarter. Net income after -- net income for the quarter including non-operating items was $64.8 million or $0.19 per share. The net interest margin declined to 3.97% compared to the 4.01% in the first quarter. The decline in the margin is the result of lower loan yields and higher levels of securities purchased earlier in the quarter in anticipation of our receipt of the proceeds for the citizens branch transaction late in the quarter. This is partially offset by cost recovery income related to negotiated settlements and payoffs in the acquired loan portfolio.
Loan growth, including runoffs in the acquired portfolios amounted to 2.3% on annualized basis, which was entirely funded by deposit growth. 
Originated loan growth was strong and amounted to 11.2% on an annualized basis. Noninterest income increased $3.3 million compared to the first quarter reaching $75.7 million. This increase was primarily due to growth in cash management fees, operating lease income, prepayment fees and gain on sale of acquired loans. 
Efficiency ratio improved to 61.5% from 63.2% in the first quarter. This is a result of improved operating leverage from higher revenues and lower expenses. Capital ratios remain strong with the tangible equity ratio at 11.5% for the second quarter. We continue to make progress deploying our capital through balance sheet growth and share purchase activity.
On Slide 3, we discussed several recent initiatives. Most importantly, we continue to expand our presence in key growth markets such as New York Metro area. We recently completed the acquisition of 57 citizens branches in the greater New York Metro area and rebranded all of the acquired branches over the weekend of June 22. 53 of the branches are in Stop & Shop supermarkets and 4 are traditional branches. 
Through these branches, we will be reaching approximately 900,000 weekly visitors to Stop & Shop stores, which will significantly strengthen our brand awareness in the country's largest MSA. We now serve customers in approximately 100 branches in the New York Metro area. As is the case throughout our footprint, we strive to bank the market. As we continue to build our deposit footprint in the New York Metro area, we are simultaneously adding asset generation capabilities. 
First, as we have said about our Stop & Shop branches in Connecticut, we generate a substantial portion of our residential mortgage and home equity originations through these in-store branches. We also see significant commercial activity in these branches. In time, we expect the recently acquired branches will also become significant asset generators.
In addition, we have expanded our C&I and asset-based lending efforts in New York Metro area, adding 5 season in market C&I lenders in the Long Island and 2 ABL professionals. 
Recently, we also added 3 senior New York commercial real estate professionals. These individuals have spent their careers focused on New York commercial real estate relationships and are well known to both the market and our management team. Further, within the last week, we added a senior private banking professional, who will lead our private banking business including expansion in New York Metro and Boston.
Second, over the last few quarters, we have built upon the depth of our cash management talent, and we are now starting to see the benefit of their efforts. In addition, we've been working to deepen our brokerage penetration throughout the footprint. 
Third, we repurchased 4.5 million shares or $53.7 million at a weighted average price of $11.93 per share in the second quarter. Year-to-date, we repurchased 9 million shares or $110 million at a weighted average price of $12.24 per share. This results in approximately $6 million of annual dividend savings. We have 9 million shares remaining in our existing share repurchase authorization.
Now I'd like to turn it over to Kirk."

As you'll recall, our first quarter net interest margin was 4.01%. Lower loan yields and higher levels of securities negatively impacted the margin by 8 basis points and 5 basis points, respectively. The expanded securities portfolio relates to both the cash proceeds from the citizens branch acquisition and deposit growth exceeding loan growth. This was partially offset by an 8 basis point improvement from cost recovery income related to settlements and payoffs in the acquired loan portfolio. Deposit costs, excluding fair value amortization, were 50 basis points, down from 55 basis points in the first quarter, which benefited the margin by 4 basis points.
The progress in reducing core deposit costs was offset by the exploration of the Bank of Smithtown and RiverBank fair value CD amortization, which negatively impacted the margin by approximately the same amount. 
It is worth pointing out that the fair value amortization from the Danvers acquisition were run off in October 2012 and negatively impact our fourth quarter deposit cost by approximately 3 basis points. 
Fair value amortization from the citizens transaction is negligible with less than 1 basis point of positive impact on funding cost. In this great environment, there continues to be opportunities to lower deposit costs, particularly in the markets we have recently entered the acquisitions.
On Slide 5, you can see that our operating net interest margin declined to 3.89% in the quarter. The difference between GAAP and operating net interest margin is the cost recovery income, which we view as discrete and transactional in nature. Our strong margin is a product of our low-cost stable funding, loan mix and solid capital levels, all of which means that we do not need to stretch on credit. In addition, our margin is and will continue to be supported by $1.1 billion of accretable yield resulting from 5 acquisitions closed within the last 2.5 years. Let me provide you a little more detail on the next slide.
Slide 6 links closely with our discussion of the net interest margin. For the quarter, interest accretion and acquired loans total approximately $56 million, down from $60 million in the first quarter. The decline in accretion primarily related to Fin Fed, which accounted for $3 million of the difference. As we have said, we expect Fin Fed accretion is likely to expire at the end of this year, negatively impacting the net interest margin by approximately 5 basis points in 2013. 
The carrying amount of acquired loans appeared in total $3 billion. During the quarter, there were reclassifications associated with our reassessments of the Butler and Smithtown portfolios. These reclassifications the driven by better-than-expected credit performance in these portfolios. For Butler, we reclassified $6.5 million from non-accretable to accretable. For Smithtown, we reclassified $2.4 million from non-accretable to accretable.
As with all prior reclasses, the amount of periodic accretion will be adjusted respectively over the remaining life of the underlying loans.
Slide 7 isn't a slide that illustrates the amount of non-cash accretion running through our income statement. If you go to the top lap, you see with the total accretion of $56 million this quarter, which when you analyze and divide by the average balance of the acquired loan portfolio gives us an effective yield of 6.97%. The weighted average coupon on the acquired loan portfolio is 5.51%. This is actual cash coming in from the acquired loans. The difference between the 6.97% effective yield and the weighted average coupon is 1.46%, which amounts to $11.7 million of additional interest income from the amortization of the original discount on the acquired loan portfolio. Annualizing this number and dividing it by the adjusted average returning assets in the second quarter shows the 19 basis points of our operating net interest margin during the quarter relates to non-cash accretion.
So if you want to think about our core underlying margin excluding the non-cash accretion, it would be our operating net interest margin of 3.89% less than 19 basis points to 3.7%. The non-cash accretion is equivalent to $0.02 a share this quarter, which is similar to prior quarters as shown on the right-hand side of the page. There has been some confusion about this topic, but we believe this slide helps set the record straight. We will continue to update this slide in the quarters ahead.
Over time, as the acquired loans repay, mature or settled, the amortization original discount will dissipate. At the same time, it is possible that we may also experience reclassifications from the non-accretable difference bucket to accretable yield due to better-than-expected credit performance.
Slide 8 provides a breakdown of elements contributing to our net increase in loans. As Jack noted earlier, the loan portfolios produced 11.2% quarter-over-quarter annualized originated loans growth for a total loan growth of 2.3% quarter-over-quarter annualized on a period-end basis. We believe we operate in the best commercial banking in the United States and are one of the few banks that can credibly offer the full product suite of a large bank while maintaining our outstanding customer service standards. Originated loan growth for the quarter totaled $477 million. As in prior quarters, growth came from a variety of products in geographic areas.
Originated commercial loans increased $374 million quarter-over-quarter, which included increases of $143 million, $119 million and $111 million from C&I, equipment financing and commercial real estate, respectively. Within C&I, we saw strength across all categories but I would highlight a few businesses that continue to outperform. Our equipment finance businesses, PCLC and People's United Equipment Finance grew originated loans $48 million and $71 million, respectively, in the quarter. Since acquisition of Financial Federal, now known as People's United Equipment Finance, closed in early 2010, the loan outstanding within this portfolio had consistently declined. However, over the last 2 quarters, we have seen this portfolio begin to grow.
Originated residential mortgages grew by $104 million or 13% annualized. The residential mortgage originations, approximately 57% were hybrid adjustable-rate mortgages, and 55% of the pipeline is jumbled product. Second quarter 2012 originations average loan size was 574,000. Average FICO score for the second quarter originations was 755 with an average LTV of 65%. 
Originated home equity loans increased by 11 million. Home equity loan closings totaled 164 million in commitments compared to 126 million in first quarter 2012. In terms of recent originations, the average line size the second quarter originations was 132,000. The average FICO score was 766 with an average combined loan-to-value of 58%. Consistent with our past practices, 100% of home equity loans are retail originated.
The acquired portfolio declined by $360 million or 43% on an annualized basis. Acquired loans are running off for a faster-than-anticipated rate for several reasons. First, the low-interest rate environment is pushing customers to settle their payout acquired loans relatively quickly. Second, the lack of prepayment fees in the acquired loan portfolios encourage customers to refinance. This dynamic is due in part to the transactional nature of the acquired companies' portfolios whereas our business is much more focused on building long-term relationships. Further, there is a concentration of criticizing classified loans and runoffs that we are comfortable parting ways with. This decline in the acquired loan portfolio, coupled with a challenging economic and competitive environment will likely pressure loan growth towards the mid-single-digits for 2012.
You can see on Slide 9 a breakdown of the elements contributing to our net increase in deposits. We have witnessed steady growth in both retail and commercial -- in both the retail and commercial segments an annualized to ital deposit growth of 3.6% in the quarter. Deposit growth was positively impacted by the citizens transaction, which closed late in the quarter but was partially offset by seasonal swing in Vermont municipal deposits. Excluding the seasonal swing in municipal deposits, commercial deposit growth was 12.6% on an annualized basis. We have also seen an improvement in deposit makes with increases in noninterest bearing in savings deposits of $25 million and $150 million, respectively and $114 million decrease in time deposits. Average total deposits were up $346 million quarter-over-quarter.
The larger deposit gathering opportunities in front of us relate to increasing our deposit mix in favor of both retail and commercial non-interest-bearing deposits and better utilization of the acquired citizens branches.
Slide 10 shows that we begin to make progress on loan and deposit growth on a per share basis while maintaining excellent asset quality. We know that if we grow loans and deposits per share, increase fee income and continue to reduce cost, we will produce greater recurring earnings per share. Over the past 2 years, loans per share and deposits per share have grown at compound annual rate of 20% and 19%, respectively. 
Slide 11 provides a breakout of noninterest income, which increased $3.3 million from the first quarter. The income areas have demonstrated momentum included cash management and operating lease income, which increased $1.8 million and $1 million, respectively. Loan prepayment fees and gains the sales of acquired loans also contributed a quarterly fee income growth, increasing by $1.6 million and $700,000.
As a reminder, our insurance business is seasonal. The second and fourth quarters tend to be weaker than the first and third quarters.
On Slide 12, you can see there are noninterest expense based improved to $206 million from $209 million last quarter. During the quarter, we experienced $3.6 million on non-operating expenses, $2 million of which related to the citizens transaction. 
As we think about noninterest expense, we are focused on the operating noninterest expense base. The second quarter operating expense base was $202.1 million, which included $700,000 related to the newly acquired citizens branches and was down from $205.6 million last quarter. The largest part of this decrease was attributable to compensation benefit reductions, which declined $5 million to $103 million in the current quarter. Approximately $3 million has declined relates to lower payroll taxes, which are typically higher in the first quarter as a result of the timing of annual incentive payments.
The third quarter will contain a full quarter of expenses for the newly acquired citizens branches, which we estimate to be $7.8 million or an increase of $7.1 million from the second quarter. We expect that during the course of 2012, we will be steadily walking the quarterly run rate down such that our targeted full year operating expense base should be in the range of $825 million to $830 million. In the quarter said, we are committed to continuing to bring the absolute expense levels down on a pro forma basis.
On Slide 13, we provide a historical perspective on our efficiency ratio. The efficiency ratio improved to 61.5% for the second quarter compared to 63.2% in the first quarter and 64.9% in the second quarter of 2011. Although exhibiting progress, the efficiency ratio has been negatively impacted by slower-than-anticipated loan growth and a decline in net interest margin. In particular, the reduction in the absolute level of interest rates from the end of last year was unexpected. And if interest rates remain at their current record low levels, we may see the timing of achieving our 55% efficiency ratio goal slipping into 2014.
As we discussed in the first quarter earnings call, the newly citizens branches are expected to cost us $0.01 per share in 2012, $0.02 per share in 2013 and breakeven in 2014. This transaction will also impact our reported efficiency ratio progress until we reach the breakeven point.
Next, we move on to an overview of recent expense initiatives given the difficult economic climate and industry's increased regulatory and compliance burden, we established the expense management oversight committee in the fall of 2011. This committee is comprised of 3 senior executives: The Chief Financial Officer, Chief Administrative Officer and chief human resources officer, and enables us to operate with a much more rigorous approach to expense control. This table outlines several key initiatives for 2012 as well as the new ones from this quarter to provide us an update on the current status. One of the goals of expense management oversight committee has been to focus on the longer planning horizon. For example, we now begin negotiating contracts 1 to 3 years in advance of exploration which gives us a stronger negotiating position since vendors recognize this much lead time, we have the ability to switch providers.
We will provide an update on our cost reduction progress and the latest expense initiatives every quarter. It is important to note that we are still investing in the business while continuing to reduce expenses. The revenue initiatives that we have funded over the last year include the additional commercial relationship officers and support staff from the New York Metro area, as well as additional talent in several key growth areas, including asset-based lending, mortgage warehouse lending, Wealth Management and private banking. 
We are pleased to say these initiatives have produced sufficient increased revenues to cover their expenses and contribute to the bottom line with the exception of Wealth Management, which we expect to break even next year; and the acquired citizens branches, which we project to breakeven in 2014.
Slide 15 and 16 are a reminder of our excellent credit quality. We did see an improvement in nonperforming assets this quarter from already industry-leading levels. NPAs decreased approximately 22 million to 295 million. Nonperforming assets at 1.67% of originated loans and REO remain well below our peer group and top 50 banks.
Looking at Slide 16, net charge-offs were 26 basis points compared to 22 basis points last quarter. Approximately 5 basis points of our charge-offs this quarter related to losses on acquired loans. Accordingly, net charge-offs and originated loan portfolio with was effectively flat on a linked quarter basis. These levels continue to reflect the minimum loss content in our nonperforming assets stand approximately 50% of our peers.
Over the last 4 quarters, charge-offs against specific reserves represent approximately 48% of total charge-offs. As such, we understand the credit issues well and typically have very few new credit advance each quarter.
On Slide 17, you can see the detail for the allowance for loan losses by loan category. A few items to note. Our allowance for loan losses to commercial loans is 1.28% with a coverage ratio of 82% of commercial NPLs. As we have stated previously, we have strict loan loss allowance methodology, which is consistently applied. That said, mix shift and new originations can result in modest changes in the overall coverage ratio in any given quarter. Provision for loan losses reflects $13.5 million in charge-offs, including $7.5 million at the previously established specific reserves and $4.6 million of additional allowance filled in response to loan growth.
Now I'll pass it back to Jack."

On Slide 18, you can see our operating return on average assets for the second quarter was 97 basis points, up significantly from the first quarter. However, this includes approximately 6 basis points of improvement related to cost recove",604,"Thank you, Kirk. On Slide 18, you can see our operating return on average assets for the second quarter was 97 basis points, up significantly from the first quarter. However, this includes approximately 6 basis points of improvement related to cost recovery income, which we regard as discrete and transactional. It's also worth noting that the operating return on average assets in the third quarter of 2011 was positively impacted by securities gains amounting to 8 basis points.  You'll recall that we took this action to reduce the premium on our books and protect against amortization exposure.
Making both of these adjustments, the chart will then illustrate consistent returns on average assets over the last 5 quarters of approximately 90 basis points. With this in mind, it's important to reflect upon the progress that we have made over the past 3 years. 
As we have strengthened the earnings power of the franchise through the additions of key personnel, the expansion of key business lines and through the thoughtful deployment of capital, we have also absorbed the negative impact of regulatory reform, related higher cost of compliance and the impact of a prolonged low interest rate environment. Through all of this, we have nearly doubled our return on average assets from 49 basis points in the second quarter of 2009 to consistently performing over 90 basis points.
On Slide 19, we expect to see an increase in return on average tangible equity as we improve profitability and thoughtfully deploy capital. Our significant capital levels remain approximately 350 basis points above peers, which produces below industry return on average tangible equity. Normalizing our equity-based to be consistent with our peers shows that the bank is performing well with the return on average tangible equity at 12.4%.
On Slide 20, consistent with the outline of our financial targets, we expect to see our operating dividend payout ratio trend lower throughout 2012. While we were aided by cost recovery income this quarter, steady loan and deposit growth, together with consistent share repurchase activity, has and will continue to reduce the dividend payout ratio.
On slide 21, we see that capital levels at the holding company and the bank remain very strong with our tangible common equity ratio at 11.5% and Tier 1 common at 13.6%, which compares well to our peers at 8% and 11.2% as of the first quarter, respectively. 
While our tangible common equity ratio remains much higher than peers, on a total risk-based capital basis, we are much closer to peers. This is the result of having a larger commercial loan portfolio, as well as smaller residential and securities portfolios than our peers. It is worth noting that we have spent some time with the Basel III proposal released on June 7, 2012 given our strong capital levels, we do not anticipate any material impact when the new rules are implemented. However, it will take time to be precise about the impact on our capital levels because amongst other considerations, Basel III risk weighting will require loan specific risk-weighting adjustments.
Our game plan for successfully navigating the low-interest rate environment includes growing loans and deposits, maintaining discipline on all asset repricing, lowering the cost of funds, lowering absolute expenses, growing fee income and maintaining excellent credit quality. Our robust pipelines and strong originated loan growth contribute to the continued momentum of our franchise. The strength of our platform continues to allow us to attract and retain exceptional talent and provides a sustainable competitive advantage.

Let me, take a first crack and then Jack chime in. I think it's important that what we have done as we've hired some experienced commercial real estate professionals, and we're not going into that market we're just a bit that were just doing multi-family. Certainly, multi-family will be in the mix. It'll be one of the things we'll be doing. But we will be doing all types of commercial real estate, and we have been doing that for quite a while in the market and have some fairly good footing in New York City, as well as the Metro areas as we sit here. The -- so overall, it's a business week we expect were going to build out. One that will be relationship-oriented and that we do have a good strong history on the commercial real estate side but also other products and offerings that will be able to lever in that market. So if you look at our commercial real estate as a whole on the portfolio, the multi-family portion is relatively small when you consider it as a whole. So we do have some capacity if we find some interesting and get production to do. But I'd reemphasize that we're looking at commercial real estate as a whole in the city."

We appreciate you joining us today. On Slide 2, we provide an overview of our second quarter results. For the quarter, operating earnings were $67.2 million or $0.20 per share, up from $60.6 million or $0.18",675,"Thank you, Peter, and good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today. On Slide 2, we provide an overview of our second quarter results. For the quarter, operating earnings were $67.2 million or $0.20 per share, up from $60.6 million or $0.18 per share in the first quarter. Net income after -- net income for the quarter, including non-operating items, was $64.8 million or $0.19 per share. The net interest margin declined to 3.97% compared to the 4.01% in the first quarter. The decline in the margin is the result of lower loan yields and higher levels of securities purchased earlier in the quarter in anticipation of our receipt of the proceeds for the Citizens branch transaction late in the quarter. This is partially offset by cost recovery income related to negotiated settlements and payoffs in the acquired loan portfolio.
Loan growth, including runoffs in the acquired portfolios, amounted to 2.3% on annualized basis, which was entirely funded by deposit growth. 
Originated loan growth was strong and amounted to 11.2% on an annualized basis. Noninterest income increased $3.3 million compared to the first quarter, reaching $75.7 million. This increase was primarily due to growth in cash management fees, operating lease income, prepayment fees and gain on sale of acquired loans. 
Efficiency ratio improved to 61.5% from 63.2% in the first quarter. This is a result of improved operating leverage from higher revenues and lower expenses. Capital ratios remained strong with the tangible equity ratio at 11.5% for the second quarter. We continue to make progress deploying our capital through balance sheet growth and share repurchase activity.
On Slide 3, we discussed several recent initiatives. Most importantly, we continue to expand our presence in key growth markets such as the New York metro area. We recently completed the acquisition of 57 Citizens branches in the greater New York metro area and rebranded all of the acquired branches over the weekend of June 22. 53 of the branches are in Stop & Shop supermarkets and 4 are traditional branches. 
Through these branches, we will be reaching approximately 900,000 weekly visitors to Stop & Shop stores, which will significantly strengthen our brand awareness in the country's largest MSA. We now serve customers in approximately 100 branches in the New York metro area. As is the case throughout our footprint, we strive to bank the market. As we continue to build our deposit footprint in the New York Metro area, we are simultaneously adding asset generation capabilities. 
First, as we have said about our Stop & Shop branches in Connecticut, we generate a substantial portion of our residential mortgage and home equity originations through these in-store branches. We also see significant commercial activity in these branches. In time, we expect the recently acquired branches will also become significant asset generators.
In addition, we have expanded our C&I and asset-based lending efforts in New York metro area, adding 5 seasoned in-market C&I lenders on Long Island and 2 ABL professionals. 
Recently, we also added 3 senior New York commercial real estate professionals. These individuals have spent their careers focused on New York commercial real estate relationships and are well known to both the market and our management team. Further, within the last week, we added a senior private banking professional, who will lead our private banking business, including expansion in the New York metro and Boston.
Second, over the last few quarters, we have built upon the depth of our cash management talent, and we are now starting to see the benefit of their efforts. In addition, we've been working to deepen our brokerage penetration throughout the footprint. 
Third, we repurchased 4.5 million shares or $53.7 million at a weighted average price of $11.93 per share in the second quarter. Year-to-date, we repurchased 9 million shares or $110 million at a weighted average price of $12.24 per share. This results in approximately $6 million of annual dividend savings. We have 9 million shares remaining in our existing share repurchase authorization.
Now I'd like to turn it over to Kirk."

Lower loan yields and higher levels of securities negati",2493,"Thank you, Jack. On Slide 4, you can see a breakdown of the elements contributing to our 3.97% net interest margin for the quarter. As you'll recall, our first quarter net interest margin was 4.01%. Lower loan yields and higher levels of securities negatively impacted the margin by 8 basis points and 5 basis points, respectively. The expanded securities portfolio relates to both the cash proceeds from the Citizens branch acquisition and deposit growth exceeding loan growth. This was partially offset by an 8-basis point improvement from cost recovery income related to settlements and payoffs in the acquired loan portfolio. Deposit costs, excluding fair value amortization, were 50 basis points, down from 55 basis points in the first quarter, which benefited the margin by 4 basis points.
The progress in reducing core deposit costs was offset by the exploration in the Bank of Smithtown and RiverBank fair value CD amortization, which negatively impacted the margin by approximately the same amount. 
It is worth pointing out that the fair value amortization from the Danvers acquisition were run off in October 2012 and negatively impact our fourth quarter deposit cost by approximately 3 basis points. 
Fair value amortization from the Citizens transaction is negligible with less than 1 basis point of positive impact on funding cost. In this rate environment, there continues to be opportunities to lower the deposit costs, particularly in the markets we have recently entered via acquisitions.
On Slide 5, you can see that our operating net interest margin declined to 3.89% in the quarter. The difference between GAAP and operating net interest margin is the cost recovery income, which we view as discrete and transactional in nature. Our strong margin is a product of our low-cost stable funding, loan mix and solid capital levels, all of which means that we do not need to stretch on credit. In addition, our margin is and will continue to be supported by $1.1 billion of accretable yield resulting from 5 acquisitions closed within the last 2.5 years. Let me provide you a little more detail on the next slide.
Slide 6 links closely with our discussion of the net interest margin. For the quarter, interest accretion and acquired loans totaled approximately $56 million, down from $60 million in the first quarter. The decline in accretion primarily related to Fin Fed, which accounted for $3 million of the difference. As we have said, we expect Fin Fed accretion is likely to expire at the end of this year, negatively impacting the net interest margin by approximately 5 basis points in 2013. 
The carrying amount of acquired loans appeared in total $3 billion. During the quarter, there were reclassifications associated with our reassessments -- out of the Butler and Smithtown portfolios. These reclassifications were driven by better-than-expected credit performance in these portfolios. For Butler, we reclassified $6.5 million from non-accretable to accretable. For Smithtown, we reclassified $2.4 million from non-accretable to accretable.
As with all prior reclasses, the amount of periodic accretion will be adjusted respectively over the remaining life of the underlying loans.
Slide 7 is a new slide that illustrates the amount of noncash accretion running through our income statement. If you go to the top left, you see we've got the total accretion of $56 million this quarter, which when you annualize and divide by the average balance of the acquired loan portfolio, gives us an effective yield of 6.97%. The weighted average coupon on the acquired loan portfolio is 5.51%. This is the actual cash coming in from the acquired loans. The difference between the 6.97% effective yield and the weighted average coupon is 1.46%, which amounts to $11.7 million of additional interest income from the amortization of the original discount on the acquired loan portfolio. Annualizing this number and dividing it by the adjusted average earning assets in the second quarter shows the 19 basis points of our operating net interest margin during the quarter relates to noncash accretion.
So if you want to think about our core underlying margin excluding the noncash accretion, it would be our operating net interest margin of 3.89% less than 19 basis points to 3.7%. The noncash accretion is equivalent to $0.02 a share this quarter, which is similar to prior quarters as shown on the right-hand side of the page. There has been some confusion about this topic, but we believe this slide helps set the record straight. We will continue to update this slide in the quarters ahead.
Over time, as the acquired loans repay, mature or settled, the amortization original discount will dissipate. At the same time, it is possible that we may also experience reclassifications from the non-accretable difference bucket to accretable yield due to better-than-expected credit performance.
Slide 8 provides a breakdown of elements contributing to our net increase in loans. As Jack noted earlier, the loan portfolios produced 11.2% quarter-over-quarter annualized originated loan growth for a total loan growth of 2.3% quarter-over-quarter annualized on a period-end basis. We believe we operate in the best commercial banking market in the United States and are one of the few banks that can credibly offer the full product suite of a large bank while maintaining our outstanding customer service standards. Originated loan growth for the quarter totaled $477 million. As in prior quarters, growth came from a variety of products in geographic areas.
Originated commercial loans increased $374 million quarter-over-quarter, which included increases of $143 million, $119 million and $111 million from C&I, equipment financing and commercial real estate, respectively. Within C&I, we saw strength across all categories, but I would highlight a few businesses that continue to outperform. Our equipment finance businesses, PCLC and People's United Equipment Finance, grew originated loans $48 million and $71 million, respectively, in the quarter. Since acquisition of Financial Federal, now known as People's United Equipment Finance, closed in early 2010, the loan outstanding within this portfolio had consistently declined. However, over the last 2 quarters, we have seen this portfolio begin to grow.
Originated residential mortgages grew by $104 million or 13% annualized. The residential mortgage originations, approximately 57% were hybrid adjustable-rate mortgages, and 55% of the pipeline is jumbo product. Second quarter 2012 originations average loan size is $574,000. Average FICO score for the second quarter originations was 755 with an average LTV of 65%. 
Originated home equity loans increased by $11 million. Home equity loan closings totaled $164 million in commitments compared to $126 million in first quarter 2012. In terms of recent originations, the average line size the second quarter originations was $132,000. The average FICO score was 766 with an average combined loan-to-value of 58%. Consistent with our past practices, 100% of home equity loans are retail originated.
The acquired portfolio declined by $360 million or 43% on an annualized basis. Acquired loans are running off with a faster-than-anticipated rate for several reasons. First, the low interest rate environment is pushing customers to settle or pay off acquired loans relatively quickly. Second, the lack of prepayment fees in the acquired loan portfolios encouraged customers to refinance. This dynamic is due in part to the transactional nature of the acquired companies' portfolios, whereas our business is much more focused on building long-term relationships. 
Further, there is a concentration of criticizing classified loans and runoffs that we are comfortable parting ways with. This decline in the acquired loan portfolio, coupled with a challenging economic and competitive environment, will likely pressure loan growth towards the mid-single digits for 2012.
You can see in Slide 9 a breakdown of the elements contributing to our net increase in deposits. We have witnessed steady growth in both retail and commercial -- in both the retail and commercial segments with annualized total deposit growth of 3.6% in the quarter. Deposit growth was positively impacted by the Citizens transaction, which closed late in the quarter, but was partially offset by seasonal swing in Vermont municipal deposits. 
Excluding the seasonal swing in municipal deposits, commercial deposit growth was 12.6% on an annualized basis. We have also seen an improvement in deposit mix with increases in non-interest-bearing and savings deposits of $25 million and $150 million, respectively, and $114 million decrease in time deposits. Average total deposits were up $346 million quarter-over-quarter.
The larger deposit gathering opportunities in front of us relate to increasing our deposit mix in favor of both retail and commercial non-interest-bearing deposits with better utilization of the acquired Citizens branches.
Slide 10 shows that we continue to make progress on loan and deposit growth on a per share basis while maintaining excellent asset quality. We know that if we grow loans and deposits per share, increase fee income and continue to reduce costs, we will produce greater recurring earnings per share. Over the past 2 years, loans per share and deposits per share have grown at compound annual rate of 20% and 19%, respectively. 
Slide 11 provides a breakout of noninterest income, which increased $3.3 million from the first quarter. The income areas that demonstrated momentum included cash management and operating lease income, which increased $1.8 million and $1 million, respectively. Loan prepayment fees and gains of the sales of acquired loans also contributed to quarterly fee income growth, increasing by $1.6 million and $700,000.
As a reminder, our insurance business is seasonal. The second and fourth quarters tend to be weaker than the first and third quarters.
On Slide 12, you can see that our noninterest expense based improved to $206 million from $209 million last quarter. During the quarter, we experienced $3.6 million on non-operating expenses, $2 million of which related to the Citizens transaction. 
As we think about noninterest expense, we are focused on the operating noninterest expense base. The second quarter operating expense base was $202.1 million, which included $700,000 related to the newly acquired Citizens branches and was down from $205.6 million last quarter. The largest part of this decrease was attributable to compensation benefit reductions, which declined $5 million to $103 million in the current quarter. Approximately $3 million of decline relates to lower payroll taxes, which are typically higher in the first quarter as a result of the timing of annual incentive payments.
The third quarter will contain a full quarter of expenses for the newly acquired Citizens branches, which we estimate to be $7.8 million or an increase of $7.1 million from the second quarter. We expect that during the course of 2012, we will be steadily walking the quarterly run rate down such that our targeted full year operating expense base should be in the range of $825 million to $830 million. In the quarters ahead, we are committed to continuing to bring the absolute expense levels down on a pro forma basis.
On Slide 13, we provide a historical perspective on our efficiency ratio. The efficiency ratio improved to 61.5% for the second quarter compared to 63.2% in the first quarter and 64.9% in the second quarter of 2011. Although exhibiting progress, the efficiency ratio has been negatively impacted by slower-than-anticipated loan growth and a decline in net interest margin. In particular, the reduction in the absolute level of interest rates from the end of last year was unexpected. And if interest rates remain at their current record low levels, we may see the timing of achieving our 55% efficiency ratio goal slipping into 2014.
As we discussed in the first quarter earnings call, the newly acquired Citizens branches are expected to cost us $0.01 per share in 2012, $0.02 per share in 2013 and breakeven in 2014. This transaction will also impact our reported efficiency ratio progress until we reach the breakeven point.
Next, we move on to an overview of recent expense initiatives. Given the difficult economic climate and the industry's increased regulatory and compliance burden, we established the expense management oversight committee in the fall of 2011. This committee is comprised of 3 senior executives: The Chief Financial Officer, Chief Administrative Officer and Chief Human Resources Officer, that enables us to operate with a much more rigorous approach to expense control. This table outlines several key initiatives for 2012, as well as the new ones from this quarter to provide us an update on their current status. One of the goals of expense management oversight committee has been to focus on a longer planning horizon. For example, we now begin negotiating contracts 1 to 3 years in advance of exploration, which gives us a stronger negotiating position since the vendors recognize with this much lead time, we have the ability to switch providers.
We will provide an update on our cost reduction progress and the latest expense initiatives every quarter. It is important to note that we are still investing in the business while continuing to reduce expenses. The revenue initiatives that we have funded over the last year include the additional commercial relationship officers and support staff from the New York metro area, as well as additional talent in several key growth areas, including asset-based lending, mortgage warehouse lending, wealth management and private banking. 
We are pleased to say these initiatives have produced sufficient increased revenues to cover their expenses and contribute to the bottom line with the exception of wealth management, which we expect to break even next year; and the acquired Citizens branches, which we project to break even in 2014.
Slides 15 and 16 are a reminder of our excellent credit quality. We did see an improvement in nonperforming assets this quarter from already industry-leading levels. NPAs decreased approximately $22 million to $295 million. Nonperforming assets at 1.67% of originated loans and REO remain well below our peer group and Top 50 banks.
Looking at Slide 16, net charge-offs were 26 basis points compared to 22 basis points last quarter. Approximately 5 basis points of our charge-offs this quarter related to losses in acquired loans. Accordingly, net charge-offs and originated loan portfolio was effectively flat on a linked quarter basis. These levels continue to reflect the minimal loss content in our nonperforming assets that stand at approximately 50% of our peers.
Over the last 4 quarters, charge-offs against specific reserves represent approximately 48% of total charge-offs. As such, we understand the credit issues well and typically have very few new credit events each quarter.
On Slide 17, you can see the detail for the allowance for loan losses by loan category. A few items to note. Our allowance for loan losses to commercial loans is 1.28% with a coverage ratio of 82% of commercial NPLs. As we have stated previously, we have a strict loan loss allowance methodology, which is consistently applied. That said, mix shift and new originations can result in modest changes in the overall coverage ratio in any given quarter. Provision for loan losses reflects $13.5 million in charge-offs, including $7.5 million at the previously established specific reserves and $4.6 million of additional allowance filled in response to loan growth.
Now I'll pass it back to Jack."
295774,212442171,327989,"People's United Financial Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 19, 2012",2012-07-19,"Earnings Calls","People's United Financial, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Kirk. On Slide 18, you can see our operating return on average assets for the second quarter was 97 basis points, up significantly from the first quarter. However, this includes approximately 6 basis points of improvement related to cost recove",606,"Thank you, Kirk. On Slide 18, you can see our operating return on average assets for the second quarter was 97 basis points, up significantly from the first quarter. However, this includes approximately 6 basis points of improvement related to cost recovery income, which we regard as discrete and transactional. It's also worth noting that the operating return on average assets in the third quarter of 2011 was positively impacted by securities gains amounting to 8 basis points.  You'll recall that we took this action to reduce the premium on our books and protect against amortization exposure.
Making both of these adjustments, the chart would then illustrate consistent returns on average assets over the last 5 quarters of approximately 90 basis points. With this in mind, it's important to reflect upon the progress that we have made over the past 3 years. 
As we have strengthened the earnings power of the franchise through the additions of key personnel, the expansion of key business lines and through the thoughtful deployment of capital, we have also absorbed the negative impact of regulatory reform to related higher cost of compliance and the impact of a prolonged low interest rate environment. Through all of this, we have nearly doubled our return on average assets from 49 basis points in the second quarter of 2009 to consistently performing over 90 basis points.
On Slide 19, we expect to see an increase in return on average tangible equity as we improve profitability and thoughtfully deployed capital. Our significant capital levels remain approximately 350 basis points above peers, which produces below industry return on average tangible equity. Normalizing our equity base to be consistent with our peers shows that the bank is performing well with return on average tangible equity at 12.4%.
On Slide 20, consistent with the outline of our financial targets, we expect to see our operating dividend payout ratio trend lower throughout 2012. While we were aided by cost recovery income this quarter, steady loan and deposit growth, together with consistent share repurchase activity, has and will continue to reduce the dividend payout ratio.
On slide 21, we see that capital levels at the holding company and the bank remain very strong with our tangible common equity ratio at 11.5% and Tier 1 common at 13.6%, which compares well to our peers at 8% and 11.3% as of the first quarter, respectively.
While our tangible common equity ratio remains much higher than peers, on a total risk-based capital basis, we are much closer to peers. This is the result of having a larger commercial loan portfolio, as well as smaller residential and securities portfolios than our peers. It is worth noting that we have spent some time with the Basel III proposal released on June 7, 2012. Given our strong capital levels, we do not anticipate any material impact when the new rules are implemented. However, it will take time to be precise about the impact on our capital levels because amongst other considerations, Basel III risk weighting will require loan specific risk-weighting adjustments.
Our game plan for successfully navigating the low interest rate environment includes growing loans and deposits, maintaining discipline on all asset repricing, lowering the cost of funds, lowering absolute expenses, growing fee income and maintaining excellent credit quality. Our robust pipelines and strong originated loan growth contribute to the continued momentum of our franchise. The strength of our platform continues to allow us to attract and retain exceptional talent and provides a sustainable competitive advantage.

Now, that's tied to the -- if you look at the underlying loans, it has some fairly -- it's going to take a while to get to that, but it would give you some clarity.

Certainly, multifamily will be in the mix. It'll be one of the things we'll be doing.

One that will be relationship-oriented and that we do have a good strong history on the commercial real estate side but also other products and offerings that we'll be able to lever in that market.

As we have looked at this analysis before and thought about the level of expenses that we have taken out, if we had done nothing, and you may be referring to that one graph that we had in our investor book that we used during the second quarter, that when updated would indicate that if we had done nothing, we'd be at around $240 million. And obviously, we came in around $203 million. So a quarterly run rate which is a little over $30 million difference and -- or $38 million difference, which is well above what we thought we'd get in cost takeouts of the acquired entities. So we continue to work pretty hard, but we are obviously picking up these costs with the Citizens deal, which we strategically think is a very good transaction but one that is going to take us a little while to get us to a breakeven."

We appreciate you joining us today. On Slide 2, we provide an overview of our second quarter results. For the quarter, operating earnings were $67.2 million or $0.20 per share, up from $60.6 million or $0.18",677,"Thank you, Peter, and good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today. On Slide 2, we provide an overview of our second quarter results. For the quarter, operating earnings were $67.2 million or $0.20 per share, up from $60.6 million or $0.18 per share in the first quarter. Net income after -- net income for the quarter, including non-operating items, was $64.8 million or $0.19 per share. The net interest margin declined to 3.97% compared to the 4.01% in the first quarter. The decline in the margin is the result of lower loan yields and higher levels of securities purchased earlier in the quarter in anticipation of our receipt of the proceeds for the Citizens branch transaction late in the quarter. This is partially offset by cost recovery income related to negotiated settlements and payoffs in the acquired loan portfolio.
Loan growth, including runoff in the acquired portfolios, amounted to 2.3% on an annualized basis, which was entirely funded by deposit growth. 
Originated loan growth was strong and amounted to 11.2% on an annualized basis. Noninterest income increased $3.3 million compared to the first quarter, reaching $75.7 million. This increase was primarily due to growth in cash management fees, operating lease income, prepayment fees and gain on sale of acquired loans. 
The efficiency ratio improved to 61.5% from 63.2% in the first quarter. This is a result of improved operating leverage from higher revenues and lower expenses. Capital ratios remained strong with the tangible equity ratio at 11.5% for the second quarter. We continue to make progress deploying our capital through balance sheet growth and share repurchase activity.
On Slide 3, we discussed several recent initiatives. Most importantly, we continue to expand our presence in key growth markets such as the New York metro area. We recently completed the acquisition of 57 Citizens branches in the greater New York metro area and rebranded all of the acquired branches over the weekend of June 22. 53 of the branches are in Stop & Shop supermarkets and 4 are traditional branches. 
Through these branches, we will be reaching approximately 900,000 weekly visitors to Stop & Shop stores, which will significantly strengthen our brand awareness in the country's largest MSA. We now serve customers in approximately 100 branches in the New York metro area. As is the case throughout our footprint, we strive to bank the market. As we continue to build our deposit footprint in the New York metro area, we are simultaneously adding asset generation capabilities. 
First, as we have said about our Stop & Shop branches in Connecticut, we generate a substantial portion of our residential mortgage and home equity originations through these in-store branches. We also see significant commercial activity in these branches. In time, we expect the recently acquired branches will also become significant asset generators.
In addition, we have expanded our C&I and asset-based lending efforts in New York metro area, adding 5 seasoned in-market C&I lenders on Long Island and 2 ABL professionals. 
Recently, we also added 3 senior New York commercial real estate professionals. These individuals have spent their careers focused on New York commercial real estate relationships and are well known to both the market and our management team. Further, within the last week, we added a senior private banking professional, who will lead our private banking business, including expansion in the New York metro and Boston.
Second, over the last few quarters, we have built upon the depth of our cash management talent, and we are now starting to see the benefit of their efforts. In addition, we've been working to deepen our brokerage penetration throughout the footprint. 
Third, we repurchased 4.5 million shares or $53.7 million at a weighted average price of $11.93 per share in the second quarter. Year-to-date, we repurchased 9 million shares or $110 million at a weighted average price of $12.24 per share. This results in approximately $6 million of annual dividend savings. We have 9 million shares remaining in our existing share repurchase authorization.
Now I'd like to turn it over to Kirk."

As you'll recall, our first quarter net interest margin was 4.01%. Lower loan yields and higher levels of securities negatively impacted the margin by 8 basis points and 5 basis points, respectively. The expanded securities portfolio relates to both the cash proceeds from the Citizens branch acquisition and deposit growth exceeding loan growth. This was partially offset by an 8-basis point improvement from cost recovery income related to settlements and payoffs in the acquired loan portfolio. Deposit costs, excluding fair value amortization, were 50 basis points, down from 55 basis points in the first quarter, which benefited the margin by 4 basis points.
The progress in reducing core deposit costs was offset by the expiration of the Bank of Smithtown and RiverBank fair value CD amortization, which negatively impacted the margin by approximately the same amount. 
It is worth pointing out that the fair value amortization from the Danvers acquisition were run off in October 2012 and negatively impact our fourth quarter deposit cost by approximately 3 basis points. 
Fair value amortization from the Citizens transaction is negligible with less than 1 basis point of positive impact on funding cost. In this rate environment, there continues to be opportunities to lower the deposit costs, particularly in the markets we have recently entered via acquisitions.
On Slide 5, you can see that our operating net interest margin declined to 3.89% in the quarter. The difference between GAAP and operating net interest margin is the cost recovery income, which we view as discrete and transactional in nature. Our strong margin is a product of our low-cost stable funding, loan mix and solid capital levels, all of which means that we do not need to stretch on credit. In addition, our margin is and will continue to be supported by $1.1 billion of accretable yield resulting from 5 acquisitions closed within the last 2.5 years. Let me provide you a little more detail on the next slide.
Slide 6 links closely with our discussion of the net interest margin. For the quarter, interest accretion on acquired loans totaled approximately $56 million, down from $60 million in the first quarter. The decline in accretion primarily related to Fin Fed, which accounted for $3 million of the difference. As we have said, we expect Fin Fed accretion is likely to expire at the end of this year, negatively impacting the net interest margin by approximately 5 basis points in 2013. 
The carrying amount of acquired loans appeared in total $3 billion. During the quarter, there were reclassifications associated with our reassessments -- of the Butler and Smithtown portfolios. These reclassifications were driven by better-than-expected credit performance in these portfolios. For Butler, we reclassified $6.5 million from non-accretable to accretable. For Smithtown, we reclassified $2.4 million from non-accretable to accretable.
As with all prior reclasses, the amount of periodic accretion will be adjusted respectively over the remaining life of the underlying loans.
Slide 7 is a new slide that illustrates the amount of noncash accretion running through our income statement. If you go to the top left, you see we booked total accretion of $56 million this quarter, which when you annualize and divide by the average balance of the acquired loan portfolio, gives us an effective yield of 6.97%. The weighted average coupon in the acquired loan portfolio is 5.51%. This is the actual cash coming in from the acquired loans. The difference between the 6.97% effective yield and the weighted average coupon is 1.46%, which amounts to $11.7 million of additional interest income from the amortization of the original discount on the acquired loan portfolio. Annualizing this number and dividing it by the adjusted average earning assets in the second quarter shows the 19 basis points of our operating net interest margin during the quarter relates to noncash accretion.
So if you want to think about our core underlying margin excluding the noncash accretion, it would be our operating net interest margin of 3.89% less than 19 basis points to 3.7%. The noncash accretion is equivalent to $0.02 a share this quarter, which is similar to prior quarters as shown on the right-hand side of the page. There has been some confusion about this topic, but we believe this slide helps set the record straight. We will continue to update this slide in the quarters ahead.
Over time, as the acquired loans repay, mature or settled, the amortization original discount will dissipate. At the same time, it is possible that we may also experience reclassifications from the non-accretable difference bucket to accretable yield due to better-than-expected credit performance.
Slide 8 provides a breakdown of elements contributing to our net increase in loans. As Jack noted earlier, the loan portfolios produced 11.2% quarter-over-quarter annualized originated loan growth for a total loan growth of 2.3% quarter-over-quarter annualized on a period-end basis. We believe we operate in the best commercial banking market in the United States and are one of the few banks that can credibly offer the full product suite of a large bank while maintaining our outstanding customer service standards. Originated loan growth for the quarter totaled $477 million. As in prior quarters, growth came from a variety of products and geographic areas.
Originated commercial loans increased $374 million quarter-over-quarter, which included increases of $143 million, $119 million and $111 million from C&I, equipment financing and commercial real estate, respectively. Within C&I, we saw strength across all categories, but I would highlight a few businesses that continue to outperform. Our equipment finance businesses, PCLC and People's United Equipment Finance, grew originated loans $48 million and $71 million, respectively, in the quarter. Since the acquisition of Financial Federal, now known as People's United Equipment Finance, closed in early 2010, the loan outstanding within this portfolio had consistently declined. However, over the last 2 quarters, we have seen this portfolio begin to grow.
Originated residential mortgages grew by $104 million or 13% annualized. The residential mortgage originations, approximately 57% were hybrid adjustable-rate mortgages, and 55% of the pipeline is jumbo product. Second quarter 2012 originations average loan size is $574,000. Average FICO score for the second quarter originations was 755 with an average LTV of 65%. 
Originated home equity loans increased by $11 million. Home equity loan closings totaled $164 million in commitments compared to $126 million in first quarter 2012. In terms of recent originations, the average line size the second quarter originations was $132,000. The average FICO score was 766 with an average combined loan-to-value of 58%. Consistent with our past practices, 100% of home equity loans are retail originated.
The acquired portfolio declined by $360 million or 43% on an annualized basis. Acquired loans are running off with a faster-than-anticipated rate for several reasons. First, the low interest rate environment is pushing customers to settle or pay off acquired loans relatively quickly. Second, the lack of prepayment fees in the acquired loan portfolios encouraged customers to refinance. This dynamic is due in part to the transactional nature of the acquired companies' portfolios, whereas our business is much more focused on building long-term relationships. 
Further, there is a concentration of criticizing classified loans and runoffs that we are comfortable parting ways with. This decline in the acquired loan portfolio, coupled with a challenging economic and competitive environment, will likely pressure loan growth towards the mid-single digits for 2012.
You can see in Slide 9 a breakdown of the elements contributing to our net increase in deposits. We have witnessed steady growth in both retail and commercial -- in both the retail and commercial segments with annualized total deposit growth of 3.6% in the quarter. Deposit growth was positively impacted by the Citizens transaction, which closed late in the quarter, but was partially offset by seasonal swing in Vermont municipal deposits. 
Excluding the seasonal swing in municipal deposits, commercial deposit growth was 12.6% on an annualized basis. We have also seen an improvement in deposit mix with increases in non-interest-bearing and savings deposits of $25 million and $150 million, respectively, and $114 million decrease in time deposits. Average total deposits were up $346 million quarter-over-quarter.
The larger deposit gathering opportunities in front of us relate to increasing our deposit mix in favor of both retail and commercial non-interest-bearing deposits with better utilization of the acquired Citizens branches.
Slide 10 shows that we continue to make progress on loan and deposit growth on a per share basis while maintaining excellent asset quality. We know that if we grow loans and deposits per share, increase fee income and continue to reduce costs, we will produce greater recurring earnings per share. Over the past 2 years, loans per share and deposits per share have grown at compound annual rates of 20% and 19%, respectively. 
Slide 11 provides a breakout of noninterest income, which increased $3.3 million from the first quarter. The income areas that demonstrated momentum included cash management and operating lease income, which increased $1.8 million and $1 million, respectively. Loan prepayment fees and gains on the sales of acquired loans also contributed to quarterly fee income growth, increasing by $1.6 million and $700,000.
As a reminder, our insurance business is seasonal. The second and fourth quarters tend to be weaker than the first and third quarters.
On Slide 12, you can see that our noninterest expense based improved to $206 million from $209 million last quarter. During the quarter, we experienced $3.6 million of non-operating expenses, $2 million of which related to the Citizens transaction. 
As we think about noninterest expense, we are focused on the operating noninterest expense base. The second quarter operating expense base was $202.1 million, which included $700,000 related to the newly acquired Citizens branches and was down from $205.6 million last quarter. The largest part of this decrease was attributable to compensation benefit reductions, which declined $5 million to $103 million in the current quarter. Approximately $3 million of this decline relates to lower payroll taxes, which are typically higher in the first quarter as a result of the timing of annual incentive payments.
The third quarter will contain a full quarter of expenses for the newly acquired Citizens branches, which we estimate to be $7.8 million or an increase of $7.1 million from the second quarter. We expect that during the course of 2012, we will be steadily walking the quarterly run rate down such that our targeted full year operating expense base should be in the range of $825 million to $830 million. In the quarters ahead, we are committed to continuing to bring the absolute expense levels down on a pro forma basis.
On Slide 13, we provide a historical perspective on our efficiency ratio. The efficiency ratio improved to 61.5% for the second quarter compared to 63.2% in the first quarter and 64.9% in the second quarter of 2011. Although exhibiting progress, the efficiency ratio has been negatively impacted by slower-than-anticipated loan growth and a decline in net interest margin. In particular, the reduction in the absolute level of interest rates from the end of last year was unexpected. And if interest rates remain at their current record low levels, we may see the timing of achieving our 55% efficiency ratio goal slipping into 2014.
As we discussed in the first quarter earnings call, the newly acquired Citizens branches are expected to cost us $0.01 per share in 2012, $0.02 per share in 2013 and breakeven in 2014. This transaction will also impact our reported efficiency ratio progress until we reach the breakeven point.
Next, we move on to an overview of recent expense initiatives. Given the difficult economic climate and the industry's increased regulatory and compliance burden, we established the expense management oversight committee in the fall of 2011. This committee is comprised of 3 senior executives: The Chief Financial Officer, Chief Administrative Officer and Chief Human Resources Officer, that enables us to operate with a much more rigorous approach to expense control. This table outlines several key initiatives for 2012, as well as the new ones from this quarter to provide us an update on their current status. One of the goals of expense management oversight committee has been to focus on a longer planning horizon. For example, we now begin negotiating contracts 1 to 3 years in advance of expiration, which gives us a stronger negotiating position since the vendors recognize with this much lead time, we have the ability to switch providers.
We will provide an update on our cost reduction progress and the latest expense initiatives every quarter. It is important to note that we are still investing in the business while continuing to reduce expenses. The revenue initiatives that we have funded over the last year include the additional commercial relationship officers and support staff in the New York metro area, as well as additional talent in several key growth areas, including asset-based lending, mortgage warehouse lending, wealth management and private banking. 
We are pleased to say these initiatives have produced sufficient increased revenues to cover their expenses and contribute to the bottom line with the exception of wealth management, which we expect to break even next year; and the acquired Citizens branches, which we project to break even in 2014.
Slides 15 and 16 are a reminder of our excellent credit quality. We did see an improvement in nonperforming assets this quarter from already industry-leading levels. NPAs decreased approximately $22 million to $295 million. Nonperforming assets at 1.67% of originated loans and REO remain well below our peer group and Top 50 banks.
Looking at Slide 16, net charge-offs were 26 basis points compared to 22 basis points last quarter. Approximately 5 basis points of our charge-offs this quarter related to losses in acquired loans. Accordingly, net charge-offs and originated loan portfolio was effectively flat on a linked quarter basis. These levels continue to reflect the minimal loss content in our nonperforming assets that stand at approximately 50% of our peers.
Over the last 4 quarters, charge-offs against specific reserves represent approximately 48% of total charge-offs. As such, we understand our credit issues well and typically have very few new credit events each quarter.
On Slide 17, you can see the detail for the allowance for loan losses by loan category. A few items to note. Our allowance for loan losses to commercial loans is 1.28% with a coverage ratio of 82% of commercial NPLs. As we have stated previously, we have a strict loan loss allowance methodology, which is consistently applied. That said, mix shift and new originations can result in modest changes in the overall coverage ratio in any given quarter. Provision for loan losses reflects $13.5 million in charge-offs, including $7.5 million at the previously established specific reserves and $4.6 million of additional allowance billed in response to loan growth.
Now I'll pass it back to Jack."

On Slide 18, you can see our operating return on average assets for the second quarter was 97 basis points, up significantly from the first quarter. However, this includes approximately 6 basis points of improvement related to cost recove",606,"Thank you, Kirk. On Slide 18, you can see our operating return on average assets for the second quarter was 97 basis points, up significantly from the first quarter. However, this includes approximately 6 basis points of improvement related to cost recovery income, which we regard as discrete and transactional. It's also worth noting that the operating return on average assets in the third quarter of 2011 was positively impacted by securities gains amounting to 8 basis points.  You'll recall that we took this action to reduce the premium on our books and protect against amortization exposure.
Making both of these adjustments, the chart would then illustrate consistent returns on average assets over the last 5 quarters of approximately 90 basis points. With this in mind, it's important to reflect upon the progress that we have made over the past 3 years. 
As we have strengthened the earnings power of the franchise through the additions of key personnel, the expansion of key business lines and through the thoughtful deployment of capital, we have also absorbed the negative impact of regulatory reform to related higher cost of compliance and the impact of a prolonged low interest rate environment. Through all of this, we have nearly doubled our return on average assets from 49 basis points in the second quarter of 2009 to consistently performing over 90 basis points.
On Slide 19, we expect to see an increase in return on average tangible equity as we improve profitability and thoughtfully deployed capital. Our significant capital levels remain approximately 350 basis points above peers, which produces below industry return on average tangible equity. Normalizing our equity base to be consistent with our peers shows that the bank is performing well with return on average tangible equity at 12.4%.
On Slide 20, consistent with the outline of our financial targets, we expect to see our operating dividend payout ratio trend lower throughout 2012. While we were aided by cost recovery income this quarter, steady loan and deposit growth, together with consistent share repurchase activity, has and will continue to reduce the dividend payout ratio.
On Slide 21, we see that capital levels at the holding company and the bank remain very strong with our tangible common equity ratio at 11.5% and Tier 1 common at 13.6%, which compares well to our peers at 8% and 11.3% as of the first quarter, respectively.
While our tangible common equity ratio remains much higher than peers, on a total risk-based capital basis, we are much closer to peers. This is the result of having a larger commercial loan portfolio, as well as smaller residential and securities portfolios than our peers. It is worth noting that we have spent some time with the Basel III proposal released on June 7, 2012. Given our strong capital levels, we do not anticipate any material impact when the new rules are implemented. However, it will take time to be precise about the impact on our capital levels because amongst other considerations, Basel III risk weighting will require loan specific risk-weighting adjustments.
Our game plan for successfully navigating the low interest rate environment includes growing loans and deposits, maintaining discipline on all asset repricing, lowering the cost of funds, lowering absolute expenses, growing fee income and maintaining excellent credit quality. Our robust pipelines and strong originated loan growth contribute to the continued momentum of our franchise. The strength of our platform continues to allow us to attract and retain exceptional talent and provides a sustainable competitive advantage.

Could it hover a little bit below, or a little bit above depending on mix? I think the answer is, yes. But it has been hovering right around that 1% level. But I could say, what I really focused on is that commercial coverage historically, we've had very little in terms of charge-offs in the residential loans."

I think it's important that what we have done is we've hired some experienced commercial real estate professionals, and we're not going into that market with just a bent that we're just doing multifamily. Certainly, multifamily will be in the mix. It'll be one of the things we'll be doing.

One that will be relationship-oriented and that we do have a good strong history on the commercial real estate side but also other products and offerings that we'll be able to lever in that market. So if you look at our commercial real estate as a whole, and the portfolio, the multifamily portion is relatively small when you consider it as a whole. So we do have some capacity if we find some interesting and good production to do. But I'd re-emphasize that we're looking at commercial real estate as a whole in the city."

For the quarter, operating earnings were $64.4 million or $0.19 per share, down from $67.2 million",373,"Thank you, Peter. Good afternoon, everyone. As always, we appreciate your joining us today. On Slide 2, we provide an overview of our third quarter results. For the quarter, operating earnings were $64.4 million or $0.19 per share, down from $67.2 million or $0.20 per share in the second quarter. Net income for the quarter was $62.2 million or $0.18 per share. 
Operating net interest margin declined to 3.82% compared to 3.88% in the second quarter. The decline in the margin is primarily the result of lower loan yields and was partially offset by lower funding costs. 
Total loan growth amounted to 8.8% on an annualized basis. We are very pleased to see this increased momentum, which is significant when considering the runoff in our acquired portfolios. 
Noninterest income in the quarter increased $5.7 million to $81.4 million. This increase was primarily due to higher prepayment fees, seasonally strong insurance revenues, higher gain on sale of residential mortgages and increased operating leasing income. 
We are particularly pleased with the progress on our efficiency ratio, which improved to 61.4% from 61.5% in the second quarter. We were able to drive operating leverage while absorbing thoughtful quarter expenses of the Citizens branch acquisition. For the growing balance sheet, supported by strategic revenue initiatives and identifying expense reductions scheduled in the quarters ahead, we look forward to continued progress on our efficiency ratio as we push towards our goal of 55%. 
Asset quality, a longtime hallmark of this institution, continues to impress as net charge-offs totaled just 18 basis points this quarter, which is the lowest level since the second quarter of 2009. 
During the quarter, we repurchased 4.5 million shares or $53.5 million at a weighted average price of $11.90 per share. Year-to-date, we repurchased 13.5 million shares or $164 million at a weighted average price of $12.12 per share. This results in approximately $8.6 million of annual dividend savings. We have 4.5 million shares remaining in our existing share repurchase authorization. 
Capital ratios remain strong with the tangible equity ratio at 11.2% for the third quarter. We continue to make progress deploying our capital through balance sheet growth, dividend payments and share repurchase activity. 
Now I would like to turn it over to Kirk."

Our loan yields negatively impacted the margin by 9 basis points. Approximately 5 basis points of this decline related to the runoff of higher yielding loans in the acquired loan portfolio. The other 4 basis points decline related to a combination of originated loans coming on at lower rates, payoffs and repricing. 
Cost recovery income, which represents settlements and payoffs in the acquired loan portfolio in excess of the carrying amount, continued this quarter and amounted to $4.1 million, down from $4.7 million last quarter, which negatively impacted the margin by 1 basis point. These forces are partially offset by 3 basis point improvement in funding rates and mix. Deposit costs are 41 basis point, down from 45 basis points last quarter and 58 basis points in the third quarter a year ago. As a reminder, the favorable effect of fair value amortization on acquired time deposit and the Danvers acquisition will end this month and negatively impact our fourth quarter net interest margin by approximately 2 basis points. In this rate environment, opportunities continue to exist to lower deposit costs. For example, average deposits and acquired markets represent approximately 17% of total average deposits with a weighted average cost of 77 basis points, which reflects progress that is still well above our franchise wide cost of deposit. 
In addition, we continue to improve our DDA mix. Overall, we anticipate a similar declined on a net interest margin next quarter, driven by the acquired loan portfolio runoff, lower absolute rates and the expiration of the fair value amortization on acquired time deposits. 
On Slide 4, you can see that our operating net interest margin declined to 3.82% in the quarter. The difference between GAAP and operating net interest margin is a cost recovery income, which we view as discrete and transactional in nature. Our strong margin is a product of our low-cost, stable funding, loan mix and solid capital levels, all of which means that we do not need to stretch on credit. In addition, our margin is and will continue to be supported by approximately $900 million of accretable yield resulting from 5 acquisitions closed within the last 2.5 years. 
Let me provide you a little more detail on the next slide. Slide 5 links closely with our discussion of the net interest margin. For the quarter, interest accretion on acquired loans totaled approximately $49 million, down from $56 million in the second quarter. The runoff in the acquired portfolio reached its highest level this quarter, as $383 million of loans paid off, matured or were settled, with just $32 million relating to Fin Fed. We now expect the acquired Fin Fed portfolio to remain with us into 2013. While we'd prefer that some of these loans had stayed with us, we have seen approximately $100 million of improvement this quarter in criticized and classified assets within the acquired loan portfolios. 
The carrying amount of acquired loans at period end totaled $2.6 billion. Recall, these portfolios totaled $5.4 billion in aggregate as of their respective acquisition dates. Overall, we remain confident that our credit marks will be sufficient to cover the anticipate loss content in these portfolios. 
Slide 6 illustrates the amount of noncash accretion running through our income statement. If you go to the top left, you will see that we posted total accretion of $49 million this quarter, which when you annualize and divide by the average balance of the acquired loan portfolio, gives an effective yield of 6 90. Weighted average coupon in the acquired loan portfolio is 5.39%. This is actually cash coming in from the acquired loans. The difference between the 6 90 effective yield, the weighted average coupon of 5.39% amounts to $10.6 million of additional interest income from the amortization of the original discount on the acquired loan portfolio. Annualizing this number and dividing it by the adjusted average earning assets in the third quarter shows 17 basis points of our operating net interest margin during the quarter relates to noncash accretion. 
So if you want to think about our core underlying margin, excluding the noncash accretion, it would be operating -- it would be our operating net interest margin at 3.82%, less the 17 basis points or 3.65%. The noncash accretion was equivalent to $0.02 per share this quarter, as shown on the right-hand side of the page which is similar to prior quarters. 
Over time, as the acquired loans repay, mature or settled, the amortization original discount will dissipate. At the same time, it is possible that we may also experience reclassifications from the non-accretable difference to accretable yield due to better-than-expected credit performance. 
Slide 7 provides a breakdown of the elements contributing to our net increase in loans. As Jack noted earlier, the loan portfolio grew 8.8% quarter over quarter annualized on a period end basis. We believe we operate in the best commercial banking market in the United States and are one of the few banks that can credibly offer the full product suite of a large bank, while maintaining our outstanding customer service standards. 
Originated loan growth for the quarter totaled $835 million. As in prior quarters, growth came from a variety of products and geographic areas. Originated commercial loans increased $722 million quarter-over-quarter. C&I and expansion contributed 82% of this growth with increases of $310 million and $286 million, respectively. 
Within C&I, we saw strength across all categories, but I would highlight a few businesses that continue to outperform. Our mortgage warehouse lending business, both equipment and finance businesses, People's United equipment finance and PCLC grew originated loans $147 million, $72 million and $43 million, respectively, in the quarter. The mortgage warehouse lending business is one that's well known to us 3 years of experience. We are comfortable with the credit. And while the growth rate will likely slow from here a bit, it does have room to grow over the next 2 years and is likely to continue to contribute nicely, given the low interest rate environment. Originated residential mortgages grew by $97 million. Of the residential mortgage originations, approximately 51% were hybrid adjustable-rate mortgages and 58% of the pipeline is jumbo product. Third quarter 2012 average loan size or close loans originated in the quarter was $316,000, while the average loan size for our loans added to the portfolio conforming our jumbo was $596,000. 
Average FICO score for all third quarter originations was 758 with an average LTV of 68%. Originated home equity loans increased by $11 million. Home equity loan closings totaled $197 million in commitments compared to $164 million in the second quarter 2012. In terms of recent originations, the average line size the third quarter originations was $133,000. The average FICO score was 7 60 with an average combined loan-to-value of 57%. Consistent with our past practices, 100% of home equity loans are originated in the branches. 
The acquired portfolio declined by $383 million. As we noted in the past, it is difficult to predict the rate of decline in the acquired portfolios. That said, we continue to manage the business with an eye towards growing our total loan balance at a mid to high single-digit growth rate. 
You can see on Slide 8 a breakdown of the elements contributing to a modest decrease in deposits, which occurred this quarter while we further reduce total deposit costs. Third quarter is seasonally our weakest period with respect to retail deposit flows, as customers tend to spend more during the summer. In addition, we continue to improve the mix of our deposit base, as higher cost time deposits decreased by $154 million. 
Larger deposit gathering opportunities in front of us relate to increasing our deposit mix in favor of both retail and commercial non-interest-bearing deposits and better utilization of the recently acquired branches in New York. I am encouraged to see that we experienced DDA growth of 11% year-over-year, excluding the recently acquired branches in New York and have seen good activity with respect to new account opening in the recently acquired branches. 
Slide 9 shows that we continue to make progress on loan and deposit growth on a per-share basis while maintaining excellent asset quality. We know that if we grow loans and deposits per share, increase fee income and continue to reduce cost, we will produce greater recurring earnings per share.  Over the past 2 years, loans per share and deposits per share have grown a compound annual rates of 21% and 20%, respectively. 
Slide 10 provides a breakout of noninterest income, which increased $5.7 million from the second quarter. The income areas that demonstrate momentum included loan prepayment fees and seasonally strong insurance, which increased $2.5 million and $2.3 million, respectively. Gain on sale of residential mortgages posted another strong quarter, producing income of $3.6 million, up $800,000 from last quarter and equal to first quarter levels. Other areas of strength included operating lease income and bank service charges, which were largely offset by weaker brokerage income. As a reminder, our insurance business is seasonal. The first and third quarters tend to be stronger than the second and fourth quarters. 
On Slide 11, you can see that our noninterest expense base increased to $209 million from $206 million last quarter. During the quarter, we incurred $3.2 million of nonoperating expenses, $2.4 million of which related to the recent branch acquisition and $800,000 related to severance. As we think about noninterest expense, we are focused on the operating noninterest expense base. The third quarter operating expense base was $205.7 million, which included $7.6 million related to the recently acquired branches and was up from $202.1 million last quarter. The impact of the recently acquired branches is partially offset by lower compensation and benefits, as well as professional and outside service reductions, which declined $1.3 million and $1.7 million, respectively. 
Clearly, we are able to make better than anticipated progress and expense control this quarter. As a result, we now anticipate full year 2012 operating expenses to be in the range of $815 million to $820 million as opposed to our prior guidance of a $825 million to $830 million.  We remain committed to continuing to bring the absolute expense levels down while we grow revenues. 
On Slide 12, we provide a historical perspective on our efficiency ratio. Since first quarter 2010, we significantly improved our operating leverage, as can be seen in our much improved efficiency ratio, which has declined from 76.1% to 61.4% this quarter or 15%. This quarter, we absorbed an additional $6.9 million of operating expenses associated with the recently acquired branches in New York and still the efficiency ratio improved modestly. 
Slides 13 and 14 are a reminder of our excellent pretty quality. Once again, we did see an improvement in nonperforming assets this quarter from already industry-leading levels. Originated nonperforming assets at 1.59% of originated loans and REO remain well below our peer group and top 50 banks. 
Looking at Slide 16, our net charge-offs were 18 basis points compared to 26 basis points last quarter. These levels continue to reflect the minimal loss content in our nonperforming assets and are well below peers. Over the last 4 quarters, charge-offs against specific reserves represent approximately 52% of total charge-offs. As such, we understand our credit issues and typically have very few new credit events each quarter. 
On Slide 15, you can see the details for the allowance for loan losses by loan category. A few items to note, our allowance for loan losses to commercial loans is 1.22% with a coverage ratio of 82% of commercial NPLs. As we have stated previously, we have a strict loan loss allowance methodology, which is consistently applied. That said, mix shift and new originations can result in modest changes in the overall coverage ratio in any given quarter. The provision for loan losses in this quarter of $15.1 million reflects $9.4 million in net charge-offs, including $4.8 million with previously established specific reserves, $5.7 million for acquired loans impairment and $4.8 million associated with loan growth. As we said earlier, overall we remain confident in the credit marks of our acquired portfolios despite the lumpiness of both costs, recovery income and impairment, as individual loans in our pools reached the end of their lives. 
Now I'll pass it back to Jack."

On Slide 16, you can see our operating return on average assets for the third quarter was 91 basis points, down slightly from the last quarter. However, this metrics does not reflect how we feel about our progress. The strong loan growth momentum and efficiency ratio improvement while absorbing a full quarter of expenses associated with the recently acquired branches in New York. 
It is important to reflect upon the progress that we have made since the management changed in the second quarter of 2010. We have strengthened the earnings power of the franchise through the additions of key personnel, expansion of business lines and through a thoughtful deployment of capital. We have also absorbed the negative impact of regulatory reform, related higher cost of compliance, the impact of a prolonged low interest rate environment and a weak economic recovery. Through all of this, we have seen strong improvement in our return on average assets and improved performance so that we are now performing at the same level as our peers. 
Slide 17 illustrates the improvement in our return on average tangible equity with the low levels -- from the low levels of 2010. We expect to see continued improvements in this metric as we improve profitability and thoughtfully deployed capital. So, our significant capital levels remain approximately 370 basis points over peers on a tangible common equity, tangible assets basis. Normalizing our equity base to be consistent with our peers shows that the bank is performing well with a return on average tangible equity of 12.3%. 
Slide 18 illustrates our substantial progress since 2010 on a dividend payout ratio. We expect progress to continue in the quarters ahead on the improved profitability and continued share repurchase activity. 
On Slide 19, we see that capital levels at the holding company and the bank remain very strong with our tangible common equity ratio at 11.2% and Tier 1 common at 13.6%, which compares well to our peers at 7.8% and 10.7% as of the second quarter, respectively. 
We have spent some time with the Basel III proposal released on June 7, 2012. We currently estimate that the Basel III proposal will negatively impact our risk-based capital ratios anywhere from 50 to 100 basis points on an as-proposed or fully phased in basis. While we have studied the release, it is important to remember that the regulations are proposed at this point and some sections are still subject to revision and interpretation. 
Our game plan for successfully navigating the low interest rate and the slow economic growth environment continues to includes growing loans and deposits, maintaining discipline on all asset repricing, lowering the cost of funds, lowering absolute expenses, growing fee income, maintaining excellent credit quality and maintaining our conservative position within the investment portfolio. Our robust pipelines and strong originated loan growth contribute to the continued momentum of our franchise. The strength of our platform continues to allow us to attract and retain exceptional talent and provides a substantial, sustainable competitive advantage.

So we are seeing in the old Bank of Smithtown as well as Danvers portfolios month by month the CD rolling down and into more current rates. In terms of the first question, the funding, we really haven't changed much in terms of strategy. Third quarter is seasonally always our lightest quarter. Our lowest point in terms of deposits tends to build from there. And what we did see during the quarter certainly was continued good loan activity. And probably as we go forward, I think there is a possibility if we continue to have a real good loan activity, then it could outstrip our deposit growth. If that occurred, we could continue to see some modest the increase in borrowing. But as far as the third quarter goes, a lot of that is just normal seasonal liquidity."

And we're also amortizing in the securities portfolio some 15-year mortgage backs that were bought 2, 3 years ago, and that balance continues to run down. So I think that's the combination of it.

For the quarter, operating earnings were $64.4 million or $0.19 per share, down from $67.2 million",374,"Thank you, Peter. Good afternoon, everyone. As always, we appreciate your joining us today. On Slide 2, we provide an overview of our third quarter results. For the quarter, operating earnings were $64.4 million or $0.19 per share, down from $67.2 million or $0.20 per share in the second quarter. Net income for the quarter was $62.2 million or $0.18 per share. 
Operating net interest margin declined to 3.82% compared to 3.88% in the second quarter. The decline in the margin is primarily the result of lower loan yields. It was partially offset by lower funding costs. 
Total loan growth amounted to 8.8% on an annualized basis. We are very pleased to see this increased momentum, which is significant when considering the runoff in our acquired portfolios. 
Noninterest income in the quarter increased $5.7 million to $81.4 million. This increase was primarily due to higher prepayment fees, seasonally strong insurance revenues, higher gain on sale of residential mortgages and increased operating lease income. 
We are particularly pleased with the progress on our efficiency ratio, which improved to 61.4% from 61.5% in the second quarter. We were able to drive operating leverage while absorbing the full quarter expenses of the Citizens branch acquisition. With the growing balance sheet, supported by strategic revenue initiatives and identified expense reductions scheduled in the quarters ahead, we look forward to continued progress on our efficiency ratio as we push towards our goal of 55%. 
Asset quality, a longtime hallmark of this institution, continues to impress as net charge-offs totaled just 18 basis points this quarter, which is the lowest level since the second quarter of 2009. 
During the quarter, we repurchased 4.5 million shares or $53.5 million at a weighted average price of $11.90 per share. Year-to-date, we repurchased 13.5 million shares or $164 million at a weighted average price of $12.12 per share. This results in approximately $8.6 million of annual dividend saving. We have 4.5 million shares remaining in our existing share repurchase authorization. 
Capital ratios remain strong, with the tangible equity ratio at 11.2% for the third quarter. We continue to make progress deploying in our capital through balance sheet growth, dividend payments and share repurchase activity. 
Now I'd like to turn it over to Kirk."

On Slide 3, you can see a breakdown of the elements contributing to our 3.89% net interest margin for the quarter.

On Slide 3, you can see a breakdown of the elements contributing to our 3.89% net interest margin for the quarter. Lower loan yields negatively impacted the margin by 9 basis points, approximately 5 basis points of this decline related to the runoff of higher yielding loans in the acquired loan portfolio. The other 4 basis point decline related to a combination of originated loans coming on at lower rates, payoff and repricing. 
Cost recovery income, which represents settlements and payoffs in the acquired loan portfolio in excess of the carrying amount, continued this quarter and amounted to $4.1 million, down from $4.7 million last quarter, which negatively impacted the margin by 1 basis point. These forces are partially offset by a 3 basis point improvement in funding rates and mix. Deposit costs are 41 basis point, down from 45 basis points last quarter and 58 basis points in the third quarter a year ago. As a reminder, the favorable effect of fair value amortization on acquired time deposits in the Danvers acquisition will end this month and negatively impact our fourth quarter net interest margin by approximately 2 basis points. In this rate environment, opportunities continue to exist to lower deposit cost. For example, average deposits and acquired markets represent approximately 17% of total average deposits, with a weighted average cost of 77 basis points, which reflects progress, but is still well above our franchise wide cost of deposits. 
In addition, we continue to improve our DDA mix. Overall, we anticipate a similar decline in our net interest margin next quarter, driven by the acquired loan portfolio runoff, lower absolute rates and the expiration of the fair value amortization on acquired time deposits. 
On Slide 4, you can see that our operating net interest margin declined to 3.82% in the quarter. The difference between GAAP and operating net interest margin is a cost recovery income, which we view as discrete and transactional in nature. Our strong margin is a product of our low-cost, stable funding, loan mix and solid capital levels, all of which means that we do not need to stretch on credit. In addition, our margin is and will continue to be supported by approximately $900 million of accretable yield resulting from 5 acquisitions closed within the last 2.5 years. 
Let me provide you a little more detail on the next slide. Slide 5 links closely with our discussion of the net interest margin. For the quarter, interest accretion on acquired loans total approximately $49 million, down from $56 million in the second quarter. The runoff in the acquired portfolio reached its highest level this quarter, as $383 million of loans paid off, matured or were settled, with just $32 million relating to Fin Fed. We now expect the acquired Fin Fed portfolio to remain with us into 2013. While we'd prefer that some of these loans had stayed with us, we have seen approximately $100 million of improvement this quarter in criticized and classified assets within the acquired loan portfolios. 
The carrying amount of acquired loans at period end totaled $2.6 billion. Recall, these portfolios totaled $5.4 billion in aggregate as of their respective acquisition dates. Overall, we remain confident that our credit marks will be sufficient to cover the anticipated loss content in these portfolios. 
Slide 6 illustrates the amount of noncash accretion running through our income statement. If you go to the top left, you will see that we booked total accretion of $49 million this quarter, which when you annualize and divide by the average balance in the acquired loan portfolio, gives an effective yield of 6.90%. Weighted average coupon in the acquired loan portfolio is 5.39%. This is actual cash coming in from the acquired loans. The difference between the 6.90% effective yield, the weighted average coupon of 5.39%, amounts to $10.6 million of additional interest income from the amortization of the original discount on the acquired loan portfolio. Annualizing this number and dividing it by the adjusted average earning assets in the third quarter shows that 17 basis points of our operating net interest margin during the quarter relates to noncash accretion. 
So if you want to think about our core underlying margin, excluding the noncash accretion, it would be operating -- it'd be our operating net interest margin at 3.82%, less the 17 basis points or 3.65%. The noncash accretion was equivalent to $0.02 per share this quarter, as shown on the right-hand side of the page, which is similar to prior quarters. 
Over time, as the acquired loans repay, mature or settled, the amortization original discount will dissipate. At the same time, it is possible that we may also experience reclassifications from the non-accretable difference to accretable yield due to better-than-expected credit performance. 
Slide 7 provides a breakdown of the elements contributing to our net increase in loans. As Jack noted earlier, the loan portfolio grew 8.8% quarter-over-quarter annualized on a period-end basis. We believe we operate in the best commercial banking market in the United States, and are one of the few banks that can credibly offer the full product suite of a large bank, while maintaining our outstanding customer service standards. 
Originated loan growth for the quarter totaled $835 million. As in prior quarters, growth came from a variety of products and geographic areas. Originated commercial loans increased $722 million quarter-over-quarter. C&I and CRE expansion contributed 82% of this growth, with increases of $310 million and $286 million, respectively. 
Within C&I, we saw strength across all categories, but I would highlight a few businesses that continue to outperform. Our mortgage warehouse lending business in both equipment and finance businesses, People's United Equipment Finance and PCLC, grew originated loans $147 million, $72 million and $43 million, respectively, in the quarter. The mortgage warehouse lending business is one that is well known to us through years of experience. We are comfortable with the credit. And while the growth rate will likely slow from here a bit, it does have room to grow over the next 2 years, and is likely to continue to contribute nicely, given the low interest rate environment. Originated residential mortgages grew by $97 million. Of the residential mortgage originations, approximately 51% were hybrid adjustable-rate mortgages and 58% of the pipeline is Jumbo product. Third quarter 2012 average loan size or our close loans originated in the quarter was $316,000, while the average loan size for our loans added to the portfolio conforming our Jumbo was $596,000. 
Average FICO score for our third quarter originations was 758, with an average LTV of 68%. Originated home equity loans increased by $11 million. Home equity loan closings totaled $197 million in commitments, compared to $164 million in the second quarter 2012. In terms of recent originations, the average line size, the third quarter originations was $133,000. The average FICO score was 7.60%, with an average combined loan-to-value of 57%. Consistent with our past practices, 100% of home equity loans are originated in the branches. 
The acquired portfolio declined by $383 million. As we noted in the past, it is difficult to predict the rate of decline in the acquired portfolios. That said, we continue to manage the business with an eye towards growing our total loan balance at a mid- to high-single digits growth rate. 
You can see on Slide 8 a breakdown of the element contributing to a modest decrease in deposits, which occurred this quarter, while we further reduce total deposit cost. Third quarter is seasonally our weakest period with respect to retail deposit flows, as customers tend to spend more during the summer months. In addition, we continue to improve the mix of our deposit base, as higher-cost time deposits decreased by $154 million. 
Larger deposit gathering opportunities in front of us relate to increasing our deposit mix in favor of both retail and commercial non-interest-bearing deposits and better utilization of the recently acquired branches in New York. I am encouraged to see that we experienced DDA growth of 11% year-over-year, excluding the recently acquired branches in New York, and have seen good activity with respect to new account openings in the recently acquired branches. 
Slide 9 shows that we continue to make progress on loan and deposit growth on a per-share basis, while maintaining excellent asset quality. We know that if we grow loans and deposits per share, increase fee income and continue to reduce cost, we will produce greater recurring earnings per share.  Over the past 2 years, loans per share and deposits per share have grown at compound annual rates of 21% and 20%, respectively. 
Slide 10 provides a breakout of non-interest income, which increased $5.7 million from the second quarter. The income areas that demonstrate at momentum included loan prepayment fees and seasonally strong insurance, which increased $2.5 million and $2.3 million, respectively. Gain on sale of residential mortgages posted another strong quarter, producing income of $3.6 million, up $800,000 from last quarter and equal to first quarter levels. Other areas of strength included operating lease income and bank service charges, which were largely offset by weaker brokerage income. As a reminder, our insurance business is seasonal. The first and third quarters tend to be stronger than the second and fourth quarters. 
On Slide 11, you can see that our non-interest expense base increased to $209 million from $206 million last quarter. During the quarter, we incurred $3.2 million of nonoperating expenses, $2.4 million of which related to the recent branch acquisition and $800,000 related to severance. As we think about non-interest expense, we are focused on the operating non-interest expense base. The third quarter operating expense base was $205.7 million, which included $7.6 million related to the recently acquired branches, and was up from $202.1 million last quarter. The impact of the recently acquired branches is partially offset by lower compensation and benefit, as well as professional and outside service reductions, which declined $1.3 million and $1.7 million, respectively. 
Clearly, we are able to make better-than-anticipated progress and expense control this quarter. As a result, we now anticipate full year 2012 operating expenses to be in the range of $815 million to $820 million, as opposed to our prior guidance of a $825 million to $830 million.  We remain committed to continuing to bring the absolute expense levels down while we grow revenues. 
On Slide 12, we provide the historical perspective on our efficiency ratio. Since first quarter 2010, we significantly improved our operating leverage, as can be seen in our much improved efficiency ratio, which has declined from 76.1% to 61.4% this quarter or 15%. This quarter, we absorbed an additional $6.9 million of operating expenses associated with the recently acquired branches in New York, and still the efficiency ratio improved modestly. 
Slides 13 and 14 are a reminder of our excellent pretty quality. Once again, we did see an improvement in nonperforming assets this quarter from already industry-leading levels. Originated nonperforming assets at 1.59% of originated loans and REO remain well below our peer group and top 50 banks. 
Looking at Slide 16, net charge-offs were 18 basis points compared to 26 basis points last quarter. These levels continue to reflect the minimal loss content in our nonperforming assets, and are well below peers. Over the last 4 quarters, charge-offs against specific reserves represent approximately 52% of total charge-offs. As such, we understand our credit issues, and typically have very few new credit event each quarter. 
On Slide 15, you can see the details for the allowance for loan losses by loan category. A few items to note. Our allowance for loan losses to commercial loans is 1.22%, with a coverage ratio of 82% of commercial NPLs. As we have stated previously, we have a strict loan loss allowance methodology, which is consistently applied. That said, mix shift and new originations can result in modest changes in the overall coverage ratio in any given quarter. The provision for loan losses this quarter of $15.1 million reflects $9.4 million in net charge-offs, including $4.8 million with previously established specific reserves, $5.7 million for acquired loans impairment and $4.8 million associated with loan growth. As we said earlier, overall, we remain confident in the credit marks of our acquired portfolios despite the lumpiness of both costs, recovery income and impairment, as individual loans and our pools reached the end of their lives. 
Now I'll pass it back to Jack."

However, this metrics does not reflect how we feel about our progress. The strong loan growth",528,"Thank you, Kirk. On Slide 16, you can see our operating return on average assets for the third quarter was 91 basis points, down slightly from the last quarter. However, this metrics does not reflect how we feel about our progress. The strong loan growth momentum and efficiency ratio improvement, while absorbing a full quarter of expenses associated with the recently acquired branches in New York. 
It is important to reflect upon the progress that we have made since the management changed in the second quarter of 2010. We have strengthened the earnings power of the franchise through the additions of key personnel, expansion of business lines and through a thoughtful deployment of capital. We have also absorbed the negative impact of regulatory reform, related high cost of compliance, the impact of a prolonged low interest rate environment and a weak economic recovery. Through all of this, we have seen strong improvement in our return on average assets, and improved performance so that we are now performing at the same level as our peers. 
Slide 17 illustrates the improvement in our return on average tangible equity with the low levels -- from the low levels of 2010. We expect to see continued improvements in this metric as we improve profitability and thoughtfully deploy capital. Still, our significant capital levels remain approximately 370 basis points over peers on a tangible common equity, tangible asset basis. Normalizing our equity base to be consistent with our peers shows that the bank is performing well with a return on average tangible equity of 12.3%. 
Slide 18 illustrates our substantial progress since 2010 on a dividend payout ratio. We expect progress to continue in the quarters ahead on the improved profitability and continued share repurchase activity. 
On Slide 19, we see that capital levels at the holding company and the bank remain very strong, with our tangible common equity ratio at 11.2% and Tier 1 common at 13.6%, which compares well to our peers at 7.8% and 10.7% as of the second quarter, respectively. 
We have spent some time with the Basel III proposal released on June 7, 2012. We currently estimate that the Basel III proposal will negatively impact our risk-based capital ratios by anywhere from 50 to 100 basis points on an as-proposed or fully phased in basis. While we have studied the release, it is important to remember that the regulations are proposed at this point, and some sections are still subject to revision and interpretation. 
Our game plan for successfully navigating the low interest rate and the slow economic growth environment continues to include growing loans and deposits, maintaining discipline on all asset repricing, lowering the cost of funds, lowering absolute expenses, growing fee income, maintaining excellent credit quality and maintaining our conservative position within the investment portfolio. Our robust pipelines in the strong originated loan growth contribute to the continued momentum of our franchise. The strength of our platform continues to allow us to attract and retain exceptional talent and provides a substantial, sustainable, competitive advantage. 
This concludes our presentation. Now we'll be happy to answer any questions that you all have. Operator, we are ready for questions."

So we're very pleased with the momentum of the team. As additional cover around that, the gentleman that we hired, the executive to lead that group, is also managing all of our New York commercial real estate effort. And so we have, for instance, moved in the Long Island commercial real estate group under his supervision. And he's had the time to spend with them on that portfolio, recognized customers that he's dealt with before to build on those relationships. And then, we've had a number of folks we've mentioned in the past that we've made many deals in New York City and have relationships from the legacy People's United Connecticut franchise.

In terms of the first question, the funding, we really haven't changed much in terms of strategy. Third quarter is seasonally always our lightest quarter. Our lowest point in terms of deposits intends to build from there. And what we did see during the quarter certainly was continued good loan activity. And probably as we go forward, I think there's a possibility, if we continue to have real good loan activity, then it could outstrip our deposit growth. If that occurred, we could continue to see some modest increase in borrowings. But as far as the third quarter goes, a lot of that is just normal seasonal liquidity."

But we have very little premium risk in that portfolio. And, Mike, if you look at it, the overall duration of the portfolio, it's right at 2.9 years."

On Slide 2, we provide an overview of our third quarter results. For the quarter, operating earnings were $64.4 million or $0.19 per share, down from $67.2 million or $0.20 per share in the second quarter. Net income for the quarter was $62.2 million or $0.18 per share. 
Operating net interest margin declined to 3.82% compared to 3.88% in the second quarter. The decline in the margin is primarily the result of lower loan yields which was partially offset by lower funding costs. 
Total loan growth amounted to 8.8% on an annualized basis. We are very pleased to see this increased momentum, which is significant when considering the runoff in our acquired portfolios. 
Noninterest income in the quarter increased $5.7 million to $81.4 million. This increase was primarily due to higher prepayment fees, seasonally strong insurance revenues, higher gain on sale of residential mortgages and increased operating lease income. 
We are particularly pleased with the progress on our efficiency ratio, which improved to 61.4% from 61.5% in the second quarter. We were able to drive operating leverage while absorbing the full quarter expenses of the Citizens branch acquisition. With the growing balance sheet, supported by strategic revenue initiatives and identified expense reductions scheduled in the quarters ahead, we look forward to continued progress on our efficiency ratio as we push towards our goal of 55%. 
Asset quality, a longtime hallmark of this institution, continues to impress as net charge-offs totaled just 18 basis points this quarter, which is the lowest level since the second quarter of 2009. 
During the quarter, we repurchased 4.5 million shares or $53.5 million at a weighted average price of $11.90 per share. Year-to-date, we repurchased 13.5 million shares or $164 million at a weighted average price of $12.12 per share. This results in approximately $8.6 million of annual dividend saving. We have 4.5 million shares remaining in our existing share repurchase authorization. 
Capital ratios remain strong, with the tangible equity ratio at 11.2% for the third quarter. We continue to make progress deploying in our capital through balance sheet growth, dividend payments and share repurchase activity. 
Now I'd like to turn it over to Kirk."

On Slide 3, you can see a breakdown of the elements contributing to our 3.89% net interest margin for the quarter.

On Slide 3, you can see a breakdown of the elements contributing to our 3.89% net interest margin for the quarter. Lower loan yields negatively impacted the margin by 9 basis points, approximately 5 basis points of this decline related to the runoff of higher yielding loans in the acquired loan portfolio. The other 4 basis point decline related to a combination of originated loans coming on at lower rates, payoff and repricing. 
Cost recovery income, which represents settlements and payoffs in the acquired loan portfolio in excess of the carrying amount, continued this quarter and amounted to $4.1 million, down from $4.7 million last quarter, which negatively impacted the margin by 1 basis point. These forces are partially offset by a 3 basis point improvement in funding rates and mix. Deposit costs are 41 basis point, down from 45 basis points last quarter and 58 basis points in the third quarter a year ago. As a reminder, the favorable effect of fair value amortization on acquired time deposits in the Danvers acquisition will end this month and negatively impact our fourth quarter net interest margin by approximately 2 basis points. In this rate environment, opportunities continue to exist to lower deposit cost. For example, average deposits and acquired markets represent approximately 17% of total average deposits, with a weighted average cost of 77 basis points, which reflects progress, but is still well above our franchise wide cost of deposits. 
In addition, we continue to improve our DDA mix. Overall, we anticipate a similar decline in our net interest margin next quarter, driven by the acquired loan portfolio runoff, lower absolute rates and the expiration of the fair value amortization on acquired time deposits. 
On Slide 4, you can see that our operating net interest margin declined to 3.82% in the quarter. The difference between GAAP and operating net interest margin is a cost recovery income, which we view as discrete and transactional in nature. Our strong margin is a product of our low-cost, stable funding, loan mix and solid capital levels, all of which means that we do not need to stretch on credit. In addition, our margin is and will continue to be supported by approximately $900 million of accretable yield resulting from 5 acquisitions closed within the last 2.5 years. 
Let me provide you a little more detail on the next slide. Slide 5 links closely with our discussion of the net interest margin. For the quarter, interest accretion on acquired loans total approximately $49 million, down from $56 million in the second quarter. The runoff in the acquired portfolio reached its highest level this quarter, as $383 million of loans paid off, matured or were settled, with just $32 million relating to Fin Fed. We now expect the acquired Fin Fed portfolio to remain with us into 2013. While we'd prefer that some of these loans had stayed with us, we have seen approximately $100 million of improvement this quarter in criticized and classified assets within the acquired loan portfolios. 
The carrying amount of acquired loans at period end totaled $2.6 billion. Recall, these portfolios totaled $5.4 billion in aggregate as of their respective acquisition dates. Overall, we remain confident that our credit marks will be sufficient to cover the anticipated loss content in these portfolios. 
Slide 6 illustrates the amount of noncash accretion running through our income statement. If you go to the top left, you will see that we booked total accretion of $49 million this quarter, which when you annualize and divide by the average balance in the acquired loan portfolio, gives an effective yield of 6.90%. Weighted average coupon in the acquired loan portfolio is 5.39%. This is actual cash coming in from the acquired loans. The difference between the 6.90% effective yield, the weighted average coupon of 5.39%, amounts to $10.6 million of additional interest income from the amortization of the original discount on the acquired loan portfolio. Annualizing this number and dividing it by the adjusted average earning assets in the third quarter shows that 17 basis points of our operating net interest margin during the quarter relates to noncash accretion. 
So if you want to think about our core underlying margin, excluding the noncash accretion, it would be operating -- it'd be our operating net interest margin at 3.82%, less the 17 basis points or 3.65%. The noncash accretion was equivalent to $0.02 per share this quarter, as shown on the right-hand side of the page, which is similar to prior quarters. 
Over time, as the acquired loans repay, mature or are settled, the amortization original discount will dissipate. At the same time, it is possible that we may also experience reclassifications from the non-accretable difference to accretable yield due to better-than-expected credit performance. 
Slide 7 provides a breakdown of the elements contributing to our net increase in loans. As Jack noted earlier, the loan portfolio grew 8.8% quarter-over-quarter annualized on a period-end basis. We believe we operate in the best commercial banking market in the United States, and are one of the few banks that can credibly offer the full product suite of a large bank, while maintaining our outstanding customer service standards. 
Originated loan growth for the quarter totaled $835 million. As in prior quarters, growth came from a variety of products and geographic areas. Originated commercial loans increased $722 million quarter-over-quarter. C&I and CRE expansion contributed 82% of this growth, with increases of $310 million and $286 million, respectively. 
Within C&I, we saw strength across all categories, but I would highlight a few businesses that continue to outperform. Our mortgage warehouse lending business in both equipment and finance businesses, People's United Equipment Finance and PCLC, grew originated loans of $147 million, $72 million and $43 million, respectively, in the quarter. The mortgage warehouse lending business is one that is well known to us through years of experience. We are comfortable with the credit. And while the growth rate will likely slow from here a bit, it does have room to grow over the next 2 years, and is likely to continue to contribute nicely, given the low interest rate environment. Originated residential mortgages grew by $97 million. Of the residential mortgage originations, approximately 51% were hybrid adjustable-rate mortgages and 58% of the pipeline is Jumbo product. Third quarter 2012 average loan size or our close loans originated in the quarter was $316,000, while the average loan size for our loans added to the portfolio conforming or Jumbo was $596,000. 
Average FICO score for our third quarter originations was 758, with an average LTV of 68%. Originated home equity loans increased by $11 million. Home equity loan closings totaled $197 million in commitments, compared to $164 million in the second quarter 2012. In terms of recent originations, the average line size, the third quarter originations was $133,000. The average FICO score was 7.60%, with an average combined loan-to-value of 57%. Consistent with our past practices, 100% of home equity loans are originated in the branches. 
The acquired portfolio declined by $383 million. As we noted in the past, it is difficult to predict the rate of decline in the acquired portfolios. That said, we continue to manage the business with an eye towards growing our total loan balance at a mid- to high-single digits growth rate. 
You can see on Slide 8 a breakdown of the element contributing to a modest decrease in deposits, which occurred this quarter, while we further reduce total deposit cost. Third quarter is seasonally our weakest period with respect to retail deposit flows, as customers tend to spend more during the summer months. In addition, we continue to improve the mix of our deposit base, as higher-cost time deposits decreased by $154 million. 
Larger deposit gathering opportunities in front of us relate to increasing our deposit mix in favor of both retail and commercial non-interest-bearing deposits and better utilization of the recently acquired branches in New York. I am encouraged to see that we experienced DDA growth of 11% year-over-year, excluding the recently acquired branches in New York, and have seen good activity with respect to new account openings in the recently acquired branches. 
Slide 9 shows that we continue to make progress on loan and deposit growth on a per-share basis, while maintaining excellent asset quality. We know that if we grow loans and deposits per share, increase fee income and continue to reduce cost, we will produce greater recurring earnings per share.  Over the past 2 years, loans per share and deposits per share have grown at a compound annual rate of 21% and 20%, respectively. 
Slide 10 provides a breakout of non-interest income, which increased $5.7 million from the second quarter. The income areas that demonstrate a momentum included loan prepayment fees and seasonally strong insurance, which increased $2.5 million and $2.3 million, respectively. Gain on sale of residential mortgages posted another strong quarter, producing income of $3.6 million, up $800,000 from last quarter and equal to first quarter levels. Other areas of strength included operating lease income and bank service charges, which were largely offset by weaker brokerage income. As a reminder, our insurance business is seasonal. The first and third quarters tend to be stronger than the second and fourth quarters. 
On Slide 11, you can see that our non-interest expense base increased to $209 million from $206 million last quarter. During the quarter, we incurred $3.2 million of nonoperating expenses, $2.4 million of which related to the recent branch acquisition and $800,000 related to severance. As we think about non-interest expense, we are focused on the operating non-interest expense base. The third quarter operating expense base was $205.7 million, which included $7.6 million related to the recently acquired branches, and was up from $202.1 million last quarter. The impact of the recently acquired branches is partially offset by lower compensation and benefit, as well as professional and outside service reductions, which declined $1.3 million and $1.7 million, respectively. 
Clearly, we are able to make better-than-anticipated progress and expense control this quarter. As a result, we now anticipate full year 2012 operating expenses to be in the range of $815 million to $820 million, as opposed to our prior guidance of a $825 million to $830 million.  We remain committed to continuing to bring the absolute expense levels down while we grow revenues. 
On Slide 12, we provide the historical perspective on our efficiency ratio. Since first quarter 2010, we significantly improved our operating leverage, as can be seen in our much improved efficiency ratio, which has declined from 76.1% to 61.4% this quarter or 15%. This quarter, we absorbed an additional $6.9 million of operating expenses associated with the recently acquired branches in New York, and still the efficiency ratio improved modestly. 
Slides 13 and 14 are a reminder of our excellent pretty quality. Once again, we did see an improvement in nonperforming assets this quarter from already industry-leading levels. Originated nonperforming assets at 1.59% of originated loans and REO remain well below our peer group and top 50 banks. 
Looking at Slide 16, net charge-offs were 18 basis points compared to 26 basis points last quarter. These levels continue to reflect the minimal loss content in our nonperforming assets, and are well below peers. Over the last 4 quarters, charge-offs against specific reserves represent approximately 52% of total charge-offs. As such, we understand our credit issues, and typically have very few new credit event each quarter. 
On Slide 15, you can see the details for the allowance for loan losses by loan category. A few items to note. Our allowance for loan losses to commercial loans is 1.22%, with a coverage ratio of 82% of commercial NPLs. As we have stated previously, we have a strict loan loss allowance methodology, which is consistently applied. That said, mix shift and new originations can result in modest changes in the overall coverage ratio in any given quarter. The provision for loan losses this quarter of $15.1 million reflects $9.4 million in net charge-offs, including $4.8 million with previously established specific reserves, $5.7 million for acquired loans impairment and $4.8 million associated with loan growth. As we said earlier, overall, we remain confident in the credit marks of our acquired portfolios despite the lumpiness of both costs, recovery income and impairment, as individual loans and our pools reached the end of their lives. 
Now I'll pass it back to Jack."

On Slide 16, you can see our operating return on average assets for the third quarter was 91 basis points, down slightly from the last quarter. However, these metrics does not reflect how we feel about our progress. The strong loan growth momentum and efficiency ratio improvement, while absorbing a full quarter of expenses associated with the recently acquired branches in New York. 
It is important to reflect upon the progress that we have made since the management changed in the second quarter of 2010. We have strengthened the earnings power of the franchise through the additions of key personnel, expansion of business lines and through a thoughtful deployment of capital. We have also absorbed the negative impact of regulatory reform, related high cost of compliance, the impact of a prolonged low interest rate environment and a weak economic recovery. Through all of this, we have seen strong improvement in our return on average assets, and improved performance so that we are now performing at the same level as our peers. 
Slide 17 illustrates the improvement in our return on average tangible equity with the low levels -- from the low levels of 2010. We expect to see continued improvements in this metric as we improve profitability and thoughtfully deploy capital. Still, our significant capital levels remain approximately 370 basis points over peers on a tangible common equity, tangible asset basis. Normalizing our equity base to be consistent with our peers shows that the bank is performing well with a return on average tangible equity of 12.3%. 
Slide 18 illustrates our substantial progress since 2010 on a dividend payout ratio. We expect progress to continue in the quarters ahead on the improved profitability and continued share repurchase activity. 
On Slide 19, we see that capital levels at the holding company and the bank remain very strong, with our tangible common equity ratio at 11.2% and Tier 1 common at 13.6%, which compares well to our peers at 7.8% and 10.7% as of the second quarter, respectively. 
We have spent some time with the Basel III proposal released on June 7, 2012. We currently estimate that the Basel III proposal will negatively impact our risk-based capital ratios by anywhere from 50 to 100 basis points on an as-proposed or fully phased in basis. While we have studied the release, it is important to remember that the regulations are proposed at this point, and some sections are still subject to revision and interpretation. 
Our game plan for successfully navigating the low interest rate and the slow economic growth environment continues to include growing loans and deposits, maintaining discipline on all asset repricing, lowering the cost of funds, lowering absolute expenses, growing fee income, maintaining excellent credit quality and maintaining our conservative position within the investment portfolio. Our robust pipelines in the strong originated loan growth contribute to the continued momentum of our franchise. The strength of our platform continues to allow us to attract and retain exceptional talent and provides a substantial, sustainable, competitive advantage. 
This concludes our presentation. Now we'll be happy to answer any questions that you all have. Operator, we are ready for questions."

So we're very pleased with the momentum of the team. As additional cover around that, the gentleman that we hired, the executive to lead that group, is also managing all of our New York commercial real estate effort. And so we have, for instance, moved in the Long Island commercial real estate group under his supervision. And he's had the time to spend with them on that portfolio, recognized customers that he's dealt with before to build on those relationships. And then, we've had a number of folks we've mentioned in the past that we've made many deals in New York City and have relationships from the legacy People's United Connecticut franchise. And we have taken that portfolio and the relationship managers there and moved them into that group, too.

In terms of the first question on the funding, we really haven't changed much in terms of strategy. Third quarter is seasonally always our lightest quarter. Our lowest point in terms of deposits intends to build from there. And what we did see during the quarter certainly was continued good loan activity. And probably as we go forward, I think there's a possibility, if we continue to have real good loan activity, then it could outstrip our deposit growth. If that occurred, we could continue to see some modest increase in borrowing. But as far as the third quarter goes, a lot of that is just normal seasonal liquidity."

And I think in terms of where it's going, the continued growth, we've been encouraged that it continued to add new customers on, new clients. And that well, we believe we'll continue to see the overall customer base expand some. On the other hand, over time, I think utilization rates will revert more back to the norm."
