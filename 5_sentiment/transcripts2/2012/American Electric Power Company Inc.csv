I think from an overall we've viewpoint, AEP has done very well in terms of financial performance. 
We delivered GAAP ongoing earnings of $0.80 a share, which is positive, given the significant headwinds of the mild weather, low natural gas prices impacts and also systems sales any Ohio customer switch. The story demonstrates the value of the diversity of AEP service footprint and our ability to control costs to respond to these headwinds. 
Industrials continue to improve. Although our commercial and residential still struggle, I think it's an indication of the economy and how much of an issue it is with the recovery of the economy at this point in time. And I think as we progress, though, there's some fundamentals within AEP service territory, primary metals and oil and gas activity, that are contributing to positive success for our territories. 
With that said, we can't reaffirm guidance because of the significant area of risk involving the Ohio situation and the transition to competition, which I'll discuss in more detail a little bit later. 
With the Ohio risk, we're still committed to our long-term strategy we set up for you on February 10, namely movements to competitive environment. We'll continue to move to that competitive environment in Ohio. We're embracing it. We support it with the corporate separation that goes along with it and the formation of our competitive generation in retail and marketing functions. 
Our investment, our regulated businesses, obviously, will continue as well. Our focus on the growth aspects and repositioning of the company around transmission and other growth areas will be significant. The dividend strength is still provided and secured by the regulated businesses. And we have a continued commitment to the 4% to 6% long-term earnings growth rate that we've discussed in February 10. 
The transformation regeneration resources, in response to the market and EPA mandates, is going to be an opportunity for us because we will deploy capital to do that, and we've seen the latest EPA rules, and Mark McCullough and our generation area certainly has worked out a capital path that makes sense for us going forward. 
So we have made progress in the first quarter on several fronts. On March 7, we issued $800 million of TCC transition funding bonds and attractive average interest rate of 2.28%, which compares favorably to similar recently priced deals. Proceeds in the bond issue were used to fund the capital program, reduce TCC debt and contribute to the pension, which is now 90% funded. 
On March 8, we completed the acquisition of BlueStar Energy, the retail organization based in Chicago. It participates in deregulated retail markets and provides energy services, such as DSM top activities. Integration of BlueStar with AEP retail is progressing very well and is on schedule, and we now have over 100,000 customers and growing quickly in that area. 
I'm pleased with the progress in our reposition of the Transmission business. Earnings from transmission continue to improve and with the recently announced Transource JV with power lot Great Plains Energy and our continued formation with Transource in our service territory, we continue to deliver more near-term projects to achieve the critical mass for future growth. 
Transource is an addition to the capital plan. We believe that it was a great project for us. It shows that critical mass in near-term on the joint venture. Although there's not much spend in the first 2 years, it really does pick up in '14, '15, '16. So that graph that we provided for you back in February that had sort of a dampened look toward the later years, as we represented, was really based upon firm, known projects with little risk, and we wanted to show it that way. And now, with the addition of Transource, you're going to see that portion of it sort of kick up in those later years as shown in that graph. 
So that's important for us to start that critical mass and see that transmission investment continue to grow. The reason why we did the Transource deal was to pursue competitive transmission development projects in the advent of order 1,000 for certainly wanted to set the tone for a comparative transmission going forward. And it was important for us to really put together an engine for that future growth. 
And we saw, certainly, from the Great Plains perspective, a near-term project that could provide ability for us to put that critical mass in place and really give us an advantage going forward in the marketplace and the competitive access area. And it also is on the interface of MISO and SPT. So that provides some future prospects for us. And as well, it focuses on other state footprints, like Missouri and Kansas. 
So overall, it's a very good thing. Great Plains is a great partner for us and one that we're happy to have involved with the Transmission business with us. 
Our generation transformation activities continue in response to the market and EPA rules. We now have 4,600 megawatts that will be retired over the time period, really detailed by the EPA rules end of 2014. But that could change based upon the extension years and also could change because the markets. So we're staying pretty flexible when the retirements would actually occur based upon a resolution of some of those issues. 
But the 4,600 megawatts is a little different than the 6,000 megawatts we had mentioned to you previously at the time of the February 10 deal that we had 6,000 megawatts. If you take out 4 and 5, which we've already retired, and then the big Sandy activity, that gets you in the 4,600-megawatt number. 
So -- but the current view is, is that, from a capital standpoint, there's a capital plan worked out, even with the aggressive EPA schedule. And certainly, we want to be able to mitigate cost to our customers as much as we can during this process. So we continue to be active on coming up with legislation that provides for more of a blanket extension of time to really give customers time to make that adjustment. 
And for us, when we retire these plants, the communities involved, the taxes involved, the social economic factors involved, need to be dealt with in a very positive fashion. And by replacing generation, by coming up with other alternatives, these communities can adjust to that. And I think that's important for us, as we deal with an economy that is where it is today. 
Turk construction is now 90% complete. We're moving along very well in that prospect, getting Turk done by the end of the year. And rate cases are being prepared to support that investment as well. 
So I have to admit, while I've been pleased with the progress of transmission, generation and many of our regulated operating company activities, our time has been spent here in the first quarter and before personally consumed by the ongoing events in Ohio, as we move to a competitive environment. 
I'm sure all of you have followed this closely. And I can't talk too much about what's going on because of the ongoing hearings in the capacity case. But without regurgitating the history of the capacity and ESP cases in Ohio, I'll give you my take on the subject. 
This is a case where AEP is asking for what other utilities in Ohio have been previously granted, a fair and reasonable transition to competition that maintains the ability for competitors to compete, but maintains the financial integrity of AEP, while we unwind some of the commitments that have been made, specifically contracts with PJM for support of FRR-related capacity for our customers and the Eastern pool agreement. The agreement that takes the transfer of capacity and energy among the company in the Eastern footprint. 
We need time to unwind those type of arrangements. And those commitments have been made previously with the concurrence of the commission. And certainly, we'd like to unwind those in a very rational way. 
The ESP plan that we filed on March 30 balances the interest of what we believe are the 3 main interest of the commission. We tried to be responsive to the concerns related to the previous stipulation and provide a clear path to competition with basically a hybrid of the approach of the stipulation, but adjusted with more duke like characteristics, such as energy only options, leading to an earlier about 6 months or option and a transition charge to the retail stability wider. So a plan is balanced in these 3 areas. And I'll call it the 3 C's: Customers, competition and the company. 
Customer rates have been adjusted to mitigate the concerns of the low load factor customers with a more moderate application of the rate increases over all classes of customers. And discounted capacity rates have been put in place that allows for competitors to successfully compete. We've shown that customers are indeed switching at the proposed $255 per megawatt day rate. And the company's financial integrity is maintained through the transition period, tied to a utility rate of return that puts us back in the position basically at the December stipulation. 
So if you read visualize a triangle with these 3 areas in each corner, there is a balance. And if you move capacity rates down, you're only lining the packets of the competitors suppliers at either the customer's expense or the company's expense. And if it's at the customers expense, the retail stability writer has to increase causing higher increases in customer rates, and that's probably not a good outcome. And if it's at the company's expense, it's tantamount to taking capacity value that the company is committed for a 3-year period to PJM to run and giving it to competitors to subsidize the acquisition of our customers, which sort of seems a little bit of un-American to me. It's really not competition. It's more a confiscation. 
So there is a balance that has been struck with this plan that I would hope the PUC will support. I know there's been much discussion about AEP's legal options, but I would much rather see this case resolved through the acceptable order of the commission so that we can all move forward with clarity around the execution that we spoke of on February 10. The capacity case is ongoing as we speak, and the procedural schedule for the ESP case has been established that has oral arguments in early July with the decision thereafter. 
So it's been a very good quarter considering the headwinds that exist with the economy, and AEP will remain focused on the execution of the areas we previously mentioned in February 10. Now I'll turn it over to Brian."

This morning, I'll explain the quarter-on-quarter variances to last year's results, provide some color on load and the economy at AEP service territories, give some insight in the coal and gas switching, provide an overview of AEP's capitalization and liquidity, and then get to your questions as quickly as possible. 
Turning to slide 4. For the first quarter of this year, as Nick mentioned, AEP earned $389 million, or $0.80 per share in ongoing earnings, versus $392 million or $0.82 per share for the first quarter of 2011. 
Weather accounted for a negative comparison to last year of $0.12 per share or $87 million. Overall, heating degree days were down 31% versus last year and 29% below normal, as this was the second mildest winter in the last 30 years for the AEP system. 
Customer switching in Ohio accounted for a negative comparison the last year of $0.06 per share or $42 million. This reflects the year-on-year decrease of total retail generation margin and is associated with AEP Ohio's total retail load that had shop by the end of the quarter of 28%. 
As you remember, in Q1 of last year, we were collecting provider of last resort charges in Ohio end of June. The loss of Ohio pool revenues versus last year accounted for a negative quarterly comparison of $0.05 per share or $39 million. 
On the positive side, Transmission Operations contributed a positive $0.01 per share or $5 million. This reflects increased earnings from Electric Transmission Texas. You will continue to see growth in investment and earnings from ETT and our Transcos, as we put dollars to work to enhance reliability and system efficiency for our customers. 
Rate changes reflecting increased investment in our regulated utility operations accounted for a positive comparison to last year's first quarter of $0.08 per share or $63 million. 
Finally, operations and maintenance reductions accounted for a positive comparison to the first quarter of last year of $0.11 per share or $80 million. This reflects a combination of spending discipline in the face of weather and other earnings challenges, as well as the reversal of a regulatory obligation that was previously recorded. 
Turning to Slide 5, you will see that our weather-normalized residential and commercial sales were lower than prior year, while our industrial sector continues to show improvement, as Nick stated earlier. Overall, weather-normalized sales were down 0.4% for the quarter, reversing a 7-quarter positive trend that was largely driven by the increase in industrial sales. Although our residential and commercial sales were down for the quarter, a number of economic indicators are showing improvement within our service territory. 
First, the economy and AP service territory is growing faster than the U.S. economy and faster than it did in 2011. Real GDP growth for AEP service territory in the first quarter of 2012 is estimated at 4.4% compared to estimated U.S. growth of 2.2%. AEP's 4.4% growth compares favorably to that of the first quarter of 2011 of 2.8%. 
In addition, the unemployment rate in AEP service territory is lower than it's been since the start of the recession at 7.9% and lower than the U.S. unemployment rate for the quarter of 8.2%. 
We noted that earlier this week, the 4-week moving average for U.S. unemployment claims rose slightly. We hope this is not a new trend for an economy that is being shown signs of improvement. 
The employment growth rate for AEP's footprint was better in the first quarter of this year than it was for all of last year, with employment growth in the West part of our seen system at 2.3%, beating the U.S. rate of 2.1%. 
Employment growth for the quarter in the East part of our system was only 1.5%, but still exceeded the growth rate for the region for last year. Contrary to this positive economic data, we should note that the AEP's combined East territory residential customer count was down 0.2% for the quarter, but that was more than offset by a combined West residential customer count that increased 0.6%. 
We are hopeful that the economic outlook will continue to improve and translate into improved electricity sales in the near term. 
Turning to Slide 6, we are looking at the top 5 sectors in our industrial customer class. Primary metals, AEP's largest industrial sector, is up 4% for the quarter-on-quarter period. If you exclude Ormet, our largest customer, which returned the full production in the first quarter of last year, primary metals were up 1.2% quarter-on-quarter. 
Chemicals and mining were both down for the quarter, but both sectors have shown quarter-to-quarter volatility throughout the recovery. The paper industry, as a whole, has been slowly declining over the past several years. As more aspects of our daily life become paperless, this trend is likely to continue. 
In addition of the sectors depicted on this slide the transportation equipment manufacturing sector, AEP's seventh largest, is up 5.5% quarter-on-quarter and is being driven by improvements from a number of customers located primarily in the Indiana and Michigan and SWEPCO service territories. This corresponds with the fact that U.S. auto sales in the first quarter were the highest they've been since before the recession. 
The oil and gas extraction sector, AEP's ninth largest industrial sector, is up 6.7% quarter-on-quarter and is being driven by developments in the shale gas areas of our service territory, primarily the Eagle Ford development and Texas and the Marcellus development in the East. These increases are coming mostly from gas processing facilities, some of which have come online and others of which are still in development.
Turning to Slide 7, I want to talk a little bit about the coal to cash generation switching that has occurred on AEP system and the outlook for the future. 
First, it is easier to see that coal-fired net capacity factors had decreased, while gas-fired net capacity factors had increase. This result is more pronounced in the East part of our system, where natural gas capacity is 14% of the total versus the West, where it is 62%. 
In the East, net capacity factors for natural gas units increased to 47% in the first quarter of 2012 from 22% in the first quarter of last year. Coal-fired net capacity factors correspondingly had dropped to 47% from 61%. The result is even more pronounced when we focus on our East combined cycle plants, which reached net capacity factors of 78% in the first quarter of this year, up from just 17% from the same period last year. 
If you were to exclude the new judgment combined cycle facility, which came online at the end of January of this year, the East combined cycle capacity factor climbs to 85%. East combined cycle generation increased fully 149% quarter-on-quarter. 
So what does all these mean? With our East combined cycle fleet operating at such a high capacity factor, we would expect the rate of coal to gas switching to remain about the same through the balance of the year. That is, most of our combined cycle gas units are running close to flat out. 
With our gas consumption and cash generation up, and of the mild weather that we've experienced, our coal inventories have climbed to 45 days full burn inventory at the end of the quarter from 39 days at the end of last year. We expect inventories decline over the second quarter. And just as we manage our inventories during the recession, we'll continue to do so now. All of that being said, our coal needs for 2012 are fully hedged and our needs for 2013 are about 80% met.
Slide 8. Let's take a look at the company's capitalization and liquidity measures. First, GAAP total debt to total capitalization remained unchanged from last quarter at 55.3%, But the quality event metric has improved, as we added $800 million of AAA rated debt to the balance sheet, as we executed our Texas Central securitized debt offering in March. 
Securitization financing reduced costs to TCC's customers versus traditional financing and brought a significant cash contributions to AEP. In addition, in February, SWEPCO issued a $275 million 10-year unsecured note at an attractive rate of 3.55%. 
Second, at the end of the first quarter, our credit metrics remained solidly BBB. AEP's FFO to interest coverage stands at 4.7x and our FFO to total debt is at 20%. During the quarter, fixed reaffirmed AEP's ratings and Moody's reviewed and left unchanged their ratings for the company and several subsidiaries. 
Turning to liquidity. Our sources included our core revolving credit facilities and cash on hand, which together, totaled approximately $3.5 billion. Our uses of liquidity include a commercial paper and letters of credit, which together, totaled approximately $500 million. When netted against one another, the company's liquidity at the end of first quarter was nearly $3 billion. 
Lastly, our pension obligation was funded at 90% at the end of the first quarter. This is an improvement from 86% funded at the end of the year in 2011. As our pension funding approaches 100% through improved investment returns and pass significant corporate contributions, we are derisking the investment portfolio. 
At the 90% funded level, our portfolio asset targets are 40% equities, 10% alternative investments and 50% fixed Income. 
As you can see, the platform is strong, as we see positive ESP order and transition to retail competition in Ohio. As Nick noted earlier, due to uncertain in Ohio regulatory outlook, we are unable to affirm our previous earnings guidance for 2012 at this time. 
As a management team, we are committed to an earnings growth rate of 4% to 6% and a dividend level supported by our regulated earnings. 
Thank you for listening today. And with that, Linda, I'll turn it back over to you to take questions."

So that gives us some optionality in terms of how the units are operated during the year. And then in terms of retirements, we're looking at the dates associated with those as well. You have the -- and really, it's a question of whether you need the capacity and does it stay online into 2014 or 2015 or even 2016? But if the gas market is lower and capacity becomes available, then we'd definitely look at those options as well. So we are looking at, on a regular basis, on what those options can be. I was just saying that in the worst case, it appears that we're okay from a capital perspective. And then, if we do get extensions, or if we decide to convert to gas in some fashion, with gas burners or whatever, we'll have that optionality to do it. So really, it's a capacity and energy question."

We delivered GAAP o",1820,"Thanks, Chuck, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today on AEP's First Quarter 2012 Earnings Call. It has been a great quarter for us, I think. From an overall viewpoint, AEP has done very well in terms of financial performance. 
We delivered GAAP ongoing earnings of $0.80 a share, which is positive, given some significant headwinds of the mild weather, low natural gas prices impacts on all systems sales and the Ohio customer switch. The story demonstrates the value of the diversity of AEP's service footprint and our ability to control costs to respond to these headwinds. 
Industrials continue to improve, while commercial and residential still struggle. I think it's an indication of the economy and how much of an issue it is with the recovery of the economy at this point in time. And I think as we progress, though, there's some fundamentals within AEP's service territory, primary metals and oil and gas activity, that are contributing to positive success for our territories. 
With that said, we can't reaffirm guidance because of the significant area of risk involving the Ohio situation and the transition to competition, which I'll discuss in more detail a little bit later. 
With the Ohio risk, we're still committed to our long-term strategy we've set out for you on February 10 namely: Movement to competitive environment, we will continue to move to that competitive environment in Ohio. We're embracing it. We support it with the corporate separation that goes along with it and the formation of our competitive generation in retail and marketing functions. 
Our investment, our regulated businesses, obviously, will continue as well. Our focus on the growth aspects and repositioning of the company around transmission and other growth areas will be significant. The dividend strength is still provided and secured by the regulated businesses. And we have a continued commitment to the 4% to 6% long-term earnings growth rate that we've discussed in February 10. 
The transformation regeneration resources, in response to the market and EPA mandates, is going to be an opportunity for us because we will deploy capital to do that, and we've seen the latest EPA rules, and Mark McCullough and our generation area certainly has worked out a capital path that makes sense for us going forward. 
So we have made progress in the first quarter on several fronts. On March 7, we issued $800 million of TCC transition funding bonds, an attractive average interest rate of 2.28%, which compared favorably to similar recently priced deals. Proceeds of the bond issue were used to fund the capital program, reduce TCC debt and contribute to the pension, which is now 90% funded. 
On March 8, we completed the acquisition of BlueStar Energy, the retail organization based in Chicago that participates in deregulated retail markets and provides energy services such as DSM-topped activities. Integration of BlueStar with AEP retail is progressing very well and is on schedule, and we now have over 100,000 customers and growing quickly in that area. 
I'm pleased with the progress in our reposition of the transmission business. Earnings from transmission continue to improve, and with the recently announced Transource JV with Kansas City Power & Light, Great Plains Energy, and our continued formation with Transco's in our service territory, we continue to deliver more near-term projects to achieve the critical mass for future growth. 
Transource is an addition to the capital plan. We believe that it was a great project for us. It shows that critical mass in near-term on the joint venture, although there's not much spend in the first 2 years. It really does pick up in '14, '15, '16. So that graph that we provided for you back in February that had sort of a dampened look toward the later years, as we represented, was really based upon firm, known projects with little risk, and we wanted to show it that way. And now, with the addition of Transource, you're going to see that portion of it sort of kick up in those later years that is shown in that graph. 
So that's important for us to start that critical mass and see that transmission investment continue to grow. The reason why we did the Transource deal was to pursue competitive transmission development projects in the advent of order 1,000 for -- certainly wanted to set the tone for a comparative transmission going forward, and it was important for us to really put together an engine for that future growth. 
And we saw, certainly, from the Great Plains perspective, a near-term project that could provide an ability for us to put that critical mass in place and really give us an advantage going forward in the marketplace in the competitive access area. And it also is on the interface of MISO and SPT, so that provides some future prospects for us. And as well, it focuses on other state footprints like Missouri and Kansas. 
So overall, it was a very good thing. Great Plains is a great partner for us and one that we're happy to have involved with the transmission business with us. 
Our generation transformation activities continue into the market in EPA rules. We now have 4,600 megawatts that'll be retired over a time period, really detailed by the EPA rules end of 2014. But that could change based upon the extension years and also could change because of the markets. So we're staying pretty flexible when the retirements would actually occur based upon a resolution of some of those issues. 
But the 4,600 megawatts is a little different than the 6,000 megawatts we had mentioned to you previously at the time of the February 10 deal that we had 6,000 megawatts. If you take out 4 and 5, which we've already retired, and then the big Sandy activity, that gets you in the 4,600-megawatt number. 
So -- but the current view is, is that, from a capital standpoint, there's a capital plan worked out, even with the aggressive EPA schedule. And certainly, we want to be able to mitigate costs to our customers as much as we can during this process. So we continue to be active on coming up with legislation that provides for more of a blanket extension of time to really give customers time to make that adjustment. 
And for us, when we retire these plants, the communities involved, the taxes involved, the socio-economic factors involved need to be dealt with in a very positive fashion. And by replacing generation, by coming up with other alternatives, these communities can adjust to that. And I think that's important for us as we deal with an economy that is where it is today. 
Turk construction is now 90% complete. We're moving along very well in that prospect, getting Turk done by the end of the year. And rate cases are being prepared to support that investment as well. 
So I have to admit, while I've been pleased with the progress of transmission, generation and many of our regulated operating company activities, our time has been spent here in the first quarter and before personally consumed by the ongoing events in Ohio, as we move to a competitive environment. 
I'm sure all of you have followed this closely. And I can't talk too much about what's going on because of the ongoing hearings in the capacity case, but without regurgitating the history of the capacity and ESP cases in Ohio, I'll give you my take on the subject. 
This is a case where AEP is asking for what other utilities in Ohio have been previously granted, a fair and reasonable transition to competition that maintains the ability for competitors to compete, but maintains the financial integrity of AEP while we unwind some of the commitments that have been made, specifically contracts with PJM for support of FRR-related capacity for our customers and the eastern pool agreement. The agreement that takes the transfer of capacity and energy among the company is in our eastern footprint. 
We need time to unwind those type of arrangements. And those commitments have been made previously with the concurrence of the commission, and certainly, we'd like to unwind those in a very rational way. 
The ESP plan that we filed on March 30 balances the interest of what we believe are the 3 main interests of the commission. We tried to be responsive to the concerns related to the previous stipulation and provide a clear path to competition with basically a hybrid of the approach of the stipulation, but adjusted with more duke-like characteristics, such as energy-only options, leading to an earlier, about 6 months, full option and a transition charge to the retail stability writer. So our plan is balanced in these 3 areas, and I'll call it the 3 C's: Customers, competition and the company. 
Customer rates have been adjusted to mitigate the concerns of the low-load factor customers with a more moderate application of the rate increases over all classes of customers. And discounted capacity rates have been put in place that allows for competitors to successfully compete. We've shown that customers are indeed switching at the proposed $255 per megawatt day rate. And the company's financial integrity is maintained through the transition period, tied to a utility rate of return that puts us back into position basically at the December stipulation. 
So if you visualize a triangle with these 3 areas in each corner, there is a balance. And if you move capacity rates down, you're only lining the pockets of the competitor suppliers at either the customer's expense or the company's expense. And if it's at the customers expense, the retail stability writer has to increase, causing higher increases in customer rates, and that's probably not a good outcome. And if it's at the company's expense, it's tantamount to taking capacity value that the company is committed for a 3-year period to PJM to run and giving it to competitors to subsidize the acquisition of our customers, which sort of seems a little bit un-American to me. It's really not competition, it's more a confiscation. 
So there is a balance that has been struck with this plan that I would hope the PUC will support. I know there has been much discussion about AEP's legal options, but I would much rather see this case resolved through the acceptable order of the commission so that we can all move forward with clarity around the execution that we spoke of on February 10. The capacity case is ongoing as we speak and the procedural schedule for the ESP case has been established that has oral arguments in early July with a decision thereafter. 
So it's been a very good quarter considering the headwinds that exists with the economy, and AEP will remain focused on the execution of the areas we've previously mentioned in February 10. Now I'll turn it over to Brian."

This morning, I'll explain the quarter-on-quarter variances to last year's results, provide some color on load and the economy at AEP service territories, give some insight into coal and gas switching, provide an overview of AEP's capitalization and liquidity, and then get to your questions as quickly as possible. 
Turning to slide 4. For the first quarter of this year, as Nick mentioned, AEP earned $389 million, or $0.80 per share in ongoing earnings versus $392 million or $0.82 per share for the first quarter of 2011. 
Weather accounted for a negative comparison to last year of $0.12 per share or $87 million. Overall, heating degree days were down 31% versus last year and 29% below normal, as this was the second mildest winter in the last 30 years for the AEP system. 
Customer switching in Ohio accounted for a negative comparison the last year of $0.06 per share or $42 million. This reflects a year-on-year decrease of total retail generation margin and is associated with AEP Ohio's total retail load that had shop by the end of the quarter of 28%. 
As you remember, in Q1 of last year, we were collecting provider of last resort charges in Ohio end of June. The loss of Ohio pool of revenues versus last year accounted for a negative quarterly comparison of $0.05 per share or $39 million. 
On the positive side, Transmission Operations contributed a positive $0.01 per share or $5 million. This reflects increased earnings from Electric Transmission Texas. You will continue to see growth in investment and earnings from ETT and our Transcos, as we put dollars to work to enhance reliability and system efficiency for our customers. 
Rate changes reflecting increased investment in our regulated utility operations accounted for a positive comparison to last year's first quarter of $0.08 per share or $63 million. 
Finally, operations and maintenance reductions accounted for a positive comparison to the first quarter of last year of $0.11 per share or $80 million. This reflects a combination of spending discipline in the face of weather and other earnings challenges, as well as the reversal of a regulatory obligation that was previously recorded. 
Turning to Slide 5, you will see that our weather-normalized residential and commercial sales were lower than prior year, while our industrial sector continues to show improvement, as Nick stated earlier. Overall, weather-normalized sales were down 0.4% for the quarter, reversing a 7-quarter positive trend that was largely driven by the increase in industrial sales. Although our residential and commercial sales were down for the quarter, a number of economic indicators are showing improvement within our service territory. 
First, the economy and AP service territory is growing faster than the U.S. economy and faster than it did in 2011. Real GDP growth for AEP service territory in the first quarter of 2012 is estimated at 4.4% compared to estimated U.S. growth of 2.2%. AEP's 4.4% growth compares favorably to that of the first quarter of 2011 of 2.8%. 
In addition, the unemployment rate in AEP service territory is lower than it's been since the start of the recession at 7.9%, and lower than the U.S. unemployment rate for the quarter of 8.2%. 
We noted that earlier this week, the 4-week moving average for U.S. unemployment claims rose slightly. We hope this is not a new trend for an economy that has been showing signs of improvement. 
The employment growth rate for AEP's footprint was better in the first quarter of this year than it was for all of last year, with employment growth in the West part of our seen system at 2.3%, beating the U.S. rate of 2.1%. 
Employment growth for the quarter in the East part of our system was only 1.5%, but still exceeded the growth rate for the region for last year. Contrary to this positive economic data, we should note that AEP's combined east territory's residential customer count was down 0.2% for the quarter, but that was more than offset by a combined west residential customer count that increased 0.6%. 
We are hopeful that the economic outlook will continue to improve and translate into improved electricity sales in the near term. 
Turning to Slide 6, we're looking at the top 5 sectors in our industrial customer class. Primary metals, AEP's largest industrial sector, is up 4% for the quarter-on-quarter period. If you exclude Ormet, our largest customer, which returned to full production in the first quarter of last year, primary metals were up 1.2% quarter-on-quarter. 
Chemicals and mining were both down for the quarter, but both sectors have shown quarter-to-quarter volatility throughout the recovery. The paper industry, as a whole, has been slowly declining over the past several years. As more aspects of our daily life become paperless, this trend is likely to continue. 
In addition of the sectors depicted on this slide, the transportation equipment manufacturing sector, AEP's seventh largest, is up 5.5% quarter-on-quarter and is being driven by improvements from a number of customers located primarily in the Indiana and Michigan and SWEPCO service territories. This corresponds with the fact that U.S. auto sales in the first quarter were the highest they've been since before the recession. 
The oil and gas extraction sector, AEP's ninth largest industrial sector, is up 6.7% quarter-on-quarter and is being driven by developments in the shale gas areas of our service territory, primarily the Eagle Ford development in Texas and the Marcellus development in the east. These increases are coming mostly from gas processing facilities, some of which have come online and others of which are still in development.
Turning to Slide 7, I want to talk a little bit about the coal-to-gas generation switching that has occurred on AEP system and the outlook for the future. 
First, it is easy to see that coal-fired net capacity factors had decreased, while gas-fired net capacity factors have increase. This result is more pronounced in the east part of our system, where natural gas capacity is 14% of the total versus the west, where it is 62%. 
In the east, net capacity factors for natural gas units increased to 47% in the first quarter of 2012 from 22% in the first quarter of last year. Coal-fired net capacity factors correspondingly had dropped to 47% from 61%. The result is even more pronounced when we focused on our east combined cycle plants, which reached net capacity factors of 78% in the first quarter of this year, up from just 17% from the same period last year. 
If you were to exclude the new just [ph] and combined cycle facility, which came online at the end of January of this year, the east combined cycle capacity factor climbs to 85%. East combined cycle generation increased fully 149% quarter-on-quarter. 
So what does all this mean? With our east combined cycle fleet operating at such a high capacity factor, we would expect the rate of coal-to-gas switching to remain about the same through the balance of the year. That is, most of our combined cycle gas units are running close to flat out. 
With our gas consumption and cash generation up, and with the mild weather that we've experienced, our coal inventories have climbed to 45 days full burn inventory at the end of the quarter from 39 days at the end of last year. We expect inventories to climb over the second quarter. And just as we manage our inventories during the recession, we'll continue to do so now. All of that being said, our coal needs for 2012 are fully hedged and our needs for 2013 are about 80% met.
Slide 8. Let's take a look at the company's capitalization and liquidity measures. First, GAAP total debt to total capitalization remained unchanged from last quarter at 55.3%, but the quality of that metric has improved as we added $800 million of AAA-rated debt to the balance sheet, as we executed our Texas Central securitized debt offering in March. 
Securitization financing reduced costs to TCC's customers versus traditional financing and brought a significant cash contribution to AEP. In addition, in February, SWEPCO issued a $275 million 10-year unsecured note at an attractive rate of 3.55%. 
Second, at the end of the first quarter, our credit metrics remained solidly BBB. AEP's FFO to interest coverage stands at 4.7x and our FFO to total debt is at 20%. During the quarter, fixed reaffirmed AEP's ratings and Moody's reviewed and left unchanged their ratings for the company and several subsidiaries. 
Turning to liquidity. Our sources included our core revolving credit facilities and cash on hand, which, together, totaled approximately $3.5 billion. Our uses of liquidity include a commercial paper and letters of credit, which, together, totaled approximately $500 million. When netted against one another, the company's liquidity at the end of the first quarter was nearly $3 billion. 
Lastly, our pension obligation was funded at 90% at the end of the first quarter. This is an improvement from 86% funded at the end of the year in 2011. As our pension funding approaches 100% through improved investment returns and past significant corporate contributions, we are derisking the investment portfolio. 
At the 90% funded level, our portfolio asset targets are 40% equities, 10% alternative investments and 50% fixed Income. 
As you can see, the platform is strong, as we seek a positive ESP order and transition to retail competition in Ohio. As Nick noted earlier, due to uncertainty in our Ohio regulatory outlook, we are unable to affirm our previous earnings guidance for 2012 at this time. 
As a management team, we are committed to an earnings growth rate of 4% to 6% and a dividend level supported by our regulated earnings. 
Thank you for listening today. And with that, Linda, I'll turn it back over to you to take questions."

I also believe that if you get a reasonable outcome and the capacity case or a FERC orders in the capacity case, it could bring the parties closer together. And I just think that there are some major milestone precursors there, the capacity rate, in particular, that could have a benefit in terms of bringing the parties together. That's also an opportunity for a quicker solution."

We delivered GAAP o",1822,"Thanks, Chuck, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today on AEP's First Quarter 2012 Earnings Call. It has been a great quarter for us, I think. From an overall viewpoint, AEP has done very well in terms of financial performance. 
We delivered GAAP ongoing earnings of $0.80 a share, which is positive, given some significant headwinds of the mild weather, low natural gas prices impacts on all systems sales and the Ohio customer switch. The story demonstrates the value of the diversity of AEP's service footprint and our ability to control costs to respond to these headwinds. 
Industrials continue to improve, while commercial and residential still struggle. I think it's an indication of the economy and how much of an issue it is with the recovery of the economy at this point in time. And I think as we progress, though, there's some fundamentals within AEP's service territory, primary metals and oil and gas activity, that are contributing to positive success for our territories. 
With that said, we can't reaffirm guidance because of the significant area of risk involving the Ohio situation and the transition to competition, which I'll discuss in more detail a little bit later. 
With the Ohio risk, we're still committed to our long-term strategy we've set out for you on February 10 namely: Movement to competitive environment, we will continue to move to that competitive environment in Ohio. We're embracing it. We support it with the corporate separation that goes along with it and the formation of our competitive generation in retail and marketing functions. 
Our investment, our regulated businesses, obviously, will continue as well. Our focus on the growth aspects and repositioning of the company around transmission and other growth areas will be significant. The dividend strength is still provided and secured by the regulated businesses. And we have a continued commitment to the 4% to 6% long-term earnings growth rate that we've discussed in February 10. 
The transformation or our generation resources, in response to the market and EPA mandates, is going to be an opportunity for us because we will deploy capital to do that, and we've seen the latest EPA rules, and Mark McCullough and our generation area certainly has worked out a capital path that makes sense for us going forward. 
So we have made progress in the first quarter on several fronts. On March 7, we issued $800 million of TCC transition funding bonds, an attractive average interest rate of 2.28%, which compared favorably to similar recently priced deals. Proceeds of the bond issue were used to fund the capital program, reduce TCC debt and contribute to the pension, which is now 90% funded. 
On March 8, we completed the acquisition of BlueStar Energy, the retail organization based in Chicago that participates in deregulated retail markets and provides energy services such as DSM type activities. Integration of BlueStar with AEP retail is progressing very well and is on schedule, and we now have over 100,000 customers and growing quickly in that area. 
I'm pleased with the progress in our reposition of the transmission business. Earnings from transmission continue to improve, and with the recently announced Transource JV with Kansas City Power & Light, Great Plains Energy, and our continued formation with Transco's in our service territory, we continue to deliver more near-term projects to achieve the critical mass for future growth. 
Transource is an addition to the capital plan. We believe that it was a great project for us. It shows that critical mass in near-term on the joint venture, although there's not much spend in the first 2 years. It really does pick up in '14, '15, '16. So that graph that we provided for you back in February that had sort of a dampened look toward the later years, as we represented, was really based upon firm, known projects with little risk, and we wanted to show it that way. And now, with the addition of Transource, you're going to see that portion of it sort of kick up in those later years that is shown in that graph. 
So that's important for us to start that critical mass and see that transmission investment continue to grow. The reason why we did the Transource deal was to pursue competitive transmission development projects in the advent of Order 1,000  for -- certainly wanted to set the tone for a comparative transmission going forward, and it was important for us to really put together an engine for that future growth. 
And we saw, certainly, from the Great Plains perspective, a near-term project that could provide an ability for us to put that critical mass in place and really give us an advantage going forward in the marketplace in the competitive access area. And it also is on the interface of MISO and SPP, so that provides some future prospects for us. And as well, it focuses on other state footprints like Missouri and Kansas. 
So overall, it was a very good thing. Great Plains is a great partner for us and one that we're happy to have involved with the transmission business with us. 
Our generation transformation activities continue into the market in EPA rules. We now have 4,600 megawatts that'll be retired over a time period, really detailed by the EPA rules end of 2014. But that could change based upon the extension years and also could change because of the markets. So we're staying pretty flexible when the retirements would actually occur based upon a resolution of some of those issues. 
But the 4,600 megawatts is a little different than the 6,000 megawatts we had mentioned to you previously at the time of the February 10 deal that we had 6,000 megawatts. If you take out 4 and 5, which we've already retired, and then the Big Sandy activity, that gets you in the 4,600-megawatt number. 
So -- but the current view is, is that, from a capital standpoint, there's a capital plan worked out, even with the aggressive EPA schedule. And certainly, we want to be able to mitigate costs to our customers as much as we can during this process. So we continue to be active on coming up with legislation that provides for more of a blanket extension of time to really give customers time to make that adjustment. 
And for us, when we retire these plants, the communities involved, the taxes involved, the socio-economic factors involved need to be dealt with in a very positive fashion. And by replacing generation, by coming up with other alternatives, these communities can adjust to that. And I think that's important for us as we deal with an economy that is where it is today. 
Turk construction is now 90% complete. We're moving along very well in that prospect, getting Turk done by the end of the year. And rate cases are being prepared to support that investment as well. 
So I have to admit, while I've been pleased with the progress of transmission, generation and many of our regulated operating company activities, our time has been spent here in the first quarter and before personally consumed by the ongoing events in Ohio, as we move to a competitive environment. 
I'm sure all of you have followed this closely. And I can't talk too much about what's going on because of the ongoing hearings in the capacity case, but without regurgitating the history of the capacity and ESP cases in Ohio, I'll give you my take on the subject. 
This is a case where AEP is asking for what other utilities in Ohio have been previously granted, a fair and reasonable transition to competition that maintains the ability for competitors to compete, but maintains the financial integrity of AEP while we unwind some of the commitments that have been made, specifically contracts with PJM for support of FRR-related capacity for our customers and the eastern pool agreement. The agreement that takes the transfer of capacity and energy among the companies in the eastern footprint. 
We need time to unwind those type of arrangements. And those commitments have been made previously with the concurrence of the commission, and certainly, we'd like to unwind those in a very rational way. 
The ESP plan that we filed on March 30 balances the interest of what we believe are the 3 main interests of the commission. We tried to be responsive to the concerns related to the previous stipulation and provide a clear path to competition with basically a hybrid of the approach of the stipulation, but adjusted with more Duke-like characteristics, such as energy-only options, leading to an earlier, about 6 months, full option and a transition charge to the retail stability rider. So our plan is balanced in these 3 areas, and I'll call it the 3 C's: Customers, competition and the company. 
Customer rates have been adjusted to mitigate the concerns of the low-load factor customers with a more moderate application of the rate increases over all classes of customers. And discounted capacity rates have been put in place that allows for competitors to successfully compete. We've shown that customers are indeed switching at the proposed $255 per megawatt day rate. And the company's financial integrity is maintained through the transition period, tied to a utility rate of return that puts us back into position basically at the December stipulation. 
So if you visualize a triangle with these 3 areas in each corner, there is a balance. And if you move capacity rates down, you're only lining the pockets of the competitor suppliers at either the customer's expense or the company's expense. And if it's at the customers' expense, the retail stability rider has to increase, causing higher increases in customer rates, and that's probably not a good outcome. And if it's at the company's expense, it's tantamount to taking capacity value that the company is committed for a 3-year period to PJM to run and giving it to competitors to subsidize the acquisition of our customers, which sort of seems a little bit un-American to me. It's really not competition, it's more a confiscation. 
So there is a balance that has been struck with this plan that I would hope the PUC will support. I know there has been much discussion about AEP's legal options, but I would much rather see this case resolved through the acceptable order of the commission so that we can all move forward with clarity around the execution that we spoke of on February 10. The capacity case is ongoing as we speak and the procedural schedule for the ESP case has been established that has oral arguments in early July with a decision thereafter. 
So it's been a very good quarter considering the headwinds that exists with the economy, and AEP will remain focused on the execution of the areas we've previously mentioned in February 10. Now I'll turn it over to Brian."

This morning, I'll explain the quarter-on-quarter variances to last year's results, provide some color on load and the economy at AEP service territories, give some insight into coal and gas switching, provide an overview of AEP's capitalization and liquidity, and then get to your questions as quickly as possible. 
Turning to slide 4. For the first quarter of this year, as Nick mentioned, AEP earned $389 million, or $0.80 per share in ongoing earnings versus $392 million or $0.82 per share for the first quarter of 2011. 
Weather accounted for a negative comparison to last year of $0.12 per share or $87 million. Overall, heating degree days were down 31% versus last year and 29% below normal, as this was the second mildest winter in the last 30 years for the AEP system. 
Customer switching in Ohio accounted for a negative comparison the last year of $0.06 per share or $42 million. This reflects a year-on-year decrease of total retail generation margin and is associated with AEP Ohio's total retail load that had shop by the end of the quarter of 28%. 
As you remember, in Q1 of last year, we were collecting provider of last resort charges in Ohio end of June. The loss of Ohio pool of revenues versus last year accounted for a negative quarterly comparison of $0.05 per share or $39 million. 
On the positive side, Transmission Operations contributed a positive $0.01 per share or $5 million. This reflects increased earnings from Electric Transmission Texas. You will continue to see growth in investment and earnings from ETT and our Transcos, as we put dollars to work to enhance reliability and system efficiency for our customers. 
Rate changes reflecting increased investment in our regulated utility operations accounted for a positive comparison to last year's first quarter of $0.08 per share or $63 million. 
Finally, operations and maintenance reductions accounted for a positive comparison to the first quarter of last year of $0.11 per share or $80 million. This reflects a combination of spending discipline in the face of weather and other earnings challenges, as well as the reversal of a regulatory obligation that was previously recorded. 
Turning to Slide 5, you will see that our weather-normalized residential and commercial sales were lower than prior year, while our industrial sector continues to show improvement, as Nick stated earlier. Overall, weather-normalized sales were down 0.4% for the quarter, reversing a 7-quarter positive trend that was largely driven by the increase in industrial sales. Although our residential and commercial sales were down for the quarter, a number of economic indicators are showing improvement within our service territory. 
First, the economy and AP service territory is growing faster than the U.S. economy and faster than it did in 2011. Real GDP growth for AEP service territory in the first quarter of 2012 is estimated at 4.4% compared to estimated U.S. growth of 2.2%. AEP's 4.4% growth compares favorably to that of the first quarter of 2011 of 2.8%. 
In addition, the unemployment rate in AEP service territory is lower than it's been since the start of the recession at 7.9%, and lower than the U.S. unemployment rate for the quarter of 8.2%. 
We noted that earlier this week, the 4-week moving average for U.S. unemployment claims rose slightly. We hope this is not a new trend for an economy that has been showing signs of improvement. 
The employment growth rate for AEP's footprint was better in the first quarter of this year than it was for all of last year, with employment growth in the West part of our seen system at 2.3%, beating the U.S. rate of 2.1%. 
Employment growth for the quarter in the East part of our system was only 1.5%, but still exceeded the growth rate for the region for last year. Contrary to this positive economic data, we should note that AEP's combined east territory's residential customer count was down 0.2% for the quarter, but that was more than offset by a combined west residential customer count that increased 0.6%. 
We are hopeful that the economic outlook will continue to improve and translate into improved electricity sales in the near term. 
Turning to Slide 6, we're looking at the top 5 sectors in our industrial customer class. Primary metals, AEP's largest industrial sector, is up 4% for the quarter-on-quarter period. If you exclude Ormet, our largest customer, which returned to full production in the first quarter of last year, primary metals were up 1.2% quarter-on-quarter. 
Chemicals and mining were both down for the quarter, but both sectors have shown quarter-to-quarter volatility throughout the recovery. The paper industry, as a whole, has been slowly declining over the past several years. As more aspects of our daily life become paperless, this trend is likely to continue. 
In addition of the sectors depicted on this slide, the transportation equipment manufacturing sector, AEP's seventh largest, is up 5.5% quarter-on-quarter and is being driven by improvements from a number of customers located primarily in the Indiana and Michigan and SWEPCO service territories. This corresponds with the fact that U.S. auto sales in the first quarter were the highest they've been since before the recession. 
The oil and gas extraction sector, AEP's ninth largest industrial sector, is up 6.7% quarter-on-quarter and is being driven by developments in the shale gas areas of our service territory, primarily the Eagle Ford development in Texas and the Marcellus development in the east. These increases are coming mostly from gas processing facilities, some of which have come online and others of which are still in development.
Turning to Slide 7, I want to talk a little bit about the coal-to-gas generation switching that has occurred on AEP system and the outlook for the future. 
First, it is easy to see that coal-fired net capacity factors had decreased, while gas-fired net capacity factors have increase. This result is more pronounced in the east part of our system, where natural gas capacity is 14% of the total versus the west, where it is 62%. 
In the east, net capacity factors for natural gas units increased to 47% in the first quarter of 2012 from 22% in the first quarter of last year. Coal-fired net capacity factors correspondingly had dropped to 47% from 61%. The result is even more pronounced when we focused on our east combined cycle plants, which reached net capacity factors of 78% in the first quarter of this year, up from just 17% from the same period last year. 
If you were to exclude the new just [ph] and combined cycle facility, which came online at the end of January of this year, the east combined cycle capacity factor climbs to 85%. East combined cycle generation increased fully 149% quarter-on-quarter. 
So what does all this mean? With our east combined cycle fleet operating at such a high capacity factor, we would expect the rate of coal-to-gas switching to remain about the same through the balance of the year. That is, most of our combined cycle gas units are running close to flat out. 
With our gas consumption and cash generation up, and with the mild weather that we've experienced, our coal inventories have climbed to 45 days full burn inventory at the end of the quarter from 39 days at the end of last year. We expect inventories to climb over the second quarter. And just as we manage our inventories during the recession, we'll continue to do so now. All of that being said, our coal needs for 2012 are fully hedged and our needs for 2013 are about 80% met.
Slide 8. Let's take a look at the company's capitalization and liquidity measures. First, GAAP total debt to total capitalization remained unchanged from last quarter at 55.3%, but the quality of that metric has improved as we added $800 million of AAA-rated debt to the balance sheet, as we executed our Texas Central securitized debt offering in March. 
Securitization financing reduced costs to TCC's customers versus traditional financing and brought a significant cash contribution to AEP. In addition, in February, SWEPCO issued a $275 million 10-year unsecured note at an attractive rate of 3.55%. 
Second, at the end of the first quarter, our credit metrics remained solidly BBB. AEP's FFO to interest coverage stands at 4.7x and our FFO to total debt is at 20%. During the quarter, fixed reaffirmed AEP's ratings and Moody's reviewed and left unchanged their ratings for the company and several subsidiaries. 
Turning to liquidity. Our sources included our core revolving credit facilities and cash on hand, which, together, totaled approximately $3.5 billion. Our uses of liquidity include a commercial paper and letters of credit, which, together, totaled approximately $500 million. When netted against one another, the company's liquidity at the end of the first quarter was nearly $3 billion. 
Lastly, our pension obligation was funded at 90% at the end of the first quarter. This is an improvement from 86% funded at the end of the year in 2011. As our pension funding approaches 100% through improved investment returns and past significant corporate contributions, we are derisking the investment portfolio. 
At the 90% funded level, our portfolio asset targets are 40% equities, 10% alternative investments and 50% fixed Income. 
As you can see, the platform is strong, as we seek a positive ESP order and transition to retail competition in Ohio. As Nick noted earlier, due to uncertainty in our Ohio regulatory outlook, we are unable to affirm our previous earnings guidance for 2012 at this time. 
As a management team, we are committed to an earnings growth rate of 4% to 6% and a dividend level supported by our regulated earnings.

The procedural schedule is set so that due process could be given to all the parties. But we also know that there is plenty of information that's already been provided throughout the entire case. So I don't think there's anything new. Anybody's going to turn over. There's no new rock uncovered here. So it could give the ability to move along more quickly. I think that -- I'm actually optimistic that the schedule will stay pretty much intact because there's been plenty of time given for the parties based upon the issues that we've already dealt with. I also believe that if you get a reasonable outcome and the capacity case or a FERC orders in the capacity case, it could bring the parties closer together. And I just think that there are some major milestone precursors there, the capacity rate, in particular, that could have a benefit in terms of bringing the parties together. That's also an opportunity for a quicker solution."

Overall, we have another good quarter for AEP. We produced GAAP and operating earnings of $0.75 and $0.77 a share respectively, and brought our year-to-date earnings to $1.55 and $1.57 respectively. So it turned out to be a pretty",2014,"Thank you, Chuck Zebula. Overall, we have another good quarter for AEP. We produced GAAP and operating earnings of $0.75 and $0.77 a share respectively, and brought our year-to-date earnings to $1.55 and $1.57 respectively. So it turned out to be a pretty good quarter for us. And as Brian will discuss in more detail a bit later, service territory continues to show progress, although very tenuous in the economic recovery, we continue to see industrial growth driven by primary metals and oil and gas activities, but we're now also seeing commercial growth for the first time in years. Residential continues to lag, so we're hopeful that the economy will continue to improve and show that sustainability, particularly from an industrial standpoint, manufacturing as well as we moving to the commercial side of things and then residential will pick up as well. So hopefully this economy will continue to make progress. I know that everyone's focused on the election during this time of the year and hopefully, we'll have a return of optimism that will permeate to the economy that we deal with.
Looking at the quarter, it really does show the discipline of cost control and the diversity of the AEP system to overcome the challenges and in particular related to Ohio with our loss of the polar charges and customer switching. You know Ohio has not been a good story for AEP over the last year or so but we're working really hard to turn this around. All of our other state jurisdictions have improved over the last year, but as you all know, all eyes are on Ohio and very focused on August, which we believe is August 8. Before getting into Ohio and other issues, I want to reiterate that our strategy we put before you on February 10 is still intact and it really does bear repeating. The major issues that we're focused is certainly movement to the competitive market in Ohio, with corporate separation and the formation of our competitive generation retail and wholesale trading and marketing functions. Now that's going to be key for us to execute for in the future after we get this August 8 to order. Investment in our regulated businesses. We will continue to invest in our regulated businesses. And as we just described, just that investment will provide for continued commitment to the growth of 4% to 6% from earnings perspective. And we'll continue to focus on growth in our transmission business as well and repositioning that business around the critical mass to make sure earnings provided near term, as well as long-term. And that dividend strength certainly is secured by the regulated businesses as we go forward as well.
So as we transform ourselves, certainly we'll transform from resource perspective as well. Our generation resources and response to the EPA and certainly from the price of natural gas and other fundamental conditions out there will continue to change. But we're very focused on providing plans to really emerge as more a diversified fleet as we go forward.
So as we look at some of the issues that we deal with during the year, it became apparent that this basic strategy components remain a focus and you'll really enable us to look ahead to the execution as necessary to reposition the company for the future. I've been CEO for about 8 months now and had been fortunate to preside over 2 of the most damaging storms in AEP's history. One what I would call a regulated storm and the other, a weather-related storm. Let me cover the weather-related storm first, which I had never heard off before the storm actually occurred, a super derecho, which occurred in late, late June. I've never heard of it, but I'll certainly focus, during the day it was a 10% chance of thunderstorms. Well that was a pretty damaging 10%. 6 of AEP states from Indiana to Virginia were affected, some 1.4 million customers and additional 300,000 customers were affected on the follow-up storms that ensued. We marshaled crews from our Western footprint, certainly from the indigenous operating companies that were affected, but also all of the country from California and elsewhere and in Canada as well to support the restoration efforts. I'm very proud of our response in our management team included -- including myself visited with crews working throughout our various states to make absolutely sure that the necessary resources were dedicated to restoring power to our customers.
Working for almost 2 weeks, 16 hour days and almost 100-degree heat was an extreme challenge and I'm confident that we performed and executed well from an operational and a safety perspective. The storm was expensive, approximately $230 million, much of which will be deferred for future recovery as a Brian will provide more detail on a little bit later, but it is and in an odd and perhaps, morbid way, it gave the management team a brief reprieve from the challenges of the other storm that occurred. The regulated storm we call Ohio.
So let's talk about that one. These clouds are starting to clear up as well. The capacity order of the PCO demonstrated a couple of major points. The commission was focus on providing competitors the ability to compete quickly for customers by putting in place RPM pricing provisions. And they're also focus on the financial integrity of AEP, evidenced by the capacity cost being set at 189 per megawatt day with the deferral mechanism to be resolved in the ESP filing. That's the first step. So after a significant belly blow in February, AEP is back on its feet and have taken the first step. Now comes the important part, the second step to demonstrate that we're walking again, before we run. The August order, we presume, will come out August 8. That order for the SP will need to define several key issues. The deferral mechanism for the capacity cost Delta from the RPM rates, the level of the RSR, the rate stability writer to ensure the financial integrity of AEP, the distribution investment writer, and will also need to find the start of the recovery of deferred fuel that's been on the books for quite a while. The other major issue is corporate separation. Will need to get the approval for that and we expect that as well.
Overall, we need to adjust the financial needs of AEP Ohio and the ensuing corporate separation to ensure the credit quality and the cash requirements are met for the emerging entities. You can't start a generation company with a fistful of deferral IOUs. We must have cash as well to solidify the balance sheets of the Genco and AEP Ohio going forward.
So make no mistake, your AEP is focus on emerging from this storm with a financially secure company and a clarification of execution to move towards a competitive market in Ohio. The development of our retail effort continues to move forward positively. I recently visited our team in Chicago the former Blazer team and they are very focused on advancing the retail efforts but they're also focus on margins. That's one key issue where I'm not interested in signing up every customer we can sign up. I'm interested in margins associated with that because we are providing the hedge ultimately for the generation that separated so we want to maximize value associated with that.
So now we need the structural pieces of the unregulated generation fleet to fall into place so that we can effectively hedge and compete so this supply. And as we discussed with you all in February, so for AEP, all of our sites are set on moving forward. We continue to see 4% to 6% long-term growth, dividend supported by the regulated companies and do not perceive the issuance of equity during this transition. We are not likely to issue guidance until after the commission renders in order on any rehearing request so by then, we may be looking at '13 and '14 projections but I have a feeling you all are looking at that already anyway.
So with all that said, we do continue on a very positive path and other aspects of our long-term strategy as well. Our transmission efforts continue to move forward. As examples, we are now turning dirt on some significant projects of a cell substation in Ohio, that's a $239 million investment, a $200 million project in Indiana and another $200 million of major projects throughout our trans coast, as well as the Prairie Wind construction is now turning dirt. So we're starting that process of construction that really can provide earnings growth for the future.
We are very disappointed in the order yesterday regarding the pioneer project, both the technical and factual basis, we believe, was not fully recognized in the order. The new line doesn't even interconnect with only Duke and AEP and you can't interconnect AP 765 KV and 138 KV system. Technically, that just doesn't work very well. And that we have a substation pretty close to that, that's accommodating to our 765 KV. So really, look at those factual issues needs to be revisited. Overall, decision really sends a wrong message to promoters of transmission solutions. So we're evaluating our options on this as we go forward but certainly we'll make our position known both publicly and probably through filings as well.
However, this doesn't impact the AEP earnings forecast for transmission because as we described earlier, we are repositioning the transmission business to focus on short-term, as well as long-term projects to provide the critical mass for earnings growth so we have plenty of projects that take its place. That project management discussion we had earlier, along with the amount of projects that are being placed in near-term perspective from our Transco and other while return projects perspectives we'll be able to certainly focus on an earnings path and secure that for the future.
So we spent so much time on Ohio, we forget there are other state regulatory matters that are moving forward. Our Indiana rate case, a $170 million rate case, is concluded as hearings and we expect an order by the end of 2012. Intervener exceptions are due August 15. We submitted our versions of what the orders look like so we'll look to that toward the end of this year. The turf ultra supercritical pulverized coal station is now 92% complete, and we're looking forward to the first fire in the boilers so that we can move on with getting that unit to operational and into rates in most various jurisdictions.
Also, we continue our focus on further developing our EPA response plans. We now estimate our capital spend to be approximately $6 billion, could be a little bit higher than that but nominally $6 billion over the next 5 or so years to accommodate the retrofits and retirement of our generation facilities. We continue to be focused on legislation to provide for a 2-year extension so that we can ensure reliability and reduce the cost of compliance that makes a lot of sense for our ultimate customers and the economy in general.
And lastly, I'll talk about our repositioning study. We have engaged MacKenzie and associates to work with us on our plan to refocus our business on growth and efficiency of operations and enable us to do to continue to prioritize our business functions around the optical model and the growth engines have transmission and the development of competitive businesses. Our growth will continue to be fueled by the regulated business, but we must optimize our cost structure to enable more investment for earnings growth. We expect to conclude this study by the end of the year, with sustainable -- with a sustainable process and organizational value that begins in 2013. So again, all eyes are on August 8, we assume, and then expect -- we expect expedient and deliberate execution and progress towards the strategic goals that we discussed. And now, I'll turn it over to Brian."

Turning to Slide 4, operating earnings for the second quarter were $370 million, up $18 million from the prior year's level of $352 million. This resulted in earnings per share of $0.77 for the quarter, an increase of $0.04 per share from",2141,"Thank you, Nic. Turning to Slide 4, operating earnings for the second quarter were $370 million, up $18 million from the prior year's level of $352 million. This resulted in earnings per share of $0.77 for the quarter, an increase of $0.04 per share from the second quarter of 2011. In summary, the favorable effect of lower O&M expense was partially offset by an increase in the impact of customer switch into alternative electric suppliers in Ohio.
The quarter-on-quarter detail shows a decline in earnings per share of $0.08 related to the level of customer switching. In addition, this year's results were adversely affected our last year's October unfavorable decision on remand from the Public utility commission of Ohio related to polar service. Last year's results included polar revenues while this year's do not. These unfavorable drivers were more than offset by lower O&M expense and favorable other items. O&M expense was down for the quarter, adding $0.13 per share to earnings. The lower O&M reflects decreased planned outage work and lower storm expenses compared to 2011. In addition, the unfavorable variance on O&M spending looks like management efforts to maintain tight controls on spending across the organization. The $0.04 per share improvement in other items reflects the favorable effect of a partial reversal of a 2011 fuel provision in Ohio. At the beginning of the call, Nick mentioned the devastating storms that hit our eastern service territory beginning on June 29. In addition to being destructive, the storms are also costly. As Nick said, current estimates of the storms total cost were about $230 million, spread across our Eastern operating companies. We believe approximately $70 million will be classified as capital and will be recovered in various future late proceedings. Of the remaining $160 million of O&M, we believe we'll ultimately be able to defer for future recovery, up to $130 million. We recognize $4 million in expenses related to the series of storm in the second quarter, leaving an estimated remaining expense for the third quarter of about $26 million.
Turning to Slide 5. Operating earnings for the year-to-date period were $759 million, up $15 million for the last year's level of $744 million. This resulted in earnings per share of $1.57 for the year-to-date, an increase of $0.02 per share from 2011. Similar to our discussion of the second quarter results, the year-to-date results reflect favorable lower O&M expense, offset by the affect of customer switching in Ohio, the unfavorable polar decision and mild first quarter weather. In detail, weather adversely affected the year-on-year results by $0.12 per share. While the weather impact in the second quarter was comparable, the affect of the mild winters throughout our service territory is evident on the year-to-date results.
Customers switching for the first 6 months of the year has lowered earnings by $0.13 per share. By the end of June, 34% of AEP Ohio load had switched to alternative suppliers.
The affect of the unfavorable polar decision adversely affected earnings by $0.10 per share.
On the positive side, rate changes, net of polar, have supported earnings by $0.07 per share. O&M expenses are favorable by $0.25 per share driven by lower spending related to planned outages and our overall efforts to control costs. Finally, other items added $0.05 per share to the results largely due to the partial reversal of the 2011 fuel provision in Ohio.
On Slide 6, you'll see on the bottom right quadrant that weather-normalized total retail sales were up 1% for the quarter and 3/10 of a percent for the year-to-date period.
The growth is coming from sales to the commercial and industrial classes while normalized residential sales continue to struggle.
Before I get to the period variances by customer class, let me give you an overview of the economy in our service territory. We continue to see economic improvement although growth is not evenly distributed it across our service areas. One of the best indicators of relative strength on the local economy is employment growth. Over the past 3 months, employment growth in AEP's metropolitan areas has increased 2%, which is better than it's been over the past year and stronger than the 1.4% employment growth for the U.S. in total.
The employment situation on weaker in our Eastern service territories where there are approximately 91,000 fewer jobs before the recession began and the unemployment rate is 7.9%.
That being said, employment growth in our East region is up 1.8% over the past 3 months.
Job growth in our Western service territory has been stronger. Over the past 3 months, employment growth in our Western Region has been 2.3% above last year. Current numbers indicate there are 17,000 more jobs than when the recession began. The strongest improvement has been in Texas with job growth of 2.9% over the past 12 months and current employment numbers indicat there are 26,000 more jobs now than at the previous session peak. Now let's look at the customer classes. The industrial sector posted the ninth consecutive quarter of growth since the recession. Industrial sales are up 1.8% for the quarter and 2% for the year, driven by strong activity in the oil and gas and transportation equipment manufacturing sectors. I'll talk more about this in more detail in the next slide.
On the top right of the Slide, AEP sales to commercial customers grew 1.6% for the second quarter and are 6/10 of a percent up for the year.
Commercial sales growth closely tracks employment growth. The employment growth we discussed earlier is driving the recovery we are experiencing in this class. Not surprisingly commercial sales has been stronger in our Western Region and especially in Texas where the job growth has been strongest.
AEP's weather-normalized sales to residential customers we're down 1.9% for the quarter and 2.4% year-to-date. Part of this is driven by customer accounts. In our Eastern service territory, we have approximately 4,000 fewer customers than we had last year. Our Texas properties experienced a notable increase in residential customer counts. This was related to strong employment and population growth.
The chart on Page 7 shows the growth and industrial sales for our 5 largest sectors. As you can see, year-to-date growth in primary metals is 1.4% yet  sales to the sector declined in the second quarter. Our largest metals customer was still ramping up to full production during the first quarter of last year. More recent data shows that the primary metals sector has stabilized at roughly 75% of the previous estimate session level. Also on this chart, you'll notice that sales in the petroleum and coal product sector has been improving, with sales up 8% in the second quarter and 7.1% for the year-to-date period. While growth in the sector has been solid across our territory, there was a major expansion in refinery East Texas that drove much of the growth for the quarter. Besides the sector shown on the chart, we are also seeing impressive growth in a couple of other sectors. Oil and gas extraction sales are up 1.3% for the quarter and 3.9% year-to-date. In addition to new customers, several existing customers had expanded recurring operations. Most of these expansions are related to the Shale gas activity, particularly in our Wheeling West Virginia and Texas territories. The transportation equipment manufacturing sector which represents 4.2% of the company's industrial sales has also demonstrated a significant increase of 10.9% for the quarter and a 8.7% for the year-to-date period.
This improvement is related to U.S. auto sales, which reached the prerecession annualized levels earlier this year. We've experienced load growth at existing automotive manufacturers in West Virginia and Louisiana. In addition, drivers in the U.S. are maintaining and not replacing their vehicles as often as they used to. This has resulted in growth at some of our motor vehicle parts manufacturers, especially in Michigan and Ohio. 
Turning to Slide 8, you can see that as the company's coal capacity factors have decreased on a quarterly and year-to-date basis, our natural gas capacity factors have increased. For both the quarterly and annual periods, our generation for natural gas has increased approximately 80%. For our East combined cycle units, the increase in capacity factors and generation is even more pronounced. With the addition of the Dresden generation facility to our water wells were plants, East combined cycle generation has increased 250% for the quarter and 181% or the year-to-date period. With year-to-date capacity factors for these plants approaching 70%, the ability to realize incremental coal-to-gas switching within our Eastern fleet is reduced.
This switching and the general pricing environment for coal, natural gas and electricity has led to an increase in our goal inventory from 45 days at the end of the first quarter to 48 days at the end of the second quarter. This is about 6 days more inventory than at the end of the second quarter of last year. Our coal needs for 2012 are fully hedged and our needs for 2013 are about 90% hedged with many units fully hedged.
On Slide 9, you will see the balance sheet, credit metrics and liquidity remains strong. Our debt to total capitalization has remained fairly constant over the last 3 quarters and currently stands at 55.2%. Our FFO to interest coverage and our FFO to total debt remain solidly BBB for a company with AEP's business risk profile. The company's net available liquidity stands at $2.8 billion, and is supported by our 2 large credit facilities, which mature in June of 2015 and July of 2016. That being said, there are some pending developments that could impact the credit quality of Ohio power company, specifically, the capacity case allows for the deferral of the difference between $189 of megawatt day and the RPM price. It is our belief that the ESP order will address the recovery mechanism for the deferral of these costs in addition to other items. Unfortunately, at this point, we do not know how or when the deferral will be recovered. Both timing and recovery are important items in determining the credit outlook.
The credit risks for Ohio power had been outlined by all 3 rating agencies. Earlier this month, S&P issued a bulletin immediately after the capacity order, stating that while there are no immediate effects on ratings, they considered deferrals of changes and capacity prices to be unsupportive of credit quality because cash flow will decline and could result in financial measures inconsistent with the current rating. We have informed stakeholders about the importance of supporting investment-grade ratings for Ohio power. In addition, the balance sheet for this company is able to absorb some level of deferrals especially if we are able to begin recovering of our deferred fuel costs and securitize our existing regulatory asset balance. These last 2 items will be credit supported. They are likely both positive and negative items to appear on the credit scorecard for Ohio Power if the overall tally is not known.
However, our metrics are solid today and we have a focus on reducing our business risk in Ohio through the transfer of 2 large plants of regulated affiliates, sizing construct of the competitive environment and hedging our output.
As Nick said, we are committed to investment-grade credit and at this time do not see the need for additional equity beyond the DRIP due to some flexibility in our capital spent profile and securitization opportunities in both Ohio and West Virginia.
Our Ohio team is working hard to achieve an outcome at our ESP case that preserves the financial strength of Ohio Power and our new competitive generation company.
Turning to Slide 10, for the remainder of 2012, I have already detailed the estimated cost impacts of the late June and early July storms. We have shown where the economy is recovering in our service territories and the resulting impact on load. The industrial and commercial load classes are headed in the right direction yet recent residential load trends had been weak.
Regulatory uncertainty in Ohio has been a concern for the AP story for some time. In early June, we started to get some clarity on Ohio regulatory outcomes with a big piece of that picture is expected to come with an order in early August. We are working hard to get a reasonable outcome. Our earnings so far this year had been the result of positive non-Ohio utility performance and expense discipline, offsetting earnings challenges in Ohio. We will maintain that discipline. Most of all, we are looking forward to being able to share with you a plan in Ohio that has a clear, reasonable transition competitive generation model and a stable regulated wires company with a financially sound AEP Ohio throughout the transition period.
With that, I will turn the call over to the operator for questions."

We continue to search and as you see some of the changes that have been made, such as with the Big Sandy scrubber proposal being pulled at this point, we're reevaluating that, we have some activity in Oklahoma around coal-fired generation as well that we've adjusted do. You'll continue to see those kinds of adjustments because what we're trying to get to is number one, portfolio that each of our operating jurisdictions support. And then secondly, a portfolio that provides some risk management around a balanced portfolio going forward. So for us, it's a relatively higher hurdle for us to be putting scrubbers on our facilities. In many cases, it's already done. In some cases, it continues to be an evaluation, even for unit such as the 1,300-megawatt units at Rockford. Paul showed RCOH with is working with the regulators determine what the proper opportunities are for that so that we can meet the emission reduction guidelines and that being discussed in all of our jurisdictions so you bring up a great point and that's something that we're very focused on.

They are very focused and active on doing that and one of the things that struck me in the discussions with them was how much they didn't talk about, let's go get as many kilowatt hours as we can. That wasn't part of deal. It was let's go get these contracts, do it wisely, do it with controls in place but focus on margins. And I think this organization, the back office system integration continues to work very well. A matter fact, I think all of our customers our existing AEP retail customers switch over to the BlueStar systems here in the next, I think in the next week or 2, 2 weeks. So it's happening very quickly and that integration process is going very well. We have AEP retail employees together with BlueStar employees now. I think we move several AEP retail employees to Chicago to really focus on that effort and I see the mix of the 2 cultures going extremely well because they're fueled by the prospect of just amazing growth potential. So that's my view of it. I think it's going to be a very positive thing for us, particularly when we get the corporate separation out of the way and they can start actually planning on doing making deals based upon the availability of that generation and long-term deal on that. While I was there they were signing of deals as a matter but with only several deals as I was leaving that they were very proud of from a long-term perspective so they are making considerable progress and I'm happy with that progress."

There's no capacity constraints that we have on the gas units at this point in time and I think our numbers were slightly down last month because that's when we did some outages on some of the gas units, but we are pleased with our gas capacity factors and our ability to respond, actually. What we're -- and just as an additional add on to that, we are continuing to be concerned about the reliability applications or what the EPA's doing because one thing we haven't talked about is the capacity factors of those small, older coal-fired units that are depending dependent upon during the peak. As we had last year, these units are being called on and connected to the system, 54% of the time, and are running in the order of 30% capacity factor during these peak months. So they're still needed and we're going to have to work through that process and even with those committed to provide the peak in August that they have minimum one-time obligations in minimum load obligations, we still achieved almost 80% capacity factor on the gas units.

We still have one of the most outstanding wholesale trading operations there is in the country and we're going to put that together with a retail organization and make sure there is a competitive business that's viable for the future. Now the decision will be made later as to whether that makes sense for us or not. It will be based upon, as we said, the February 10 meeting, if we can make it look at quasi-regulated, where there's long-term contracts, there's hedging associated with that the activities and the market sees that we have a business that makes sense for us in the future, then that we'll continue with it. But I think it's important for us to rationalize that process over the next 2 to 3 years and fully understand what that business looks like. The other issue too is we don't know what happens across the country or what happens in the next 2 to 3 years in various fundamentals or whether states go to competition or elsewhere.

So it turned out to be a pretty good quarter for us. And as Brian will discuss in more detail a little bit later, our service territory continues to show progress. Although very tenuous in the economic recovery, we continue to see industrial growth driven by primary metals and oil and gas activities, but we're now also seeing commercial growth for the first time in years. Residential continues to lag, so we're hopeful that the economy will continue to improve and show that sustainability, particularly from an industrial standpoint, manufacturing as well as moving to the commercial side of things and then residential will pick up as well. So hopefully this economy will continue to make progress. I know that everyone's focused on the election during this time of the year and hopefully, we'll have a return of optimism that will permeate through the economy that we deal with.
Looking at the quarter, it really does show the discipline of cost control and the diversity of the AEP system to overcome the challenges, in particular related to Ohio where our loss of the POLR charges and customer switching. Ohio has not been a good story for AEP over the last year or so, and -- but we're working really hard to turn this around. All of our other state jurisdictions have improved over the last year, but as you all know, all eyes are on Ohio and very focused on August, which we believe is August 8. 
Before getting into Ohio and other issues, I want to reiterate that our strategy we put before you on February 10 is still intact and it really does bear repeating. The major issues that we're focused on is certainly movement to the competitive market in Ohio, with corporate separation and the formation of our competitive generation in retail and wholesale trading and marketing functions. That's going to be key for us to execute for in the future after we get this August 8 to order. 
Investment in our regulated businesses. We will continue to invest in our regulated businesses. And as we've described, just that investment will provide for continued commitment to the growth of 4% to 6% from an earnings perspective. And we'll continue to focus on growth in our transmission business as well and repositioning that business around the critical mass to make sure earnings provide in near term, as well as long-term. And that dividend strength certainly is secured by the regulated businesses as we go forward as well.
So as we transform ourselves, certainly we'll transform from a resource perspective as well. Our generation resources in response to the EPA and certainly from the price of natural gas and other fundamental conditions out there will continue to change. But we're very focused on providing plans to really emerge as a more diversified fleet as we go forward.
So all -- so as we looked at some of the issues that we deal with during the year, it became apparent that these basic strategy components remain a focus and will really enable us to look ahead to the execution as necessary reposition the company for the future. 
I've been CEO for about 8 months now and had been fortunate to preside over 2 of the most damaging storms in AEP's history. One, what I would call a regulated storm and the other, a weather-related storm. Let me cover the weather-related storm first, which I had never heard of before the storm actually occurred, a super derecho, which occurred in late, late June. I've never heard of it, but I'll certainly focus. During the day, it was a 10% chance of thunderstorms. Well, that was a pretty damaging 10%. 6 of AEP states from Indiana to Virginia were affected and some 1.4 million customers. And additional 300,000 customers were affected on the follow-up storms that ensued. We marshaled crews from our Western footprint and certainly from the indigenous operating companies that were affected, but also all of the country, from California and elsewhere, and in Canada as well to support the restoration efforts. I'm very proud of our response. And our management team, included -- including myself, visited with crews working throughout our various states to make absolutely sure that the necessary resources were dedicated, restoring power to our customers. Working for almost 2 weeks, 16-hour days and almost a 100-degree heat was an extreme challenge that I'm confident that we performed and executed well from an operational and a safety perspective. 
The storm was expensive, approximately $230 million, much of which will be deferred for future recovery as Brian will provide more detail on a little bit later, but it is and in an odd and perhaps, morbid way, it gave the management team a brief reprieve from the challenges of the other storm that occurred -- the regulated storm we call Ohio. So let's talk about that one. 
These clouds are starting to clear up as well. The capacity order of the PCO demonstrated a couple of major points. The Commission was focused on providing competitors the ability to compete quickly for customers by putting in place RPM pricing provisions. And they're also focused on the financial integrity of AEP, evidenced by the capacity cost being set at 189 per megawatt day, with the deferral mechanism to be resolved in the ESP filing. That's the first step. So after a significant belly blow in February, AEP is back on its feet and have taken the first step. Now comes the important part, the second step to demonstrate that we're walking again before we run. The August order, we presume, will come out August 8. That order for the ESP will need to -- needs to define several key issues: the deferral mechanism for the capacity cost delta from the RPM rates; the level of the RSR, the rate stability rider, to ensure the financial integrity of AEP; the distribution investment rider. And we'll also need to define the start of the recovery of the deferred fuel that's been on the books for quite a while. The other major issue is corporate separation. We'll need to get the approval for that, and we expect that as well. 
Overall, we need to address the financial needs of AEP Ohio and the ensuing corporate separation to ensure the credit quality and the cash requirements are met for the emerging entities. You can't start a generation company with a fistful of deferral IOUs. We must have cash as well to solidify the balance sheets of the Genco and AEP Ohio going forward.
So make no mistake. Your AEP is focused on emerging from this storm with a financially secure company and a clarification of execution to move toward a competitive market in Ohio. The development of our retail effort continues to move forward positively. I recently visited our team in Chicago, the former BlueStar team, and they are very focused on advancing the retail efforts, but they're also focused on margins. That's one key issue I'm not interested in signing up every customer we can sign up. I'm interested in margins associated with that because we are providing a hedge, ultimately for the generation that separated, so we want to maximize value associated with that.
So now we need the structural pieces of the unregulated generation fleet to fall into place so that we can effectively hedge and compete so that this supply. And as we discussed with you all in February, so for AEP, all of our sites are set on moving forward. We continue to see 4% to 6% long-term growth, dividend supported by the regulated companies and do not perceive the issuance of equity during this transition. We are not likely to issue guidance until after the commission renders an order on any rehearing request so by then, we may be looking at '13 and '14 projections but I have a feeling you all are looking at that already anyway.
So with all that said, we do continue on a very positive path in other aspects of our long-term strategy as well. Our transmission efforts continue to move forward. As examples, we are now turning dirt on some significant projects of a cell substation in Ohio, that's a $239 million investment; a $200 million project in Indiana; and another $200 million of major projects throughout our Transcos, as well as the Prairie Wind construction is now turning dirt. So we're starting that process of construction that really can provide the earnings growth for the future.
We are very disappointed in the order yesterday regarding the Pioneer Project. Both the technical and factual basis, we believe, was not fully recognized in the order. The new line doesn't even interconnect with the EPSCO, only Duke and AEP. And you can't interconnect AEP's 765 KV into an EPSCO's 138 KV system. That's -- technically, that just doesn't work very well. And that we have a substation pretty close to that, that's accommodating to our 765 KV. So really, look at those factual issues needs to be revisited. Overall, a decision really sends a wrong message to promoters of transmission solutions. So we're evaluating our options on this as we go forward, but certainly we'll make our position known both publicly and probably through filings as well.
However, this doesn't impact the AEP earnings forecast for transmission because as we described earlier, we're repositioning the transmission business to focus on short-term, as well as long-term projects to provide the critical mass for earnings growth, so we have plenty of projects to take its place. That project management discussion we had earlier, along with the amount of projects that are being placed in near-term perspective from a Transco and other [indiscernible] projects perspectives, we'll be able to certainly focus on an earnings path and secure that for the future.
So we spent so much time on Ohio. We forget there are other state regulatory matters that are moving forward. Our Indiana rate case, the $170 million rate case, has concluded us hearings and we expect an order by the end of 2012. Intervener exceptions are due August 15. We submitted our version of what the order should look like, so we'll look to that toward the end of this year. The Turk ultra supercritical pulverized coal station is now 92% complete, and we're looking forward to the first fire in the boilers so that we can move on with getting that unit to operational and into rates in those various jurisdictions.
Also, we continue our focus on further developing our EPA response plans. We now estimate our capital spend to be approximately $6 billion, could be a little bit higher than that but nominally, $6 billion over the next 5-or-so years to accommodate the retrofits and retirements of our generation facilities. We continue to be focused on legislation to provide for a 2-year extension so that we can ensure reliability and reduce the cost of compliance that makes a lot of sense for our ultimate customers and the economy in general.
And lastly, I'll talk about our repositioning study. We have engaged MacKenzie and Associates to work with us on our plan to refocus our business on growth and efficiency of operations and enable us to do -- to continue to prioritize our business functions around the opco [operating company] model and the growth engines of transmission and the development of competitive businesses. Our growth will continue to be fueled by the regulated business, but we must optimize our cost structure to enable more investment for earnings growth. We expect to conclude this study by the end of the year, with sustainable -- with a sustainable process and organizational value that begins in 2013. So again, all eyes are on August 8. We assume and then expect -- we expect expedient and deliberate execution and progress toward the strategic goals that we've discussed. 
And now, I'll turn it over to Brian."
135470,214165493,328431,"American Electric Power Co., Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 20, 2012",2012-07-20,"Earnings Calls","American Electric Power Company, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Nick. Turning to Slide 4. Operating earnings for the second quarter were $370 million, up $18 million from the prior year's level of $352 million. This resulted in earnings per share of $0.77 for the quarter, an increase of $0.04 per share from",2149,"Thank you, Nick. Turning to Slide 4. Operating earnings for the second quarter were $370 million, up $18 million from the prior year's level of $352 million. This resulted in earnings per share of $0.77 for the quarter, an increase of $0.04 per share from the second quarter of 2011. 
In summary, the favorable effect of lower O&M expense was partially offset by an increase in the impact of customer switch into alternative electric suppliers in Ohio.
The quarter-on-quarter detail shows a decline in earnings per share of $0.08 related to the level of customer switching. In addition, this year's results were adversely affected our last year's October unfavorable decision on remand from the Public Utility Commission of Ohio related to POLR service. Last year's results included POLR revenues, while this year's do not. These unfavorable drivers were more than offset by lower O&M expense and favorable other items. O&M expense was down for the quarter, adding $0.13 per share to earnings. The lower O&M reflects decreased planned outage work and lower storm expenses compared to 2011. In addition, the unfavorable variance in O&M spending reflects management efforts to maintain tight controls on spending across the organization. The $0.04 per share improvement in other items reflects the favorable effect of a partial reversal of a 2011 fuel provision in Ohio. 
At the beginning of the call, Nick mentioned the devastating storms that hit our eastern service territory beginning on June 29. In addition to being destructive, the storms were also costly. As Nick said, current estimates of the storms' total cost were about $230 million, spread across our Eastern operating companies. We believe approximately $70 million will be classified as capital and will be recovered in various future rate proceedings. Of the remaining $160 million of O&M, we believe we'll ultimately be able to defer for future recovery up to $130 million. We recognize $4 million in expenses related to the series of storm in the second quarter, leaving an estimated remaining expense for the third quarter of about $26 million.
Turning to Slide 5. Operating earnings for the year-to-date period were $759 million, up $15 million from last year's level of $744 million. This resulted in earnings per share of $1.57 for the year-to-date, an increase of $0.02 per share from 2011. 
Similar to our discussion of the second quarter results, the year-to-date results reflect favorable lower O&M expense, offset by the effect of customer switching in Ohio, the unfavorable POLR decision and mild first quarter weather. In detail, weather adversely affected the year-on-year results by $0.12 per share. While the weather impact in the second quarter was comparable, the effect of the mild winter throughout our service territory is evident in the year-to-date results. Customer switching for the first 6 months of the year was -- has lowered earnings by $0.13 per share. By the end of June, 34% of AEP Ohio load had switched to alternative suppliers. The effect of the unfavorable POLR decision adversely affected earnings by $0.10 per share.
On the positive side, rate changes net of POLR have supported earnings by $0.07 per share; o&M expenses are favorable by $0.25 per share, driven by lower spending related to planned outages and our overall efforts to control costs; finally, other items added $0.05 per share to the results, largely due to the partial reversal of the 2011 fuel provision in Ohio.
On Slide 6, you'll see on the bottom right quadrant that weather-normalized total retail sales were up 1% for the quarter and 3/10 of 1% for the year-to-date period. The growth is coming from sales to the commercial and industrial classes, while normalized residential sales continue to struggle.
Before I get into the period variances by customer class, let me give you an overview of the economy in our service territory. We continue to see economic improvement, although the growth is not evenly distributed across our service areas. One of the best indicators of relative strength of the local economy is employment growth. 
Over the past 3 months, employment growth in AEP's metropolitan areas has increased 2%, which is better than it's been over the past year and stronger than the 1.4% employment growth for the U.S. in total. 
The employment situation remains weaker in our eastern service territories, where there are approximately 91,000 fewer jobs than before the recession began, and the unemployment rate is 7.9%. That being said, employment growth in our East Region is up 1.8% over the past 3 months.
Job growth in our western service territory has been stronger. Over the past 3 months, employment growth in our Western Region has been 2.3% above last year. Current numbers indicate there are 17,000 more jobs than when the recession began. The strongest improvement has been in Texas, with job growth of 2.9% over the past 12 months, and current employment numbers indicate there are 26,000 more jobs now than at the prerecession peak. 
Now let's look at the customer classes. The industrial sector posted the ninth consecutive quarter of growth since the recession. Industrial sales are up 1.8% for the quarter and 2% for the year, driven by strong activity in the oil and gas and transportation equipment manufacturing sectors. I'll talk more about this in more detail on the next slide.
On the top right of the slide, AEP sales to commercial customers grew 1.6% for the second quarter and are 6/10 of 1% up for the year. Commercial sales growth closely tracks employment growth. The employment growth we discussed earlier is driving the recovery we are experiencing in this class. Not surprisingly, commercial sales have been stronger in our West Region and especially in Texas where the job growth has been the strongest.
AEP's weather-normalized sales to residential customers were down 1.9% for the quarter and 2.4% year-to-date. Part of this is driven by customer accounts. In our eastern service territory, we have approximately 4,000 fewer customers than we had last year. Our Texas properties experienced a notable increase in residential customer counts. This was related to strong employment and population growth.
The chart on Page 7 shows the growth in industrial sales for our 5 largest sectors. As you can see, year-to-date growth in primary metals is 1.4%, yet  sales to the sector declined in the second quarter. Our largest metals customer was still ramping up to full production during the first quarter of last year. More recent data shows that the primary metals sector has stabilized at roughly 75% of the prerecession level. 
Also on this chart, you'll notice that sales in the petroleum and coal products sector had been improving, with sales up 8% in the second quarter and 7.1% for the year-to-date period. While growth in this sector has been solid across our territory, there was a major expansion at a refinery in East Texas that drove much of the growth for the quarter. 
Besides the sectors shown on the chart, we are also seeing impressive growth in a couple of other sectors. Oil and gas extraction sales are up 1.3% for the quarter and 3.9% year-to-date. In addition to new customers, several existing customers have expanded their current operations. Most of these expansions are related to the shale gas activity, particularly in our Wheeling West Virginia and Texas territories. 
The transportation equipment manufacturing sector, which represents 4.2% of the company's industrial sales, has also demonstrated a significant increase of 10.9% for the quarter and 8.7% for the year-to-date period. This improvement is related to U.S. auto sales, which reached their prerecession annualized levels earlier this year. We have experienced load growth at existing automotive manufacturers in West Virginia and Louisiana. In addition, drivers in the U.S. are maintaining and not replacing their vehicles as often as they used to. This has resulted in growth at some of our motor vehicle parts manufacturers, especially in Michigan and Ohio. 
Turning to Slide 8, you can see that as the company's coal capacity factors have decreased on a quarterly and year-to-date basis, our natural gas capacity factors have increased. For both the quarterly and annual periods, our generation from natural gas has increased approximately 80%. For our East combined cycle units, the increase in capacity factors and generation is even more pronounced. With the addition of the Dresden generation facility to our water firm in Warrensburg plants, East combined cycle generation has increased 250% for the quarter and 181% for the year-to-date period. With year-to-date capacity factors for these plants approaching 70%, the ability to realize incremental coal-to-gas switching within our Eastern fleet is reduced.
This switching and the general pricing environment for coal, natural gas and electricity has led to an increase in our coal inventory from 45 days at the end of the first quarter to 48 days at the end of the second quarter. This is about 6 days more inventory than at the end of the second quarter of last year. Our coal needs for 2012 are fully hedged and our needs for 2013 are about 90% hedged with many units fully hedged.
On Slide 9, you will see that our balance sheet, credit metrics and liquidity remained strong. Our debt to total capitalization has remained fairly constant over the last 3 quarters and currently stands at 55.2%. Our FFO to interest coverage and our FFO to total debt remain solidly BBB for a company with AEP's business risk profile. The company's net available liquidity stands at $2.8 billion, and is supported by our 2 large credit facilities, which mature in June of 2015 and July of 2016. 
That being said, there are some pending developments that could impact the credit quality of Ohio Power Company, specifically, the capacity case allows for the deferral of the difference between $189 a megawatt day and the RPM price. It is our belief that the ESP order will address the recovery mechanism for the deferral of these costs in addition to other items. Unfortunately, at this point, we do not know how or when the deferral will be recovered. Both timing and recovery are important items in determining the credit outlook.
The credit risks for Ohio Power had been outlined by all 3 rating agencies. Earlier this month, S&P issued a bulletin immediately after the capacity order, stating that while there are no immediate effects on ratings, they considered deferrals of changes and capacity prices to be unsupportive of credit quality because cash flow would decline and could result in financial measures inconsistent with the current rating. We have informed stakeholders about the importance of supporting investment grade ratings for Ohio Power. In addition, the balance sheet for this company is able to absorb some level of deferrals, especially if we are able to begin recovery of our deferred fuel costs and securitize our existing regulatory asset balances. These last 2 items will be credit supportive. They are likely both positive and negative items to appear on the credit scorecard for Ohio Power, yet the overall tally is not known. 
However, our metrics are solid today and we have a focus on reducing our business risk in Ohio through the transfer of 2 large plants to regulated affiliates, sizing our cost structure to a competitive environment and hedging our output. As Nick said, we are committed to investment grade credit and at this time do not see the need for additional equity beyond the DRIP due to some flexibility in our capital spend profile and securitization opportunities in both Ohio and West Virginia. Our Ohio team is working hard to achieve an outcome in our ESP case that preserves the financial strength of Ohio Power and our new competitive generation company.
Turning to Slide 10, for the remainder of 2012, I have already detailed the estimated cost impacts of the late June and early July storms. We have shown where the economy is recovering in our service territories and the resulting impact on load. The industrial and commercial load classes are headed in the right direction, yet recent residential load trends had been weak. Regulatory uncertainty in Ohio has been a concern for the AEP story for some time. In early June, we started to get some clarity on Ohio regulatory outcomes, with a big piece of that picture is expected to come with an order in early August. We are working hard to get a reasonable outcome. Our earnings so far this year had been the result of positive non-Ohio utility performance and expense discipline, offsetting earnings challenges in Ohio. We will maintain that discipline. Most of all, we are looking forward to being able to share with you a plan in Ohio that has a clear, reasonable transition to a competitive generation model and a stable regulated wires company with a financially sound AEP Ohio throughout the transition period.
With that, I will turn the call over to the operator for questions."

And of course, we continue to work, as I said, on the legislative side because EPRI has done an independent analysis showing that it cost 1/3 less if you wind up with the 2-year extension if you're able to optimize that. But I think it's important for us to go through the process in concert with the state, and it really focuses on that operating company model where we're working with them to determine what the proper solution is. And you're right, we are -- we continue to search and as you see some of the changes that have been made, such as with the Big Sandy scrubber proposal being pulled at this point, we're reevaluating that, we have some activity in Oklahoma around coal-fired generation as well that we've adjusted do. You'll continue to see those kinds of adjustments because what we're trying to get to is: number one, a portfolio that each of our operating jurisdictions support; and then secondly, a portfolio that provides some risk management around a balanced portfolio going forward. So for us, it's a relatively high hurdle for us to be putting scrubbers on our facilities. In some -- in many cases, it's already done. In some cases, it continues to be an evaluation, even for units such as the 1,300-megawatt units at Rockford. Paul Chodak over at I&M is working with the regulators to determine what the proper opportunities are for that so that we can meet the emission reduction guidelines, and that's being discussed in all of our jurisdictions. So you bring up a great point, and that's something that we're very focused on. And we'll continue to try to optimize, matter of fact, when we first started this process, we were looking at $8 billion, and it's come down to just over $6 billion, and we expect it to continue to be refined as we go forward in concert with the states."

And generally, around that 70% to 80% capacity factor, I think, which is sort of amazing, given what we're dealing with. I think from a coal-fired generation perspective, it's dropped off considerably. As long as you're -- we're not having sub-$3 per MBTU price, the capacity on the gas units are going to be -- continuing to be high. There's no capacity constraints that we have on the gas units at this point in time. And I think our numbers were slightly down last month because that's when we took some outages on some of the gas units. But we are pleased with our gas capacity factors and our ability to respond, actually. What we're -- and just as an additional add-on to that, we are continuing to be concerned about the reliability implications or what the EPA is doing because one thing we haven't talked about is the capacity factors of those small, older coal-fired units that are depending -- dependent upon during the peak. As we had last year, these units are being called on and connected to the system 54% of the time and are running in the order of 30% capacity factor during these peak months. So they're still needed. And we're going to have to work through that process. And even with those committed to provide the peak, and obviously they have minimum run-time obligations and minimum load obligations, we still achieved almost 80% capacity factor on the gas units. So that pretty well tells you we're really switching back and forth based upon what the peak requirements are but utilizing the energy component through the natural gas as much as we can."

And that's why I was pointing to the EPRI study, which is an independent organization, Electric Power Research Institute. They did a study and said that if you were to take an additional 2 years, by utilizing technologies, you could actually save half of the units that are scoped for retirement for that period of time and achieve the same emission reductions at a 1/3 less costs. So instead of $300 billion cost in the country to address the EPA issues, it would cost around $200 billion, which -- that's a substantial cost savings, particularly when you talk about the impact on the economy. And as we go through this process, we're going to have to determine, with EPA and perhaps legislation would give you a lot more flexibility and a lot more security around the solutions, and that's what we're trying to achieve."

You've gone out about BlueStar and you're now entering a new competitive business, both on the retail and the wholesale side, and I just want to kind of ask that question. Is that really core to AEP? I mean, is what AEP really good at is from running a regulated business and that as you migrate towards more of a merchant model in Ohio and more competitive model, do  you wonder about whether that's really non-core to what your strengths are and that whether those businesses really fit within the broader bubble of AEP?"

We have -- we still have one of the most outstanding wholesale trading operations there is in the country. We're going to put that together with a retail organization and make sure there is a competitive business that's viable for the future. Now, the decision will be made later as to whether that makes sense for us or not. But it'll be based upon, as we've said, the February 10 meeting. If we can make it look quasi-regulated, where there's long-term contracts, there's hedging associated with the activities and the market sees that we have a business that makes sense for us in the future, then that -- we'll continue with it. But I think it's important for us to rationalize that process over the next 2 to 3 years and fully understand what that business looks like. The other issue, too, is we don't know what happens across the country or what happens in the next 2 to 3 years in various fundamentals or whether states go to competition or elsewhere. So it really winds up being a very credible option for us in the future. Hopefully, it'll be complementary.

The overall, we had another good quarter for AEP. We produced GAAP and operating earnings of $0.75 and $0.77 a share, respectively, and brought our year-to-date earnings to $1.55 and $1.57 per share, respectively. So it turned out",2035,"Thank you, Chuck Zebula. The overall, we had another good quarter for AEP. We produced GAAP and operating earnings of $0.75 and $0.77 a share, respectively, and brought our year-to-date earnings to $1.55 and $1.57 per share, respectively. So it turned out to be a pretty good quarter for us. And as Brian will discuss in more detail a little bit later, our service territory continues to show progress. Although very tenuous in the economic recovery, we continue to see industrial growth driven by primary metals and oil and gas activities, but we're now also seeing commercial growth for the first time in years. Residential continues to lag, so we're hopeful that the economy will continue to improve and show that sustainability, particularly from an industrial standpoint, manufacturing as well as moving to the commercial side of things and then residential will pick up as well. So hopefully this economy will continue to make progress. I know that everyone's focused on the election during this time of the year and hopefully, we'll have a return of optimism that will permeate through the economy that we deal with.
Looking at the quarter, it really does show the discipline of cost control and the diversity of the AEP system to overcome the challenges, in particular related to Ohio where our loss of the POLR charges and customer switching. Ohio has not been a good story for AEP over the last year or so, and -- but we're working really hard to turn this around. All of our other state jurisdictions have improved over the last year, but as you all know, all eyes are on Ohio and very focused on August, which we believe is August 8. 
Before getting into Ohio and other issues, I want to reiterate that our strategy we put before you on February 10 is still intact and it really does bear repeating. The major issues that we're focused on is certainly movement to the competitive market in Ohio, with corporate separation and the formation of our competitive generation in retail and wholesale trading and marketing functions. That's going to be key for us to execute for in the future after we get this August 8 to order. 
Investment in our regulated businesses. We will continue to invest in our regulated businesses. And as we've described, just that investment will provide for continued commitment to the growth of 4% to 6% from an earnings perspective. And we'll continue to focus on growth in our transmission business as well and repositioning that business around the critical mass to make sure earnings provide in near term, as well as long-term. And that dividend strength certainly is secured by the regulated businesses as we go forward as well.
So as we transform ourselves, certainly we'll transform from a resource perspective as well. Our generation resources in response to the EPA and certainly from the price of natural gas and other fundamental conditions out there will continue to change. But we're very focused on providing plans to really emerge as a more diversified fleet as we go forward.
So all -- so as we looked at some of the issues that we deal with during the year, it became apparent that these basic strategy components remain a focus and will really enable us to look ahead to the execution as necessary reposition the company for the future. 
I've been CEO for about 8 months now and have been fortunate to preside over 2 of the most damaging storms in AEP's history. One, what I would call a regulated storm and the other, a weather-related storm. Let me cover the weather-related storm first, which I had never heard of before the storm actually occurred, a super derecho, which occurred in late, late June. I've never heard of it, but I'll certainly focus. During the day, it was a 10% chance of thunderstorms. Well, that was a pretty damaging 10%. 6 of AEP states from Indiana to Virginia were affected and some 1.4 million customers. And additional 300,000 customers were affected in the follow-up storms that ensued. We marshaled crews from our Western footprint and certainly from the indigenous operating companies that were affected, but also all of the country, from California and elsewhere, and in Canada as well to support the restoration efforts. I'm very proud of our response. And our management team, included -- including myself, visited with crews working throughout our various states to make absolutely sure that the necessary resources were dedicated, restoring power to our customers. Working for almost 2 weeks, 16-hour days and almost a 100-degree heat was an extreme challenge that I'm confident that we performed and executed well from an operational and a safety perspective. 
The storm was expensive, approximately $230 million, much of which will be deferred for future recovery as Brian will provide more detail on a little bit later, but it is and in an odd and perhaps, morbid way, it gave the management team a brief reprieve from the challenges of the other storm that occurred -- the regulated storm we call Ohio. So let's talk about that one. 
These clouds are starting to clear up as well. The capacity order of the PCO demonstrated a couple of major points. The Commission is focused on providing competitors the ability to compete quickly for customers by putting in place RPM pricing provisions. And they're also focused on the financial integrity of AEP, evidenced by the capacity cost being set at 189 per megawatt day, with the deferral mechanism to be resolved in the ESP filing. That's the first step. So after a significant belly blow in February, AEP is back on its feet and have taken the first step. Now comes the important part, the second step to demonstrate that we're walking again before we run. The August order, we presume, will come out August 8. That order for the ESP will need to -- needs to define several key issues: the deferral mechanism for the capacity cost delta from the RPM rates; the level of the RSR, the rate stability rider, to ensure the financial integrity of AEP; the distribution investment rider. And we'll also need to define the start of the recovery of the deferred fuel that's been on the books for quite a while. The other major issue is corporate separation. We'll need to get the approval for that, and we expect that as well. 
Overall, we need to address the financial needs of AEP Ohio and the ensuing corporate separation to ensure the credit quality and the cash requirements are met for the emerging entities. You can't start a generation company with a fistful of deferral IOUs. We must have cash as well to solidify the balance sheets of the Genco and AEP Ohio going forward.
So make no mistake. Your AEP is focused on emerging from this storm with a financially secure company and a clarification of execution to move toward a competitive market in Ohio. The development of our retail effort continues to move forward positively. I recently visited our team in Chicago, the former BlueStar team, and they are very focused on advancing the retail efforts, but they're also focused on margins. That's one key issue I'm not interested in signing up every customer we can sign up. I'm interested in margins associated with that because we are providing a hedge, ultimately for the generation that separated, so we want to maximize value associated with that.
So now we need the structural pieces of the unregulated generation fleet to fall into place so that we can effectively hedge and compete so that this supply. And as we discussed with you all in February, so for AEP, all of our sites are set on moving forward. We continue to see 4% to 6% long-term growth, dividend supported by the regulated companies and do not perceive the issuance of equity during this transition. We are not likely to issue guidance until after the commission renders an order on any rehearing request so by then, we may be looking at '13 and '14 projections but I have a feeling you all are looking at that already anyway.
So with all that said, we do continue on a very positive path in other aspects of our long-term strategy as well. Our transmission efforts continue to move forward. As examples, we are now turning dirt on some significant projects of a cell substation in Ohio, that's a $239 million investment; a $200 million project in Indiana; and another $200 million of major projects throughout our Transcos, as well as the Prairie Wind construction is now turning dirt. So we're starting that process of construction that really can provide the earnings growth for the future.
We are very disappointed in the order yesterday regarding the Pioneer Project. Both the technical and factual basis, we believe, was not fully recognized in the order. The new line doesn't even interconnect with the EPSCO, only Duke and AEP. And you can't interconnect AEP's 765 KV into an EPSCO's 138 KV system. That's -- technically, that just doesn't work very well. And that we have a substation pretty close to that, that's accommodating to our 765 KV. So really, look at those factual issues needs to be revisited. Overall, a decision really sends a wrong message to promoters of transmission solutions. So we're evaluating our options on this as we go forward, but certainly we'll make our position known both publicly and probably through filings as well.
However, this doesn't impact the AEP earnings forecast for transmission because as we described earlier, we're repositioning the transmission business to focus on short-term, as well as long-term projects to provide the critical mass for earnings growth, so we have plenty of projects to take its place. That project management discussion we had earlier, along with the amount of projects that are being placed in near-term perspective from a Transco and other longer term projects perspectives, we'll be able to certainly focus on an earnings path and secure that for the future.
So we spent so much time on Ohio. We forget there are other state regulatory matters that are moving forward. Our Indiana rate case, the $170 million rate case, has concluded as hearings and we expect an order by the end of 2012. Intervener exceptions are due August 15. We submitted our version of what the order should look like, so we'll look to that toward the end of this year. The Turk ultra supercritical pulverized coal station is now 92% complete, and we're looking forward to the first fire in the boilers so that we can move on with getting that unit to operational and into rates in those various jurisdictions.
Also, we continue our focus on further developing our EPA response plans. We now estimate our capital spend to be approximately $6 billion, could be a little bit higher than that but nominally, $6 billion over the next 5-or-so years to accommodate the retrofits and retirements of our generation facilities. We continue to be focused on legislation to provide for a 2-year extension so that we can ensure reliability and reduce the cost of compliance. That makes a lot of sense for our ultimate customers and the economy in general.
And lastly, I'll talk about our repositioning study. We have engaged MacKenzie and Associates to work with us on our plan to refocus our business on growth and efficiency of operations and enable us to do -- to continue to prioritize our business functions around the opco [operating company] model and the growth engines of transmission and the development of competitive businesses. Our growth will continue to be fueled by the regulated business, but we must optimize our cost structure to enable more investment for earnings growth. We expect to conclude this study by the end of the year, with sustainable -- with a sustainable process and organizational value that begins in 2013. So again, all eyes are on August 8. We assume and then expect -- we expect expedient and deliberate execution and progress toward the strategic goals that we've discussed. 
And now, I'll turn it over to Brian."
135470,214165493,328497,"American Electric Power Co., Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 20, 2012",2012-07-20,"Earnings Calls","American Electric Power Company, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Nick. Turning to Slide 4. Operating earnings for the second quarter were $370 million, up $18 million from the prior year's level of $352 million. This resulted in earnings per share of $0.77 for the quarter, an increase of $0.04 per share from",2147,"Thank you, Nick. Turning to Slide 4. Operating earnings for the second quarter were $370 million, up $18 million from the prior year's level of $352 million. This resulted in earnings per share of $0.77 for the quarter, an increase of $0.04 per share from the second quarter of 2011. 
In summary, the favorable effect of lower O&M expense was partially offset by an increase in the impact of customer switching to alternative electric suppliers in Ohio.
The quarter-on-quarter detail shows a decline in earnings per share of $0.08 related to the level of customer switching. In addition, this year's results were adversely affected by last year's October unfavorable decision on remand from the Public Utility Commission of Ohio related to POLR service. Last year's results included POLR revenues, while this year's do not. These unfavorable drivers were more than offset by lower O&M expense and favorable other items. O&M expense was down for the quarter, adding $0.13 per share to earnings. The lower O&M reflects decreased planned outage work and lower storm expenses compared to 2011. In addition, the unfavorable variance in O&M spending reflects management efforts to maintain tight controls on spending across the organization. The $0.04 per share improvement in other items reflects the favorable effect of a partial reversal of a 2011 fuel provision in Ohio. 
At the beginning of the call, Nick mentioned the devastating storms that hit our eastern service territory beginning on June 29. In addition to being destructive, the storms were also costly. As Nick said, current estimates of the storms' total cost were about $230 million, spread across our Eastern operating companies. We believe approximately $70 million will be classified as capital and will be recovered in various future rate proceedings. Of the remaining $160 million of O&M, we believe we'll ultimately be able to defer for future recovery up to $130 million. We recognize $4 million in expenses related to the series of storm in the second quarter, leaving an estimated remaining expense for the third quarter of about $26 million.
Turning to Slide 5. Operating earnings for the year-to-date period were $759 million, up $15 million from last year's level of $744 million. This resulted in earnings per share of $1.57 for the year-to-date, an increase of $0.02 per share from 2011. 
Similar to our discussion of the second quarter results, the year-to-date results reflect favorable lower O&M expense, offset by the effect of customer switching in Ohio, the unfavorable POLR decision and mild first quarter weather. In detail, weather adversely affected the year-on-year results by $0.12 per share. While the weather impact in the second quarter was comparable, the effect of the mild winter throughout our service territory is evident in the year-to-date results. Customer switching for the first 6 months of the year was -- has lowered earnings by $0.13 per share. By the end of June, 34% of AEP Ohio load had switched to alternative suppliers. The effect of the unfavorable POLR decision adversely affected earnings by $0.10 per share.
On the positive side, rate changes net of POLR have supported earnings by $0.07 per share; O&M expenses are favorable by $0.25 per share, driven by lower spending related to planned outages and our overall efforts to control costs; finally, other items added $0.05 per share to the results, largely due to the partial reversal of the 2011 fuel provision in Ohio.
On Slide 6, you'll see on the bottom right quadrant that weather-normalized total retail sales were up 1% for the quarter and 3/10 of 1% for the year-to-date period. The growth is coming from sales to the commercial and industrial classes, while normalized residential sales continue to struggle.
Before I get into the period variances by customer class, let me give you an overview of the economy in our service territory. We continue to see economic improvement, although the growth is not evenly distributed across our service areas. One of the best indicators of relative strength of the local economy is employment growth. 
Over the past 3 months, employment growth in AEP's metropolitan areas has increased 2%, which is better than it's been over the past year and stronger than the 1.4% employment growth for the U.S. in total. 
The employment situation remains weaker in our eastern service territories, where there are approximately 91,000 fewer jobs than before the recession began, and the unemployment rate is 7.9%. That being said, employment growth in our East Region is up 1.8% over the past 3 months.
Job growth in our western service territory has been stronger. Over the past 3 months, employment growth in our Western Region has been 2.3% above last year. Current numbers indicate there are 17,000 more jobs than when the recession began. The strongest improvement has been in Texas, with job growth of 2.9% over the past 12 months, and current employment numbers indicate there are 26,000 more jobs now than at the prerecession peak. 
Now let's look at the customer classes. The industrial sector posted the ninth consecutive quarter of growth since the recession. Industrial sales are up 1.8% for the quarter and 2% for the year, driven by strong activity in the oil and gas and transportation equipment manufacturing sectors. I'll talk more about this in more detail on the next slide.
On the top right of the slide, AEP sales to commercial customers grew 1.6% for the second quarter and are 6/10 of 1% up for the year. Commercial sales growth closely tracks employment growth. The employment growth we discussed earlier is driving the recovery we are experiencing in this class. Not surprisingly, commercial sales have been stronger in our West Region and especially in Texas where the job growth has been the strongest.
AEP's weather-normalized sales to residential customers were down 1.9% for the quarter and 2.4% year-to-date. Part of this is driven by customer accounts. In our eastern service territory, we have approximately 4,000 fewer customers than we had last year. Our Texas properties experienced a notable increase in residential customer counts. This was related to strong employment and population growth.
The chart on Page 7 shows the growth in industrial sales for our 5 largest sectors. As you can see, year-to-date growth in primary metals is 1.4%, yet  sales to the sector declined in the second quarter. Our largest metals customer was still ramping up to full production during the first quarter of last year. More recent data shows that the primary metals sector has stabilized at roughly 75% of the prerecession level. 
Also on this chart, you'll notice that sales in the petroleum and coal products sector had been improving, with sales up 8% in the second quarter and 7.1% for the year-to-date period. While growth in this sector has been solid across our territory, there was a major expansion at a refinery in East Texas that drove much of the growth for the quarter. 
Besides the sectors shown on the chart, we are also seeing impressive growth in a couple of other sectors. Oil and gas extraction sales are up 1.3% for the quarter and 3.9% year-to-date. In addition to new customers, several existing customers have expanded their current operations. Most of these expansions are related to the shale gas activity, particularly in our Wheeling,  West Virginia and Texas territories. 
The transportation equipment manufacturing sector, which represents 4.2% of the company's industrial sales, has also demonstrated a significant increase of 10.9% for the quarter and 8.7% for the year-to-date period. This improvement is related to U.S. auto sales, which reached their prerecession annualized levels earlier this year. We have experienced load growth at existing automotive manufacturers in West Virginia and Louisiana. In addition, drivers in the U.S. are maintaining and not replacing their vehicles as often as they used to. This has resulted in growth at some of our motor vehicle parts manufacturers, especially in Michigan and Ohio. 
Turning to Slide 8, you can see that as the company's coal capacity factors have decreased on a quarterly and year-to-date basis, our natural gas capacity factors have increased. For both  quarterly and annual periods, our generation from natural gas has increased approximately 80%. For our East combined cycle units, the increase in capacity factors and generation is even more pronounced. With the addition of the Dresden generation facility to our Waterford and Warrensburg plants, East combined cycle generation has increased 250% for the quarter and 181% for the year-to-date period. With year-to-date capacity factors for these plants approaching 70%, the ability to realize incremental coal-to-gas switching within our Eastern fleet is reduced.
This switching and the general pricing environment for coal, natural gas and electricity has led to an increase in our coal inventory from 45 days at the end of the first quarter to 48 days at the end of the second quarter. This is about 6 days more inventory than at the end of the second quarter of last year. Our coal needs for 2012 are fully hedged and our needs for 2013 are about 90% hedged with many units fully hedged.
On Slide 9, you will see that our balance sheet, credit metrics and liquidity remained strong. Our debt to total capitalization has remained fairly constant over the last 3 quarters and currently stands at 55.2%. Our FFO to interest coverage and our FFO to total debt remain solidly BBB for a company with AEP's business risk profile. The company's net available liquidity stands at $2.8 billion, and is supported by our 2 large credit facilities, which mature in June of 2015 and July of 2016. 
That being said, there are some pending developments that could impact the credit quality of Ohio Power Company, specifically, the capacity case allows for the deferral of the difference between $189 a megawatt day and the RPM price. It is our belief that the ESP order will address the recovery mechanism for the deferral of these costs in addition to other items. Unfortunately, at this point, we do not know how or when the deferral will be recovered. Both timing and recovery are important items in determining the credit outlook.
The credit risks for Ohio Power had been outlined by all 3 rating agencies. Earlier this month, S&P issued a bulletin immediately after the capacity order, stating that while there are no immediate effects on ratings, they considered deferrals of changes and capacity prices to be unsupportive of credit quality because cash flow would decline and could result in financial measures inconsistent with the current rating. We have informed stakeholders about the importance of supporting investment grade ratings for Ohio Power. In addition, the balance sheet for this company is able to absorb some level of deferrals, especially if we are able to begin recovery of our deferred fuel costs and securitize our existing regulatory asset balances. These last 2 items will be credit supportive. They are likely both positive and negative items to appear on the credit scorecard for Ohio Power, yet the overall tally is not known. 
However, our metrics are solid today and we have a focus on reducing our business risk in Ohio through the transfer of 2 large plants to regulated affiliates, sizing our cost structure to a competitive environment and hedging our output. As Nick said, we are committed to investment grade credit and at this time do not see the need for additional equity beyond the DRIP due to some flexibility in our capital spend profile and securitization opportunities in both Ohio and West Virginia. Our Ohio team is working hard to achieve an outcome in our ESP case that preserves the financial strength of Ohio Power and our new competitive generation company.           
Turning to Slide 10, for the remainder of 2012, I have already detailed the estimated cost impacts of the late June and early July storms. We have shown where the economy is recovering in our service territories and the resulting impact on load. The industrial and commercial load classes are headed in the right direction, yet recent residential load trends had been weak. Regulatory uncertainty in Ohio has been a concern for the AEP story for some time. In early June, we started to get some clarity on Ohio regulatory outcomes, but a big piece of that picture is expected to come with an order in early August. We are working hard to get a reasonable outcome. Our earnings so far this year had been the result of positive non-Ohio utility performance and expense discipline, offsetting earnings challenges in Ohio. We will maintain that discipline. Most of all, we are looking forward to being able to share with you a plan in Ohio that has a clear, reasonable transition to a competitive generation model and a stable regulated wires company with a financially sound AEP Ohio throughout the transition period.
With that, I will turn the call over to the operator for questions."

We have to have a view going forward of sustainable reductions that provide us a base where we can continue to progress as a company. So that's what we're really focused on.

And of course, we continue to work, as I said, on the legislative side because EPRI has done an independent analysis showing that it cost 1/3 less if you wind up with a 2-year extension if you're able to optimize that. But I think it's important for us to go through the process in concert with the states, and it really focuses on that operating company model where we're working with them to determine what the proper solution is. And you're right, we are -- we continue to search and as you see some of the changes that have been made, such as with the Big Sandy scrubber proposal being pulled at this point, we're reevaluating that, we have some activity in Oklahoma around coal-fired generation as well that we've adjusted to do. You'll continue to see those kinds of adjustments because what we're trying to get to is: number one, a portfolio that each of our operating jurisdictions support; and then secondly, a portfolio that provides some risk management around a balanced portfolio going forward. So for us, it's a relatively high hurdle for us to be putting scrubbers on our facilities. In some -- in many cases, it's already done. In some cases, it continues to be an evaluation, even for units such as the 1,300-megawatt units at Rockford. Paul Chodak over at I&M is working with the regulators to determine what the proper opportunities are for that so that we can meet the emission reduction guidelines, and that's being discussed in all of our jurisdictions. So you bring up a great point, and that's something that we're very focused on. And we'll continue to try to optimize, matter of fact, when we first started this process, we were looking at $8 billion, and it's come down to just over $6 billion, and we expect it to continue to be refined as we go forward in concert with the states."

And generally, around that 70% to 80% capacity factor, I think, which is sort of amazing, given what we're dealing with. I think from a coal-fired generation perspective, it's dropped off considerably. As long as you're -- we're not having sub-$3 per MBTU price, the capacity on the gas units are going to be -- continuing to be high. There's no capacity constraints that we have on the gas units at this point in time. And I think our numbers were slightly down last month because that's when we took some outages on some of the gas units. But we are pleased with our gas capacity factors and our ability to respond, actually. What we're -- and just as an additional add-on to that, we are continuing to be concerned about the reliability implications or what the EPA is doing because one thing we haven't talked about is the capacity factors of those small, older coal-fired units that are depending -- dependent upon during the peak. As we had last year, these units are being called on and connected to the system 54% of the time and are running in the order of 30% capacity factor during these peak months. So they're still needed. And we're going to have to work through that process. And even with those committed to provide the peak, and obviously they have minimum run-time obligations and minimum load obligations, we still achieved almost 80% capacity factor on the gas units. So that pretty well tells you we're really switching back and forth based upon what the peak requirements are but utilizing the energy component through the natural gas as much as we can."

Is that really core to AEP? I mean, is what AEP really good at is from running a regulated business and that as you migrate towards more of a merchant model in Ohio and more competitive model, do  you wonder about whether that's really non-core to what your strengths are and that whether those businesses really fit within the broader bubble of AEP?"

We have -- we still have one of the most outstanding wholesale trading operations there is in the country. We're going to put that together with a retail organization and make sure there is a competitive business that's viable for the future. Now, the decision will be made later as to whether that makes sense for us or not. But it'll be based upon, as we've said, the February 10 meeting. If we can make it look quasi-regulated, where there's long-term contracts, there's hedging associated with the activities and the market sees that we have a business that makes sense for us in the future, then that -- we'll continue with it. But I think it's important for us to rationalize that process over the next 2 to 3 years and fully understand what that business looks like. The other issue, too, is we don't know what happens across the country or what happens in the next 2 to 3 years in various fundamentals or whether states go to competition or elsewhere. So it really winds up being a very credible option for us in the future. Hopefully, it'll be complementary.

The overall, we had another good quarter for AEP. We produced GAAP and operating earnings of $0.75 and $0.77 a share, respectively, and brought our year-to-date earnings to $1.55 and $1.57 per share, respectively. So it turned out",2035,"Thank you, Chuck Zebula. The overall, we had another good quarter for AEP. We produced GAAP and operating earnings of $0.75 and $0.77 a share, respectively, and brought our year-to-date earnings to $1.55 and $1.57 per share, respectively. So it turned out to be a pretty good quarter for us. And as Brian will discuss in more detail a little bit later, our service territory continues to show progress. Although very tenuous in the economic recovery, we continue to see industrial growth driven by primary metals and oil and gas activities, but we're now also seeing commercial growth for the first time in years. Residential continues to lag, so we're hopeful that the economy will continue to improve and show that sustainability, particularly from an industrial standpoint, manufacturing as well as moving to the commercial side of things and then residential will pick up as well. So hopefully this economy will continue to make progress. I know that everyone's focused on the election during this time of the year and hopefully, we'll have a return of optimism that will permeate through the economy that we deal with.
Looking at the quarter, it really does show the discipline of cost control and the diversity of the AEP system to overcome the challenges, in particular related to Ohio where our loss of the POLR charges and customer switching. Ohio has not been a good story for AEP over the last year or so, and -- but we're working really hard to turn this around. All of our other state jurisdictions have improved over the last year, but as you all know, all eyes are on Ohio and very focused on August, which we believe is August 8. 
Before getting into Ohio and other issues, I want to reiterate that our strategy we put before you on February 10 is still intact and it really does bear repeating. The major issues that we're focused on is certainly movement to the competitive market in Ohio, with corporate separation and the formation of our competitive generation in retail and wholesale trading and marketing functions. That's going to be key for us to execute for in the future after we get this August 8 to order. 
Investment in our regulated businesses. We will continue to invest in our regulated businesses. And as we've described, just that investment will provide for continued commitment to the growth of 4% to 6% from an earnings perspective. And we'll continue to focus on growth in our transmission business as well and repositioning that business around the critical mass to make sure earnings provide in near term, as well as long-term. And that dividend strength certainly is secured by the regulated businesses as we go forward as well.
So as we transform ourselves, certainly we'll transform from a resource perspective as well. Our generation resources in response to the EPA and certainly from the price of natural gas and other fundamental conditions out there will continue to change. But we're very focused on providing plans to really emerge as a more diversified fleet as we go forward.
So all -- so as we looked at some of the issues that we deal with during the year, it became apparent that these basic strategy components remain a focus and will really enable us to look ahead to the execution as necessary reposition the company for the future. 
I've been CEO for about 8 months now and have been fortunate to preside over 2 of the most damaging storms in AEP's history. One, what I would call a regulated storm and the other, a weather-related storm. Let me cover the weather-related storm first, which I had never heard of before the storm actually occurred, a super derecho, which occurred in late, late June. I've never heard of it, but I'll certainly focus. During the day, it was a 10% chance of thunderstorms. Well, that was a pretty damaging 10%. 6 of AEP states from Indiana to Virginia were affected and some 1.4 million customers. And additional 300,000 customers were affected in the follow-up storms that ensued. We marshaled crews from our Western footprint and certainly from the indigenous operating companies that were affected, but also all of the country, from California and elsewhere, and in Canada as well to support the restoration efforts. I'm very proud of our response. And our management team, included -- including myself, visited with crews working throughout our various states to make absolutely sure that the necessary resources were dedicated, restoring power to our customers. Working for almost 2 weeks, 16-hour days and almost a 100-degree heat was an extreme challenge that I'm confident that we performed and executed well from an operational and a safety perspective. 
The storm was expensive, approximately $230 million, much of which will be deferred for future recovery as Brian will provide more detail on a little bit later, but it is and in an odd and perhaps, morbid way, it gave the management team a brief reprieve from the challenges of the other storm that occurred -- the regulated storm we call Ohio. So let's talk about that one. 
These clouds are starting to clear up as well. The capacity order of the PCO demonstrated a couple of major points. The Commission is focused on providing competitors the ability to compete quickly for customers by putting in place RPM pricing provisions. And they're also focused on the financial integrity of AEP, evidenced by the capacity cost being set at 189 per megawatt day, with the deferral mechanism to be resolved in the ESP filing. That's the first step. So after a significant belly blow in February, AEP is back on its feet and have taken the first step. Now comes the important part, the second step to demonstrate that we're walking again before we run. The August order, we presume, will come out August 8. That order for the ESP will need to -- needs to define several key issues: the deferral mechanism for the capacity cost delta from the RPM rates; the level of the RSR, the rate stability rider, to ensure the financial integrity of AEP; the distribution investment rider. And we'll also need to define the start of the recovery of the deferred fuel that's been on the books for quite a while. The other major issue is corporate separation. We'll need to get the approval for that, and we expect that as well. 
Overall, we need to address the financial needs of AEP Ohio and the ensuing corporate separation to ensure the credit quality and the cash requirements are met for the emerging entities. You can't start a generation company with a fistful of deferral IOUs. We must have cash as well to solidify the balance sheets of the Genco and AEP Ohio going forward.
So make no mistake. Your AEP is focused on emerging from this storm with a financially secure company and a clarification of execution to move toward a competitive market in Ohio. The development of our retail effort continues to move forward positively. I recently visited our team in Chicago, the former BlueStar team, and they are very focused on advancing the retail efforts, but they're also focused on margins. That's one key issue I'm not interested in signing up every customer we can sign up. I'm interested in margins associated with that because we are providing a hedge, ultimately for the generation that separated, so we want to maximize value associated with that.
So now we need the structural pieces of the unregulated generation fleet to fall into place so that we can effectively hedge and compete so that this supply. And as we discussed with you all in February, so for AEP, all of our sites are set on moving forward. We continue to see 4% to 6% long-term growth, dividend supported by the regulated companies and do not perceive the issuance of equity during this transition. We are not likely to issue guidance until after the commission renders an order on any rehearing request so by then, we may be looking at '13 and '14 projections but I have a feeling you all are looking at that already anyway.
So with all that said, we do continue on a very positive path in other aspects of our long-term strategy as well. Our transmission efforts continue to move forward. As examples, we are now turning dirt on some significant projects of a cell substation in Ohio, that's a $239 million investment; a $200 million project in Indiana; and another $200 million of major projects throughout our Transcos, as well as the Prairie Wind construction is now turning dirt. So we're starting that process of construction that really can provide the earnings growth for the future.
We are very disappointed in the order yesterday regarding the Pioneer Project. Both the technical and factual basis, we believe, was not fully recognized in the order. The new line doesn't even interconnect with the EPSCO, only Duke and AEP. And you can't interconnect AEP's 765 KV into an EPSCO's 138 KV system. That's -- technically, that just doesn't work very well. And that we have a substation pretty close to that, that's accommodating to our 765 KV. So really, look at those factual issues needs to be revisited. Overall, a decision really sends a wrong message to promoters of transmission solutions. So we're evaluating our options on this as we go forward, but certainly we'll make our position known both publicly and probably through filings as well.
However, this doesn't impact the AEP earnings forecast for transmission because as we described earlier, we're repositioning the transmission business to focus on short-term, as well as long-term projects to provide the critical mass for earnings growth, so we have plenty of projects to take its place. That project management discussion we had earlier, along with the amount of projects that are being placed in near-term perspective from a Transco and other longer term projects perspectives, we'll be able to certainly focus on an earnings path and secure that for the future.
So we spent so much time on Ohio. We forget there are other state regulatory matters that are moving forward. Our Indiana rate case, the $170 million rate case, has concluded as hearings and we expect an order by the end of 2012. Intervener exceptions are due August 15. We submitted our version of what the order should look like, so we'll look to that toward the end of this year. The Turk ultra supercritical pulverized coal station is now 92% complete, and we're looking forward to the first fire in the boilers so that we can move on with getting that unit to operational and into rates in those various jurisdictions.
Also, we continue our focus on further developing our EPA response plans. We now estimate our capital spend to be approximately $6 billion, could be a little bit higher than that but nominally, $6 billion over the next 5-or-so years to accommodate the retrofits and retirements of our generation facilities. We continue to be focused on legislation to provide for a 2-year extension so that we can ensure reliability and reduce the cost of compliance. That makes a lot of sense for our ultimate customers and the economy in general.
And lastly, I'll talk about our repositioning study. We have engaged MacKenzie and Associates to work with us on our plan to refocus our business on growth and efficiency of operations and enable us to do -- to continue to prioritize our business functions around the opco [operating company] model and the growth engines of transmission and the development of competitive businesses. Our growth will continue to be fueled by the regulated business, but we must optimize our cost structure to enable more investment for earnings growth. We expect to conclude this study by the end of the year, with sustainable -- with a sustainable process and organizational value that begins in 2013. So again, all eyes are on August 8. We assume and then expect -- we expect expedient and deliberate execution and progress toward the strategic goals that we've discussed. 
And now, I'll turn it over to Brian."
135470,214165493,328741,"American Electric Power Co., Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 20, 2012",2012-07-20,"Earnings Calls","American Electric Power Company, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Nick. Turning to Slide 4. Operating earnings for the second quarter were $370 million, up $18 million from the prior year's level of $352 million. This resulted in earnings per share of $0.77 for the quarter, an increase of $0.04 per share from",2147,"Thank you, Nick. Turning to Slide 4. Operating earnings for the second quarter were $370 million, up $18 million from the prior year's level of $352 million. This resulted in earnings per share of $0.77 for the quarter, an increase of $0.04 per share from the second quarter of 2011. 
In summary, the favorable effect of lower O&M expense was partially offset by an increase in the impact of customer switching to alternative electric suppliers in Ohio.
The quarter-on-quarter detail shows a decline in earnings per share of $0.08 related to the level of customer switching. In addition, this year's results were adversely affected by last year's October unfavorable decision on remand from the Public Utility Commission of Ohio related to POLR service. Last year's results included POLR revenues, while this year's do not. These unfavorable drivers were more than offset by lower O&M expense and favorable other items. O&M expense was down for the quarter, adding $0.13 per share to earnings. The lower O&M reflects decreased planned outage work and lower storm expenses compared to 2011. In addition, the unfavorable variance in O&M spending reflects management efforts to maintain tight controls on spending across the organization. The $0.04 per share improvement in other items reflects the favorable effect of a partial reversal of a 2011 fuel provision in Ohio. 
At the beginning of the call, Nick mentioned the devastating storms that hit our eastern service territory beginning on June 29. In addition to being destructive, the storms were also costly. As Nick said, current estimates of the storms' total cost were about $230 million, spread across our Eastern operating companies. We believe approximately $70 million will be classified as capital and will be recovered in various future rate proceedings. Of the remaining $160 million of O&M, we believe we'll ultimately be able to defer for future recovery up to $130 million. We recognize $4 million in expenses related to the series of storm in the second quarter, leaving an estimated remaining expense for the third quarter of about $26 million.
Turning to Slide 5. Operating earnings for the year-to-date period were $759 million, up $15 million from last year's level of $744 million. This resulted in earnings per share of $1.57 for the year-to-date, an increase of $0.02 per share from 2011. 
Similar to our discussion of the second quarter results, the year-to-date results reflect favorable lower O&M expense, offset by the effect of customer switching in Ohio, the unfavorable POLR decision and mild first quarter weather. In detail, weather adversely affected the year-on-year results by $0.12 per share. While the weather impact in the second quarter was comparable, the effect of the mild winter throughout our service territory is evident in the year-to-date results. Customer switching for the first 6 months of the year was -- has lowered earnings by $0.13 per share. By the end of June, 34% of AEP Ohio load had switched to alternative suppliers. The effect of the unfavorable POLR decision adversely affected earnings by $0.10 per share.
On the positive side, rate changes net of POLR have supported earnings by $0.07 per share; O&M expenses are favorable by $0.25 per share, driven by lower spending related to planned outages and our overall efforts to control costs; finally, other items added $0.05 per share to the results, largely due to the partial reversal of the 2011 fuel provision in Ohio.
On Slide 6, you'll see on the bottom right quadrant that weather-normalized total retail sales were up 1% for the quarter and 3/10 of 1% for the year-to-date period. The growth is coming from sales to the commercial and industrial classes, while normalized residential sales continue to struggle.
Before I get into the period variances by customer class, let me give you an overview of the economy in our service territory. We continue to see economic improvement, although the growth is not evenly distributed across our service areas. One of the best indicators of relative strength of the local economy is employment growth. 
Over the past 3 months, employment growth in AEP's metropolitan areas has increased 2%, which is better than it's been over the past year and stronger than the 1.4% employment growth for the U.S. in total. 
The employment situation remains weaker in our eastern service territories, where there are approximately 91,000 fewer jobs than before the recession began, and the unemployment rate is 7.9%. That being said, employment growth in our East Region is up 1.8% over the past 3 months.
Job growth in our western service territory has been stronger. Over the past 3 months, employment growth in our Western Region has been 2.3% above last year. Current numbers indicate there are 17,000 more jobs than when the recession began. The strongest improvement has been in Texas, with job growth of 2.9% over the past 12 months, and current employment numbers indicate there are 26,000 more jobs now than at the prerecession peak. 
Now let's look at the customer classes. The industrial sector posted the ninth consecutive quarter of growth since the recession. Industrial sales are up 1.8% for the quarter and 2% for the year, driven by strong activity in the oil and gas and transportation equipment manufacturing sectors. I'll talk more about this in more detail on the next slide.
On the top right of the slide, AEP sales to commercial customers grew 1.6% for the second quarter and are 6/10 of 1% up for the year. Commercial sales growth closely tracks employment growth. The employment growth we discussed earlier is driving the recovery we are experiencing in this class. Not surprisingly, commercial sales have been stronger in our West Region and especially in Texas where the job growth has been the strongest.
AEP's weather-normalized sales to residential customers were down 1.9% for the quarter and 2.4% year-to-date. Part of this is driven by customer accounts. In our eastern service territory, we have approximately 4,000 fewer customers than we had last year. Our Texas properties experienced a notable increase in residential customer counts. This was related to strong employment and population growth.
The chart on Page 7 shows the growth in industrial sales for our 5 largest sectors. As you can see, year-to-date growth in primary metals is 1.4%, yet  sales to the sector declined in the second quarter. Our largest metals customer was still ramping up to full production during the first quarter of last year. More recent data shows that the primary metals sector has stabilized at roughly 75% of the prerecession level. 
Also on this chart, you'll notice that sales in the petroleum and coal products sector had been improving, with sales up 8% in the second quarter and 7.1% for the year-to-date period. While growth in this sector has been solid across our territory, there was a major expansion at a refinery in East Texas that drove much of the growth for the quarter. 
Besides the sectors shown on the chart, we are also seeing impressive growth in a couple of other sectors. Oil and gas extraction sales are up 1.3% for the quarter and 3.9% year-to-date. In addition to new customers, several existing customers have expanded their current operations. Most of these expansions are related to the shale gas activity, particularly in our Wheeling,  West Virginia and Texas territories. 
The transportation equipment manufacturing sector, which represents 4.2% of the company's industrial sales, has also demonstrated a significant increase of 10.9% for the quarter and 8.7% for the year-to-date period. This improvement is related to U.S. auto sales, which reached their prerecession annualized levels earlier this year. We have experienced load growth at existing automotive manufacturers in West Virginia and Louisiana. In addition, drivers in the U.S. are maintaining and not replacing their vehicles as often as they used to. This has resulted in growth at some of our motor vehicle parts manufacturers, especially in Michigan and Ohio. 
Turning to Slide 8, you can see that as the company's coal capacity factors have decreased on a quarterly and year-to-date basis, our natural gas capacity factors have increased. For both  quarterly and annual periods, our generation from natural gas has increased approximately 80%. For our East combined cycle units, the increase in capacity factors and generation is even more pronounced. With the addition of the Dresden generation facility to our Waterford and Warrensburg plants, East combined cycle generation has increased 250% for the quarter and 181% for the year-to-date period. With year-to-date capacity factors for these plants approaching 70%, the ability to realize incremental coal-to-gas switching within our Eastern fleet is reduced.
This switching and the general pricing environment for coal, natural gas and electricity has led to an increase in our coal inventory from 45 days at the end of the first quarter to 48 days at the end of the second quarter. This is about 6 days more inventory than at the end of the second quarter of last year. Our coal needs for 2012 are fully hedged and our needs for 2013 are about 90% hedged with many units fully hedged.
On Slide 9, you will see that our balance sheet, credit metrics and liquidity remained strong. Our debt to total capitalization has remained fairly constant over the last 3 quarters and currently stands at 55.2%. Our FFO to interest coverage and our FFO to total debt remain solidly BBB for a company with AEP's business risk profile. The company's net available liquidity stands at $2.8 billion, and is supported by our 2 large credit facilities, which mature in June of 2015 and July of 2016. 
That being said, there are some pending developments that could impact the credit quality of Ohio Power Company, specifically, the capacity case allows for the deferral of the difference between $189 a megawatt day and the RPM price. It is our belief that the ESP order will address the recovery mechanism for the deferral of these costs in addition to other items. Unfortunately, at this point, we do not know how or when the deferral will be recovered. Both timing and recovery are important items in determining the credit outlook.
The credit risks for Ohio Power had been outlined by all 3 rating agencies. Earlier this month, S&P issued a bulletin immediately after the capacity order, stating that while there are no immediate effects on ratings, they considered deferrals of changes and capacity prices to be unsupportive of credit quality because cash flow would decline and could result in financial measures inconsistent with the current rating. We have informed stakeholders about the importance of supporting investment grade ratings for Ohio Power. In addition, the balance sheet for this company is able to absorb some level of deferrals, especially if we are able to begin recovery of our deferred fuel costs and securitize our existing regulatory asset balances. These last 2 items will be credit supportive. They are likely both positive and negative items to appear on the credit scorecard for Ohio Power, yet the overall tally is not known. 
However, our metrics are solid today and we have a focus on reducing our business risk in Ohio through the transfer of 2 large plants to regulated affiliates, sizing our cost structure to a competitive environment and hedging our output. As Nick said, we are committed to investment grade credit and at this time do not see the need for additional equity beyond the DRIP due to some flexibility in our capital spend profile and securitization opportunities in both Ohio and West Virginia. Our Ohio team is working hard to achieve an outcome in our ESP case that preserves the financial strength of Ohio Power and our new competitive generation company.           
Turning to Slide 10, for the remainder of 2012, I have already detailed the estimated cost impacts of the late June and early July storms. We have shown where the economy is recovering in our service territories and the resulting impact on load. The industrial and commercial load classes are headed in the right direction, yet recent residential load trends had been weak. Regulatory uncertainty in Ohio has been a concern for the AEP story for some time. In early June, we started to get some clarity on Ohio regulatory outcomes, but a big piece of that picture is expected to come with an order in early August. We are working hard to get a reasonable outcome. Our earnings so far this year had been the result of positive non-Ohio utility performance and expense discipline, offsetting earnings challenges in Ohio. We will maintain that discipline. Most of all, we are looking forward to being able to share with you a plan in Ohio that has a clear, reasonable transition to a competitive generation model and a stable regulated wires company with a financially sound AEP Ohio throughout the transition period.
With that, I will turn the call over to the operator for questions."

We have to have a view going forward of sustainable reductions that provide us a base where we can continue to progress as a company. So that's what we're really focused on.

And of course, we continue to work, as I said, on the legislative side because EPRI has done an independent analysis showing that it cost 1/3 less if you wind up with a 2-year extension if you're able to optimize that. But I think it's important for us to go through the process in concert with the states, and it really focuses on that operating company model where we're working with them to determine what the proper solution is. And you're right, we are -- we continue to search and as you see some of the changes that have been made, such as with the Big Sandy scrubber proposal being pulled at this point, we're reevaluating that, we have some activity in Oklahoma around coal-fired generation as well that we've adjusted to do. You'll continue to see those kinds of adjustments because what we're trying to get to is: number one, a portfolio that each of our operating jurisdictions support; and then secondly, a portfolio that provides some risk management around a balanced portfolio going forward. So for us, it's a relatively high hurdle for us to be putting scrubbers on our facilities. In some -- in many cases, it's already done. In some cases, it continues to be an evaluation, even for units such as the 1,300-megawatt units at Rockford. Paul Chodak over at I&M is working with the regulators to determine what the proper opportunities are for that so that we can meet the emission reduction guidelines, and that's being discussed in all of our jurisdictions. So you bring up a great point, and that's something that we're very focused on. And we'll continue to try to optimize, matter of fact, when we first started this process, we were looking at $8 billion, and it's come down to just over $6 billion, and we expect it to continue to be refined as we go forward in concert with the states."

And generally, around that 70% to 80% capacity factor, I think, which is sort of amazing, given what we're dealing with. I think from a coal-fired generation perspective, it's dropped off considerably. As long as you're -- we're not having sub-$3 per MBTU price, the capacity on the gas units are going to be -- continuing to be high. There's no capacity constraints that we have on the gas units at this point in time. And I think our numbers were slightly down last month because that's when we took some outages on some of the gas units. But we are pleased with our gas capacity factors and our ability to respond, actually. What we're -- and just as an additional add-on to that, we are continuing to be concerned about the reliability implications or what the EPA is doing because one thing we haven't talked about is the capacity factors of those small, older coal-fired units that are depending -- dependent upon during the peak. As we had last year, these units are being called on and connected to the system 54% of the time and are running in the order of 30% capacity factor during these peak months. So they're still needed. And we're going to have to work through that process. And even with those committed to provide the peak, and obviously they have minimum run-time obligations and minimum load obligations, we still achieved almost 80% capacity factor on the gas units. So that pretty well tells you we're really switching back and forth based upon what the peak requirements are but utilizing the energy component through the natural gas as much as we can."

You've gone out and bought BlueStar and you're now entering a new competitive business, both on the retail and the wholesale side, and I just want to kind of ask that question. Is that really core to AEP? I mean, is what AEP really good at is from running a regulated business and that as you migrate towards more of a merchant model in Ohio and more competitive model, do  you wonder about whether that's really non-core to what your strengths are and that whether those businesses really fit within the broader bubble of AEP?"

We have -- we still have one of the most outstanding wholesale trading operations there is in the country. We're going to put that together with a retail organization and make sure there is a competitive business that's viable for the future. Now, the decision will be made later as to whether that makes sense for us or not. But it'll be based upon, as we've said, the February 10 meeting. If we can make it look quasi-regulated, where there's long-term contracts, there's hedging associated with the activities and the market sees that we have a business that makes sense for us in the future, then that -- we'll continue with it. But I think it's important for us to rationalize that process over the next 2 to 3 years and fully understand what that business looks like. The other issue, too, is we don't know what happens across the country or what happens in the next 2 to 3 years in various fundamentals or whether states go to competition or elsewhere. So it really winds up being a very credible option for us in the future. Hopefully, it'll be complementary.

Now I really call this, these calls a status calls because we now have a long-term strategy that's been in place since Fe",1863,"Okay. Thanks, Chuck, and good morning, everyone, and thank you all very taking the time to join our third quarter 2012 earnings call. Now I really call this, these calls a status calls because we now have a long-term strategy that's been in place since February and we're committed to continuing with that strategy and really describing, taking the opportunity to describe the steps that we've been taking along the way and moving forward with that strategy to not only redefine AEP from a transformational perspective, but also set AEP up for the future. It's also discussion of the environment that we find ourselves in. And -- but most importantly, what we're doing about it. 
Notwithstanding the derecho that certainly had an impact on our service territory, I guess the multiple storms during that period of time were close to 1.8 million customers over 2 weeks, when you have that kind of customer mix with those storms, it's really has an impact on what the electric supply was during that period of time. 
But notwithstanding that, there's no doubt that it was a challenging quarter. In the past couple of years, the accelerators has been pushed to the core on the industrial, covering our service territory, and has gradually been leading up quarter-over-quarter. Until now, this quarter refining the foods of the Excelerator. Fueled by primary metals to the oil and gas activity, we've made great progress in the recovery afterward this session. And now we find from ready metals faltering once again, due to the soft international demand, primarily in the aluminum area, while certainly, oil and gas activity continues to progress. 
So industrial load dropped for the first time in 9 quarters about 3.1%. And half of that was probably in Ormet here in Ohio, were 2 top lines were taken off-line. so it does show that sensitivity around aluminum prices. 
In previous quarters, the Industrials were compensating for residential and commercial decreases. And now we see commercial customer growth still continuing to improve. We saw that for the first time in a few years last quarter, our commercial improvement. That continues. 
But as we said earlier, the economy is continuous at best and we really do have to be concerned about the issues involved in that. And now we're seeing probably the end results of 2012 year-to-date load growth profile being essentially flat for the year. 
So one quarter doesn't make a trend, but we have to be concerned as anytime we see a slowdown in economic activity, some of the issues such as international market conditions, needed Texas regulatory reform and the need for a coherent energy policy are factors that must be resolved this investment enabling recovery. We're hopeful that after the election, we can make some progress on those fronts.
And as Brian will discuss later, despite load growth challenges and the continued loss of Ohio-related revenue due to the movement to competition, we delivered your consensus earnings in the quarter of $1 on a GAAP basis per share and $1.02 operating earnings per share for the third quarter and $2.55 and $2.59 per share, respectively for the 9-month year-to-date. 
How do we overcome the challenges that I just discussed? Well, I think it goes back to the February discussion that we had, diversity of the AEP system is something that's very positive for us. We not only have been controlling costs, which we've done a great job of, we have various other jurisdictions that have produced rate increases. So certainly, when you look at the strength of AEP, it is in that diversity that we keep talking about. There's no sense of whining about economy. It is what this. But we can and to adjust to provide a level of discipline that the market expects.
We know that when the economy truly begins to recovery in a sustainable fashion, the diversity of our system of our customer mix, the fundamental resources, such as shale gas, which is prevalent in our operating footprint, will enable AEP to continue to reach our growth potential.
So we remain committed to our long-term strategy, as discussed with you in February 10 of this year, and I'll talk about it in all the quarterly earnings webcast as well. But I'll reaffirm it here. Certainly, our notions have been around these issues, movement to competitive market in Ohio with corporate separation and the formation of our competitive generation retail and marketing functions. 
Number two, investment in our regulated business and the focus in our OE optimization. Number three, a focus on the growth aspects of the business, such as transmission. And then four, there are reaffirm to your commitment to be a regulated utility going forward. The dividend strength that we have is generated by the regulated businesses, and we are intend on maintaining that, that 86%, 14% mix that we've talked about previously. And a continued commitment to the 4% to 6% earnings growth. Transformation for our generation resources is also a key component particularly in light of EPA mandates and so forth.
So as we -- so as far as providing guidance, we anticipate providing guidance after we received a finer order of the Ohio ESP, which we expect, hopefully, by the end of the year. By then, we'll also complete the repositioning study that we've been involved with. So we're anticipating having a February Analyst Day to provide guidance for 2013. 
At that point, I think the main risk issues that we'll have are really centered around the level of Ohio customer switching and load growth that we see postelection and so forth. So I think we'll be in a better position, much better position, to give guidance at that point in time.
Our operational performance has been excellent. And when you look at the things we actually control. We've done an outstanding job. The repositioning study, I'm very pleased with the progress there, will be completed by the end of the year. And I'm just pleased with the degree of thoughtfulness that the teams have gone through to achieve the objectives and the progress being made. 
We've had 2 or 4 sets of discussions with the 5 teams that are working on this thing. And it's amazing to me that he can have substantial process changes that reposition this company for the future and focus on the growth areas. And we wind up providing a level of service that we continue to maintain. So it is a very good progress there and we fully expect to be able to talk more about that when we get to the February timeframe.
Transmission has just successfully completed a $350 million debt offering, which was fully subscribed. And there was a high degree of interest in it. So it shows that we're moving in the right direction from an investment profile, and we continue to work on our capital allocation to further encourage the growth of our Transmission businesses. 
We continue to focus on the advancement of Transcos in the various jurisdictions. We have 4 Transcos and others are in various levels of ongoing pending actions. So we continue to be hardened by what's going on there as well. 
Our Turk Plant is moving toward completion. We expect our first coal firing, we had a natural gas-fired for startup a couple of months ago, and I was proudly showing the pictures of that. It looks like a gas burner, I guess, I appreciate it more than the others did. But nevertheless, today, we should be seeing the first coal firing. We should see synchronization to the grid of the Turk Plant here in November. And then in December, we'll see it go commercial. So -- and it is a beautiful plant site, being the first ultra-supercritical pulverized coal unit in the nation. And we're very proud of that accomplishment and a political it, you wonder why we can't do these things everywhere.
The rectal area cases related to that, obviously, getting that commercial operation data is critical for us. We follow the case in Texas, and it's ongoing in terms of that jurisdictional recovery there and even with that following, we still have among the lowest rates in Texas. So I think we stand in pretty good favor there in terms of the placement of that plant and what it means for the future for SWEPCO customers.
Other cases, such as the Indiana case, $130 million case filed there. Case hearings have concluded and we expect to have an outcome to that by the end of this year as well. 
So those things aside, probably one of the main things you're interesting in is what's happening in Ohio. During the last quarter, we made considerable progress there. As many of you are aware, the Ohio PCL provided clarity for our transition to your competitive market by issuing ESP orders, capacity orders and corporate separation orders that enable us to move forward with the FERC filings. And the result of those orders have been positive for us in that we can map out a plan for the future, focus on the filing that need to be made at FERC once again, and also pursue the other state filings on the transfers of miscellaneous to APCO and Kentucky Power. So we're focused on those jurisdictions and discussions are ongoing in those areas as well.
So we'll have 6 filings to make, just as we made last time around the areas of separation of the Ohio assets, transfer of Amos, merging, we link into APCO and other termination agreements associated with the pre connection agreement in various joint operating agreements and those types of things. 
So those filings will be made. We anticipate making those filings by the end of those October. So we're moving forward step by step in this process to ensure that we continue the progress that's being made. 
Also, I'm pleased with the progress of AEP Energy, formally AEP Retail business. We put free star and everything else in that business. We now have approximately 150,000 customers, and we continue to focus on margins, not quantity, in a very deliberate, disciplined fashion. So we proceed with separating out our Ohio generation. We'll include that in that part of our business. And I'm very focused on that transition to make sure that it's complete. And I'm very happy to see that, that business continues to progress and they're actually earning their own keeps. That's a great, great story early on in their function. 
So while the economy continues to be a challenge, we have responded with an unwavering focus and commitment to our strategic plan and a disciplined to write shareholder value and quality customer service. And we're very focused on those steps. We'll be very transparent about the steps as we go forward. And like I said, this is viewed as a status call to let you know that progress has indeed been made and the fundamentals are there in our service territory because of diversity that this system is ready to go. 
So I'll turn it over to Brian to give you the details of the third quarter. Brian?"
135470,223136289,368723,"American Electric Power Co., Inc., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Oct 24, 2012",2012-10-24,"Earnings Calls","American Electric Power Company, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Nick, and good morning to everyone. Let's start on slide 4 with the quarter comparison rate see that operating earnings for the third quarter of this year were $496 million, or $1.02 per share, as compared to $566 million or $1.17 per share for",2178,"Thank you, Nick, and good morning to everyone. Let's start on slide 4 with the quarter comparison rate see that operating earnings for the third quarter of this year were $496 million, or $1.02 per share, as compared to $566 million or $1.17 per share for the last year's third quarter. 
Ohio customer switching to the authorized capacity cost deferrals, combined for a negative $0.06 sense comparison to last year's third quarter. In the third quarter of 2011, we recorded a $28 million carrying cost for the TCC stranded capacity auction true-up. Since we securitized this true-up earlier this year, we do not have a comparable amount this quarter, resulting in an unfavorable comparison of $0.04. Although this was the fifth one this third quarter in the last 30 years, last year's third quarter was the warmest during that timeframe. This results some weather having a negative $0.04 per share comparison the last year, but is actually positive $0.07 versus normal weather.
Off-system sales net of sharing were down $20 million, or $0.03 versus last year. Physical volumes and margins were off in response to power prices that averaged 20% below last year, and natural gas prices that were off by over 30%. Trading and marketing results were $5 million lower than last year.
Non-utility Operations and parent results accounted to a negative $0.03 comparison to last year and are mostly explained by the effect on the drought on our River Operations business. Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $32 million and accounted for a negative $0.04 comparison to last year. This was due to the accelerated depreciation at the Ohio plants that we will retire in 2015, increased depreciation rates on several of our jurisdictions, as well as the amortization of the TCC's securitization.
On the positive comparisons, jurisdiction rate changes, net of the loss of the Ohio provider of last resort revenues, added $0.03 per share, or $20 million compared to last year. Our continued focus on spending mentioned several times resulted in operation and maintenance expenses, net of offsets, having a positive comparison of $0.04 per share over last year. Other, including higher Transco and ETT earnings, added $0.02 per share over last year's third quarter.
At this point, I would like to provide an update to the cost treatment related to the June 29 derecho and the 3 smaller storms that occurred during the restoration efforts. The total cost for these storms was approximately $217 million, of which about $62 million were capital and removal costs. Of the remaining $155 million, about $124 million has been deferred for future recovery, leaving about $31 million to be expensed. $4 million were expensed in the second quarter, and the remaining $27 million were expensed in the third quarter.
Turning to Slide 5. I will review the year-to-date comparisons. Operating earnings for the 2012 year-to-date period were $1.255 billion or $2.59 per share, compared to $1.31 billion or $2.72 per share for the year-to-date of 2011. Ohio customer switching, net of authorized capacity deferrals, accounted for a negative $0.19 per share when compared to last year's year-to-date. Approximately 42% of Ohio's load has switched applies, versus approximately 10% of load that has switched by the end of September last year.
Weather provided a negative $0.16 per share comparison to last year for the year-to-date period. This year's mild winter do not compare favorably with the more extreme winter of 2011, and as previously mentioned, while the summer was warm, it was not as warm as last year. However, when compared to normal weather, 2012 year-to-date was favorable by $0.04. 
Non-utility Operations and parent results had the negative comparison to last year of $21 million or $0.04 per share. This was mostly explained by the drought impacts on our River Operations and by the loss of production tax credits in our Texas windfarms.
Depreciation and amortization expenses increased by $101 million, or $0.13 per share for the year-to-date period. And the reasons for this is the same for the quarterly comparison. Year-on-year rate increases from several of our jurisdictions were fully offset by the loss of the Ohio provider of last resort revenues, resulting in no change to the year-to-date period for this category.
Continued disciplined spending resulted in a positive year-to-year O&M comparison of $215 million or $0.28 per share. It is important to remember that this line item is operational and maintenance extent that of revenued greases to convert rate trackers and other contemporary use rate mechanisms.
The remaining positive year-to-date reconciliation of $0.11 per share is explained by higher transmission earnings, the 2012 reversal of a negative fuel provision from the prior year and a lower income tax rate. 
Taking a look at retail load trends on Slide 6, you will see the bottom right hand quadrant that overall weather-normalized retail sales were down 1.4% for the quarter and are now down 3/10 of a percent year-to-date. Before going into the second comparisons, let me provide an overview of the economy in our service territory. On several traditional economic indicators, the AEP service territories outperformed national measures. For example, employment growth rate for AEP's metropolitan areas was up 2.1% for the quarter, versus national employment growth, which was up only 1.4%.
GDP was estimated to grow at 3% for AEP's Metropolitan areas for the quarter, versus 1.8% estimated growth for the U.S. in aggregate. Our Western service territories experienced GDP growth of 3.4%, as compared to the 2.6% growth experienced in the Western portion of our system. These different growth rates exemplify the diversity that. Referred to in his comments. 
Despite these positive comparisons and national indicators, AEP did not escape the realities of the struggling economy. This is evident relooking at the bottom left at quarter end of the slide, where you can see that industrial sales were down 3.1% for the quarter. This development is a concern because as Nick said, it's countered for positive will transfer the previous 9 quarters. 
Industrial sales are now positive 2/10 of a percent for the year-to-date period. We'll explore these customer class in a little more detail in the next slide. Above industrial sales, you will see that weather normalized residential sales declined 5/10 of a percent compared to last year's third quarter. We believe that about half of this negative 5/10 percent was attributable to the derecho. 
While customer counts remained fairly steady at 5.3 million customers, average usage per residential customer declined 7/10 of a percent for the quarter and is down nearly 2% for the year. We believe this is related to state and federal energy and efficiency initiatives and the lingering effects of the economy. 
The commercial customer class was essentially flat for the quarter and is now up 5/10 of a percent for the year-to-date period. We believe that it growth in employment that I mentioned earlier should have a positive impact on the commercial sector in the future. 
Let's take a look at the industrial sales class on Slide 7. You can see that 4 of our top 5 industrial sectors experienced negative trends for the quarter. Nick referenced the primary metals sector, which was down 9.8% for the quarter and is now down 2.5% for the year. Much of this decline is due to our largest customer, which reduced production by 1/3 during the quarter. Excluding this customer, primary matters will down 3.9% for the quarter and 1.4% year-to-date.
The chemical manufacturing sector was down 5% for the quarter and is down 2.2% year-to-date. Nationally, chemical manufacturing is at its lowest level since 2010, due to decreases in worldwide demand.
Mining, excluding oil and gas, is down in response the coal mine closures related to environmental challenges, as well as reduced coal mine production due to low utility demand and the low natural gas prices. On the bright side, petroleum and coal products manufacturing, our third largest industrial sector, was up 6% for the quarter and is now up 6.7% and percent year-to-date. Our largest increase here was in SWEPCO service area, where our larger finer expanded capacity.
Other sectors showing growth are transportation equipment manufacturing, our seventh largest industry, which is up 5.3% for the quarter, related to strong U.S. auto sales, and oil and gas extraction, our our ninth largest industry, which is up 2.6% for the quarter related to shale gas production.
Turning to slide 8, you can see that the company's coal capacity factors have decreased on a quarterly and year-to-date basis, as our natural gas capacity factors have increased. Overall, our generation from natural gas has increased approximately 50% year-to-date.
For our East combined cycle units, the increase in capacity factors and generation is even more pronounced. With the addition of the Dresden generation facility to our Waterford and Lawrenceburg West of our East combined cycle generation has increased 114% for the quarter and 160% for the year-to-date period.
With year-to-date capacity factors for these plants approaching 70% and with the recent increases in the 4 natural gas prices, the ability to realize incremental coal-to-gas switching within our Eastern fleet is minimal. Because of the hot weather, our coal units were in more in the third quarter than in the second quarter and our coal inventory went from 48 days at the end of the second quarter to 45 days at the end of the third quarter. Our target is 35 to 40 days.
Our coal needs for 2012 are fully hedged and our needs for 2013 are about 92% hedged, with many units fully hedged. 
Turning to slide 9, you will find the company's balance sheet credit and liquidity statistics for the end of the third quarter. The balance sheet continues to reflect our conservative approach to financing a company. At the end of the quarter, total debt to total capitalization was 54.6%. In addition, our pension funding status was at 87% and includes the contribution of $100 million made in September.
Our credit statistics for the trailing 12 months remained strong, with FFO to total debt near 20% and our interest coverage ratio at 4.8x.
In addition, our liquidity at the end of the quarter was over $3 billion and is supported by 2 core credit facilities with a total capacity of $3.25 billion. 
Last week, Moody's publish outlays credit opinion on American Electric Power. This opinion positively highlighted the company's diverse stream of cash flows and conservative financing policies, while at the same time, identifying the increased business risk due to a transition of Ohio-generated generation to a deregulated market in 2015. We remain committed to managing our balance sheet and credit outlook conservatively as we approach the Ohio transition.
On Page 10, you will find a number of upcoming events on our calendar through the first quarter of next year. In the next few weeks, we plan to make filings at the FERC related to our corporate separation plants in Ohio. We believe that making these filings this fall puts us on track to legally separate at the beginning of 2014. These FERC filings and corporate separation will require us to evaluate the counting recovery of Ohio generating assets. In the past, we have evaluated the recovery in that generating assets in the east generation pull collectively as an asset group. Prospectively, we may need to review the Ohio assets individually. 
Of interest of the Ohio units that we previously identified to you for retirement in 2015. We are currently depreciating these units to an end of life in the mid 2015. And as of the end of the quarter, those 11 units at 5 plants had a net book value of $284 million.
Later this year, we also plan to file with West Virginia, Virginia and Kentucky to seek authority to the July numbers to Appalachian Power and Kentucky Power. Also in the regulatory front, we do anticipate a rate order in our Indiana please begin of the year and we were hopeful to get the financing orders in Ohio and West Virginia by early 2013, enabling us to proceed with about $700 million in securitizations in the first quarter of next year.
Nick mentioned earlier in his comments about the Turk Plant becoming operational. Later this year, and he also mentioned the cases that will be used to get Turk that jurisdiction rate base as quickly as possible. 
Lastly, I'm sure that we'll see many of you at the upcoming EEI Financial Conference in Phoenix. At the meeting, we will highlight many of the drivers of financial performance in the company, as well as an update on the comp these strategic initiatives. We will not be issuing guidance at that time. Once the regulatory process concludes in Ohio and our orders are final, we plan to host and analyst meeting where we will address guidance, earning and dividend growth, our regulated operations and our competitive platform going forward.
Thank you for your time this morning. And at this point, I'll turn the call over to the operator, and Nick and I will be happy to take your questions."

Obviously, we've been very careful as the years have gone by, and this year is no different, where we look at operating top of synergies that exist, but also from an O&M reductions standpoint, there are things that we view as typically, we have outages moving in and out. We have are the things that occurs the result that changes the nature of the O&M spend. But we make sure that those changes are sustainable going forward. It's not a matter of us not doing something and moving at into next year. We're really focused on making sure that we're able to do it in a sustainable fashion. So what we really have done with the repositioning study is refocus that effort to say that we want to focus on process changes that enable us to make sustainable O&M reductions in the future. And the teams are focused on that and just to give you examples. There are areas where there's reporting things that we have done internally that over the years, reports continue to be done, they don't need to be done. Or they can be done in a consolidated fashion, the same report being produced by several business units, for example. And those are synergies that we're looking at in process changes that can occur. On the supply chain side, standardization is certainly a key for us. We will be surprised how many peers are glad, 90 different peers are glad that we buy. So it's those kinds of things that we really focus on to try to make sure that we're getting as much O&M reduction as we can, but doing it in a sustainable fashion. Typically, I think you're going to see, on a percentage basis, roughly a 2/3 process-oriented reduction change. And then when you look at changes and spends of control in terms of organizational realignment, those types of things and because the process review enables less resources to be performed in one area versus another, 1/3 of that will be more resource production types of activities. So it's those kinds of trade-offs of that were seeing. But it's very focused on the process side of things first and then the resources fall out. The reason why we do it that way is because we want to wind up in the situation where if we're trying to expand and grow do Transmission business, we want resources to beat put into those capital areas where transmission can be built and also produce headroom from a rate perspective, where more capital can be deployed. So that's why we're doing it. And I think it's coming along quite well."

And there are some pretty interesting things that they've come up with. So there are some structural changes in the way the plants operate. And really, the use of contractors and things like that. So which -- that's something that they're looking at. From perspective, it certainly is focused that piece as well. The finance piece, they're looking at reporting obligations and all these types of things that e we're efficiencies lie. Or certainly, in organizational reviews going on as well. But I wouldn't say it's an asset change. Certainly, it could be some capital deployed to make things more efficient in some manner. But most of it is process, pure process oriented, and then looking at Spence of control, looking at organizational, structural element with the new reality of where we're taking the business. And -- but the big issue is to make sure that whatever changes we make are sustainable for the future and with our long-term strategy in mind. And that's -- so -- and that really gets us to the point where we can start to think about, as I said earlier, once we go through the steps that we've lined up in the long-term plan to get to a point where we can effectively optimize our asset mix to improve ROE."

Thanks, Chuck, and good morning to everyone. And thank you all very taking the time to join our third quarter 2012 earnings call. Now I really call this -- these calls, a status calls because we now have a long-term strategy that's been in place sin",1878,"Okay. Thanks, Chuck, and good morning to everyone. And thank you all very taking the time to join our third quarter 2012 earnings call. Now I really call this -- these calls, a status calls because we now have a long-term strategy that's been in place since February and we're committed to continuing with that strategy and really describing -- taking the opportunity to describe the steps that we've been taking along the way and moving forward with that strategy to not only redefine AEP from a transformational perspective, but also set AEP up for the future. It's also a discussion of the environment that we find ourselves in. And -- but most importantly, what we're doing about it.
Notwithstanding the derecho that certainly had an impact on our service territory, I guess multiple storms during that period of time were close to 1.8 million customers over 2 weeks. When you have that kind of customer mix with those storms, it's really has an impact on what the electric supply was during that period of time.
But notwithstanding that, there's no doubt that it was a challenging quarter. In the past couple of years, the accelerator's been pushed on the -- to the floor on the industrial covering our service territory, and it's gradually been letting up quarter-by-quarter. Until now, this quarter, we're finding the foot's off the accelerator. Fueled by primary metals in oil and gas activity, we've made great progress in the recovery after the recession. And now we find primary metals faltering once again due to the soft international demand, primarily in the aluminum area while certainly, oil and gas activity continues to progress.
So our industrial load dropped for the first time in 9 quarters about 3.1%. And half of that was probably in Ormet here in Ohio, where 2 pot lines were taken off-line. So it does show that sensitivity around aluminum prices.
In previous quarters, the industrials were compensating for residential and commercial decreases. And now we see commercial customer growth still continuing to improve. We saw that for the first time in a few years last quarter, commercial improvement, that continues.
But as we said earlier, the economy is tenuous at best, and we really do have to be concerned about the issues involved with that. And now we're seeing probably the end result of 2012 year-to-date load growth profile being essentially flat for the year.
So 1 quarter doesn't make a trend, but we have to be concerned. As anytime we see a slowdown in economic activity, certainly issues such as international market conditions, needed tax and regulatory reform and the need for a coherent energy policy are factors that must be resolved thus, for investment to enable a recovery. We're hopeful that after the election, we can make some progress on those fronts.
As Brian will discuss later, despite load growth challenges and the continued loss of Ohio-related revenue due to the movement to competition, we delivered near-consensus earnings in the quarter of $1 on a GAAP basis per share and $1.02 operating earnings per share for the third quarter, and $2.55 and $2.59 per share, respectively, for the 9 months year-to-date.
How do we overcome the challenges that I just discussed? Well, I think it goes back to the February discussion that we had. Diversity of the AEP system is something that's very positive for us. We not only have been controlling costs, which we've done a great job of, we have various other jurisdictions that have produced rate increases. So certainly, when you look at the strip of AEP, it is in that diversity that we keep talking about. There's no sense of whining about the economy. It is what it is. But we can, and do, adjust to provide a level of discipline that the market expects.
We know that when the economy truly begins to recover in a sustainable fashion, the diversity of our system, of our customer mix, the fundamental resources such as shale gas, which is prevalent in our operating footprint, will enable AEP to continue to reach our growth potential.
So we remain committed to our long-term strategy as discussed with you in February 10 of this year, and I've talked about it in all the quarterly earnings webcasts as well, but I'll reaffirm it here. Certainly, our notions have been around these issues, movement to competitive market in Ohio with corporate separation and the formation of our competitive generation retail and marketing functions.
Number two, investment in our regulated businesses and the focus on ROE optimization. Number three, a focus on growth aspects of the business such as transmission. And then four, to reaffirm to your commitment to be a regulated utility going forward. The dividend strength that we have is generated by the regulated businesses, and we are intent on maintaining that, that 86%, 14% mix that we've talked about previously, and a continued commitment to the 4% to 6% earnings growth. Transformation of our generation resources is also a key component, particularly in light of EPA mandates and so forth.
So as we -- so as far as providing guidance, we anticipate providing guidance after we received a final order of the Ohio ESP, which we expect, hopefully, by the end of the year. By then, we'll also complete the repositioning study that we've been involved with. So we're anticipating having a February Analyst Day to provide guidance for 2013.
At that point, I think the main risk issues that we'll have are really centered around the level of Ohio customers switching and in load growth that we see postelection and so forth. So I think we'll be in a better position, much better position, to give guidance at that point in time.
Our operational performance has been excellent. When you look at the things we actually control, we've done an outstanding job. The repositioning study, I'm very pleased with the progress there, we'll be completed by the end of the year. And I'm just pleased with the degree of thoughtfulness that the teams have gone through to achieve the objectives and the progress being made. We've had 2 or 3 sets of discussions with the 5 teams that were working on this thing. And it's amazing to me that you can have substantial process changes that reposition this company for the future and focus on the growth areas. And we wind up providing a level of service that we continue to maintain. So it is a very good progress there and we fully expect to be able to talk more about that when we get to the February timeframe.
Transmission has just successfully completed a $350 million debt offering which was fully subscribed. And there was a high degree of interest in it. So it shows that we're moving in the right direction from an investment profile, and we continue to work on our capital allocation to further encourage the growth of our Transmission businesses.
We continue to focus on the advancement of Transcos in the various jurisdictions. Now we have 4 Transcos and others are in various levels of ongoing pending actions. So we continue to be heartened by what's going on there as well.
Our Turk Plant is moving toward completion. We expect our first coal firing, we had a natural gas firing for startup a couple of months ago, and I was proudly showing the pictures of that. It looks like a gas burner, I guess, I appreciate it more than the others did. But nevertheless, today, we should be seeing the first coal firing. We should see synchronization to the grid of the Turk Plant here in November. And then in December, we'll see it go commercial. So -- and it is a beautiful plant site, being the first ultra-supercritical pulverized coal unit in the nation. And we're very proud of that accomplishment. When you look at it, you wonder why we can't do these things everywhere.
The regulatory cases related to that, obviously, getting that commercial operation data is critical for us. We filed the case in Texas and it's ongoing in terms of that jurisdictional recovery there. And even with that following, we still have among the lowest rates in Texas. So I think we stand in pretty good favor there in terms of the placement of that plant and what it means for the future for SWEPCO customers.
Other cases, such as the Indiana case, $140 million case filed there. Case hearings have concluded and we expect to have an outcome to that by the end of this year as well. 
So those things aside, probably one of the main things you're interest is in is what's happened in Ohio. During the last quarter, we made considerable progress there. As many of you are aware, the Ohio PUCO provided clarity for our transition to a competitive market by issuing ESP orders, capacity orders and corporate separation orders that enable us to move forward with the FERC filings. And the result of those orders have been positive for us in that we can map out a plan for the future, focus on the filings that need to be made at FERC once again, and also pursue the other state filings on the transfers of Mitchell and Amos to APCO and Kentucky Power. So we're focused on those jurisdictions, and discussions are ongoing in those areas as well.
So we'll have 6 filings to make, just as we made last time around the areas of separation of the Ohio assets, transfer of Mitchell and Amos, merging Wheeling into APCO and other termination agreements associated with the pool in the interconnection agreements, in various temporary joint operating agreements and those types of things.
So those filings will be made. We anticipate making those filings by the end of October. So we're moving forward step by step in this process to ensure that we continue with the progress that's being made.
Also, I'm pleased with the progress of AEP Energy, a form of our AEP Retail business. We put BlueStar and everything else in that business. We now have approximately 150,000 customers. And we continue to focus on margins, not quantity, in a very deliberate, disciplined fashion. So we proceed with separating out our Ohio generation. We'll include that in that part of the business. And I'm very focused on that transition to make sure that it's complete. And I'm very happy to see that, that business continues to progress and they're actually earning their own keeps. That's a great, great story early on in their function.
So while the economy continues to be a challenge, we have responded with an unwavering focus and commitment to our strategic plan and the discipline to derive shareholder value and quality customer service. And we're very focused on those steps. We'll be very transparent about those steps as we go forward. And like I said, this is viewed as a status call to let you know that progress has indeed been made and the fundamentals are there in our service territory because of diversity, that this system is ready to go.
So I'll turn it over to Brian to give you the details of the third quarter. Brian?"
135470,223136289,368973,"American Electric Power Co., Inc., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Oct 24, 2012",2012-10-24,"Earnings Calls","American Electric Power Company, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Nick, and good morning to everyone. Let's start on slide 4 with the quarterly comparison. Well you'll see that operating earnings for the third quarter of this year were $496 million or $1.02 per share as compared to $566 million or $1.17 per s",2183,"Thank you, Nick, and good morning to everyone. Let's start on slide 4 with the quarterly comparison. Well you'll see that operating earnings for the third quarter of this year were $496 million or $1.02 per share as compared to $566 million or $1.17 per share for the last year's third quarter.
Ohio customer switching and the authorized capacity cost deferrals combined for a negative $0.06 sense comparison to last year's third quarter. In the third quarter of 2011, we recorded a $28 million carrying cost for the TCC stranded capacity auction true-up. Since we securitized this true-up earlier this year, we do not have a comparable amount this quarter resulting in an unfavorable comparison of $0.04. Although this was the fifth one this third quarter in the last 30 years, last year's third quarter was the warmest during that timeframe. This results on weather having a negative $0.04 per share comparison the last year, but it's actually positive $0.07 versus normal weather.
Off-system sales, net of sharing, were down $20 million or $0.03 versus last year. Physical volumes and margins were off in response to power prices that averaged 20% below last year, and natural gas prices that were off by over 30%. Trading and marketing results were $5 million lower than last year.
Non-Utility Operations and Parent results accounted for a negative $0.03 comparison to last year and are mostly explained by the effect of the drought on our River Operations business. Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $32 million and accounted for a negative $0.04 comparison to last year. This was due to the accelerated depreciation at the Ohio plants that we will retire in 2015, increased depreciation rates on several of our jurisdictions as well as the amortization of the TCC's securitization.
On the positive comparisons, jurisdictional rate changes, net of the loss of the Ohio provider of last resort revenues, added $0.03 per share or $20 million compared to last year. Our continued focus on spending, that Nick mentioned several times, resulted in operation and maintenance expenses, net of offsets, having a positive comparison of $0.04 per share over last year. Other, including higher Transco and ETT earnings, added $0.02 per share over last year's third quarter.
At this point, I would like to provide an update to the cost treatment related to the June 29 derecho and the 3 smaller storms that occurred during the restoration efforts. The total cost for these storms was approximately $217 million, of which about $62 million were capital and removal costs. Of the remaining $155 million, about $124 million has been deferred for future recovery, leaving about $31 million to be expensed. $4 million were expensed in the second quarter, and the remaining $27 million were expensed in the third quarter.
Turning to Slide 5. I will review the year-to-date comparisons. Operating earnings for the 2012 year-to-date period were $1.255 billion or $2.59 per share compared to $1.31 billion or $2.72 per share for the year-to-date of 2011. Ohio customer switching, net of authorized capacity deferrals, accounted for a negative $0.19 per share when compared to last year's year-to-date. Approximately 42% of Ohio's load has switched suppliers versus approximately 10% of load that has switched by the end of September last year.
Weather provided a negative $0.16 per share comparison to last year for the year-to-date period. This year's mild winter do not compare favorably with the more extreme winter of 2011. And as previously mentioned, while the summer was warm, it was not as warm as last year. However, when compared to normal weather, 2012 year-to-date was favorable by $0.04.
Non-Utility Operations and Parent results had a negative comparison to last year of $21 million or $0.04 per share. This was mostly explained by the drought impacts on our River Operations and by the loss of production tax credits in our Texas wind farms.
Depreciation and amortization expenses increased by $101 million or $0.13 per share for the year-to-date period. And the reasons for this are the same as for the quarterly comparison. Year-on-year rate increases from several of our jurisdictions were fully offset by the loss of the Ohio provider of last resort revenues, resulting in no change to the year-to-date period for this category.
Continued disciplined spending resulted in a positive year-to-year O&M comparison of $215 million or $0.28 per share. It's important to remember that this line item is operational, and maintenance expenses net of revenue increases to account for rate trackers and other contemporary news [ph] rate mechanisms.
The remaining positive year-to-date reconciliation of $0.11 per share is explained by higher transmission earnings, the 2012 reversal of a negative fuel provision from the prior year and a lower income tax rate.
Taking a look at retail load trends on Slide 6, you'll see the bottom right hand quadrant that overall, weather-normalized retail sales were down 1.4% for the quarter and are now down 0.3/10 of 1% year-to-date. Before going into the second comparisons, let me provide an overview of the economy in our service territory. On several traditional economic indicators, the AEP service territories outperformed national measures. For example, employment growth for AEP's metropolitan areas was up 2.1% for the quarter, versus national employment growth, which was up only 1.4%.
GDP was estimated to grow at 3% for AEP's metropolitan areas for the quarter versus 1.8% estimated growth for the U.S. in aggregate. Our western service territories experienced GDP growth of 3.4% as compared to the 2.6% growth experienced in the western portion of our system. These different growth rates exemplify the diversity that Nick referred to on his comments. 
Despite these positive comparisons for national indicators, AEP did not escape the realities of a struggling economy. This is evident when looking at the bottom left hand quadrant of the slide, where you can see that industrial sales were down 3.1% for the quarter. This development is of concern because as Nick said, it's countered with a positive industrial load trans from the previous 9 quarters. 
Industrial sales are now positive 0.2/10 of 1% for the year-to-date period. We'll explore these customer class in a little more detail in the next slide. Above industrial sales, you'll see that weather-normalized residential sales declined. 0.5/10 of 1% compared to last year's third quarter. We believe that about half of this negative 0.5/10 percent was attributable to the derecho.
While customer counts remained fairly steady at 5.3 million customers, average usage per residential customer declined 0.7/10 of 1% for the quarter and is down nearly 2% for the year. We believe this is related to state and federal energy and efficiency initiatives and to the lingering effects of the economy.
The commercial customer class was essentially flat for the quarter and is now up 0.5/10 of 1% for the year-to-date period. We believe that the growth in employment, that I mentioned earlier, should have a positive impact on the commercial sector in the future.
Let's take a look at the industrial sales class on Slide 7. You can see that 4 of our top 5 industrial sectors experienced negative trends for the quarter. Nick referenced the primary metals sector, which was down 9.8% for the quarter and is now down 2.5% for the year. Much of this decline is due to our largest customer which reduced production by 1/3 during the quarter. Excluding this customer, primary metals were down 3.9% for the quarter and 1.4% year-to-date.
The chemical manufacturing sector was down 5% for the quarter and is down 2.2% year-to-date. Nationally, chemical manufacturing is at its lowest level since 2010 due to decreases in worldwide demand.
Mining, excluding oil and gas, is down in response to coal mine closures related to environmental challenges as well as reduced coal mine production due to low utility demand and the low natural gas prices. On the bright side, petroleum and coal products manufacturing, our third largest industrial sector, was up 6% for the quarter and is now up 6.7% year-to-date. Our largest increase here was in SWEPCO service area for our larger finer expanded capacity.
Other sectors showing growth are transportation equipment manufacturing, our seventh largest industry, which is up 5.3% for the quarter related to strong U.S. auto sales; and oil and gas extraction, our ninth largest industry, which is up 2.6% for the quarter related to shale gas production.
Turning to slide 8, you can see that the company's coal capacity factors have decreased on a quarterly and year-to-date basis as our natural gas capacity factors have increased. Overall, our generation from natural gas has increased approximately 50% year-to-date.
For our East combined cycle units, the increase in capacity factors and generation is even more pronounced. With the addition of the Dresden generation facility to our Waterford and Laurenceburg plants, our East combined cycle generation has increased 114% for the quarter and 160% for the year-to-date period.
With year-to-date capacity factors for these plants approaching 70% and with the recent increases in the Ford natural gas prices, the ability to realize incremental coal-to-gas switching within our Eastern fleet is minimal. Because of the hot weather, our coal units were in more in the third quarter than in the second quarter and our coal inventory went from 48 days at the end of the second quarter to 45 days at the end of the third quarter. Our target is 35 to 40 days.
Our coal needs for 2012 are fully hedged and our needs for 2013 are about 92% hedged, with many units fully hedged. 
Turning to slide 9, you will find the company's balance sheet, credit and liquidity statistics for the end of third quarter. The balance sheet continues to reflect our conservative approach to financing a company. At the end of the quarter, total debt to total capitalization was 54.6%. In addition, our pension funding status was at 87% and include the contribution of $100 million made in September.
Our credit statistics for the trailing 12 months remained strong, with FFO to total debt near 20% and our interest coverage ratio at 4.8x.
In addition, our liquidity at the end of the quarter was over $3 billion and is supported by 2 core credit facilities with a total capacity of $3.25 billion. 
Last week, Moody's published their latest credit opinion on American Electric Power. This opinion positively highlighted the company's diverse stream of cash flows and conservative financing policies, while at the same time, identifying the increased business risk due to the transition of Ohio-generated -- generation to a deregulated market in 2015. We remain committed to managing our balance sheet and credit outlook conservatively as we approach the Ohio transition.
On Page 10, you will find a number of upcoming events on our calendar through the first quarter of next year. In the next few weeks, we plan to make filings at the FERC related to our corporate separation plans in Ohio. We believe that making these filings this fall puts us on track to legally separate at the beginning of 2014. These FERC filings on corporate separation will require us to evaluate the accounting recovery of Ohio generating assets. In the past, we have evaluated the recovery of the generating assets in the East generation pool collectively as an asset group. Prospectively, we may need to review the Ohio assets individually. 
Of interest are the Ohio units that we have previously identified to you for retirement in 2015. We are currently depreciating these units to an end of life in mid 2015. And as of the end of the quarter, those 11 units at 5 plants had a net book value of $284 million.
Later this year, we also plan to file with West Virginia, Virginia and Kentucky to seek authority to transfer the Mitchell and Amos capacity to Appalachian Power and Kentucky Power. Also in the regulatory front, we do anticipate a rate order in our Indiana case by the end of the year, and we are hopeful to get the financing orders in Ohio and West Virginia by early 2013, enabling us to proceed with about $700 million in securitizations in the first quarter of next year.
Nick mentioned earlier in his comments about the Turk Plant becoming operational. Later this year, and he also mentioned the cases that will be used to get Turk in the jurisdictional rate base as quickly as possible. 
Lastly, I'm sure that we'll see many of you at the upcoming EEI Financial Conference in Phoenix. At the meeting, we will highlight many of the drivers of financial performance of the company as well as an update on the comp these strategic initiatives. We will not be issuing guidance at that time. Once the regulatory process concludes in Ohio and our orders are final, we plan to host an analyst meeting where we will address guidance, earning and dividend growth, our regulated operations and our competitive platform going forward.
Thank you for your time this morning. And at this point, I'll turn the call over to the operator, and Nick and I will be happy to take your questions."

So Paul, there's been a lot of activity associated with that. Obviously, we've been very careful as the years have gone by, and this year's no different where we look at operating top of our synergies that exist. But also from an O&M reduction standpoint, there are things that we view as -- typically, we have outages moving in and out. We have other things that occurs, the result that changes the nature of the O&M spend. But we make sure that those changes are sustainable going forward. It's not a matter of us not doing something and moving it into next year. We're really focused on making sure that we're able to do it in a sustainable fashion. So what we really have done with the repositioning study is refocus that effort to say that we want to focus on process changes that enable us to make sustainable O&M reductions in the future. And the teams have focused on that -- and just to give you examples, there are areas where there's reporting things that we have done internally that over the years, reports continue to be done, they don't need to be done. Or they can be done in a consolidated fashion, the same report being produced by several business units, for example. Those are synergies that we're looking at and process changes that can occur. On the supply chain side, standardization is certainly a key for us. You'd be surprised how many pairs of gloves, 90 different pairs of gloves that we buy. So it's those kinds of things that we really focus on to try to make sure that we're getting as much O&M reduction as we can, but doing it in a sustainable fashion. Typically, I think you're going to see, on a percentage basis, roughly a 2/3 process-oriented reduction change. And then when you look at changes in spans of control, in terms of organizational realignment, those types of things, and because the process review enables less resources to be performed in one area versus another, 1/3 of that will be more resource reduction types of activities. So it's those kinds of trade-offs that were seeing. But it's very focused on the process side of things first, and then the resources fall out. The reason why we do it that way is because we want to wind up in a situation where if we're trying to expand and grow the transmission business, we want resources to be put into those capital areas where transmission can be built and also produce headroom from a rate perspective where more capital can be deployed. So that's why we're doing it. And I think it's coming along quite well."

The finance piece, they're looking at their reporting obligations and all these types of things that -- where the efficiencies lie or certainly, an organizational review is going on as well. But I wouldn't say it's an asset change. Certainly, it could be some capital deployed to make things more efficient in some manner.

Now I really call this -- these calls, as status calls because we now have a long-term strategy that's been in place si",1881,"Okay. Thanks, Chuck, and good morning to everyone. And thank you all very taking the time to join our third quarter 2012 earnings call. Now I really call this -- these calls, as status calls because we now have a long-term strategy that's been in place since February and we're committed to continuing with that strategy and really describing -- taking the opportunity to describe the steps that we've been taking along the way and moving forward with that strategy to not only redefine AEP from a transformational perspective, but also set AEP up for the future. It's also a discussion of the environment that we find ourselves in. And -- but most importantly, what we're doing about it.
Notwithstanding the derecho that certainly had an impact on our service territory, I guess multiple storms during that period of time were close to 1.8 million customers over 2 weeks. When you have that kind of customer mix with those storms, it certainly has an impact on what the electric supply was during that period of time.
But notwithstanding that, there's no doubt that it was a challenging quarter. In the past couple of years, the accelerator's been pushed on the -- to the floor on the industrial recovery in our service territory, and it's gradually been letting up quarter-by-quarter. Until now, this quarter, we're finding that the foot's off the accelerator. Fueled by primary metals in oil and gas activity, we've made great progress in the recovery after the recession. And now we find primary metals faltering once again due to the soft international demand, primarily in the aluminum area while certainly, oil and gas activity continues to progress.
So our industrial load dropped for the first time in 9 quarters about 3.1%. And half of that was probably in Ormet here in Ohio, where 2 pot lines were taken off-line. So it does show that sensitivity around aluminum prices.
In previous quarters, the industrials were compensating for residential and commercial load decreases. And now we see commercial customer growth still continuing to improve. We saw that for the first time in a few years last quarter, commercial improvement, that continues.
But as we said earlier, the economy is tenuous at best, and we really do have to be concerned about the issues involved with that. And now we're seeing probably the end result of 2012 year-to-date load growth profile being essentially flat for the year.
So 1 quarter doesn't make a trend, but we have to be concerned. As anytime we see a slowdown in economic activity, certainly issues such as international market conditions, needed tax and regulatory reform and the need for a coherent energy policy are factors that must be resolved to spur investment and enable a recovery. We're hopeful that after the election, we can make some progress on those fronts.
As Brian will discuss later, despite load growth challenges and the continued loss of Ohio-related revenue due to the movement to competition, we delivered near-consensus earnings in the quarter of $1 on a GAAP basis per share and $1.02 operating earnings per share for the third quarter, and $2.55 and $2.59 per share, respectively, for the 9 months year-to-date.
How do we overcome the challenges that I just discussed? Well, I think it goes back to the February discussion that we had. Diversity of the AEP system is something that's very positive for us. We not only have been controlling costs, which we've done a great job of, we have various other jurisdictions that have produced rate increases. So certainly, when you look at the strength of AEP, it is in that diversity that we keep talking about. There's no sense of whining about the economy. It is what it is. But we can, and do, adjust to provide a level of discipline that the market expects.
We know that when the economy truly begins to recover in a sustainable fashion, the diversity of our system, of our customer mix, the fundamental resources such as shale gas, which is prevalent in our operating footprint, will enable AEP to continue to reach our growth potential.
So we remain committed to our long-term strategy as discussed with you in February 10 of this year, and I've talked about it in all the quarterly earnings webcasts as well, but I'll reaffirm it here. Certainly, our notions have been around these issues, movement to competitive market in Ohio with corporate separation and the formation of our competitive generation retail and marketing functions.
Number two, investment in our regulated businesses and the focus on ROE optimization. Number three, a focus on growth aspects of the business such as transmission. And then four, to reaffirm to you our commitment to be a regulated utility going forward. The dividend strength that we have is generated by the regulated businesses, and we are intent on maintaining that, that 86%, 14% mix that we've talked about previously, and a continued commitment to the 4% to 6% earnings growth. Transformation of our generation resources is also a key component, particularly in light of EPA mandates and so forth.
So as we -- so as far as providing guidance, we anticipate providing guidance after we receive a final order of the Ohio ESP, which we expect, hopefully, by the end of the year. By then, we'll also complete the repositioning study that we've been involved with. So we're anticipating having a February Analyst Day to provide guidance for 2013.
At that point, I think the main risk issues that we'll have are really centered around the level of Ohio customers switching and in load growth that we see postelection and so forth. So I think we'll be in a better position, much better position, to give guidance at that point in time.
Our operational performance has been excellent. When you look at the things we actually control, we've done an outstanding job. The repositioning study, I'm very pleased with the progress there, we'll be completed by the end of the year. And I'm just pleased with the degree of thoughtfulness that the teams have gone through to achieve the objectives and the progress being made. We've had 2 or 3 sets of discussions with the 5 teams that were working on this thing. And it's amazing to me that you can have substantial process changes that reposition this company for the future and focus on the growth areas. And we wind up providing a level of service that we continue to maintain. So it is a very good progress there and we fully expect to be able to talk more about that when we get to the February timeframe.
Transmission has just successfully completed a $350 million debt offering which was fully subscribed. And there was a high degree of interest in it. So it shows that we're moving in the right direction from an investment profile, and we continue to work on our capital allocation to further encourage the growth of our Transmission businesses.
We continue to focus on the advancement of Transcos in the various jurisdictions. Now we have 4 Transcos and others are in various levels of ongoing pending actions. So we continue to be heartened by what's going on there as well.
Our Turk Plant is moving toward completion. We expect our first coal firing, we had a natural gas firing for startup a couple of months ago, and I was proudly showing the pictures of that. It looks like a gas burner, I guess, I appreciate it more than the others did. But nevertheless, today, we should be seeing the first coal firing. We should see synchronization to the grid of the Turk Plant here in November. And then in December, we'll see it go commercial. So -- and it is a beautiful plant site, being the first ultra-supercritical pulverized coal unit in the nation. And we're very proud of that accomplishment. When you look at it, you wonder why we can't do these things everywhere.
The regulatory cases related to that, obviously, getting that commercial operation date is critical for us. We filed the case in Texas and it's ongoing in terms of that jurisdictional recovery there. And even with that following, we still have among the lowest rates in Texas. So I think we stand in pretty good favor there in terms of the placement of that plant and what it means for the future for SWEPCO customers.
Other cases, such as the Indiana case, $140 million case filed there. Case hearings have concluded and we expect to have an outcome to that by the end of this year as well. 
So those things aside, probably one of the main things you're interested in is what's happened in Ohio. During the last quarter, we made considerable progress there. As many of you are aware, the Ohio PUCO provided clarity for our transition to a competitive market by issuing ESP orders, capacity orders and corporate separation orders that enable us to move forward with the FERC filings. And the result of those orders have been positive for us in that we can map out a plan for the future, focus on the filings that need to be made at FERC once again, and also pursue the other state filings on the transfers of Mitchell and Amos to APCO and Kentucky Power. So we're focused on those jurisdictions, and discussions are ongoing in those areas as well.
So we'll have 6 filings to make, just as we made last time around the areas of separation of the Ohio assets, transfer of Mitchell and Amos, merging Wheeling into APCO and other termination agreements associated with the pool in the interconnection agreements, in various temporary joint operating agreements and those types of things.
So those filings will be made. We anticipate making those filings by the end of October. So we're moving forward step by step in this process to ensure that we continue with the progress that's being made.
Also, I'm pleased with the progress of AEP Energy, a form of our AEP Retail business. We put BlueStar and everything else in that business. We now have approximately 150,000 customers. And we continue to focus on margins, not quantity, in a very deliberate, disciplined fashion. So we proceed with separating out our Ohio generation. We'll include that in that part of the business. And I'm very focused on that transition to make sure that it's complete. And I'm very happy to see that, that business continues to progress and they're actually earning their own keeps. That's a great, great story early on in their function.
So while the economy continues to be a challenge, we have responded with an unwavering focus and commitment to our strategic plan and the discipline to derive shareholder value and quality customer service. And we're very focused on those steps. We'll be very transparent about those steps as we go forward. And like I said, this is viewed as a status call to let you know that progress has indeed been made and the fundamentals are there in our service territory because of diversity, that this system is ready to go.
So I'll turn it over to Brian to give you the details of the third quarter. Brian?"

Let's start on slide 4 with the quarterly comparison. Well you'll see that operating earnings for the third quarter of this year were $496 million or $1.02 per share as compared to $566 million or $1.17 per s",2169,"Thank you, Nick, and good morning to everyone. Let's start on slide 4 with the quarterly comparison. Well you'll see that operating earnings for the third quarter of this year were $496 million or $1.02 per share as compared to $566 million or $1.17 per share for the last year's third quarter.
Ohio customer switching and the authorized capacity cost deferrals combined for a negative $0.06 comparison to last year's third quarter. In the third quarter of 2011, we recorded a $28 million carrying cost for the TCC stranded capacity auction true-up. Since we securitized this true-up earlier this year, we do not have a comparable amount this quarter resulting in an unfavorable comparison of $0.04. Although this was the fifth one this third quarter in the last 30 years, last year's third quarter was the warmest during that timeframe. This results on weather having a negative $0.04 per share comparison the last year, but it's actually positive $0.07 versus normal weather.
Off-system sales, net of sharing, were down $20 million or $0.03 versus last year. Physical volumes and margins were off in response to power prices that averaged 20% below last year, and natural gas prices that were off by over 30%. Trading and marketing results were $5 million lower than last year.
Non-Utility Operations and Parent results accounted for a negative $0.03 comparison to last year and are mostly explained by the effect of the drought on our River Operations business. Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $32 million and accounted for a negative $0.04 comparison to last year. This was due to the accelerated depreciation at the Ohio plants that we will retire in 2015, increased depreciation rates on several of our jurisdictions as well as the amortization of the TCC's securitization.
On the positive comparisons, jurisdictional rate changes, net of the loss of the Ohio provider of last resort revenues, added $0.03 per share or $20 million compared to last year. Our continued focus on spending, that Nick mentioned several times, resulted in operation and maintenance expenses, net of offsets, having a positive comparison of $0.04 per share over last year. Other, including higher Transco and ETT earnings, added $0.02 per share over last year's third quarter.
At this point, I would like to provide an update to the cost treatment related to the June 29 derecho and the 3 smaller storms that occurred during the restoration efforts. The total cost for these storms was approximately $217 million, of which about $62 million were capital and removal costs. Of the remaining $155 million, about $124 million has been deferred for future recovery, leaving about $31 million to be expensed. $4 million were expensed in the second quarter, and the remaining $27 million were expensed in the third quarter.
Turning to Slide 5. I will review the year-to-date comparisons. Operating earnings for the 2012 year-to-date period were $1.255 billion or $2.59 per share compared to $1.31 billion or $2.72 per share for the year-to-date of 2011. Ohio customer switching, net of authorized capacity deferrals, accounted for a negative $0.19 per share when compared to last year's year-to-date. Approximately 42% of Ohio's load has switched suppliers versus approximately 10% of load that had switched by the end of September last year.
Weather provided a negative $0.16 per share comparison to last year for the year-to-date period. This year's mild winter did not compare favorably with the more extreme winter of 2011. And as previously mentioned, while the summer was warm, it was not as warm as last year. However, when compared to normal weather, 2012 year-to-date was favorable by $0.04.
Non-Utility Operations and Parent results had a negative comparison to last year of $21 million or $0.04 per share. This was mostly explained by the drought impacts on our River Operations and by the loss of production tax credits in our Texas wind farms.
Depreciation and amortization expenses increased by $101 million or $0.13 per share for the year-to-date period. And the reasons for this are the same as for the quarterly comparison. Year-on-year rate increases from several of our jurisdictions were fully offset by the loss of the Ohio provider of last resort revenues, resulting in no change to the year-to-date period for this category.
Continued disciplined spending resulted in a positive year-to-year O&M comparison of $215 million or $0.28 per share. It's important to remember that this line item is operational, and maintenance expenses net of revenue increases to account for rate trackers and other contemporaneous rate mechanisms.
The remaining positive year-to-date reconciliation of $0.11 per share is explained by higher transmission earnings, the 2012 reversal of a negative fuel provision from the prior year and a lower income tax rate.
Taking a look at retail load trends on Slide 6, you'll see the bottom right hand quadrant that overall, weather-normalized retail sales were down 1.4% for the quarter and are now down 0.3% year-to-date. Before going into the second comparisons, let me provide an overview of the economy in our service territory. On several traditional economic indicators, the AEP service territories outperformed national measures. For example, employment growth for AEP's metropolitan areas was up 2.1% for the quarter, versus national employment growth, which was up only 1.4%.
GDP was estimated to grow at 3% for AEP's metropolitan areas for the quarter versus 1.8% estimated growth for the U.S. in aggregate. Our western service territories experienced GDP growth of 3.4% as compared to the 2.6% growth experienced in the western portion of our system. These different growth rates exemplify the diversity that Nick referred to on his comments. 
Despite these positive comparisons for national indicators, AEP did not escape the realities of a struggling economy. This is evident when looking at the bottom left hand quadrant of the slide, where you can see that industrial sales were down 3.1% for the quarter. This development is of concern because as Nick said, it's counter to the positive industrial load trends from the previous 9 quarters. 
Industrial sales are now positive 0.2% for the year-to-date period. We'll explore these customer class in a little more detail in the next slide. Above industrial sales, you'll see that weather-normalized residential sales declined. 0.5% compared to last year's third quarter. We believe that about half of this negative 0.5% was attributable to the derecho.
While customer counts remained fairly steady at 5.3 million customers, average usage per residential customer declined 0.7% for the quarter and is down nearly 2% for the year. We believe this is related to state and federal energy and efficiency initiatives and to the lingering effects of the economy.
The commercial customer class was essentially flat for the quarter and is now up 0.5% for the year-to-date period. We believe that the growth in employment that I mentioned earlier should have a positive impact on the commercial sector in the future.
Let's take a look at the industrial sales class on Slide 7. You can see that 4 of our top 5 industrial sectors experienced negative trends for the quarter. Nick referenced the primary metals sector, which was down 9.8% for the quarter and is now down 2.5% for the year. Much of this decline is due to our largest customer which reduced production by 1/3 during the quarter. Excluding this customer, primary metals were down 3.9% for the quarter and 1.4% year-to-date.
The chemical manufacturing sector was down 5% for the quarter and is down 2.2% year-to-date. Nationally, chemical manufacturing is at its lowest level since 2010 due to decreases in worldwide demand.
Mining, excluding oil and gas, is down in response to coal mine closures related to environmental challenges as well as reduced coal mine production due to low utility demand and the low natural gas prices. On the bright side, petroleum and coal products manufacturing, our third largest industrial sector, was up 6% for the quarter and is now up 6.7% year-to-date. Our largest increase here was in SWEPCO service area where our larger finer [ph] expanded capacity.
Other sectors showing growth are transportation equipment manufacturing, our seventh largest industry, which is up 5.3% for the quarter related to strong U.S. auto sales; and oil and gas extraction, our ninth largest industry, which is up 2.6% for the quarter related to shale gas production.
Turning to slide 8, you can see that the company's coal capacity factors have decreased on a quarterly and year-to-date basis as our natural gas capacity factors have increased. Overall, our generation from natural gas has increased approximately 50% year-to-date.
For our East combined cycle units, the increase in capacity factors and generation is even more pronounced. With the addition of the Dresden generation facility to our Waterford and Laurenceburg plants, our East combined cycle generation has increased 114% for the quarter and 160% for the year-to-date period.
With year-to-date capacity factors for these plants approaching 70% and with the recent increases in the Ford natural gas prices, the ability to realize incremental coal-to-gas switching within our Eastern fleet is minimal. Because of the hot weather, our coal units were in more in the third quarter than in the second quarter and our coal inventory went from 48 days at the end of the second quarter to 45 days at the end of the third quarter. Our target is 35 to 40 days.
Our coal needs for 2012 are fully hedged and our needs for 2013 are about 92% hedged, with many units fully hedged. 
Turning to slide 9, you will find the company's balance sheet, credit and liquidity statistics for the end of third quarter. The balance sheet continues to reflect our conservative approach to financing a company. At the end of the quarter, total debt to total capitalization was 54.6%. In addition, our pension funding status was at 87% and include the contribution of $100 million made in September.
Our credit statistics for the trailing 12 months remained strong, with FFO to total debt near 20% and our interest coverage ratio at 4.8x.
In addition, our liquidity at the end of the quarter was over $3 billion and is supported by 2 core credit facilities with a total capacity of $3.25 billion. 
Last week, Moody's published their latest credit opinion on American Electric Power. This opinion positively highlighted the company's diverse stream of cash flows and conservative financing policies, while at the same time, identifying the increased business risk due to the transition of Ohio-generated -- generation to a deregulated market in 2015. We remain committed to managing our balance sheet and credit outlook conservatively as we approach the Ohio transition.
On Page 10, you will find a number of upcoming events on our calendar through the first quarter of next year. In the next few weeks, we plan to make filings at the FERC related to our corporate separation plans in Ohio. We believe that making these filings this fall puts us on track to legally separate at the beginning of 2014. These FERC filings on corporate separation will require us to evaluate the accounting recovery of Ohio generating assets. In the past, we have evaluated the recovery of the generating assets in the East generation pool collectively as an asset group. Prospectively, we may need to review the Ohio assets individually. 
Of interest are the Ohio units that we have previously identified to you for retirement in 2015. We are currently depreciating these units to an end of life in mid 2015. And as of the end of the quarter, those 11 units at 5 plants had a net book value of $284 million.
Later this year, we also plan to file with West Virginia, Virginia and Kentucky to seek authority to transfer the Mitchell and Amos capacity to Appalachian Power and Kentucky Power. Also in the regulatory front, we do anticipate a rate order in our Indiana case by the end of the year, and we are hopeful to get the financing orders in Ohio and West Virginia by early 2013, enabling us to proceed with about $700 million in securitizations in the first quarter of next year.
Nick mentioned earlier in his comments about the Turk Plant becoming operational later this year, and he also mentioned the cases that will be used to get Turk in the jurisdictional rate base as quickly as possible. 
Lastly, I'm sure that we'll see many of you at the upcoming EEI Financial Conference in Phoenix. At the meeting, we will highlight many of the drivers of financial performance of the company as well as an update on the company's strategic initiatives. We will not be issuing guidance at that time. Once the regulatory process concludes in Ohio and our orders are final, we plan to host an analyst meeting where we will address guidance, earning and dividend growth, our regulated operations and our competitive platform going forward.
Thank you for your time this morning. And at this point, I'll turn the call over to the operator, and Nick and I will be happy to take your questions."

So Paul, there's been a lot of activity associated with that. Obviously, we've been very careful as the years have gone by, and this year's no different where we look at operating top of our synergies that exist. But also from an O&M reduction standpoint, there are things that we view as -- typically, we have outages moving in and out. We have other things that occur as a result that changes the nature of the O&M spend. But we make sure that those changes are sustainable going forward. It's not a matter of us not doing something and moving it into next year. We're really focused on making sure that we're able to do it in a sustainable fashion. So what we really have done with the repositioning study is refocus that effort to say that we want to focus on process changes that enable us to make sustainable O&M reductions in the future. And the teams have focused on that -- and just to give you examples, there are areas where there's reporting things that we have done internally that over the years, reports continue to be done, they don't need to be done. Or they can be done in a consolidated fashion, the same report being produced by several business units, for example. Those are synergies that we're looking at and process changes that can occur. On the supply chain side, standardization is certainly a key for us. You'd be surprised how many pairs of gloves, 90 different pairs of gloves that we buy. So it's those kinds of things that we really focus on to try to make sure that we're getting as much O&M reduction as we can, but doing it in a sustainable fashion. Typically, I think you're going to see, on a percentage basis, roughly a 2/3 process-oriented reduction change. And then when you look at changes in spans of control, in terms of organizational realignment, those types of things, and because the process review enables less resources to be performed in one area versus another, 1/3 of that will be more resource reduction types of activities. So it's those kinds of trade-offs that were seeing. But it's very focused on the process side of things first, and then the resources fall out. The reason why we do it that way is because we want to wind up in a situation where if we're trying to expand and grow the transmission business, we want resources to be put into those capital areas where transmission can be built and also produce headroom from a rate perspective where more capital can be deployed. So that's why we're doing it. And I think it's coming along quite well."

But because our mines were located close to the plants and they're mainly -- coal comes in by the river and we have pretty advantageous contracts, it certainly helps us keep in that switchover price lower. So I think it's a very good proposition for us because we are able to move back and forth in that perspective and we have the contractual ability to adjust from that perspective as well. And it really says something good about the ongoing nature of our unregulated business because it will be practically 2/3 are fully controlled coal units. And as well, our gas units, 1/3 gas, will be able to take advantage of those economies as well. So..."

Over 80% of the plant people are involved in the evaluation of how the plant moves forward. And there are some pretty interesting things that they've come up with. So there are some structural changes in the way the plants operate. And really, the use of contractors and things like that. So which -- that's something that they're looking at. From an IT perspective, it certainly is focused on that piece as well. The finance piece, they're looking at their reporting obligations and all these types of things that -- where the efficiencies lie or certainly, an organizational review is going on as well. But I wouldn't say it's an asset change. Certainly, it could be some capital deployed to make things more efficient in some manner. But most of it is process, pure process oriented, and then looking at spans of control, looking at organizational structure alignment with the new reality of where we're taking the business. And -- but the big issue is to make sure that whatever changes we make are sustainable for the future and with our long-term strategy in mind. And that's -- so -- and that really gets us to a point where we can start to think about -- as I've said earlier, once we go through the steps of -- that we've lined out in our long-term plan to get to a point where we can effectively optimize our asset mix to improve ROE."

Thanks, Chuck, and good morning to everyone. And thank you all very -- taking the time to join our third quarter 2012 earnings call. Now I really call this -- these calls, as status calls because we now have a long-term strategy that's been in place",1882,"Okay. Thanks, Chuck, and good morning to everyone. And thank you all very -- taking the time to join our third quarter 2012 earnings call. Now I really call this -- these calls, as status calls because we now have a long-term strategy that's been in place since February and we're committed to continuing with that strategy and really describing -- taking the opportunity to describe the steps that we've been taking along the way and moving forward with that strategy to not only redefine AEP from a transformational perspective, but also set AEP up for the future. It's also a discussion of the environment that we find ourselves in. And -- but most importantly, what we're doing about it.
Notwithstanding the derecho that certainly had an impact on our service territory, I guess multiple storms during that period of time were close to 1.8 million customers over 2 weeks. When you have that kind of customer mix with those storms, it certainly has an impact on what the electric supply was during that period of time.
But notwithstanding that, there's no doubt that it was a challenging quarter. In the past couple of years, the accelerator's been pushed on the -- to the floor on the industrial recovery in our service territory, and it's gradually been letting up quarter-by-quarter. Until now, this quarter, we're finding that the foot's off the accelerator. Fueled by primary metals in oil and gas activity, we've made great progress in the recovery after the recession. And now we find primary metals faltering once again due to the soft international demand, primarily in the aluminum area while certainly, oil and gas activity continues to progress.
So our industrial load dropped for the first time in 9 quarters about 3.1%. And half of that was probably in Ormet here in Ohio, where 2 pot lines were taken off-line. So it does show that sensitivity around aluminum prices.
In previous quarters, the industrials were compensating for residential and commercial load decreases. And now we see commercial customer growth still continuing to improve. We saw that for the first time in a few years last quarter, commercial improvement, that continues.
But as we said earlier, the economy is tenuous at best, and we really do have to be concerned about the issues involved with that. And now we're seeing probably the end result of 2012 year-to-date load growth profile being essentially flat for the year.
So 1 quarter doesn't make a trend, but we have to be concerned. As anytime we see a slowdown in economic activity, certainly issues such as international market conditions, needed tax and regulatory reform and the need for a coherent energy policy are factors that must be resolved to spur investment and enable a recovery. We're hopeful that after the election, we can make some progress on those fronts.
As Brian will discuss later, despite load growth challenges and the continued loss of Ohio-related revenue due to the movement to competition, we delivered near-consensus earnings in the quarter of $1 on a GAAP basis per share and $1.02 operating earnings per share for the third quarter, and $2.55 and $2.59 per share, respectively, for the 9 months year-to-date.
How do we overcome the challenges that I just discussed? Well, I think it goes back to the February discussion that we had. Diversity of the AEP system is something that's very positive for us. We not only have been controlling costs, which we've done a great job of, we have various other jurisdictions that have produced rate increases. So certainly, when you look at the strength of AEP, it is in that diversity that we keep talking about. There's no sense of whining about the economy. It is what it is. But we can, and do, adjust to provide a level of discipline that the market expects.
We know that when the economy truly begins to recover in a sustainable fashion, the diversity of our system, of our customer mix, the fundamental resources such as shale gas, which is prevalent in our operating footprint, will enable AEP to continue to reach our growth potential.
So we remain committed to our long-term strategy as discussed with you in February 10 of this year, and I've talked about it in all the quarterly earnings webcasts as well, but I'll reaffirm it here. Certainly, our notions have been around these issues, movement to competitive market in Ohio with corporate separation and the formation of our competitive generation retail and marketing functions.
Number two, investment in our regulated businesses and the focus on ROE optimization. Number three, a focus on growth aspects of the business such as transmission. And then four, to reaffirm to you our commitment to be a regulated utility going forward. The dividend strength that we have is generated by the regulated businesses, and we are intent on maintaining that, that 86%, 14% mix that we've talked about previously, and a continued commitment to the 4% to 6% earnings growth. Transformation of our generation resources is also a key component, particularly in light of EPA mandates and so forth.
So as we -- so as far as providing guidance, we anticipate providing guidance after we receive a final order of the Ohio ESP, which we expect, hopefully, by the end of the year. By then, we'll also complete the repositioning study that we've been involved with. So we're anticipating having a February Analyst Day to provide guidance for 2013.
At that point, I think the main risk issues that we'll have are really centered around the level of Ohio customers switching and in load growth that we see postelection and so forth. So I think we'll be in a better position, much better position, to give guidance at that point in time.
Our operational performance has been excellent. When you look at the things we actually control, we've done an outstanding job. The repositioning study, I'm very pleased with the progress there, we'll be completed by the end of the year. And I'm just pleased with the degree of thoughtfulness that the teams have gone through to achieve the objectives and the progress being made. We've had 2 or 3 sets of discussions with the 5 teams that were working on this thing. And it's amazing to me that you can have substantial process changes that reposition this company for the future and focus on the growth areas. And we wind up providing a level of service that we continue to maintain. So it is a very good progress there and we fully expect to be able to talk more about that when we get to the February timeframe.
Transmission has just successfully completed a $350 million debt offering which was fully subscribed. And there was a high degree of interest in it. So it shows that we're moving in the right direction from an investment profile, and we continue to work on our capital allocation to further encourage the growth of our Transmission businesses.
We continue to focus on the advancement of Transcos in the various jurisdictions. Now we have 4 Transcos and others are in various levels of ongoing pending actions. So we continue to be heartened by what's going on there as well.
Our Turk Plant is moving toward completion. We expect our first coal firing, we had a natural gas firing for startup a couple of months ago, and I was proudly showing the pictures of that. It looks like a gas burner, I guess, I appreciate it more than the others did. But nevertheless, today, we should be seeing the first coal firing. We should see synchronization to the grid of the Turk Plant here in November. And then in December, we'll see it go commercial. So -- and it is a beautiful plant site, being the first ultra-supercritical pulverized coal unit in the nation. And we're very proud of that accomplishment. When you look at it, you wonder why we can't do these things everywhere.
The regulatory cases related to that, obviously, getting that commercial operation date is critical for us. We filed the case in Texas and it's ongoing in terms of that jurisdictional recovery there. And even with that following, we still have among the lowest rates in Texas. So I think we stand in pretty good favor there in terms of the placement of that plant and what it means for the future for SWEPCO customers.
Other cases, such as the Indiana case, $140 million case filed there. Case hearings have concluded and we expect to have an outcome to that by the end of this year as well. 
So those things aside, probably one of the main things you're interested in is what's happened in Ohio. During the last quarter, we made considerable progress there. As many of you are aware, the Ohio PUCO provided clarity for our transition to a competitive market by issuing ESP orders, capacity orders and corporate separation orders that enable us to move forward with the FERC filings. And the result of those orders have been positive for us in that we can map out a plan for the future, focus on the filings that need to be made at FERC once again, and also pursue the other state filings on the transfers of Mitchell and Amos to APCO and Kentucky Power. So we're focused on those jurisdictions, and discussions are ongoing in those areas as well.
So we'll have 6 filings to make, just as we made last time around the areas of separation of the Ohio assets, transfer of Mitchell and Amos, merging Wheeling into APCO and other termination agreements associated with the pool in the interconnection agreements, in various temporary joint operating agreements and those types of things.
So those filings will be made. We anticipate making those filings by the end of October. So we're moving forward step by step in this process to ensure that we continue with the progress that's being made.
Also, I'm pleased with the progress of AEP Energy, a form of our AEP Retail business. We put BlueStar and everything else in that business. We now have approximately 150,000 customers. And we continue to focus on margins, not quantity, in a very deliberate, disciplined fashion. So we proceed with separating out our Ohio generation. We'll include that in that part of the business. And I'm very focused on that transition to make sure that it's complete. And I'm very happy to see that, that business continues to progress and they're actually earning their own keeps. That's a great, great story early on in their function.
So while the economy continues to be a challenge, we have responded with an unwavering focus and commitment to our strategic plan and the discipline to derive shareholder value and quality customer service. And we're very focused on those steps. We'll be very transparent about those steps as we go forward. And like I said, this is viewed as a status call to let you know that progress has indeed been made and the fundamentals are there in our service territory because of diversity, that this system is ready to go.
So I'll turn it over to Brian to give you the details of the third quarter. Brian?"
135470,223136289,369661,"American Electric Power Co., Inc., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Oct 24, 2012",2012-10-24,"Earnings Calls","American Electric Power Company, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Nick, and good morning to everyone. Let's start on slide 4 with the quarterly comparison. Well you'll see that operating earnings for the third quarter of this year were $496 million or $1.02 per share as compared to $566 million or $1.17 per s",2169,"Thank you, Nick, and good morning to everyone. Let's start on slide 4 with the quarterly comparison. Well you'll see that operating earnings for the third quarter of this year were $496 million or $1.02 per share as compared to $566 million or $1.17 per share for the last year's third quarter.
Ohio customer switching and the authorized capacity cost deferrals combined for a negative $0.06 comparison to last year's third quarter. In the third quarter of 2011, we recorded a $28 million carrying cost for the TCC stranded capacity auction true-up. Since we securitized this true-up earlier this year, we do not have a comparable amount this quarter resulting in an unfavorable comparison of $0.04. Although this was the fifth one this third quarter in the last 30 years, last year's third quarter was the warmest during that timeframe. This results on weather having a negative $0.04 per share comparison the last year, but it's actually positive $0.07 versus normal weather.
Off-system sales, net of sharing, were down $20 million or $0.03 versus last year. Physical volumes and margins were off in response to power prices that averaged 20% below last year, and natural gas prices that were off by over 30%. Trading and marketing results were $5 million lower than last year.
Non-Utility Operations and Parent results accounted for a negative $0.03 comparison to last year and are mostly explained by the effect of the drought on our River Operations business. Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $32 million and accounted for a negative $0.04 comparison to last year. This was due to the accelerated depreciation at the Ohio plants that we will retire in 2015, increased depreciation rates on several of our jurisdictions as well as the amortization of the TCC's securitization.
On the positive comparisons, jurisdictional rate changes, net of the loss of the Ohio provider of last resort revenues, added $0.03 per share or $20 million compared to last year. Our continued focus on spending, that Nick mentioned several times, resulted in operation and maintenance expenses, net of offsets, having a positive comparison of $0.04 per share over last year. Other, including higher Transco and ETT earnings, added $0.02 per share over last year's third quarter.
At this point, I would like to provide an update to the cost treatment related to the June 29 derecho and the 3 smaller storms that occurred during the restoration efforts. The total cost for these storms was approximately $217 million, of which about $62 million were capital and removal costs. Of the remaining $155 million, about $124 million has been deferred for future recovery, leaving about $31 million to be expensed. $4 million were expensed in the second quarter, and the remaining $27 million were expensed in the third quarter.
Turning to Slide 5. I will review the year-to-date comparisons. Operating earnings for the 2012 year-to-date period were $1.255 billion or $2.59 per share compared to $1.31 billion or $2.72 per share for the year-to-date of 2011. Ohio customer switching, net of authorized capacity deferrals, accounted for a negative $0.19 per share when compared to last year's year-to-date. Approximately 42% of Ohio's load has switched suppliers versus approximately 10% of load that had switched by the end of September last year.
Weather provided a negative $0.16 per share comparison to last year for the year-to-date period. This year's mild winter did not compare favorably with the more extreme winter of 2011. And as previously mentioned, while the summer was warm, it was not as warm as last year. However, when compared to normal weather, 2012 year-to-date was favorable by $0.04.
Non-Utility Operations and Parent results had a negative comparison to last year of $21 million or $0.04 per share. This was mostly explained by the drought impacts on our River Operations and by the loss of production tax credits in our Texas wind farms.
Depreciation and amortization expenses increased by $101 million or $0.13 per share for the year-to-date period. And the reasons for this are the same as for the quarterly comparison. Year-on-year rate increases from several of our jurisdictions were fully offset by the loss of the Ohio provider of last resort revenues, resulting in no change to the year-to-date period for this category.
Continued disciplined spending resulted in a positive year-to-year O&M comparison of $215 million or $0.28 per share. It's important to remember that this line item is operational, and maintenance expenses net of revenue increases to account for rate trackers and other contemporaneous rate mechanisms.
The remaining positive year-to-date reconciliation of $0.11 per share is explained by higher transmission earnings, the 2012 reversal of a negative fuel provision from the prior year and a lower income tax rate.
Taking a look at retail load trends on Slide 6, you'll see the bottom right hand quadrant that overall, weather-normalized retail sales were down 1.4% for the quarter and are now down 0.3% year-to-date. Before going into the second comparisons, let me provide an overview of the economy in our service territory. On several traditional economic indicators, the AEP service territories outperformed national measures. For example, employment growth for AEP's metropolitan areas was up 2.1% for the quarter, versus national employment growth, which was up only 1.4%.
GDP was estimated to grow at 3% for AEP's metropolitan areas for the quarter versus 1.8% estimated growth for the U.S. in aggregate. Our western service territories experienced GDP growth of 3.4% as compared to the 2.6% growth experienced in the western portion of our system. These different growth rates exemplify the diversity that Nick referred to on his comments. 
Despite these positive comparisons for national indicators, AEP did not escape the realities of a struggling economy. This is evident when looking at the bottom left hand quadrant of the slide, where you can see that industrial sales were down 3.1% for the quarter. This development is of concern because as Nick said, it's counter to the positive industrial load trends from the previous 9 quarters. 
Industrial sales are now positive 0.2% for the year-to-date period. We'll explore this customer class in a little more detail in the next slide. Above industrial sales, you'll see that weather-normalized residential sales declined. 0.5% compared to last year's third quarter. We believe that about half of this negative 0.5% was attributable to the derecho.
While customer counts remained fairly steady at 5.3 million customers, average usage per residential customer declined 0.7% for the quarter and is down nearly 2% for the year. We believe this is related to state and federal energy and efficiency initiatives and to the lingering effects of the economy.
The commercial customer class was essentially flat for the quarter and is now up 0.5% for the year-to-date period. We believe that the growth in employment that I mentioned earlier should have a positive impact on the commercial sector in the future.
Let's take a look at the industrial sales class on Slide 7. You can see that 4 of our top 5 industrial sectors experienced negative trends for the quarter. Nick referenced the primary metals sector, which was down 9.8% for the quarter and is now down 2.5% for the year. Much of this decline is due to our largest customer which reduced production by 1/3 during the quarter. Excluding this customer, primary metals were down 3.9% for the quarter and 1.4% year-to-date.
The chemical manufacturing sector was down 5% for the quarter and is down 2.2% year-to-date. Nationally, chemical manufacturing is at its lowest level since 2010 due to decreases in worldwide demand.
Mining, excluding oil and gas, is down in response to coal mine closures related to environmental challenges as well as reduced coal mine production due to low utility demand and the low natural gas prices. On the bright side, petroleum and coal products manufacturing, our third largest industrial sector, was up 6% for the quarter and is now up 6.7% year-to-date. Our largest increase here was in SWEPCO service area where our larger finer [ph] expanded capacity.
Other sectors showing growth are transportation equipment manufacturing, our seventh largest industry, which is up 5.3% for the quarter related to strong U.S. auto sales; and oil and gas extraction, our ninth largest industry, which is up 2.6% for the quarter related to shale gas production.
Turning to slide 8, you can see that the company's coal capacity factors have decreased on a quarterly and year-to-date basis as our natural gas capacity factors have increased. Overall, our generation from natural gas has increased approximately 50% year-to-date.
For our East combined cycle units, the increase in capacity factors and generation is even more pronounced. With the addition of the Dresden generation facility to our Waterford and Lawrenceburg plants, our East combined cycle generation has increased 114% for the quarter and 160% for the year-to-date period.
With year-to-date capacity factors for these plants approaching 70% and with the recent increases in the Ford natural gas prices, the ability to realize incremental coal-to-gas switching within our Eastern fleet is minimal. Because of the hot weather, our coal units were in more in the third quarter than in the second quarter and our coal inventory went from 48 days at the end of the second quarter to 45 days at the end of the third quarter. Our target is 35 to 40 days.
Our coal needs for 2012 are fully hedged and our needs for 2013 are about 92% hedged, with many units fully hedged. 
Turning to slide 9, you will find the company's balance sheet, credit and liquidity statistics for the end of third quarter. The balance sheet continues to reflect our conservative approach to financing a company. At the end of the quarter, total debt to total capitalization was 54.6%. In addition, our pension funding status was at 87% and include the contribution of $100 million made in September.
Our credit statistics for the trailing 12 months remained strong, with FFO to total debt near 20% and our interest coverage ratio at 4.8x.
In addition, our liquidity at the end of the quarter was over $3 billion and is supported by 2 core credit facilities with a total capacity of $3.25 billion. 
Last week, Moody's published their latest credit opinion on American Electric Power. This opinion positively highlighted the company's diverse stream of cash flows and conservative financing policies, while at the same time, identifying the increased business risk due to the transition of Ohio-generated -- generation to a deregulated market in 2015. We remain committed to managing our balance sheet and credit outlook conservatively as we approach the Ohio transition.
On Page 10, you will find a number of upcoming events on our calendar through the first quarter of next year. In the next few weeks, we plan to make filings at the FERC related to our corporate separation plans in Ohio. We believe that making these filings this fall puts us on track to legally separate at the beginning of 2014. These FERC filings on corporate separation will require us to evaluate the accounting recovery of Ohio generating assets. In the past, we have evaluated the recovery of the generating assets in the East generation pool collectively as an asset group. Prospectively, we may need to review the Ohio assets individually. 
Of interest are the Ohio units that we have previously identified to you for retirement in 2015. We are currently depreciating these units to an end of life in mid 2015. And as of the end of the quarter, those 11 units at 5 plants had a net book value of $284 million.
Later this year, we also plan to file with West Virginia, Virginia and Kentucky to seek authority to transfer the Mitchell and Amos capacity to Appalachian Power and Kentucky Power. Also in the regulatory front, we do anticipate a rate order in our Indiana case by the end of the year, and we are hopeful to get the financing orders in Ohio and West Virginia by early 2013, enabling us to proceed with about $700 million in securitizations in the first quarter of next year.
Nick mentioned earlier in his comments about the Turk Plant becoming operational later this year, and he also mentioned the cases that will be used to get Turk in the jurisdictional rate base as quickly as possible. 
Lastly, I'm sure that we'll see many of you at the upcoming EEI Financial Conference in Phoenix. At the meeting, we will highlight many of the drivers of financial performance of the company as well as an update on the company's strategic initiatives. We will not be issuing guidance at that time. Once the regulatory process concludes in Ohio and our orders are final, we plan to host an analyst meeting where we will address guidance, earning and dividend growth, our regulated operations and our competitive platform going forward.
Thank you for your time this morning. And at this point, I'll turn the call over to the operator, and Nick and I will be happy to take your questions."

So Paul, there's been a lot of activity associated with that. Obviously, we've been very careful as the years have gone by, and this year's no different where we look at operating top of our synergies that exist. But also from an O&M reduction standpoint, there are things that we view as -- typically, we have outages moving in and out. We have other things that occur as a result that changes the nature of the O&M spend. But we make sure that those changes are sustainable going forward. It's not a matter of us not doing something and moving it into next year. We're really focused on making sure that we're able to do it in a sustainable fashion. So what we really have done with the repositioning study is refocus that effort to say that we want to focus on process changes that enable us to make sustainable O&M reductions in the future. And the teams have focused on that -- and just to give you examples, there are areas where there's reporting things that we have done internally that over the years, reports continue to be done, they don't need to be done. Or they can be done in a consolidated fashion, the same report being produced by several business units, for example. Those are synergies that we're looking at and process changes that can occur. On the supply chain side, standardization is certainly a key for us. You'd be surprised how many pairs of gloves, 90 different pairs of gloves that we buy. So it's those kinds of things that we really focus on to try to make sure that we're getting as much O&M reduction as we can, but doing it in a sustainable fashion. Typically, I think you're going to see, on a percentage basis, roughly a 2/3 process-oriented reduction change. And then when you look at changes in spans of control, in terms of organizational realignment, those types of things, and because the process review enables less resources to be performed in one area versus another, 1/3 of that will be more resource reduction types of activities. So it's those kinds of trade-offs that were seeing. But it's very focused on the process side of things first, and then the resources fall out. The reason why we do it that way is because we want to wind up in a situation where if we're trying to expand and grow the transmission business, we want resources to be put into those capital areas where transmission can be built and also produce headroom from a rate perspective where more capital can be deployed. So that's why we're doing it. And I think it's coming along quite well."
