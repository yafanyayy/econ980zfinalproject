I'll begin today's call with some brief comments about the quarter and then we'll pass it over to Aleem to provide more detail on the results and then I'll come back. 
I'm going to start today on Slide 3 with which provides a summary of the major drivers for our performance. Net income was $152 million for the quarter or $0.28 a share. Full year EPS was $1.09, up meaningfully from the prior year. While we generated good quarter business momentum, and that was building throughout the year, some of that progress is being masked by legacy mortgage issues by continued impact results. Our favorable loan and deposit both growth and mixed trends continued this quarter. Performing loans were up a solid 4%, and that is net of our continued efforts to reduce our exposure to high-risk loans. At the same time, we saw strong DDA growth over the last quarter and last year. Over the course of the last few years, strong positive growth has outstripped loan growth causing our loan to deposit ratio to decline. The current momentum on the loan side is going to allow us to better utilize the deposits and thus pay the ratio more back into line. While the net interest margin was down slightly, improved deposit mix, pricing discipline and loan growth drove an absolute increase in net interest income. Conversely, fee income declined from last few due to lower debit interchange revenues and an increase in the mortgage repurchase provision. We're going to provide much more detail on mortgage repurchases later in this call. 
Total expenses were down modestly from the prior quarter, but we made excellent progress on our PPG program this quarter, gaining 25% of our annualized target by year end, putting us firmly on track to remove $300 million from our expense base by year-end 2013. From a credit quality perspective, we continue to see improvement across all primary credit metrics. Most notably, nonperforming loans were down 10% sequentially. Lastly, we generated positive capital growth and our capital ratios remain strong and well in excess of current and proposed regulatory requirements. 
Now that sums up the quarter from a very, very high level. I'm going to turn it over to Aleem. He's going to give us more details, and as I said, I'll come back and sum up a bit. Aleem?"

We appreciate it's been a busy week for you, so thank you for choosing to join us this morning. We had several large items impact our results this quarter, some positively and some negatively. Before getting too",3954,"Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everybody. We appreciate it's been a busy week for you, so thank you for choosing to join us this morning. We had several large items impact our results this quarter, some positively and some negatively. Before getting too deep into our results, let's get rounded in these. As we do each quarter, we spelled out certain adjustment items in our appendix. This is not provide you clarity on items affecting our noninterest income and expense trends that are not recurring our noncore. The 3 largest such items for the fourth quarter are shown at the top of Slide 4. 
First, we wrote down the value of our MSR by $38 million due to the expected increased prepayment speeds associated with HARP 2.0. While this is an upfront financial cost of the program, we do expect to realize future benefits from HARP-related refinance activity. Second, and per our November 8-K filing, we made the decision to freeze our defined benefit pension plan. Concurrent with the freeze, we also made a onetime contribution to our longer-tenured teammates 401(k) accounts. The net impact of these 2 items resulted in a fourth quarter gain of $60 million. We also recorded $27 million in severance-related expenses associated with our Playbook for Profitable Growth or PPG Expense Program. This was due to progress that we made on the implementation and design of the program during the fourth quarter. 
This quarter's accrual reflects what we currently believe to be the majority of the severance costs to be incurred over the life of the program. Two other notable items this quarter are shown at the bottom of the slide. As we've previously communicated, we observed an elevated level of mortgage repurchase demands during the fourth quarter. These demands, together with an increase to our mortgage repurchase reserve, led to a $215 million mortgage repurchase provision, which is up by $98 million from the third quarter. We'll discuss this in greater detail in a few minutes. 
Lastly, we had an approximate $50 million reduction in card fees due to the impact of debit interchange regulation that became effective during the fourth quarter. 
One item you don't see on this slide is an accrual for a mortgage servicing settlement with the state Attorneys General. Like several other servicers, we have very recently commenced discussions regarding such an event. However, this dialogue is in the very preliminary stages. We do not yet have a reasonable estimate of the amount and no accrual for the potential financial impact has been recorded in our financial results. As discussions progress over the next few weeks, we expect to provide an update on this matter in our 10-K. 
With these items as a backdrop, please turn to Slide 5 for a review of the summary income statement. Net income to common shareholders was $152 million this quarter or $0.28 per share. This compares with $0.39 per share last quarter and $0.23 per share for the fourth quarter of last year. The $0.11 sequential quarter decline was the result of lower noninterest income, primarily due to impact of the 3 items I mentioned on the previous slide, the increased mortgage repurchase provision, lower debit interchange revenue and the HARP-related MSR adjustment. These more than offset an increase in net interest income, the lower provision and a modest expense decline. 
I've said EPS increase from the fourth quarter of 2010 was driven by higher net interest income, a lower provision and the elimination of the TARP preferred dividends. These were partially offset by the decline in fee income for mortgages and debit cards. 
For the full year, we reported EPS of $1.09, up meaningfully from the net loss of $0.18 reported in 2010. This was driven by a 4% increase in net interest income, a significant reduction in the loan loss provision due to improved credit quality and the elimination of TARP dividends, beginning in the second quarter 2011.  
Let's now delve deeper into each of the major income statement categories, beginning with net interest income on Slide 6. Fourth quarter net interest income increased sequentially by $31 million or 2%. This was due to an increase in interest income resulting from strong loan growth, together with a decline in interest expense due to the continuation of the favorable deposit mix and pricing trends, as well as a reduction in long-term debt. Consistent with our prior guidance, net interest margin declined by 3 basis points, the result of lower earning asset yields. We expect that we'll see another 3 to 5 basis point margin decline in the first quarter, also attributable to lower yields. 
Relative to the prior year, fourth quarter net interest income increased by $30 million or 2%. This was driven by lower interest expense which was attributable to 22% average DDA growth, a 20 basis point reduction in deposit rates paid and a $2 billion reduction in average long-term debt. 
Some other factors also drove full year net interest income growth of over $200 million or 4%. Turning to noninterest income, on a reported basis, noninterest income declined by $180 million from the third quarter. This was attributable to an increase in the mortgage repurchase provision, the HARP 2.0 MSR valuation adjustment, the impact of debit interchange regulation and lower valuation gains on the company's fair value debt. On an adjusted basis, noninterest income declined sequentially by $101 million due to the $98 million increase in the mortgage repurchase provision and the $42 million decline in card fees. Partially offsetting this was a strong quarter for Investment Banking, driven by higher syndicated finance revenue. 
Net income increases market conditions as market provisions are more favorable than those of the for fourth quarter and core mortgage production was also strong. The volume and gain on sale of margins remaining at healthy levels. Relative to the fourth quarter of 2010, fee income declined by $185 million, again, primarily due to the mortgage repurchase provision and card fees. 
Moving to Slide 8, you see in the top left portion of this slide that we received $636 million in demand this quarter, up by almost $200 million from the last quarter. The increase was entirely due to agency-related demands, most notably from 2007 vintage Fannie Mae loans. Overall, the reasons for the demands are similar to those in previous quarters, such as representation or issues with the prices. Demands that we've received have been more concentrated in loans that have already been through the foreclosure process. However, we have recently noticed some change in the pattern of requests relative to their delinquency status. More recent request for full loan files, which are a precursor for future demands, have been more skewed toward loans that are delinquent but are not yet in foreclosure. This suggests to us that the agencies are working through the backlog of demands from prior years, which indicate that demand increases in Q4 should be an acceleration of timing rather than growth in the overall population. 
The top right part of this page shows spending demands increased from $490 million to $590 million. This was due to the increase in current quarter demands. You'll note that due to our high level of loss resolution this quarter, pending population at quarter end was actually below the amount of current quarter demands. Charge-offs for the quarter were $177 million, up by over $40 million from Q3 due to the high level of demand resolution activities. Provision of $215 million exceeded charge-offs, resulting in an increase to the mortgage repurchase reserve of $38 million. We believe this higher reserve level is appropriate in light of the recent increase in demand. 
The bottom right portion of the slide reflects originations, managed activity and losses to date for the 2005 to 2011 vintages. Now let's turn to Slide 9 where we hold in a similar data for the 2006 to 2008 vintages, which have accounted for about 85% of all demands and 90% of losses to date. This slide shows the new disclosures that we hope will provide you with focused information on these 3 highest loss vintages. Some additional information on each of these individual vintages is also included in the appendix. 
On the left side of the page, you see that we originated and sold loans with $120 billion in unpaid principal balance or UPB. This includes $99 billion in agency loans and $21 billion of private label. We also see some historical information on delinquencies, repurchase rate and loss severity. The right-hand side of the page shows our loss experienced to date from the 2006 to 2008 vintages. I'll walk you through this framework as it's a useful 1, not only for understanding our losses to date, but also for estimating future losses. 
Turning to the top, you'll see the $120 billion in loans originated and sold. When you multiply that by the 17.7% of loans that have ever gone 120 days past due, you arrive at a total ever 120 days past due delinquent amount of $21.2 billion. This is relevant as the vast majority of demands have come from this population of loans. Demands received on 2006 to 2008 vintages have equaled 20.9% of this delinquent population or $4.4 billion in total demand. $0.5 billion of those demands are still pending and $3.9 billion in demands have been resolves. Repurchase rate on this $3.9 billion has been 58% or $2.3 billion in total repurchases. The severity rate of 47% has resulted in $1.1 billion in losses recognized to date. This loss figure, taken together with our current reserve for these vintages, has led to a $1.3 billion income statement impact to date of these 2006 to 2008 vintages. Four key variables in this framework are the do delinquency rate, the request rate, the repurchase rate and loss severity. 
Let's focus on the delinquency and request rates first. Repurchase requests received to date had an inverse correlation to the amount of time between origination and default. The shorter the time frame between the origination and default, the greater the request rate. And the longer the time frame, the less likely it is that a request will be received. It has also been a positive correlation between the current loan-to-value ratio and the request rates. The higher the current LTV, the higher the request rate and vice versa. The preponderance of demands received has come from loans that went delinquent within the first 36 months after origination. If this pattern continues and investor selection criteria do not change, it suggests that the pool of delinquent loans from which we'll receive demands should be stabilized, given that any performing loans from the 2006 to 2008 vintages is now past this 3-year mark. 
The lifetime request rate is likely to increase somewhat so it would be reasonable to expect new demands from this delinquent population of loans. Current LTV is 1 predictive variable for the potential magnitude of the increase. The housing values generally continue to decline. This could indicate the potential for continuation of elevated request levels. However, as I noted previously, we've been witnessing some patterns in demand in full file requests, which suggest that the backlog of demands from prior years could be finished. Factors that point to a more modest increase in the request rate are the passage of time, shift in full file request from later stage foreclosed loans to earlier stage default status and the fact that demands can only reasonably be on that population of loans that did not meet underwriting guidelines. 
With respect to the other 2 variables, the repurchase rate on these 3 vintages has been fairly consistent in that 56% to 58% range, while the severity rate in the last 12 months has been about 55%, which is higher than the 47% lifetime severity. This increase is due to the impact of declining home values have had on severity, as well as the higher proportion of demands coming from the 2007 vintage, which was the peak of the housing market. 
In conclusion, while mortgage repurchase demands remain difficult to predict, we do expect them to remain elevated in the coming quarters. However, if the assumptions that lead us to believe why we're seeing an acceleration of demands prove correct, then we would expect the earnings impact associated with this issue to lessen during the second half of 2012. 
Let's move on to Slide 10 for a discussion of noninterest expenses. Since it declined by $13 million from the third quarter, this was driven by $126 million decline in employee compensation and benefits. Roughly half of that was due to the pension curtailment net of the 401(k) contributions contribution. The balance was largely driven by a year-end reduction to incentive plans based upon the company's full year financial performance. We will obviously see an increase in this line item next quarter as the pension gain is nonrecurring, compensation plans will reset for the new year and we'll have the usual seasonal increase in FICA and other benefits. Partially offsetting this quarter's total expense decline were increases in credit and collections expense due primarily to seasonal tax and insurance payments on nonperforming mortgages, higher operating losses associated with specific legal accruals and a seasonal increase in marketing. 
Relative to the fourth quarter of last year, reported expenses were stable. Employee compensation declined while operating losses and credit and collections expenses increased. Onto the balance sheet, beginning with loan trends on Slide 11. Our loan performance growth was strong, with average performing loans increasing by over $4 billion or 4% for the third quarter. Most notable was the $2.2 billion or almost 5% increase in C&I loans. This too was largely driven by our larger corporate borrowers and our Corporate and Investment Banking line of business accounting for $1.7 billion of the increase. Both came across most industry verticals, with healthcare and energy contributing the most. Our asset-backed commercial paper conduits also helped drive increase as the asset-based lending. Diversified Commercial line of business also demonstrated growth with outstanding up about $0.5 billion, driven by a modest increase in utilization rates. Residential loans increased by about $700 million, entirely due to government-guaranteed mortgages. We added to this portfolio during the quarter as we continue to make progress on diversifying and de-risking the overall balance sheet. 
Consumer loans also increased, up $1.6 billion or about 9.5%. Both came across all categories, with government-guaranteed student loans being the largest driver, $1.2 billion due to portfolio acquisitions. Relative to the prior year, average performing loans were up $5.5 billion or 5%. C&I grew more than $4.5 billion or over 10%, while consumer loans increased over $3.5 billion or almost 25%. Concurrent with the growth in these targeted categories and as part of our loan portfolio diversification strategy, we decreased our exposure to other asset classes. Resulting de-risking of the portfolio is shown on Slide 12. Portfolios that we've categorized as higher risk declined by over $13 billion or more than 55% over the past 3 years. At the same time, government-guaranteed loans increased by over $11 billion. It essentially replaced loans that were higher risk with those that are guaranteed. This double de-risking has driven a meaningful improvement in our risk profile. Decline in the higher risk balances continued last quarter, falling by another $0.5 billion. As expected, the pace of the dollar decline moderated somewhat during the second half of the year, which is a function of the overall balances reaching lower levels. Relative to the prior year, higher risk balances declined by almost $3 billion or more than 20%. Commercial Construction was the largest driver at $1.3 billion or more than 50%. High-risk mortgages and Home Equity also declined by approximately $800 million each. 
Overall, we're pleased with the progress that we're making in our loan portfolio diversification strategy. We've been successful both in growing targeted commercial and consumer categories, as well as in reducing our exposure to certain residential and construction categories. The strategy to purchase government-guaranteed loans has performed well as a bridge during a time of low economic growth. And if organic loan growth continues in the coming quarters, we expect slower growth in this category. As for deposit performance, fourth quarter saw a continuation of favorable deposit growth and mixed trends. Average client deposits increased by $2.1 billion or 1.7%. This growth was again driven by lower cost deposits, most notably DDA, which increased by more than $2 billion or almost 7%. NOW accounts also increased, while higher cost time deposits continued their decline, falling by about $800 million or more than 4%. 
The story from the prior year is similar. Client deposits grew by $5.4 billion or 4.5%. Lower cost deposits led the way, up over 8%, with DDA the largest driver, increasing by more than $6 billion or over 20%. Currently, higher cost time deposits declined by almost $3 billion. These favorable deposit trends have been the major driver of our higher levels of net interest income and the year-over-year increase in NIM. 
Moving on to credit quality on Slide 14, the primary credit metrics continue to trend favorably this quarter. The only anomaly is the increase in the total delinquency ratio, which you see on the top left graph. This was due to the purchase of government-guaranteed student loan portfolios. Our asset class has higher delinquency rates although the true loss exposure is very low due to the government guarantee. Delinquencies, excluding government-guaranteed loans, continued to trend lower, down 2 basis points, driven by improvements in Nonguaranteed Mortgage and Home Equity. Nonperforming assets and nonperforming loans declined by 10% each, while net charge-offs fell modestly, lower by 4%. We'll look further at the underlying trend in both of these metrics momentarily. In the light of the continued credit quality improvement, the allowance fell by about $140 million. The ratio of the allowance to loans declined on a reported basis by 21 basis points to 2.01%, this quarter's growth in loans contributing an 8 basis point decline -- contributing 8 basis points to the decrease. Excluding government-guaranteed loans from the denominator of the calculation, the allowance was 2.27% of loans at the end of the quarter or about 25 basis points higher than it was on a reported basis. Overall, we're pleased with a continued improvements in the quality of the balance sheet. 
Slide 15 provides some additional detail on nonperforming loans and net charge-offs trends. Nonperforming loans declined by 10% on a sequential quarter basis. This marked the 10th consecutive quarter of lower nonperforming loans. Similar to recent quarterly trends, commercial loans were the largest driver, and by $279 million or 23%, with notable decreases across each of the commercial loan categories. Residential nonperforming loans also decreased, driven by improvements in Residential Construction and Nonguaranteed Mortgages. Net charge-offs improved sequentially, lower by 4% from the third quarter level. This improvement was driven by commercial construction loans, partially offset by a $23 million increase in residential loans. Relative to the prior year, nonperforming loans were down by $1.2 billion or almost 30%. Commercial Construction, C&I and Nonguaranteed Mortgage were the largest drivers of the decline, while every loan category improved. Fourth quarter net charge-offs declined by $150 million or almost 25% from the prior year. Declines were most evident in Nonguaranteed Mortgage, Commercial Construction, C&I and Home Equity. For the full year, net charge-offs declined by over $800 million or about 30% with residential loans being the largest driver. As we look to the first quarter of 2012, we again expect to see a further decline in NPLs, with net charge-offs relatively stable to modestly down. 
Slide 16 shows trends in our capital metrics, beginning with Tier 1 common at the top left of the page. Tier 1 common capital continued its higher trend this quarter, up by about $100 million as a result of retained earnings. The estimated Tier 1 common ratio ended 2011 at a healthy level of 9.25%. The modest decline from the third quarter was due to strong loan growth generating additional risk-weighted assets. Tier 1 capital also increased while the Tier 1 ratio was estimated to decline from the third quarter due to risk-weighted asset growth, as well as continued modest reductions in our outstanding Trust Preferred Securities. You may note that over the course of the year, we were able to reduce our outstanding TruPS by almost $400 million. Both the Tier 1 common and Tier 1 capital ratios continue to be well above both Basel I and Basel III regulatory requirements. Tangible common equity ratio declined by 30 basis points due to lower accumulated other comprehensive income, which was primarily the result of actuarial adjustments to our pension, as well as higher assets. The AOCI decline, partially offset by this quarter's retained earnings, was what led to the 1% decline in tangible book value per share, which ended the quarter at $25.33. 
Let's turn to Slide 17 for a discussion of our PPG Expense Program. We've previously outlined this program for you, and as Bill stated earlier, we've made some very good early progress toward achieving our $300 million goal. By the end of the year, we had achieved $75 million in annualized savings from our cost base or about $18 million per quarter. PPG is comprised of 3 primary areas of opportunity: strategic supply management, consumer bank efficiencies and operations and staff support. These opportunities spanned the entire organization. Every teammate is involved in delivering expense savings and meeting our goal. 
On this slide, you can see that we've provided the major initiatives within each category and our progress against them. As we're still relatively early in the process, I'm going to show these are still in the planning phase while others are starting to deliver real-time expense savings. Strategic supply management represents our largest opportunity and the savings to date are coming from our negotiations with vendors, as well as demand management. On the vendor side, we've commenced initiatives to secure even more competitive pricing. At the same time, we're proactively further managing down our own demand. For instance, we've reduced demand for print services, market data tools, travel and the like. While none of these individually are overly significant, in the aggregate, they add up. And these types of initiatives have the added benefit of getting all of our teammates engaged to help improve performance for our shareholders. 
Moving to consumer bank efficiencies, earnings to date here have come entirely from our sales and service productivity initiatives. We've made these changes in response to changing client behavior and preferences. Clients' willingness and desire to utilize self-service channels has increased. So we made numerous investments over the past few years in client facing technology, which is mobile and ATM enhancements. The adoption rates of these self-service channels has been high which has shifted transaction volume out of the branch. This is allowing us to refine our branch network and staffing models. Specifically, we have reduced our branch staffing levels primarily through attrition as we transition into a new staffing model. This model will be more efficient and we believe it will enable us to maintain our high levels of client satisfaction and loyalty. 
Operations and staff support, the other main category of savings. Savings realized to date have been achieved largely through our consolidations and shared services initiatives. We've already made strategic consolidations in our finance and marketing groups, which are driving the current savings, and we'll also be making changes in other functional areas. As our PPG Expense Program progresses, we'll continue to provide status updates to you along with the savings that are being realized. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bill"

We're pleased with the progress we've made on our expense saving program.

We're pleased with the progress we've made on our expense saving program. As Aleem stated, we got off to a fast start in 2011 and you can expect to see us move steadily towards our targets in 2012 and '13. Now let me assure you this has my, Aleem and the company's full attention. By now, you're familiar with our strategic priority to drive higher profitability from a more diversified platform. In addition to our efforts to improve the expense efficiency, we're also focused on growing consumer market and wallet share, diversifying the loan portfolio and optimizing our business mix. We've had some real successes against these initiatives in 2011 and more importantly have positive momentum headed into 2012. 
I'm going to spend a few minutes just today highlighting some of the key underlying fundamentals in each of our lines of businesses to give you a perspective on core performance. In spite of regulatory headwinds, we've made great strides in our efforts to grow consumer market and wallet share, before these initiatives show up in our retail line of business and as a testament to our investments in improving client loyalty. In 2011, despite all the product changes, we were able to expand our primary relationships over the prior year, building on client loyalty as the foundation. We also significantly expanded our product penetration for relationship, and this was done particularly well in the fourth quarter. From an overall deposit market share perspective, despite increased competition, we have increased share in 8 of our 10 largest MSAs. 
Now on the lending side, we're delivering strong performance with both consumer direct and indirect loans, up markedly over the last year. On a very short period of time, we've become an industry leader in our market and service quality and client loyalty. Our goal now is to better monetize this position via increased momentum and acquisition, retention and significant improvement in relationship expansion. I'm pleased to say they're all showing a positive trajectory. The Wealth and Investment Management net income was up 16% over last year, with retail investment income generating an impressive growth rate of 12%. Income was also up significantly over last year and we drove the revenue of this line of business while keeping the expenses stable. An improving market can only add additional leverage. 
Our Corporate and Investment Banking business delivered record revenue and net income results in 2011. Our relationship-based business model is working and being embraced by the market. On the asset side loans were up an impressive 25%. Further, we moved up in the most lead table rankings that we're simply winning more lead left mandates. The business is growing the top line, adding and expanding relationships and investing in talent, all while operating with a close eye on efficiency. 
Our Diversified Commercial Banking line of business delivered solid growth both net interest and fee income. The total revenue up 9% and net income up 33% over last year. Loans grew steadily throughout the year, coupled with strong growth in primary relationships, which helped drive performance. The efficiency ratio for this line of business is also very attractive. Growing CID in Diversified Commercial Banking are key elements of our strategy to optimize our business mix and they will be accretive to our efficiency story. We also point out that credit quality held a very well in both businesses on a relative basis throughout the cycle, and both had low loss rates in 2011. Overall, I'm pleased with the progress that we've made here and the potential for future growth. I hope you can tell from the discussion thus far that SunTrust is driving some very solid core business momentum and as I stated earlier, some of the momentum is being masked by legacy mortgage issues. Mortgage line of business lost about $700 million in 2011, largely due to issues related to loans originated in 2008 and before. We continue to work through these legacy issues and we'll get them behind us in due time. In the meantime, our mortgage origination volume continues to be healthy, it's got attractive margins, it's relationship-driven. Our risk management has significantly improved. As evidence of our client-centric approach to origination, we just ranked second-highest overall in customer satisfaction according to the 2011 J.D. Power survey. 
The Corporate Treasury and Other segment is next in line by revenues. I want to point out here that due to our intense focus on balance sheet management, we were very well positioned for the lower for longer rate environment. We have a lot more discipline at SunTrust around our asset liability pricing. You see the benefits of that showing up in our NIM, which while down slightly, is still well above our own historical average. 
Lastly, Commercial Real Estate, our smallest business while 1 with a great amount of potential for earning asset growth. CRE lost $300 million in 2011 as it also had a housing-related exposure. On a relative basis, we had significant fewer challenges from many of our peers. We're beginning to see opportunity in the marketplace in select markets and the particular asset classes. We transition this business back into production mode and we believe this got future potential here. As with our other nonhousing related exposures, our commercial-oriented real estate businesses also performed relatively well through the cycle. 
Let's move to the last slide to recap. While 2011 was a challenging year, overall, we ended it with significantly better momentum than when it began. Full year EPS was up meaningfully from last year, balance sheet trends closed favorably, low-cost deposits continue to increase, the loan growth exhibited a notable pickup during the third and fourth quarters, particularly in the portfolios that we targeted for growth. Many of our core businesses demonstrated good trends throughout the year, hoping to offset the regulatory headwinds we faced on the fee side of the business. Credit quality improved steadily through 2011. We've further reduced our exposure to high-risk loans, helped reduce a much better diversified and lower-risk balance sheet. Our capital ratios remain strong at the close of the year. We're well in excess of the current and proposed regulatory requirements. We repaid the government's TARP investment in a less dilutive manner, increased our common dividend to shareholders during 2011. We hope to be able to increase our return of capital to shareholders coming out of this year's CCAR process. From an operating perspective, we launched our PPG Expense Program and made progress towards our goal. We also saw results from our other strategic priorities. Now we've clearly generated momentum in many of the key areas of our business, our focus on our strategic priorities is yielding results, we're committed to building on our momentum as we move into the year. I know we took a lot of time, but we had a lot to cover today. So with that, Kris, let me turn it over and let's turn it over to Q&A"

I wouldn't actually annualize that going forward and think about that kind of number going forward as a result of our full year purchases and putting government-guaranteed loans on our books. If we start to see the organic loan growth that we saw in the last couple of quarters continue on through 2012, obviously, client-related business will have the first call on our balance sheet and our liquidity, and we'd much rather do organic client business than the kind of government-guaranteed product that we put on.

So I do expect margins will drop for the entire industry and we will be focused on net interest income rather than margin. But we also have a couple of levers, I think, that we can continue to try to pull to try to improve net interest income and margin over the course of the year. We're going to be focused on additional deposit pricing initiatives. We've got some more debt rolling off the books. And, to the extent that we can, we're going to be focused on what we're able to do on the TruPS side, too. So we're going to be doing whatever we can to manage the balance sheet appropriately and try to grow income and mitigate the margin decline."

That's 1 issue is, where there are issues that come back, and there are several subsets within those, it's board misrepresentation, it's documentation issues, it's appraisal issues, it's a whole list of those things. But I think, as we talk with the agencies, they seem to be looking at sort of 2 variables within that. One is the amount of time that, that's gone by for which the loan has been delinquent. And as I said earlier, there seems to be a very, very high correlation between the demand and the amount of time with 0 to 36 months being the key. So that is particularly helpful to us in the industry as we now move past those 3 most challenging vintages. I think the other big issue that the agency seems to be looking at is LTV. And to the extent that the housing market has stabilized from here and LTVs don't continue to decline, I think that'll also be helpful. Both of those things, I think, Marty, are going to help mitigate a rise in the request rate. Because this is a cumulative request rate, 29%, the point is dead on. It will rise from here, but I think both of those issues I just mentioned will help mitigate that rise, and it shouldn't go up significantly more from the kinds of numbers we've been seeing.

So I think we were, the banking we looked at regulated, and that was something that we all spend a lot of time on. So are you saying that we're getting close to the top, the 21%. If you double that number and get to 30%, you can only add about another $500 million to $600 million which you've already reserved $300 million.

I'll begin today's call with some brief comments about the quarter and then we'll pass it over to Aleem to provide more detail on the results and then I'll come back. 
I'm going to start today on Slide 3, which provides a summary of the major drivers for our performance. Net income was $152 million for the quarter or $0.28 a share. Full year EPS was $1.09 and up meaningfully from the prior year. While we generated good core business momentum, and that was building throughout the year, some of that progress is being masked by legacy mortgage issues that continue to impact results. 
Our favorable loan and deposit both growth and mix trends continued this quarter. Performing loans were up a solid 4%, and that is net of our continued efforts to reduce our exposure to high risk loans. At the same time, we saw strong DDA growth over the last quarter and last year. Over the course of the last few years, strong deposit growth has outstripped loan growth causing our loan-to-deposit ratio to decline, but the current momentum on the loan side is going to allow us to better utilize the deposits and thus, spreading the ratio more back in the line. 
While the net interest margin was down slightly, improved deposit mix, pricing discipline and loan growth drove an absolute increase in net interest income. Conversely, fee income declined from last quarter due to lower debit interchange revenues and an increase in the mortgage repurchase provision. We're going to provide much more detail on mortgage repurchases later in this call. 
Total expenses were down modestly from the prior quarter, but we've made excellent progress on our PPG program this quarter, gaining 25% of our annualized target by year end and putting us firmly on track to remove $300 million from our expense base by year end 2013. From a credit quality perspective, we continued to see improvement across all primary credit metrics. Most notably, nonperforming loans were down 10%, sequentially. Lastly, we generated positive capital growth, and our capital ratios remain strong and well in excess of current and proposed regulatory requirements. 
Now that sums up the quarter from a very, very high level. I'm going to turn it over to Aleem. He's going to give you some more details. And then, as I said, I'll come back and sum up a bit. Aleem?"

Before getting too",3977,"Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everybody. We appreciate it's been a busy week for you, so thank you for choosing to join us this morning. We had several large items impact our results this quarter, some positively and some negatively. Before getting too deep into our results, let's get grounded in these. 
As we do each quarter, we spelled out certain adjustment items in our appendix. This is done to provide you clarity on items affecting our noninterest income and expense trends that are nonrecurring our non-core. The 3 largest such items from the fourth quarter are shown at the top of Slide 4. 
First, we wrote down the value of our MSR by $38 million due to the expected increased prepayment speeds associated with HARP 2.0. While this is an upfront financial cost of the program, we do expect to realize future benefits from HARP-related refinance activity. 
Second and per our November 8-K filing, we made the decision to freeze our defined benefit pension plan. Concurrent with the freeze, we also made a onetime contribution to our longer-tenured teammates' 401(k) accounts. The net impact of these 2 items resulted in a fourth quarter gain of $60 million. We also recorded $27 million in severance-related expenses associated with our Playbook for Profitable Growth or PPG Expense Program. This was due to progress that we made on the implementation and design of the program during the fourth quarter. This quarter's accrual reflects what we currently believe to be the majority of the severance costs to be incurred over the life of the program. 
Two other notable items this quarter are shown at the bottom of the slide. As we previously communicated, we observed an elevated level of mortgage repurchase demands during the fourth quarter. These demands, together with an increase to our mortgage repurchase reserve, led to a $215 million mortgage repurchase provision, which is up by $98 million from the third quarter. We'll discuss this in greater detail in a few minutes. And lastly, we had an approximate $50 million reduction in card fees due to the impact of debit interchange regulations that became effective during the fourth quarter. 
One item you don't see on this slide is an accrual for a mortgage servicing settlement with the state's Attorneys General. Like several other servicers, we have very recently commenced discussions regarding such an event. However, this dialogue is in the very preliminary stages, so we do not yet have a reasonable estimate of the amount, and no accrual for the potential financial impact has been recorded in our financial results. As discussions progress over the next few weeks, we expect to provide an update on this matter in our 10-K. 
With these items as a backdrop, please turn to Slide 5 for a review of the summary income statement. Net income to common shareholders was $152 million this quarter or $0.28 per share. This compares with $0.39 per share last quarter and $0.23 per share for the fourth quarter of last year. The $0.11 sequential quarter decline was the result of lower noninterest income primarily due to the impact of 3 items I mentioned on the previous slide: the increased mortgage repurchase provision, lower debit interchange revenue and the HARP-related MSR adjustment. These more than offset an increase in net interest income, the lower provision and a modest expense decline. 
I've said EPS increase from the fourth quarter of 2010 was driven by higher net interest income, a lower provision and the elimination of the TARP preferred dividends. These were partially offset by the decline in fee income for mortgages and debit cards. 
For the full year, we reported EPS of $1.09, up meaningfully from the net loss of $0.18 reported in 2010. This was driven by a 4% increase in net interest income, a significant reduction in the loan loss provision due to improved credit quality and the elimination of TARP dividends beginning in the second quarter of 2011.  
Let's now delve deeper into each of the major income statement categories, beginning with net interest income on Slide 6. Fourth quarter net interest income increased sequentially by $31 million or 2%. This was due to an increase in the interest income resulting from strong loan growth, together with a decline in interest expense due to the continuation of the favorable deposit mix and pricing trends as well as a reduction in long-term debt. Consistent with our prior guidance, the net interest margin declined by 3 basis points, the result of lower earning asset yields. We expect that we'll see another 3- to 5-basis-point margin decline in the first quarter, also attributable to lower yields. 
Relative to the prior year, fourth quarter net interest income increased by $30 million or 2%. This was driven by a lower interest expense, which was attributable to 22% average DDA growth, a 20-basis-point reduction in deposit rates paid and a $2 billion reduction in average long-term debt. Similar factors also drove full year net interest income growth of over $200 million or 4%. 
Turning to noninterest income. On a reported basis, noninterest income declined by $180 million from the third quarter. This was attributable to an increase in the mortgage repurchase provision, the HARP 2.0 MSR valuation adjustments, the impact of debit interchange regulation and lower valuation gains on the company's fair value debt. On an adjusted basis, noninterest income declined sequentially by $101 million due to the $98 million increase in the mortgage repurchase provision and a $42 million decline in card fees. Partially offsetting this was a strong quarter for Investment Banking, driven by higher syndicated finance revenue. 
Trading income also increased as market conditions were more favorable than those in the third quarter, and core mortgage production was also strong, with volume and gain on sale margins remaining at healthy levels. Relative to the fourth quarter of 2010, fee income declined by $185 million, again, primarily due to the mortgage repurchase provision and card fees. 
Moving to Slide 8. You see in the top left portion of this slide that we received $636 million in demands this quarter, up by almost $200 million from the last quarter. The increase was entirely due to agency-related demands, most notably from 2007 vintage Fannie Mae loans. Overall, the reasons for the demands are similar to those in previous quarters, such as borrower misrepresentation or issues with the prices. 
The demands that we've received have been more concentrated in loans that have already been through the foreclosure process. However, we have recently noticed some change in the pattern of requests relative to their delinquency status. The more recent requests for full loan files, which are a precursor for future demands, have been more skewed toward loans that are delinquent but not yet in foreclosure. This suggests to us that the agencies are working through the backlog of demands from prior years, which indicate that the demand increase in Q4 could be an acceleration of timing rather than growth in the overall population. 
The top right part of this page shows pending demands increased from $490 million to $590 million. This was due to the increase in current quarter demands. You'll note that due to our high level of loss resolution this quarter, the pending population at quarter end was actually below the amount of current quarter demands. 
Charge-offs for the quarter were $177 million, up by over $40 million from Q3, due to the high level of demand resolution activities. A provision of $215 million exceeded charge-offs, resulting in an increase to the mortgage repurchase reserve of $38 million. We believe this higher reserve level is appropriate in light of the recent increase in demands. The bottom right portion of the slide reflects originations, demands activity and losses to date for the 2005 to 2011 vintages. 
Now let's turn to Slide 9, where we hone in on similar data for the 2006 to 2008 vintages, which have accounted for about 85% of all demands and 90% of losses to date. This slide shares some new disclosures that we hope will provide you with focused information on these 3 highest loss vintages. Some additional information on each of these individual vintages is also included in the appendix. 
On the left side of the page, you see that we originated and sold loans with $120 billion in unpaid principal balance or UPB. This includes $99 billion in agency loans and $21 billion of private label. You'll also see some historical information on delinquencies, the repurchase rate and loss severity. The right-hand side of the page shows our loss experienced to date from the 2006 to 2008 vintages. I'll walk you through this framework as it's a useful one not only for understanding our losses to date but also for estimating future losses. 
Starting at the top, you see the $120 billion in loans originated and sold. When you multiply that by the 17.7% of loans that have ever gone 120 days past due, you arrive at a total ever 120 days past due delinquent amount of $21.2 billion. This is relevant as the vast majority of demands have come from this population of loans. 
To date, demands received on 2006 to 2008 vintages have equaled 20.9% of this delinquent population or $4.4 billion in total demands. $0.5 billion of those demands are still pending, and $3.9 billion in demands have been resolved. The repurchase rate on this $3.9 billion has been 58% or $2.3 billion in total repurchases. At a severity rate of 47%, this has resulted in $1.1 billion in losses recognized to date. This loss figure, taken together with our current reserve for these vintages, has led to a $1.3 billion income statement impact to date for these 2006 to 2008 vintages. The 4 key variables in this framework are the delinquency rate, the request rate, the repurchase rate and loss severity. 
Let's focus on the delinquency and request rates first. Repurchase requests received to date have had an inverse correlation to the amount of time between origination and default. The shorter the timeframe between origination and default, the greater the request rate. And the longer the timeframe, the less likely it is that a request will be received. There has also been a positive correlation between the current loan-to-value ratio and the request rates. The higher the current LTV, the higher the request rate and vice versa. 
The preponderance of demands received has come from loans that went delinquent within the first 36 months after origination. If this pattern continues and investor selection criteria do not change, it suggests that the pool of delinquent loans from which we'll receive demands should be stabilizing given that any performing loan from the 2006 to 2008 vintages is now past this 3-year mark. 
The lifetime request rate is likely to increase somewhat as it would be reasonable to expect new demands from this delinquent population of loans. Current LTV is one predictive variable for the potential magnitude of the increase. If housing values generally continue to decline, this could indicate the potential for a continuation of elevated request levels. However, as I noted previously, we've been witnessing some patterns in demands in full file requests, which suggest that the backlog of demands from prior years could be thinning. Factors that point to a more modest increase in the request rate are the passage of time, the shift in full file request from later stage foreclosed loans to earlier stage default ppstatus and the fact that demands can only reasonably be  [indiscernible] on that population of loans that did not meet underwriting guidelines. 
  
With respect to the other 2 variables, the repurchase rate on these 3 vintages has been fairly consistent in the 56% to 58% range, while the severity rate in the last 12 months has been about 55%, which is higher than the 47% lifetime severity. This increase is due to the impact that declining home values have had on severity as well as the higher proportion of demands coming from the 2007 vintage, which was the peak of the housing market. 
In conclusion, while mortgage repurchase demands remain difficult to predict, we do expect them to remain elevated in the coming quarters. However, if the assumptions that lead us to believe why we're seeing an acceleration of demands prove correct, then we would expect the earnings impact associated with this issue to lessen during the second half of 2012. 
Let's move on to Slide 10 for a discussion of noninterest expenses. Expenses declined by $13 million from the third quarter. This was driven by a $126 million decline in employee compensation and benefits. Roughly half of that was due to the pension curtailment net of the 401(k) contribution. The balance was largely driven by a year end reduction to incentive plans based upon the company's full year financial performance. So we will obviously see an increase in this line item next quarter as the pension gain is nonrecurring, compensation plans will reset for the new year, and we'll have the usual seasonal increase in FICA and other benefits. 
Partially offsetting this quarter's total expense decline were increases in credit and collections expense due primarily to seasonal tax and insurance payments on nonperforming mortgages, higher operating losses associated with specific legal accruals and a seasonal increase in marketing. Relative to the fourth quarter of last year, reported expenses were stable. Employee compensation declined, while operating losses and credit and collections expenses increased. 
On to the balance sheet, beginning with loan trends on Slide 11. Our loan performance growth was strong with average performing loans increasing by over $4 billion or 4% from the third quarter. Most notable was the $2.2 billion or almost 5% increase in C&I loans. Growth here was largely driven by our larger corporate borrowers, with Corporate and Investment Banking line of business accounting for $1.7 billion of the increase. Growth came across most industry verticals, with healthcare and energy contributing the most. Our asset-backed commercial paper conduit also helped drive the increase as did asset-based lending. 
The Diversified Commercial line of business also demonstrated growth, with outstanding up about $0.5 billion, driven by a modest increase in utilization rates. Residential loans increased by about $700 million entirely due to government-guaranteed mortgages. We added to this portfolio during the quarter as we continued to make progress on diversifying and de-risking the overall balance sheet. 
Consumer loans also increased, up $1.6 billion or about 9.5%. Growth came across all categories, with government-guaranteed student loans being the largest driver, up $1.2 billion due to portfolio acquisitions. Relative to the prior year, average performing loans were up $5.5 billion or 5%. C&I grew more than $4.5 billion or over 10%, while consumer loans increased over $3.5 billion or almost 25%. 
Concurrent with the growth in these targeted categories and as part of our loan portfolio diversification strategy, we decreased our exposure to other asset classes. The resulting de-risking of the portfolio is shown on Slide 12. 
Portfolios that we've categorized as higher risk declined by over $13 billion or more than 55% over the past 3 years. At the same time, government-guaranteed loans increased by over $11 billion. We've essentially replaced loans that were higher risk with those that are guaranteed. This double de-risking has driven a meaningful improvement in our risk profile. 
The decline in the higher risk balances continued last quarter, falling by another $0.5 billion. As expected, the pace of dollar decline moderated somewhat during the second half of the year, which is a function of the overall balances reaching lower levels. Relative to the prior year, higher risk balances declined by almost $3 billion or more than 20%. Commercial construction was the largest driver, down $1.3 billion or more than 50%. High risk mortgages and home equity also declined by approximately $800 million each. 
Overall, we're pleased with the progress that we've -- that we're making in our loan portfolio diversification strategy. We've been successful both in growing targeted commercial and consumer categories as well as in reducing our exposure to certain residential and construction categories. Our strategy to purchase government-guaranteed loans has performed well as a bridge during a time of low economic growth. And if organic loan growth continues in the coming quarters, we expect slower growth in this category. 
As for deposit performance, fourth quarter saw a continuation of favorable deposit growth and mixed trends. Average client deposits increased by $2.1 billion or 1.7%. This growth was again driven by lower cost deposits, most notably DDA, which increased by more than $2 billion or almost 7%. NOW accounts also increased, while higher cost time deposits continued their decline, falling by about $800 million or more than 4%. 
Story from the prior year is similar. Client deposits grew by $5.4 billion or 4.5%. Lower cost deposits led the way, up over 8%, with DDA, the largest driver, increasing by more than $6 billion or over 20%. And currently, higher cost time deposits declined by almost $3 billion. These favorable deposit trends have been the major driver of our higher levels of net interest income and the year-over-year increase in NIM. 
Moving on to credit quality on Slide 14. Primary credit metrics continue to trend favorably this quarter. The only anomaly is the increase in the total delinquency ratio, which you see on the top left graph. This was due to the purchase of government-guaranteed student loan portfolios. That asset class has higher delinquency rates, although the true loss exposure is very low due to the government guarantee. 
Delinquencies, excluding government-guaranteed loans, continue to trend lower, down 2 basis points, driven by improvements in nonguaranteed mortgages and home equity. Nonperforming assets and nonperforming loans declined by 10% each, while net charge-offs fell modestly, lower by 4%. We'll look further at the underlying trends in both of these metrics momentarily. 
In the light of the continued credit quality improvement, the allowance fell by about $140 million. The ratio of the allowance to loans declined on a reported basis by 21 basis points to 2.01% with this quarter's growth in loans contributing an 8-basis-point decline -- an 8 basis -- contributing 8 basis points to the decrease. When excluding government-guaranteed loans from the denominator of the calculation, the allowance was 2.27% of loans at the end of the quarter or about 25 basis points higher than it was on a reported basis. Overall, we're pleased with the continued improvements and the quality of the balance sheet. 
Slide 15 provides some additional detail on nonperforming loan and net charge-off trends. Nonperforming loans declined by 10% on a sequential quarter basis. This marks the 10th consecutive quarter of lower nonperforming loans. Similar to recent quarterly trends, commercial loans were the largest driver and by $279 million or 23%, with notable decreases across each of the commercial loan categories. Residential nonperforming loans also decreased, driven by improvements in residential construction and nonguaranteed mortgages. 
Net charge-offs improved sequentially, lower by 4% from the third quarter level. This improvement was driven by commercial construction loans, partially offset by a $23 million increase in residential loans. Relative to the prior year, nonperforming loans were down by $1.2 billion or almost 30%. Commercial construction, C&I and nonguaranteed mortgages were the largest drivers of the decline, though every loan category improved. 
Fourth quarter net charge-offs declined by $150 million or almost 25% from the prior year. Declines were most evident in nonguaranteed mortgages, commercial construction, C&I and home equity. For the full year, net charge-offs declined by over $800 million or about 30%, with residential loans being the largest driver. As we look to the first quarter of 2012, we again expect to see a further decline in NPLs, with net charge-offs relatively stable to modestly down. 
Slide 16 shows trends in our capital metrics, beginning with Tier 1 common at the top left of the page. Tier 1 common capital continued its higher trend this quarter, up by about $100 million, as a result of retained earnings. The estimated Tier 1 common ratio ended 2011 at a healthy level of 9.25%. The modest decline from the third quarter was due to strong loan growth generating additional risk-weighted assets. 
Tier 1 capital also increased, while the Tier 1 ratio was estimated to decline from the third quarter due to risk-weighted asset growth as well as continued modest reductions in our outstanding trust preferred securities. You may note that over the course of the year, we were able to reduce our outstanding TruPS by almost $400 million. Both the Tier 1 common and Tier 1 capital ratios continue to be well above both Basel I and Basel III regulatory requirements. 
The tangible common equity ratio declined by 30 basis points due to lower accumulated other comprehensive income, which was primarily the result of actuarial adjustments to our pension as well as higher assets. The AOCI decline, partially offset by this quarter's retained earnings, is what led to the 1% decline in tangible book value per share, which ended the quarter at $25.33. 
Let's turn to Slide 17 for a discussion of our PPG Expense Program. We previously outlined this program for you. And as Bill stated earlier, we have made some very good early progress toward achieving our $300 million goal. By the end of the year, we have achieved $75 million in annualized savings from our cost base or about $18 million per quarter. 
PPG is comprised of 3 primary areas of opportunity: strategic supply management, consumer bank efficiencies and operations and staff support. These opportunities span the entire organization, and every teammate is involved in delivering expense savings and meeting our goal. 
On this slide, you can see that we have provided the major initiatives within each category and our progress against them. As we're still relatively early in the process, some initiatives are still in the planning phase, while others are starting to deliver real-time expense savings. 
Strategic supply management represents our largest opportunity, and the savings to date are coming from our negotiations with vendors as well as demand management. On the vendor side, we've commenced initiatives to secure even more competitive pricing. At the same time, we're proactively further managing down our own demand. For instance, we've reduced demands for print services, market data tools, travel and the like. While none of these, individually, are overly significant, in the aggregate, they add up, and these types of initiatives have the added benefit of getting all of our teammates engaged to help improve performance for our shareholders. 
Moving to consumer bank efficiencies. Savings to date here have come entirely from our sales and service productivity initiatives. We've made these changes in response to changing client behavior and preferences. Clients' willingness and desire to utilize self-service channels has increased, so we made numerous investments over the past few years in client-facing technology such as mobile and ATM enhancements. 
The adoption rates of these self-service channels has been high, which has shifted transaction volume out of the branch. This is allowing us to refine our branch network and staffing models. Specifically, we have reduced our branch staffing levels primarily through attrition as we transition into a new staffing model. This model will be more efficient, and we believe it will enable us to maintain our high levels of client satisfaction and loyalty. 
Operations and staff support is the other main category of savings. Savings realized to date have been achieved largely through our consolidations and shared services initiatives. We've already made strategic consolidations in our finance and marketing groups, which are driving the current savings, and we'll also be making changes in other functional areas. As our PPG Expense Program progresses, we'll continue to provide status updates to you along with the savings that are being realized. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bill"

We're pleased with the progress we've made on our expense saving program. As Aleem stated, we got off to a fast start in 2011, and you can expect to see us move steadily towards our targets in 2012 and '13. Let me assure you this has",1189,"Okay. Thanks, Aleem. We're pleased with the progress we've made on our expense saving program. As Aleem stated, we got off to a fast start in 2011, and you can expect to see us move steadily towards our targets in 2012 and '13. Let me assure you this has my, Aleem and the company's full attention. 
Now by now, you are familiar with our strategic priorities to drive higher profitability from a more diversified platform. In addition to our efforts to improve the expense efficiency, we're also focused on growing consumer market and wallet share, diversifying the loan portfolio and optimizing our business mix, and we've got some real successes against these initiatives in 2011 and more importantly, have positive momentum headed into 2012. 
I'm going to spend a few minutes just today highlighting some of the key underlying fundamentals in each of our lines of businesses to give you a perspective on core performance. In spite of regulatory headwinds, we've made great strides in our efforts to grow consumer market and wallet share. The core of these initiatives show up in our retail line of business and as a testament to our investments in improving client loyalty. 
In 2011, despite all the product changes, we were able to expand our primary relationships over the prior year. Building on client loyalty as the foundation, we also significantly expanded our product penetration per relationship, and this was done particularly well in the fourth quarter. From an overall deposit market share perspective, despite increased competition, we have increased share in 8 of our 10 largest MSAs. And on the lending side, we're delivering strong performance with both consumer direct and indirect loans, up marketably over the last year. 
On a very short period of time, we've become an industry leader in our market in service quality and client loyalty. Our goal now is to better monetize this position via increased momentum and acquisition, retention and significant improvement in relationship expansion, and I'm pleased to say they're all showing a positive trajectory. 
Our Wealth and Investment Management net income was up 16% over last year, with retail investment income generating an impressive growth rate of 12%. Trust income was also up significantly over last year, and we drove the revenue of this line of business while keeping the expenses stable. An improving market can only add additional leverage. 
Our Corporate and Investment Banking business delivered record revenue and net income results in 2011, evidence that our relationship-based business model is working and being embraced by the market. On the asset side, loans were up an impressive 25%. Further, we moved up at most lead table rankings, and we're simply winning more lead left mandates. The business is growing the top line, adding and expanding relationships and investing in talent, all while operating with a close eye on efficiency. 
Our Diversified Commercial Banking line of business delivered solid growth in both net interest and fee income with total revenue up 9% and net income up 33% over last year. Loans grew steadily throughout the year, coupled with strong growth in primary relationships, which helped drive performance. The efficiency ratio for this line of business is also very attractive. 
Growing CIB in Diversified Commercial Banking are key elements of our strategy to optimize our business mix, and they will be accretive to our efficiency story. I'll also point out that credit quality held up very well in both businesses on a relative basis throughout the cycle, and both had low loss rates in 2011. Overall, I'm pleased with the progress that we've made here and the potential for future growth. 
I hope you can tell from the discussion thus far that SunTrust is driving some very solid core business momentum. But as I stated earlier, some of the momentum is being masked by legacy mortgage issues. The Mortgage line of business lost about $700 million in 2011 largely due to issues related to loans originated in 2008 and before. 
So we're continuing to work through these legacy issues, and we'll get them behind us in due time. In the meantime, our mortgage origination volume continues to be healthy. It's got attractive margins. It's relationship driven, and our risk management has significantly improved. As evidence of our client-centric approach to origination, we just ranked second highest overall in customer satisfaction according to the 2011 J.D. Power survey. 
Our Corporate Treasury and Other segment is next in line by revenues. What I want to point out here is that due to our intense focus on balance sheet management, we were very well positioned for the lower-for-longer rate environment. We have a lot more discipline at SunTrust around our asset and liability pricing, and you see the benefits of that showing up in our NIM which, while down slightly, is still well above our own historical average. 
Lastly, Commercial Real Estate, our smallest business but one with a great amount of potential for earning asset growth. CRE lost $300 million in 2011 as it also had a housing-related exposure, but on a relative basis, we had significant fewer challenges than many of our peers. We're beginning to see opportunity in the marketplace in select markets and in particular asset classes. We transitioned this business back into production mode, and we believe there's good future potential here. As with our other nonhousing-related exposures, our commercial-oriented real estate businesses have also performed relatively well through the cycle. 
Now let's move to the last slide to recap. While 2011 was a challenging year, overall, we ended it with significantly better momentum than when it began. Full year EPS was up meaningfully from last year. Balance sheet trends closed favorably. Low-cost deposits continue to increase, and loan growth exhibited a notable pickup during the third and fourth quarters, particularly in the portfolios that we targeted for growth. Many of our core businesses demonstrated good trends throughout the year, helping to offset some of the regulatory and environmental headwinds we faced on the fee side of the business. 
Credit quality improved steadily through 2011. We further reduced our exposure to high risk loans and have produced a much better diversified and lower risk balance sheet. Our capital ratios remain strong at the close of the year and well in excess of the current and proposed regulatory requirements. We repaid the government's TARP investment in a less dilutive manner and increased our common dividend to shareholders during 2011. We hope to be able to increase our return of capital to shareholders coming out of this year's CCAR process. From an operating perspective, we launched our PPG Expense Program and made progress towards our goal. We also saw results from our other strategic priorities. 
So we've clearly generated momentum in many of the key areas of our business. Our focus on our strategic priorities is yielding results, and we're committed to building our -- on our momentum as we move into the year. 
I know we spent a lot of time, but we had a lot to cover today. So with that, Kris, let me turn it over, and let's take in the Q&A"

Going forward, I would actually annualize, as you saw it, 4% -- we had 4% loan growth in the fourth quarter, I wouldn't actually annualize that going forward and think about that kind of number going forward as a result of our portfolio purchases and putting government-guaranteed loans on our books. If we start to see the organic loan growth that we saw in the last couple of quarters continue on through 2012, obviously, client-related business will have the first call on our balance sheet and our liquidity, and we'd much rather do organic client business than the kind of government-guaranteed product that we put on.

It's appraisal issues. It's a whole list of those things. But I think, as we talk with the agencies, they seem to be looking at sort of 2 variables within that. One is the amount of time that's gone by for which the loan has been delinquent. And as I said earlier, the -- there seems to be a very, very high correlation between the demand and the amount of time, with 0 to 36 months being the key. So that is particularly helpful to us in the industry as we now move past those 3 most challenging vintages. I think the other big issue that the agency seemed to be looking at is LTV. And to the extent that the housing market has stabilized from here and LTVs don't continue to decline, I think that'll also be helpful. Both of those things, I think, Marty, are going to help mitigate the rise in the request rate. Because this is a cumulative request rate, 20.9%, your point is dead on. It will rise from here. But I think both of those issues I just mentioned will help mitigate that rise, and it just -- it shouldn't go up significantly more from the kinds of numbers we've been seeing. Does that help?

So the $21.2 billion there stays the same, because we've already passed out of the sweet spot of when they can actually think about it from that standpoint. I was just curious in the overall portfolio. To me, if you were to get to 30%, that would just be an extraordinarily high number relative to loans that were delivered to agencies that had a potential discrepancy that would give them the right to give them back to you. So I think we were -- as a banking, we looked at regulated, and that was something that we all spent a lot of time on. So that's -- you're saying that we're getting close to the top at 21%. If you double that number and get to 30%, you can only add about another $500 million to $600 million, which you've already reserved $300 million.

I'll begin today's call with some brief comments about the quarter and then we'll pass it over to Aleem to provide more detail on the results and then I'll come back. 
I'm going to start today on Slide 3, which provides a summary of the major drivers for our performance. Net income was $152 million for the quarter or $0.28 a share. Full year EPS was $1.09 and up meaningfully from the prior year. While we generated good core business momentum, and that was building throughout the year, some of that progress is being masked by legacy mortgage issues that continue to impact results. 
Our favorable loan and deposit, both growth and mix trends, continued this quarter. Performing loans were up a solid 4%, and that is net of our continued efforts to reduce our exposure to higher-risk loans. At the same time, we saw strong DDA growth over the last quarter and last year. Over the course of the last few years, strong deposit growth has outstripped loan growth, causing our loan-to-deposit ratio to decline, though the current momentum on the loan side is going to allow us to better utilize the deposits and thus bring the ratio more back in the line. 
While the net interest margin was down slightly, improved deposit mix, pricing discipline and loan growth drove an absolute increase in net interest income. Conversely, fee income declined from last quarter due to lower debit interchange revenues and an increase in the mortgage repurchase provision. We're going to provide much more detail on mortgage repurchases later in this call. 
Total expenses were down modestly from the prior quarter, but we've made excellent progress on our PPG program this quarter, hitting 25% of our annualized target by year end and putting us firmly on track to remove $300 million from our expense base by year end 2013. From a credit quality perspective, we continued to see improvement across all primary credit metrics. Most notably, nonperforming loans were down 10%, sequentially. Lastly, we generated positive capital growth, and our capital ratios remained strong and well in excess of current and proposed regulatory requirements. 
Now that sums up the quarter from a very, very high level. I'm going to turn it over to Aleem. He's going to give you some more details. And then, as I said, I'll come back and sum up a bit. Aleem?"

We had several large items impact our results this quarter, some positively and some negatively. So before getting too deep into our results, let's get grounded in these. 
As we do each quarter, we spelled out certain adjustment items in our appendix. This is done to provide you clarity on items affecting our noninterest income and expense trends that are nonrecurring or non-core. The 3 largest such items from the fourth quarter are shown at the top of Slide 4. 
First, we wrote down the value of our MSR by $38 million due to the expected increased prepayment speeds associated with HARP 2.0. While this is an upfront financial cost of the program, we do expect to realize future benefits from HARP-related refinance activity. 
Second and per our November 8-K filing, we made the decision to freeze our defined benefit pension plan. Concurrent with the freeze, we also made a onetime contribution to our longer-tenured teammates' 401(k) accounts. The net impact of these 2 items resulted in a fourth quarter gain of $60 million. We also recorded $27 million in severance-related expenses associated with our Playbook for Profitable Growth or PPG Expense Program. This was due to progress that we made on the implementation and design of the program during the fourth quarter. This quarter's accrual reflects what we currently believe to be the majority of the severance costs to be incurred over the life of the program. 
Two other notable items this quarter are shown at the bottom of the slide. As we previously communicated, we observed an elevated level of mortgage repurchase demands during the fourth quarter. These demands, together with an increase to our mortgage repurchase reserve, led to a $215 million mortgage repurchase provision, which is up by $98 million from the third quarter. We'll discuss this in greater detail in a few minutes. And lastly, we had an approximate $50 million reduction in card fees due to the impact of debit interchange regulations that became effective during the fourth quarter. 
One item you don't see on this slide is an accrual for a mortgage servicing settlement with the state's Attorneys General. Like several other servicers, we have very recently commenced discussions regarding such an event. However, this dialogue is in the very preliminary stages, so we do not yet have a reasonable estimate of the amount, and no accrual for the potential financial impact has been recorded in our financial results. As discussions progress over the next few weeks, we expect to provide an update on this matter in our 10-K. 
With these items as a backdrop, please turn to Slide 5 for a review of the summary income statement. Net income to common shareholders was $152 million this quarter or $0.28 per share. This compares with $0.39 per share last quarter and $0.23 per share for the fourth quarter of last year. The $0.11 sequential quarter decline was the result of lower noninterest income primarily due to the impact of 3 items I mentioned on the previous slide: The increased mortgage repurchase provision, lower debit interchange revenue and the HARP-related MSR adjustment. These more than offset an increase in net interest income, a lower provision and a modest expense decline. 
$0.05 EPS increase from the fourth quarter of 2010 was driven by higher net interest income, a lower provision and the elimination of the TARP preferred dividends. These were partially offset by the decline in fee income for mortgages and debit cards. 
For the full year, we reported EPS of $1.09, up meaningfully from the net loss of $0.18 reported in 2010. This was driven by a 4% increase in net interest income, a significant reduction in the loan loss provision due to improved credit quality and the elimination of TARP dividends beginning in the second quarter of 2011.  
Let's now delve deeper into each of the major income statement categories, beginning with net interest income on Slide 6. Fourth quarter net interest income increased sequentially by $31 million or 2%. This was due to an increase in interest income resulting from strong loan growth, together with a decline in interest expense due to the continuation of the favorable deposit mix and pricing trends as well as a reduction in long-term debt. Consistent with our prior guidance, the net interest margin declined by 3 basis points, the result of lower-earning asset yields. We expect that we'll see another 3- to 5-basis-point margin decline in the first quarter, also attributable to lower yields. 
Relative to the prior year, fourth quarter net interest income increased by $30 million or 2%. This was driven by a lower interest expense, which was attributable to 22% average DDA growth, a 20-basis-point reduction in deposit rates paid and a $2 billion reduction in average long-term debt. Similar factors also drove full year net interest income growth of over $200 million or 4%. 
Turning to noninterest income. On a reported basis, noninterest income declined by $180 million from the third quarter. This was attributable to an increase in the mortgage repurchase provision, the HARP 2.0 MSR valuation adjustments, the impact of debit interchange regulation and lower valuation gains on the company's fair value debt. On an adjusted basis, noninterest income declined sequentially by $101 million due to the $98 million increase in the mortgage repurchase provision and a $42 million decline in card fees. Partially offsetting this was a strong quarter for Investment Banking, driven by higher syndicated finance revenue. 
Trading income also increased as market conditions were more favorable than those in the third quarter, and core mortgage production was also strong, with volume and gain-on-sale margins remaining at healthy levels. Relative to the fourth quarter of 2010, fee income declined by $185 million, again, primarily due to the mortgage repurchase provision and card fees. 
Moving to Slide 8. You see in the top left portion of this slide that we received $636 million in demands this quarter, up by almost $200 million from the last quarter. The increase was entirely due to agency-related demands, most notably from 2007 vintage Fannie Mae loans. Overall, the reasons for the demands are similar to those in previous quarters, such as borrower misrepresentation or issues with the prices. 
The demands that we've received have been more concentrated in loans that have already been through the foreclosure process. However, we have recently noticed some change in the pattern of requests relative to their delinquency status. The more recent requests for full loan files, which are a precursor for future demands, have been more skewed toward loans that are delinquent but not yet in foreclosure. This suggests to us that the agencies are working through the backlog of demands from prior years, which indicate that the demand increase in Q4 could be an acceleration of timing rather than growth in the overall population. 
The top right part of this page shows pending demands increased from $490 million to $590 million. This was due to the increase in current quarter demands. You'll note that due to our high level of loss resolution this quarter, the pending population at quarter end was actually below the amount of current quarter demands. 
Charge-offs for the quarter were $177 million, up by over $40 million from Q3, due to the high level of demand resolution activities. A provision of $215 million exceeded charge-offs, resulting in an increase to the mortgage repurchase reserve of $38 million. We believe this higher reserve level is appropriate in light of the recent increase in demands. The bottom right portion of the slide reflects originations, demands activity and losses to date for the 2005 to 2011 vintages. 
Now let's turn to Slide 9, where we hone in on similar data for the 2006 to 2008 vintages, which have accounted for about 85% of all demands and 90% of losses to date. This slide shares some new disclosures that we hope will provide you with focused information on these 3 highest loss vintages. Some additional information on each of these individual vintages is also included in the appendix. 
On the left side of the page, you see that we originated and sold loans with $120 billion in unpaid principal balance or UPB. This includes $99 billion in agency loans and $21 billion of private label. You'll also see some historical information on delinquencies, the repurchase rate and loss severity. The right-hand side of the page shows our loss experienced to date from the 2006 to 2008 vintages. I'll walk you through this framework as it's a useful one, not only for understanding our losses to date, but also for estimating future losses. 
Starting at the top, you see the $120 billion in loans originated and sold. When you multiply that by the 17.7% of loans that have ever gone 120 days past due, you arrive at a total ever 120 days past due delinquent amount of $21.2 billion. This is relevant as the vast majority of demands have come from this population of loans. 
To date, demands received on 2006 to 2008 vintages have equaled 20.9% of this delinquent population or $4.4 billion in total demands. $0.5 billion of those demands are still pending, and $3.9 billion in demands have been resolved. The repurchase rate on this $3.9 billion has been 58% or $2.3 billion in total repurchases. At a severity rate of 47%, this has resulted in $1.1 billion in losses recognized to date. This loss figure, taken together with our current reserve for these vintages, has led to a $1.3 billion income statement impact to date for these 2006 to 2008 vintages. The 4 key variables in this framework are the delinquency rate, the request rate, the repurchase rate and loss severity. 
Let's focus on the delinquency and request rates first. Repurchase requests received to date have had an inverse correlation to the amount of time between origination and default. The shorter the timeframe between origination and default, the greater the request rate. And the longer the timeframe, the less likely it is that a request will be received. There has also been a positive correlation between the current loan-to-value ratio and the request rates. The higher the current LTV, the higher the request rate and vice versa. 
The preponderance of demands received has come from loans that went delinquent within the first 36 months after origination. If this pattern continues and investor selection criteria do not change, it suggests that the pool of delinquent loans from which we'll receive demands should be stabilizing given that any performing loan from the 2006 to 2008 vintages is now past this 3-year mark. 
The lifetime request rate is likely to increase somewhat as it would be reasonable to expect new demands from this delinquent population of loans. Current LTV is one predictive variable for the potential magnitude of the increase. If housing values generally continue to decline, this could indicate the potential for a continuation of elevated request levels. However, as I noted previously, we've been witnessing some patterns in demands in full file requests, which suggest that the backlog of demands from prior years could be thinning. Factors that point to a more modest increase in the request rate are the passage of time, the shift in full file requests from later stage foreclosed loans to earlier stage default status and the fact that demands can only reasonably be gauged [ph] on that population of loans that did not meet underwriting guidelines. 
  
With respect to the other 2 variables, the repurchase rate on these 3 vintages has been fairly consistent in the 56% to 58% range, while the severity rate in the last 12 months has been about 55%, which is higher than the 47% lifetime severity. This increase is due to the impact that declining home values have had on severity as well as the higher proportion of demands coming from the 2007 vintage, which was the peak of the housing market. 
In conclusion, while mortgage repurchase demands remain difficult to predict, we do expect them to remain elevated in the coming quarters. However, if the assumptions that lead us to believe why we're seeing an acceleration of demands prove correct, then we would expect the earnings impact associated with this issue to lessen during the second half of 2012. 
Let's move on to Slide 10 for a discussion of noninterest expenses. Expenses declined by $13 million from the third quarter. This was driven by a $126 million decline in employee compensation and benefits. Roughly half of that was due to the pension curtailment net of the 401(k) contribution. The balance was largely driven by a year end reduction to incentive plans based upon the company's full year financial performance. So we will obviously see an increase in this line item next quarter as the pension gain is nonrecurring, compensation plans will reset for the new year, and we'll have the usual seasonal increase in FICA and other benefits. 
Partially offsetting this quarter's total expense decline were increases in credit and collections expense due primarily to seasonal tax and insurance payments on nonperforming mortgages, higher operating losses associated with specific legal accruals and a seasonal increase in marketing. Relative to the fourth quarter of last year, reported expenses were stable. Employee compensation declined, while operating losses and credit and collections expenses increased. 
On to the balance sheet, beginning with loan trends on Slide 11. Our loan performance growth was strong with average performing loans increasing by over $4 billion or 4% from the third quarter. Most notable was the $2.2 billion or almost 5% increase in C&I loans. Growth here was largely driven by our larger corporate borrowers, with our Corporate and Investment Banking line of business accounting for $1.7 billion of the increase. Growth came across most industry verticals, with healthcare and energy contributing the most. Our asset-backed commercial paper conduit also helped drive the increase as did asset-based lending. 
The Diversified Commercial line of business also demonstrated growth, with outstanding up about $0.5 billion, driven by a modest increase in utilization rates. Residential loans increased by about $700 million entirely due to government-guaranteed mortgages. We added to this portfolio during the quarter as we continued to make progress on diversifying and de-risking the overall balance sheet. 
Consumer loans also increased, up $1.6 billion or about 9.5%. Growth came across all categories, with government-guaranteed student loans being the largest driver, up $1.2 billion due to portfolio acquisitions. Relative to the prior year, average performing loans were up $5.5 billion or 5%. C&I grew more than $4.5 billion or over 10%, while consumer loans increased over $3.5 billion or almost 25%. 
Concurrent with the growth in these targeted categories and as part of our loan portfolio diversification strategy, we decreased our exposure to other asset classes. The resulting de-risking of the portfolio is shown on Slide 12. 
Portfolios that we've categorized as higher risk declined by over $13 billion or more than 55% over the past 3 years. At the same time, government-guaranteed loans increased by over $11 billion. We've essentially replaced loans that were higher risk with those that are guaranteed. This double de-risking has driven a meaningful improvement in our risk profile. 
The decline in the higher risk balances continued last quarter, falling by another $0.5 billion. As expected, the pace of dollar decline moderated somewhat during the second half of the year, which is a function of the overall balances reaching lower levels. Relative to the prior year, higher risk balances declined by almost $3 billion or more than 20%. Commercial construction was the largest driver, down $1.3 billion or more than 50%. Higher-risk mortgages and home equity also declined by approximately $800 million each. 
Overall, we're pleased with the progress that we've -- that we're making in our loan portfolio diversification strategy. We've been successful both in growing targeted commercial and consumer categories as well as in reducing our exposure to certain residential and construction categories. Our strategy to purchase government-guaranteed loans has performed well as a bridge during a time of low economic growth. And if organic loan growth continues in the coming quarters, we expect slower growth in this category. 
As for deposit performance, fourth quarter saw a continuation of favorable deposit growth and mix trends. Average client deposits increased by $2.1 billion or 1.7%. This growth was again driven by lower cost deposits, most notably DDA, which increased by more than $2 billion or almost 7%. NOW accounts also increased, while higher-cost time deposits continued their decline, falling by about $800 million or more than 4%. 
Story from the prior year is similar. Client deposits grew by $5.4 billion or 4.5%. Lower-cost deposits led the way, up over 8%, with DDA, the largest driver, increasing by more than $6 billion or over 20%. And currently, higher-cost time deposits declined by almost $3 billion. These favorable deposit trends have been the major driver of our higher levels of net interest income and the year-over-year increase in NIM. 
Moving on to credit quality on Slide 14. Primary credit metrics continue to trend favorably this quarter. The only anomaly is the increase in the total delinquency ratio, which you see on the top left graph. This was due to the purchase of government-guaranteed student loan portfolios. That asset class has higher delinquency rates, although the true loss exposure is very low due to the government guarantee. 
Delinquencies, excluding government-guaranteed loans, continue to trend lower, down 2 basis points, driven by improvements in nonguaranteed mortgages and home equity. Nonperforming assets and nonperforming loans declined by 10% each, while net charge-offs fell modestly, lower by 4%. We'll look further at the underlying trends in both of these metrics momentarily. 
In the light of the continued credit quality improvement, the allowance fell by about $140 million. The ratio of the allowance to loans declined on a reported basis by 21 basis points to 2.01% with this quarter's growth in loans contributing an 8-basis-point decline -- an 8 basis -- contributing 8 basis points to the decrease. When excluding government-guaranteed loans from the denominator of the calculation, the allowance was 2.27% of loans at the end of the quarter or about 25 basis points higher than it was on a reported basis. Overall, we're pleased with the continued improvements in the quality of the balance sheet. 
Slide 15 provides some additional detail on nonperforming loan and net charge-off trends. Nonperforming loans declined by 10% on a sequential quarter basis. This marks the 10th consecutive quarter of lower nonperforming loans. Similar to recent quarterly trends, commercial loans were the largest driver, down by $279 million or 23%, with notable decreases across each of the commercial loan categories. Residential nonperforming loans also decreased, driven by improvements in residential construction and nonguaranteed mortgages. 
Net charge-offs improved sequentially, lower by 4% from the third quarter level. This improvement was driven by commercial construction loans, partially offset by a $23 million increase in residential loans. Relative to the prior year, nonperforming loans were down by $1.2 billion or almost 30%. Commercial construction, C&I and nonguaranteed mortgages were the largest drivers of the decline, though every loan category improved. 
Fourth quarter net charge-offs declined by $150 million or almost 25% from the prior year. Declines were most evident in nonguaranteed mortgages, commercial construction, C&I and home equity. For the full year, net charge-offs declined by over $800 million or about 30%, with residential loans being the largest driver. As we look to the first quarter of 2012, we again expect to see a further decline in NPLs, with net charge-offs relatively stable to modestly down. 
Slide 16 shows trends in our capital metrics, beginning with Tier 1 common at the top left of the page. Tier 1 common capital continued its higher trend this quarter, up by about $100 million, as a result of retained earnings. The estimated Tier 1 common ratio ended 2011 at a healthy level of 9.25%. The modest decline from the third quarter was due to strong loan growth generating additional risk-weighted assets. 
Tier 1 capital also increased, while the Tier 1 ratio was estimated to decline from the third quarter due to risk-weighted asset growth as well as continued modest reductions in our outstanding trust preferred securities. You may note that over the course of the year, we were able to reduce our outstanding TruPS by almost $400 million. Both the Tier 1 common and Tier 1 capital ratios continue to be well above both Basel I and Basel III regulatory requirements. 
The tangible common equity ratio declined by 30 basis points due to lower accumulated other comprehensive income, which was primarily the result of actuarial adjustments to our pension as well as higher assets. The AOCI decline, partially offset by this quarter's retained earnings, is what led to the 1% decline in tangible book value per share, which ended the quarter at $25.33. 
Let's turn to Slide 17 for a discussion of our PPG Expense Program. We previously outlined this program for you. And as Bill stated earlier, we have made some very good early progress toward achieving our $300 million goal. By the end of the year, we have achieved $75 million in annualized savings from our cost base or about $18 million per quarter. 
PPG is comprised of 3 primary areas of opportunity: Strategic supply management, consumer bank efficiencies and operations and staff support. These opportunities span the entire organization, and every teammate is involved in delivering expense savings and meeting our goal. 
On this slide, you can see that we have provided the major initiatives within each category and our progress against them. As we're still relatively early in the process, some initiatives are still in the planning phase, while others are starting to deliver real-time expense savings. 
Strategic supply management represents our largest opportunity, and the savings to date are coming from our negotiations with vendors as well as demand management. On the vendor side, we've commenced initiatives to secure even more competitive pricing. At the same time, we're proactively further managing down our own demand. For instance, we've reduced demands for print services, market data tools, travel and the like. While none of these, individually, are overly significant, in the aggregate, they add up, and these types of initiatives have the added benefit of getting all of our teammates engaged to help improve performance for our shareholders. 
Moving to consumer bank efficiencies. Savings to date here have come entirely from our sales and service productivity initiatives. We've made these changes in response to changing client behavior and preferences. Clients' willingness and desire to utilize self-service channels has increased, so we made numerous investments over the past few years in client-facing technology such as mobile and ATM enhancements. 
The adoption rates of these self-service channels has been high, which has shifted transaction volume out of the branch. This is allowing us to refine our branch network and staffing models. Specifically, we have reduced our branch staffing levels primarily through attrition as we transition into a new staffing model. This model will be more efficient, and we believe it will enable us to maintain our high levels of client satisfaction and loyalty. 
Operations and staff support is the other main category of savings. Savings realized to date have been achieved largely through our consolidations and shared services initiatives. We've already made strategic consolidations in our finance and marketing groups, which are driving the current savings, and we'll also be making changes in other functional areas. As our PPG Expense Program progresses, we'll continue to provide status updates to you along with the savings that are being realized. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bill."

We're pleased with the progress we've made on our expense saving program. As Aleem stated, we got off to a fast start in 2011, and you can expect to see us move steadily towards our targets in 2012 and '13. Let me assure you this has my, Aleem and the company's full attention. 
Now by now, you are familiar with our strategic priorities to drive higher profitability from a more diversified platform. In addition to our efforts to improve the expense efficiency, we're also focused on growing consumer market and wallet share, diversifying the loan portfolio and optimizing our business mix, and we've had some real successes against these initiatives in 2011 and more importantly, have positive momentum headed into 2012. 
I'm going to spend a few minutes just today highlighting some of the key underlying fundamentals in each of our lines of businesses to give you a perspective on core performance. In spite of regulatory headwinds, we've made great strides in our efforts to grow consumer market and wallet share. The core of these initiatives show up on our retail line of business and is a testament to our investments in improving client loyalty. 
In 2011, despite all the product changes, we were able to expand our primary relationships over the prior year. Building on client loyalty as the foundation, we also significantly expanded our product penetration per relationship, and this was done particularly well in the fourth quarter. From an overall deposit market share perspective, despite increased competition, we have increased share in 8 of our 10 largest MSAs. And on the lending side, we're delivering strong performance with both consumer direct and indirect loans, up marketably over last year. 
On a very short period of time, we've become an industry leader in our market in service quality and client loyalty. Our goal now is to better monetize this position via increased momentum and acquisition, retention and significant improvement in relationship expansion, and I'm pleased to say they're all showing a positive trajectory. 
Our Wealth and Investment Management net income was up 16% over last year, with retail investment income generating an impressive growth rate of 12%. Trust income was also up significantly over last year, and we drove the revenue of this line of business while keeping the expenses stable. An improving market can only add additional leverage. 
Our Corporate and Investment Banking business delivered record revenue and net income results in 2011, evidence that our relationship-based business model is working and being embraced by the market. On the asset side, loans were up an impressive 25%. Further, we moved up in most lead table rankings, and we're simply winning more lead left mandates. The business is growing the top line, adding and expanding relationships and investing in talent, all while operating with a close eye on efficiency. 
Our Diversified Commercial Banking line of business delivered solid growth in both net interest and fee income with total revenue up 9% and net income up 33% over last year. Loans grew steadily throughout the year, coupled with strong growth in primary relationships, which helped drive performance. The efficiency ratio for this line of business is also very attractive. 
Growing CIB and Diversified Commercial Banking are key elements of our strategy to optimize our business mix, and they will be accretive to our efficiency story. I'll also point out that credit quality held up very well in both businesses on a relative basis throughout the cycle, and both had low loss rates in 2011. Overall, I'm pleased with the progress that we've made here and the potential for future growth. 
I hope you can tell from the discussion thus far that SunTrust is driving some very solid core business momentum. But as I stated earlier, some of the momentum is being masked by legacy mortgage issues. The Mortgage line of business lost about $700 million in 2011 largely due to issues related to loans originated in 2008 and before. 
So we're continuing to work through these legacy issues, and we'll get them behind us in due time. In the meantime, our mortgage origination volume continues to be healthy. It's got attractive margins. It's relationship driven, and our risk management has significantly improved. As evidence of our client-centric approach to origination, we just ranked second highest overall in customer satisfaction according to the 2011 J.D. Power survey. 
Our Corporate Treasury and Other segment is next in line by revenues. What I want to point out here is that due to our intense focus on balance sheet management, we were very well positioned for the lower-for-longer rate environment. We have a lot more discipline at SunTrust around our asset and liability pricing, and you see the benefits of that showing up in our NIM which, while down slightly, is still well above our own historical average. 
Lastly, Commercial Real Estate, our smallest business but one with a great amount of potential for earning asset growth. CRE lost $300 million in 2011 as it also had a housing-related exposure, but on a relative basis, we had significantly fewer challenges than many of our peers. We're beginning to see opportunity in the marketplace in select markets and in particular asset classes. We transitioned this business back into production mode, and we believe there's good future potential here. As with our other nonhousing-related exposures, our commercial-oriented real estate businesses have also performed relatively well through the cycle. 
Now let's move to the last slide of recap. While 2011 was a challenging year, overall, we ended it with significantly better momentum than when it began. Full year EPS was up meaningfully from last year. Balance sheet trends closed favorably. Low-cost deposits continued to increase, and loan growth exhibited a notable pickup during the third and fourth quarters, particularly in the portfolios that we targeted for growth. Many of our core businesses demonstrated good trends throughout the year, helping to offset some of the regulatory and environmental headwinds we faced on the fee side of the business. 
Credit quality improved steadily through 2011. We further reduced our exposure to higher-risk loans and have produced a much better diversified and lower-risk balance sheet. Our capital ratios remain strong at the close of the year and well in excess of the current and proposed regulatory requirements. We repaid the government's TARP investment in a less dilutive manner and increased our common dividend to shareholders during 2011. We hope to be able to increase our return of capital to shareholders coming out of this year's CCAR process. From an operating perspective, we launched our PPG Expense Program and made progress towards our goal. We also saw results from our other strategic priorities. 
So we've clearly generated momentum in many of the key areas of our business. Our focus on our strategic priorities is yielding results, and we're committed to building our -- on our momentum as we move into the year. 
I know we spent a lot of time, but we had a lot to cover today. So with that, Kris, let me turn it over, and let's take in to Q&A"

Going forward, I would actually annualize, as you saw, we put 4% -- we had 4% loan growth in the fourth quarter, I wouldn't actually annualize that going forward and think about that kind of number going forward as a result of portfolio purchases and putting government-guaranteed loans on our books. If we start to see the organic loan growth that we saw in the last couple of quarters continue on through 2012, obviously, client-related business will have the first call on our balance sheet and our liquidity, and we'd much rather do organic client business than the kind of government-guaranteed product that we put on. So it was a successful strategy for us in the past. Hopefully, it starts to decline now as the economy starts to come back and we're able to do more client business and lend more money to clients."

It's appraisal issues. It's a whole list of those things. But I think, as we talk with the agencies, they seem to be looking at sort of 2 variables within that. One is the amount of time that's gone by for which the loan has been delinquent. And as I said earlier, the -- there seems to be a very, very high correlation between the demand and the amount of time, with 0 to 36 months being the key. So that is particularly helpful to us in the industry as we now move past those 3 most challenging vintages. I think the other big issue that the agency seemed to be looking at is LTV. And to the extent that the housing market has stabilized from here and LTVs don't continue to decline, I think that will also be helpful. Both of those things, I think, Marty, are going to help mitigate the rise in the request rate. Because this is a cumulative request rate, 20.9%, your point is dead on. It will rise from here, but I think both of those issues I just mentioned will help mitigate that rise, and it just -- it shouldn't go up significantly more from the kinds of numbers we've been seeing.

So I think we were -- as a banking, looked at regulated, and that was something that we all spent a lot of time on. So that's -- you're saying that we're getting close to the top at 21%. If you double that number and get to 30%, you can only add about another $500 million to $600 million, which you've already reserved $300 million.

Thanks, and I'll begin today's call with some brief comments on the first quarter and then I'm going to pass it over to Aleem to provide the details on the results. 
We'll start on Slide 3 of our presentation, where we hit the high-level points. Net income for the quarter was $245 million and earnings per share was $0.46, which was $0.33 increase over last quarter and a $0.38increase over prior year. Growth in revenue and continued favorable loan deposit an asset quality trends drove the improved results. Both net interest income and noninterest income were up over last quarter. On the net interest income side, we benefited from higher loan balances, lower cost deposit growth and a reduction in funding costs such as our net interest margin expanded 3 basis points. Sequential quarter fee income was up sharply and most notably in mortgage production as low interest rates and HARP 2 drove significant refinance activity. On a year-over-year basis, fee income was stable as high mortgage revenue this quarter offset the lost income due to debit interchange changes and lower security gains. 
Expenses declined from the prior quarter and we've made significant progress against our Playbook for Profitable Growth expense savings goal. Today, we've put in place annualized savings of $190 million, and as such, we're on track to achieve the $300 million goal for the program. So while I'm pleased with the progress, this is ultimately about establishing an efficiency-minded culture which will allow us to exceed our goal without a bounce-back. 
Now moving to the balance sheet, favorable loan and deposit trends continued this quarter. Performing loans were up 3% with growth in targeted categories and declines in higher risk loans. We also saw sustained lower-cost deposit growth. Credit quality also continued to improve with marked decreases in all primary credit metrics. Nonperforming loans were down another 9% this quarter and net charge-offs were down 11% sequentially. 
Now lastly, we generated positive capital growth and our capital ratios remain strong and well in excess of our current and proposed regulatory requirements. 
Now that being said, let me take a moment to proactively address CCAR. As part of the process moving forward, we'll be resubmitting our capital plan. We're required to submit the revised plan by mid-June and then expect to hear back by the end of the third quarter. First quarter results will be included in our submission and we'll be running another full stress test. This new submission will only cover any proposed capital actions for the fourth quarter of this year and first quarter of 2013 as anything beyond that will be incorporated in the next year's CCAR process. 
So we're still in the process of learning all the variables. There's not much to report at this time. We're going to be working closely with our board as we decide what to include in our revised submission.

Thank you for joining us. I'll begin my comments this morning on Slide 4 with a high-level overview of the income statement.

I'll begin my comments this morning on Slide 4 with a high-level overview of the income statement. 
Earnings per share this quarter were $0.46 which compares favorably to the $0.13 per share reported last quarter and the $0.08 per share from last year. The $0.33 sequential quarter increase was driven by  both higher revenue and lower expenses. Revenue increased by $171 million, with growth in both net interest income and noninterest income, the latter of which was largely mortgage-related. Expenses declined by $126 million, primarily the result of the $120 million fourth quarter accrual for the potential mortgage servicing settlement. 
Relative to the prior year, the $0.38 earnings per share increase was driven by higher net interest income, a lower provision resulting from improved credit quality and the elimination of the TARP dividend drag. In addition to the preferred dividend payments made that quarter, we also incurred a $74 million noncash charge related to the unamortized discount upon the redemption of the TARP shares. 
Let's now delve deeper into each of the major income statement categories, beginning with net interest income on Slide 5. 
Net interest income increased sequentially by $18 million or 1%. This was driven by higher average loan balances and favorable liability trends, including reduced rates paid on deposits, strong DDA growth and lower average long-term debt. This combination of actions drove a 9 basis point decline in our liability costs this quarter, which more than offset a 5 basis point decrease in our interest-earning asset yield, leading to the 3 basis point increase in net interest margin. This increase exceeded our expectations due primarily to better-than-forecasted deposit trends. 
Relative to the prior year, net interest income grew $65 million or 5%. This increase was driven by a $7 billion increase in average loan balances, improvements in deposit mix and pricing, including a 25% increase in DDA and $5 billion of combined reductions in longer-term debt and CD balances. 
As you're aware, part of our overall interest rate risk management strategy includes hedging certain floating rate commercial loans to receive fixed swaps. These swaps effectively convert these loans from floating to fixed rate. Net interest income attributable to the commercial loan swap position is approximately $150 million during the first quarter of 2012. And as previously disclosed, we will see about a $35 million decline from this amount in the  second quarter. 
Effectively, some of our previously fixed rate commercial loans are converting back to floating.   This $35 million decline will equate to about 10 basis points of net interest margin compression. Assuming no major changes to LIBOR, commercial loan swap income is expected to remain relatively stable at this new run rate for the remainder of the year. 
Let's turn to noninterest income on Slide 6. Noninterest income increased by $153 million from the fourth quarter, driven by higher mortgage-related revenue which was up by $125 million. Excluding the $40 million decline in the mortgage repurchase provision, all mortgage production income was up by $85 million or more than 50%. Production volume this quarter was $7.7 billion, 12% increase from the fourth quarter. Locked volume increased more than 30% and we also saw wider gains on sale. About 3/4 of this quarter's volume was refinance-related and we began to take HARP 2.0 applications. Borrowers are taking advantage of this program and we're being proactive about helping them as we think this program is a beneficial one for our clients and our country. 
Mortgage servicing income also increased from the prior quarter, up by $59 million. This was due in part to the $38 million MSR write-down we took during the fourth quarter in anticipation of increased prepayment volume from HARP refinancing. 
Third quarter results also benefited from favorable net hedge performance. While mortgage income was strong this quarter, certain fee categories exhibited seasonal weakness, such as deposit service charges and Investment Banking, which declined by $12 million and $16 million, respectively. Relative to last year, fee income was stable on a reported basis and up 7% on an adjusted basis. The primary puts and takes were higher margin production income due to both increased volume and margins and lower card fees due to the impact of the new debit interchange regulations. 
If you turn to Slide 7 to discuss mortgage repurchases. As shown on the top left portion of this slide, the purchase demands were $448 million this quarter, down by about $190 million from the high level experienced during the fourth quarter. The timing of demands continues to be variable and this quarter's decline was the result of lower demand volume from Fannie Mae. 
Consistent with what we expressed last quarter, we believe the trend suggest that the agencies are making progress and working through the backlog of potential demands from prior years. Specifically, the composition of the demands this quarter remained concentrated in loans that have already been through the foreclosure process, while the requests for full loan files, the precursor for future demands, continue to become more skewed toward loans that are delinquent, but not yet in foreclosure. 
Turning to population, shown on the top right portion of the slide, declined by about $25 million, ending this quarter at $564 million. This was primarily the result of fewer new demands. Bottom left portion of the page shows the changes in the mortgage repurchase reserve. Mortgage repurchase provision this quarter was $175 million, which exceeded the $113 million in net charge-offs. The resulting $63 million increase in the reserve was made in light of our expectation for continued high levels of future demands as well as the belief that the decline in net charge-offs could be timing-related. 
Some summary statistics of our sole mortgages are displayed on the bottom right of the page and we've also provided for you in the appendix the same level of additional detail on the 2006 to 2008 vintages that we shared last quarter. 
Overall, I'd note that our expectations around mortgage repurchases remains similar to a quarter ago. We foresee demand volume remaining high and variable in the coming quarters. However, if the patterns and full file requests and demands continue to play themselves out as expected, we continue to believe we will experience a reduced income statement impact toward the latter part of the year. 
Let's move on to other expenses on Slide 8. On a reported basis, expenses declined by $126 million from the fourth quarter. This was largely the result of the $120 million accrual taken in the fourth quarter for the potential mortgage servicing settlement. We also saw a decline in credit-related expenses and operating losses. As usual, we provide some additional information on these expenses in our appendix. You'll see that, collectively, they were down by $91 million, with the primary drivers being seasonally lower credit and collections expenses, lower losses from other real estate owned and lower legal and mortgage servicing related accruals. 
Employee compensation and benefits increased by $173 million this quarter. You'll recall this line item was abnormally low in the fourth quarter as we curtailed our pension plan and made reductions to our 2011 incentive compensation pools. After you adjust for these 2 items, the increase this quarter was primarily related to the normal seasonal increase in employee benefit costs. 
Relative to the prior year, expenses were up by $76 million. Employee compensation and benefits increased by $43 million in light of improved performance and modest annual salary increases. Operating losses were also higher, up $33 million as a result of specific legal and mortgage servicing accruals. Conversely, marketing in FDIC premiums and regulatory assessments were down by a combined $30 million. 
Before we turn to the balance sheet starting on Slide 9, I'll summarize the income statement this quarter by noting that we benefited from many of the favorable trends that began to develop in the second half of 2011, and we were pleased to begin 2012 with a quarter of solid core performance. 
Average performing loans grew by a healthy $3.3 billion or 3% from the fourth quarter and were up by $8.6 billion or 8% from the prior year. The sequential quarter increase was relatively evenly split between the commercial, residential and consumer loan categories. Within the commercial book, C&I was again the primary driver, up $1.1 billion or 2%. Similar to recent quarters, the growth was primarily concentrated in our large corporate and middle market segments. Large corporate growth occurred in most industry verticals, most notably, media, healthcare and energy. And momentum within the middle market segment continued to build as it was up by about 10% sequentially. 
Residential loan growth was driven by guaranteed loans which increased by $1.2 billion and was partially offset by a decline in Home Equity. All consumer category loans increased, led by student loans, which was up primarily due to the full benefit of loans acquired during the prior quarter. 
The growth from last year was driven entirely by targeted categories, specifically C&I, guaranteed mortgage and consumer loans. C&I increased by $5.4 billion or 12%. Similar to the sequential quarter story, loan growth was widespread across large corporate industry verticals, as well as our middle market segments. Guaranteed mortgages were up $2.2 billion and consumer loans grew by $4 billion, led by student and auto. Conversely, CRE, construction, Home Equity and non-guaranteed mortgage balances all were managed down by about $3 billion in total. This contributed to a continued derisking of the loan portfolio, which you see on Slide 10. 
The portfolios that we've categorized as higher risk declined by $13.6 billion or 58% over the past few years and they were down by another $400 million this quarter. But the declines evenly distributed across the 3 major categories. Higher risk balances were managed down by $2.4 billion or 20% over the prior year, commercial construction comprised $1 billion of the decline, while higher risk home Equity and mortgage balances both declined by $700 million. 
As can be seen at the bottom of the page, the overall decline in the higher risk balances has essentially been offset by increases in government-guaranteed loans, which has helped to significantly alter the risk profile of the portfolio in a relatively short period of time. This improved risk profile becomes evident in our credit trends which you see on Slide 11. 
Credit quality continued to trend favorably this quarter, with meaningful declines in delinquencies, nonperforming assets and loans and net charge-offs. Early stage delinquencies, excluding government-guaranteed loans, were down by 9 basis points this quarter. The accelerated rate of improvement from prior quarters is attributable to normal seasonality of delinquency trends, coupled with continued improvements in the loan portfolio. We're happy to report a 29 basis point decline in indirect, a 19 basis point improvement in Home Equity and an 11 basis point decline in non-guaranteed mortgages. 
Nonperforming assets and nonperforming loans both declined by approximately $250 million this quarter. The 9% sequential quarter reduction in nonperforming loans is primarily driven by declines in commercial construction and residential mortgages. A portion of the residential mortgage decline was the result of our decision to move $86 million of nonperforming loans to held for sale and we expect to complete the sale of these loans during the second quarter. Relative to the prior year, nonperforming loans declined about $1.3 billion or 33%, with commercial construction, C&I, CRE and residential mortgage the largest contributors. 
Several banks this quarter reclassified into NPL, performing Home Equity lines that are behind delinquent first mortgages. Based upon our existing accounting policies and practices, we did not believe it was necessary for us to make a similar reclassification. However, I will point out that our reserving methodology takes this issue into account either by the direct knowledge we have from servicing the first mortgage or via the regular refreshing of FICO scores which quickly respond to borrower delinquencies. Therefore, if we are ever required to reclassify this small population of performing loans as nonperforming, we would expect income statement impact to be immaterial. 
Net charge-offs were down by $50 million or 11% sequentially, which was better than our expectations. Declines came from most loan categories, most notably C&I, CRE and residential construction. These declines were partially offset by a $10 million increase in residential mortgage charge-offs, the result of the aforementioned move of certain nonperforming loans to held for sale. Relative to the prior year, net charge-offs were lower by about $150 million, driven by commercial construction, residential mortgages and Home Equity. 
In light of the continued improvement in credit quality, the allowance for loan and lease loss ratio declined by 9 basis points to 1.92%. Excluding government-guaranteed loans from the denominator of the calculation, the ratio at quarter end stood at 2.16%. 
Overall, we're pleased with the continued improvement in credit trends. As we look to the second quarter, we currently expect to see additional declines in nonperforming loans and relatively stable to down net charge-offs. 
Let's take a look at our deposit performance. This quarter, we again benefited from favorable deposit trends. Average client deposits grew $800 million, with all of that coming from lower-cost categories. CDA was the primary driver, up $1.3 billion or 4%, with growth from both consumer and commercial clients. Conversely, higher cost time deposits balances continued their decline by $700 million or 4%. Compared to a year ago, client deposits grew by about $5 billion or 4%. DDA increased by over $7 billion or 25%. Savings was up by $600 million or 14%, while time deposits declined by $2.4 billion or about 12%. We've been able to achieve this deposit growth while also closely managing pricing, demonstrated by interest-bearing deposit costs coming down 17 basis points from last year. 
Another benefit of our strong liquidity position and DDA growth is that we reduced our average long-term debt by $2.5 billion from last year. Collectively, these favorable liability trends have resulted in an $82 million or 27% year-over-year decline in our overall interest expense, which has been a major driver of our net interest income growth. 
Slide 13 provides information on our capital metrics. Tier 1 common capital increased for the seventh consecutive quarter, up sequentially by another $200 million as a result of retained earnings. Tier 1 common ratio ended the quarter at an estimated 9.3%, up from 9.22% at year end. The tangible common equity ratio increased by 5 basis points due to higher earnings which also led to the increased tangible book value per share shown on the bottom right of the page. 
Let's turn to Slide 14 for a discussion of our Playbook for Profitable Growth expense program. As you know, our PPG Expense Program's ultimate goal is the removal of $300 million from our run rate expenses by the end of next year. To date, we've achieved $190 million of these savings on an annualized basis. This program is comprised of several fundamental expense savings initiatives. They're broken into 3 main buckets: strategic supply management, consumer bank efficiencies and operations and support staff. You can see on the bottom of this slide that many of our programs are well underway and we've clearly attained some good initial results. 
Our strategic supply management initiatives have lowered costs with our suppliers, as well as reduced our own demand for such services. In addition to contract renegotiations, savings are being realized through markedly reduced travel and lower usage of temporary labor, courier and print services. 
In the consumer bank efficiencies category, savings have come through branch staff and location efficiencies that we achieved via technological advancements and strategic investment in lower cost channels. This is a win-win as our clients value the enhanced conveniences and adoption rates of the new technology have been high. 
Further, we garnered savings on our rewards check card program by renegotiating what we pay for the rewards and restructuring the rewards earnings rate. 
Several initiatives have driven our operations and support staff savings. We further reduced spends in layers in the organization and initiated lean process design efforts to streamline key business processes, generate measurable savings and enhance client experiences. 
Furthermore, we made significant progress in our efforts to leverage digital technology, reducing paper statements by hundreds of thousands. These items, coupled with the progress we made last year, put us in a good position relative to our stated expense savings goal. Taking the broader view and looking over the longer term, we are acutely focused on improving our overall efficiency ratio. We've previously articulated our longer-term goal for sub 60% efficiency ratio upon the abatement of elevated credit- and mortgage-related expenses and that is what we're actively working toward. This program is the start and is providing the impetus for us to become a more efficiently run organization. 
I'll conclude today with an overview of some changes that we've made to our segment reporting structure. You will recall that we previously reported results for 6 primary lines of business: Retail Banking, Diversified Commercial Banking, Corporate and Investment Banking, Wealth and Investment Management, Mortgage, and Commercial Real Estate, with the remainder in Corporate Other. 
Starting in 2012, our results are being reported via the 4 segments that you see here: Consumer Banking and Private Wealth Management, Wholesale Banking, Mortgage Banking and Corporate Other. Mortgage and Corporate Other are largely unchanged, but there are notable changes in the other 2 segments. 
First, we formed Consumer Banking and Private Wealth Management by combining our legacy retail line of business with the private Wealth portion of our former Wealth and Investment Management business. 
Second, we created Wholesale Banking by combining our previous Corporate and Investment Banking, Diversified Commercial and CRE lines of business. 
Business Banking, our small business banking unit, which was previously included in retail, is also now part of wholesale. Additionally, the other major units of our former Wealth and Investment Management unit, our family office and RidgeWorth our mutual fund complex, also roll up into the new wholesale reporting segments. 
These changes were made in light of how our clients want to bank with us and how we manage our business. For example, when the business client has cash management, lending, real estate and capital markets needs, we service client by delivering SunTrust's full set of capabilities via our Wholesale Banking line of business, and this reporting structure facilitates that delivery approach. 
Similarly, when a consumer client has traditional banking and Wealth management needs, our Consumer Banking and Private Wealth Management line of business is able to seamlessly offer these capabilities. 
To best serve our client needs, we have reorganized our management structure last year and appointed an executive to run each of our major segments. Brad is in charge of Consumer Banking and Private Wealth management. Mark Chancy runs Wholesale Banking and Jerome Leonhardt leads Mortgage Banking. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bill to wrap us up before we go to Q&A."

Before we move on, let me briefly share with you a few comments about our business line performance to help reiterate the improvement we're seeing in our underlying core performance. 
During the quarter, Consumer and Private Wealth Management completed our deposit transformation away from free checking. We retained 98% of our balances through this process and the average deposit size of a new checking account is up almost 50% in our Everyday Checking product relative to what it was under free checking. 
Loyalty, as you might expect, took an early dip during the transition, but I'm pleased to say that there's rebounded and now exceeds where we were before the transformation and maybe, most importantly, total deposits that continue the favorable trend. Now another good sign of early recovery and our execution is evidenced in Consumer Lending overall, where production has been very strong. It's up 24% on a year-over-year basis, and that's totally organic from purchased assets. 
Our wholesale business continues to perform well. Net income is up 60% from the prior year. Our corporate Investment Banking business continues to build momentum, and this unit posted its second-highest quarterly profit ever. C&I loan growth, overall, remains solid, though still more concentrated in large corporate and middle market. Deposits are strong and the wholesale line of business is generating positive operating leverage. 
While we continue to manage through the legacy issues in mortgage, origination activity was a bright spot this quarter. Production was up by 1/3 from the prior year reaffirming our relationship-driven model. So our progress is steady. We're on the path of group performance relative to our opportunity. 
I'll wrap up my comments on the quarter, I'd characterize our results had a solid start to the year that build upon improved momentum that we established and generated last year. We benefited from the mortgage refinance tailwind this quarter, helping us overcome some of the fee income headwinds on the consumer side. More broadly, though, we see good underlying, improving core performance in virtually all of our businesses. 
So with that said, Kris, I'll turn it over to Q&A."

I think we're pretty close to our clients. We understand what their needs are.

As you heard from our previous answer to Betsy, we've certainly got a store of liquidity available to support that loan growth.

I talked about the consumer side being up 24% over last year. first quarter is always lower than the fourth quarter, but production is up. Pipelines in the commercial and large corporate side look good. But to a lease point, the real leverage is in utilization. Utilization is basically flat and has continued to be flat multi-quarter. Given sort of our concentration in this business, the nature of the type of commitments we make, the loyalty that we have from our client base, any economic recovery where utilization starts to increase, we get, I think, sort of a disproportionate impact of that on the positive side."

When you look at Q4 versus Q1, our overall noninterest expenses were down $120 million. One way to think about that is that $120 million was really all the reduction of the fourth quarter accrual for mortgage servicing litigation. So that brings us about flat. Within that flat, Q4 to Q1, there were lots of puts and takes. Generally, here's the high-level numbers of what we saw Q4 to Q1. The employee comp and benefits were up about $170 million, as I said. The pieces that went into that $170 million were the low pension number in the fourth quarter as a result of the curtailment, the reduction in other incentive plans we put in place in the fourth quarter and the Q1 seasonal increase in FICA and employee benefits. So those are basically the components of the $170 million increase. And that $170 million was basically offset by reductions in marketing, in operating losses, litigation accruals and FDIC premium and in those credit and collection costs and other noninterest expenses like legal and consulting, lower PPG severance, et cetera, so net-net, down $120 million, but with a lot of puts and takes. Having said that, most of those puts and takes were really in Q4 noise, not Q1 noise. As I think about Q1, it was a relative -- it was a very clean noiseless quarter, and most of the differences were really Q4 items from last year."

And I'll begin today's call with some brief comments on the first quarter, and then I'm going to pass it over to Aleem to provide the details on the results. We'll start on Slide 3 of our presentation where we hit the high-level points. Net income for the quarter was $245 million and earnings per share was $0.46, which was $0.33 increase over last quarter and a $0.38 increase over prior year. Growth in revenue and continued favorable loan deposit and asset quality trends drove the improved results. 
Both net interest income and noninterest income were up over last quarter. On the net interest income side, we benefited from higher loan balances, lower cost deposit growth and a reduction in funding costs, such that our net interest margin expanded 3 basis points. Sequential quarter fee income was up sharply, and most notably in mortgage production, as low interest rates and HARP 2 drove significant refinance activity. On a year-over-year basis, fee income was stable as high mortgage revenue this quarter offset the lost income due to debit interchange changes and lower security gains. 
Expenses declined from prior quarter, and we've made significant progress against our Playbook for Profitable Growth expense savings goal. Today, we've put in placed annualized savings of $190 million, and as such, we're on track to achieve the $300 million goal for the program. So while I'm pleased with the progress, this is ultimately about establishing an efficiency-minded culture, which will allow us to exceed our goal without a bounce-back. 
Now moving to the balance sheet. Favorable loan and deposit trends continued this quarter. Performing loans were up 3%, with growth in targeted categories and declines in higher-risk loans. We also saw sustained lower-cost deposit growth. Credit quality also continued to improve with marked decreases in all primary credit metrics. Nonperforming loans were down another 9% this quarter, and net charge-offs were down 11% sequentially. 
Now lastly, we generated positive capital growth and our capital ratios remained strong and well in excess of our current and proposed regulatory requirements. 
Now that being said, however, let me take a moment to proactively address CCAR. As part of the process moving forward, we'll be resubmitting our capital plan. We're required to submit the revised plan by mid-June and then expect to hear back by the end of the third quarter. First quarter results will be included in our submission, and we'll be running another full stress test. This new submission will only cover any proposed capital actions for the fourth quarter of this year and first quarter of 2013 as anything beyond that will be incorporated in the next year's CCAR process. So we're still in the process of learning all the variables. There's not much to report at this time. We're going to be working closely with our board as we decide what to include in our revised submission. 
So with that, Aleem, let me turn it over to you."

I'll begin my comments this morning on Slide 4 with a high-level overview of the income statement. 
Earnings per share this quarter were $0.46, which compares favorably to the $0.13 per shares -- $0.13 per share reported last quarter and the $0.08 per share from last year. The $0.33 sequential quarter increase was driven by both higher revenue and lower expenses. Revenue increased by $171 million with growth in both net interest income and noninterest income, the latter of which was largely mortgage-related. Expenses declined by $126 million, primarily the result of the $120 million fourth quarter accrual for the potential mortgage servicing settlement. 
Relative to the prior year, the $0.38 earnings per share increase was driven by higher net interest income, a lower provision resulting from improved credit quality and the elimination of the TARP dividend drag. In addition to the preferred dividend payments made that quarter, we also incurred a $74 million noncash charge related to the unamortized discount upon the redemption of the TARP shares. 
Let's now delve deeper into each of the major income statement categories, beginning with net interest income on Slide 5. Net interest income increased sequentially by $18 million or 1%. This was driven by higher average loan balances and favorable liability trends, including reduced rates paid on deposits, strong DDA growth and lower average long-term debt. This combination of actions drove a 9 basis point decline in our liability costs this quarter, which more than offset a 5 basis point decrease in our interest-earning asset yield, leading to the 3 basis point increase in net interest margin. This increase exceeded our expectations due primarily to better-than-forecasted deposit trends. 
Relative to the prior year, net interest income grew $65 million or 5%. This increase was driven by a $7 billion increase in average loan balances, improvements in deposit mix and pricing, including a 25% increase in DDA, and $5 billion of combined reductions in longer-term debt and CD balances. 
As you're aware, part of our overall interest rate risk management strategy includes hedging certain floating rate commercial loans with received fixed swaps. The swaps effectively convert these loans from floating to fixed rate. Net interest income attributable to the commercial loan swap position is approximately $150 million during the first quarter of 2012. And as previously disclosed, we will see about a $35 million decline from this amount in the  second quarter. 
Effectively, some of our previously fixed rate commercial loans are converting back to floating. This $35 million decline will equate to about 10 basis points of net interest margin compression. Assuming no major changes to LIBOR, commercial loan swap income is expected to remain relatively stable at this new run rate for the remainder of the year. 
Let's turn to noninterest income on Slide 6. Noninterest income increased by $153 million from the fourth quarter, driven by higher mortgage-related revenue which was up by $125 million. Excluding the $40 million decline in the mortgage repurchase provision, core mortgage production income was up by $85 million or more than 50%. Production volume this quarter was $7.7 billion, 12% increase from the fourth quarter. 
Locked volume increased more than 30%, and we also saw wider gains on sale. About 3/4 of this quarter's volume was refinance related, and we began to take HARP 2.0 applications. Borrowers are taking advantage of this program, and we're being proactive about helping them as we think this program is a beneficial one for our clients and our country. 
Mortgage servicing income also increased from the prior quarter, up by $59 million. This was due in part to the $38 million MSR write-down we took during the fourth quarter in anticipation of increased prepayment volume from HARP refinancings. Third quarter results also benefited from favorable net hedge performance. 
While mortgage income was strong this quarter, certain fee categories exhibited seasonal weakness, such as deposit service charges and investment banking, which declined by $12 million and $16 million, respectively. Relative to last year, fee income was stable on a reported basis and up 7% on an adjusted basis. The primary puts and takes were higher mortgage production income, due to both increased volume and margins, and lower card fees due to the impact of the new debit interchange regulations. 
Turn to Slide 7 to discuss mortgage repurchases. As shown on the top-left portion of this slide, the purchase demands were $448 million this quarter, down by about $190 million from the high level experienced during the fourth quarter. The timing of demands continues to be variable and this quarter's decline was the result of lower demand volume from Fannie Mae. 
Consistent with what we expressed last quarter, we believe the trend suggest that the agencies are making progress and working through the backlog of potential demands from prior years. Specifically, the composition of the demands this quarter remained concentrated in loans that have already been through the foreclosure process while the request for full loan files, the precursor -- the future demands, continue to become more skewed toward loans that are delinquent but not yet in foreclosure. 
Pending population, shown on the top-right portion of this slide, declined by about $25 million, ending this quarter at $564 million. This was primarily the result of fewer new demands. 
Bottom-left portion of the page shows the changes in the mortgage repurchase reserve. Mortgage repurchase provision this quarter was $175 million, which exceeded the $113 million in net charge-offs. The resulting $63 million increase in the reserve was made in light of our expectation for continued high levels of future demands, as well as the belief that the decline in net charge-offs could be timing related. 
Some summary statistics of our sold mortgages are displayed on the bottom right of the page, and we've also provided for you in the appendix the same level of additional detail on the 2006 to 2008 vintages that we shared last quarter. 
Overall, I'd note that our expectations around mortgage repurchases remain similar to a quarter ago. We foresee demand volume remaining high and variable in the coming quarters. However, if the patterns and full file requests and demands continue to play themselves out as expected, we continue to believe we will experience a reduced income statement impact toward the latter part of the year. 
Let's move on to expenses on Slide 8. On a reported basis, expenses declined by $126 million from the fourth quarter. This was largely the result of the $120 million accrual taken in the fourth quarter for the potential mortgage servicing settlement. We also saw a decline in credit-related expenses and operating losses. As usual, we provide some additional information on these expenses in our appendix. You'll see that, collectively, they were down by $91 million, with the primary drivers being seasonally lower credit and collections expenses, lower losses from other real estate owned and lower legal and mortgage servicing-related accruals. 
Employee compensation and benefits increased by $173 million this quarter. You'll recall this line item was abnormally low in the fourth quarter as we curtailed our pension plan and made reductions to our 2011 incentive compensation pools. After you adjust for these 2 items, the increase this quarter was primarily related to the normal seasonal increase in employee benefits cost.
Relative to the prior year, expenses were up by $76 million. Employee compensation and benefits increased by $43 million in light of improved performance and modest annual salary increases. Operating losses were also higher, up $33 million, as a result of specific legal and mortgage servicing accruals. Conversely, marketing and FDIC premiums and regulatory assessments were down by a combined $30 million. 
Before we turn to the balance sheet sliding on slide -- starting on Slide 9, I'll summarize the income statement this quarter by noting that we benefited from many of the favorable trends that began to develop in the second half of 2011, and we were pleased to begin 2012 with a quarter of solid core performance. Average performing loans grew by a healthy $3.3 billion or 3% from the fourth quarter and were up by $8.6 billion or 8% from the prior year. The sequential quarter increase was relatively evenly split between the commercial, residential and consumer loan categories. 
Within the commercial book, C&I was again the primary driver, up $1.1 billion or 2%. Similar to recent quarters, the growth was primarily concentrated in our large corporate and middle market segments. Large corporate growth occurred in most industry verticals, most notably, media, healthcare and energy. And momentum within the middle market segment continued to build as it was up by about 10% sequentially. Residential loan growth was driven by guaranteed loans, which increased by $1.2 billion, and was partially offset by a decline in home equity. All consumer category loans increased, led by student loans, which was up primarily due to the full benefit of loans acquired during the prior quarter. 
The growth from last year was driven entirely by targeted categories, specifically C&I, guaranteed mortgage and consumer loans. C&I increased by $5.4 billion or 12%. Similar to the sequential quarter story, loan growth was widespread across large corporate industry verticals, as well as our middle market segments. Guaranteed mortgages were up $2.2 billion, and consumer loans grew by $4 billion, led by student and auto. Conversely, CRE, construction, home equity and non-guaranteed mortgage balances all were managed down by about $3 billion in total. This contributed to a continued derisking of the loan portfolio, which you see on Slide 10. 
The portfolios that we've categorized as higher risk declined by $13.6 billion or 58% over the past few years, and they were down by another $400 million this quarter. But the declines evenly distributed across the 3 major categories. Higher-risk balances were managed down by $2.4 billion or 20% over the prior year. Commercial construction comprised $1 billion of the decline while higher risk home equity and mortgage balances both declined by $700 million. 
As can be seen at the bottom of the page, the overall decline in the higher-risk balances has essentially been offset by increases in government-guaranteed loans, which has helped to significantly alter the risk profile of the portfolio in a relatively short period of time. This improved risk profile becomes evident in our credit trends, which you see on Slide 11. 
Credit quality continued to trend favorably this quarter, with meaningful declines in delinquencies, nonperforming assets and loans and net charge-offs. Early-stage delinquencies, excluding government-guaranteed loans, were down by 9 basis points this quarter. The accelerated rate of improvement from prior quarters is attributable to normal seasonality of delinquency trends, coupled with continued improvements in the loan portfolio. We're happy to report a 29 basis point decline in indirect, a 19 basis point improvement in home equity and an 11 basis point decline in non-guaranteed mortgages. 
Nonperforming assets and nonperforming loans both declined by approximately $250 million this quarter. The 9% sequential quarter reduction in nonperforming loans is primarily driven by declines in commercial construction and residential mortgages. A portion of the residential mortgage decline was the result of our decision to move $86 million of nonperforming loans to held for sale, and we expect to complete the sale of these loans during the second quarter. Relative to the prior year, nonperforming loans declined about $1.3 billion or 33%, with commercial construction, C&I, CRE and residential mortgage the largest contributors. 
Several banks this quarter reclassified into NPL, performing home equity lines that are behind delinquent first mortgages. Based upon our existing accounting policies and practices, we did not believe it was necessary for us to make a similar reclassification. However, I will point out that our reserving methodology takes this issue into account, either by the direct knowledge we have from servicing the first mortgage or via the regular refreshing of FICO scores which quickly respond to borrower delinquencies. Therefore, if we are ever required to reclassify this small population of performing loans as nonperforming, we would expect the income statement impact to be immaterial. 
Net charge-offs were down by $50 million or 11% sequentially, which was better than our expectations. Declines came from most loan categories, most notably C&I, CRE and residential construction. These declines were partially offset by a $10 million increase in residential mortgage charge-offs, the result of the aforementioned move of certain nonperforming loans to held for sale. Relative to the prior year, net charge-offs were lower by about $150 million, driven by commercial construction, residential mortgages and home equity. 
In light of the continued improvement in credit quality, the allowance for loan and lease loss ratio declined by 9 basis points to 1.92%. Excluding government-guaranteed loans from the denominator of the calculation, the ratio at quarter end stood at 2.16%. Overall, we're pleased with the continued improvement in credit trends. As we look to the second quarter, we currently expect to see additional declines in nonperforming loans and relatively stable to down net charge-offs. 
Let's take a look at our deposit performance. This quarter, we again benefited from favorable deposit trends. Average client deposits grew $800 million, with all of that coming from lower-cost categories. DDA was the primary driver, up $1.3 billion or 4%, with growth from both consumer and commercial clients. Conversely, higher-cost time deposits balances continued their decline by $700 million or 4%. Compared to a year ago, client deposits grew by about $5 billion or 4%. DDA increased by over $7 billion or 25%. Savings was up by $600 million or 14% while time deposits declined by $2.4 billion or about 12%. We've been able to achieve this deposit growth while also closely managing pricing, demonstrated by interest-bearing deposit costs coming down 17 basis points from last year. 
Another benefit of our strong liquidity position and DDA growth is that we reduced our average long-term debt by $2.5 billion from last year. Collectively, these favorable liability trends have resulted in an $82 million or 27% year-over-year decline in our overall interest expense, which has been a major driver of our net interest income growth. 
Slide 13 provides information on our capital metrics. Tier 1 common capital increased for the seventh consecutive quarter, up sequentially by another $200 million as a result of retained earnings. Tier 1 common ratio ended the quarter at an estimated 9.3%, up from 9.22% at year end. The tangible common equity ratio increased by 5 basis points due to higher earnings which also led to the increased tangible book value per share shown on the bottom right of the page. 
Let's turn to Slide 14 for a discussion of our Playbook for Profitable Growth Expense program. As you know, our PPG Expense program's ultimate goal is the removal of $300 million from our run rate expenses by the end of next year. To date, we've achieved $190 million of these savings on an annualized basis. This program is comprised of several fundamental expense-savings initiatives. They're broken into 3 main buckets: strategic supply management, consumer bank efficiencies and operations and support staff. You can see on the bottom of this slide that many of our programs are well underway, and we've clearly attained some good initial results. 
Our strategic supply management initiatives have lowered costs with our suppliers, as well as reduced our own demand for such services. In addition to contract renegotiations, savings are being realized through markedly reduced travel and lower usage of temporary labor, courier and print services. 
In the consumer bank efficiencies category, savings have come through branch, staff and location efficiencies that we achieved via technological advancements and strategic investment in lower cost channels. This is a win-win as our clients value the enhanced conveniences and adoption rates of the new technology have been high. Further, we garnered savings on our rewards check card program by renegotiating what we pay for the rewards and restructuring the rewards earnings rate. 
Several initiatives have driven our operations and support staff savings. We further reduced spends in layers in the organization and initiated Lean process design efforts to streamline key business processes, generate measurable savings and enhance client experiences. Furthermore, we made significant progress in our efforts to leverage digital technology, reducing paper statements by hundreds of thousands. These items, coupled with the progress we made last year, put us in a good position relative to our stated expense savings goal. 
Taking the broader view and looking over the longer term, we are acutely focused on improving our overall efficiency ratio. We've previously articulated our longer-term goal for a sub-60% efficiency ratio upon the abatement of elevated credit- and mortgage-related expenses, and that is what we're actively working toward. This program is the start and is providing the impetus for us to become a more efficiently run organization. 
I'll conclude today with an overview of some changes that we've made to our segment reporting structure. You will recall that we previously reported results for 6 primary lines of business: Retail Banking, Diversified Commercial Banking, Corporate and Investment Banking, Wealth and Investment Management, Mortgage, and Commercial Real Estate, with the remainder in Corporate Other. Starting in 2012, our results are being reported via the 4 segments that you see here: Consumer Banking and Private Wealth Management, Wholesale Banking, Mortgage Banking and Corporate Other. 
Mortgage and Corporate Other are largely unchanged, but there are notable changes in the other 2 segments. First, we formed Consumer Banking and Private Wealth Management by combining our legacy Retail line of business with the private wealth portion of our former Wealth and Investment Management line business. 
Second, we created Wholesale Banking by combining our previous Corporate and Investment Banking, Diversified Commercial and CRE lines of business. Business Banking, our small business banking unit, which was previously included in Retail, is also now part of Wholesale. Additionally, the other major units of our former Wealth and Investment Management unit GenSpring, our family office, and RidgeWorth, our mutual fund complex, also roll up into the new Wholesale reporting segment.
These changes were made in light of how our clients want to bank with us and how we manage our business. For example, when the business client has cash management, lending, real estate and capital markets needs, we serve this client by delivering SunTrust's full set of capabilities via our Wholesale Banking line of business, and this reporting structure facilitates that delivery approach. Similarly, when a consumer client has traditional banking and wealth management needs, our Consumer Banking and Private Wealth Management line of business is able to seamlessly offer these capabilities. 
To best serve our client needs, we reorganized our management structure last year and appointed an executive to run each of our major segments. Brad is in charge of Consumer Banking and Private Wealth Management. Mark Chancy runs Wholesale Banking, and Jerome Lienhard leads Mortgage Banking. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bill to wrap us up before we go to Q&A."

Before we move on, let me briefly share with you a few comments about our business line performance to help reiterate the improvement we're seeing in our underlying core performance. 
During the quarter, Consumer and Private Wealth Management completed our deposit transformation away from free checking. We retained 98% of our balances through this process, and the average deposit size of a new checking account is up almost 50% in our Everyday Checking product relative to what it was under free checking. Loyalty, as you might expect, took an early dip during the transition, but I'm pleased to say it has rebounded and it now exceeds where we were before the transformation and maybe most importantly, total deposits that continue the favorable trend. 
Now another good sign of early recovery and -- in our execution is evidenced in consumer lending overall, where production has been very strong. It's up 24% on a year-over-year basis, and that's totally organic, not from purchased assets. 
Our Wholesale business continues to perform well. Net income is up 60% from the prior year. Our Corporate Investment Banking business continues to build momentum, and this unit posted its second-highest quarterly profit ever. C&I loan growth, overall, remains solid, though still more concentrated in larger corporate and middle market. Deposits are strong and the Wholesale line of business is generating positive operating leverage. 
While we continue to manage through the legacy issues in mortgage, origination activity was a bright spot this quarter. Production was up by 1/3 from the prior year, reaffirming our relationship-driven model. So our progress is steady. We're on the path to improved performance relative to our opportunity. 
I'll wrap up my comments on the quarter. I'd characterize our results as a solid start to the year that builds upon improved momentum that we established and generated last year. We benefited from the mortgage refinance tailwind this quarter, helping us overcome some of the fee income headwinds on the consumer side. More broadly, though, we see good underlying improving core performance in virtually all of our businesses. 
So with that said, Kris, I'll turn it over to Q&A."

And while we see sort of glimpses of it and we'll see a week to week or slight improvement, it still is not the big driver, and refinance will eventually runs its course.

Within that flat Q4 to Q1, there were a lots of puts and takes. Generally, here's the high-level numbers of what we saw Q4 to Q1. Employee comp and benefits was up about $170 million, as I said. The pieces that went into that $170 million were the low pension number in the fourth quarter as a result of the curtailment, the reduction in other incentive plans we put in place in the fourth quarter and the Q1 seasonal increase in FICA and employee benefits. So those are, basically, the components of the $170 million increase. And that $170 million was basically offset by reductions in marketing, in operating losses, litigation accruals, in FDIC premium and in those credit and collection costs and other noninterest expenses, like legal and consulting, lower PPG, severance, et cetera. So net-net, down $120 million but with a lot of puts and takes. Having said that, most of those puts and takes were really a Q4 noise, not Q1 noise.

It looks like from what the announcements we saw over the last week or so, Craig, that money centers were asked to make this change but regional banks generally weren't. But having said that, let me sort of lead you through how we're looking at this now. So we've got a $15 billion home equity book. About 1/3 of that book are actually firsts, not seconds. Of the remainder, about 1/3 of those, we already serviced the firsts. So we can see what's going on in the first and we have good -- a good sense of what's going on in that book. Of the remainder where there are seconds and we don't service the firsts, we actually do a FICO refresh every quarter.

Therefore, if we are ever requested to put a required, to put what our currently performing loans into a nonperforming category, we actually don't expect that the income statement impact would be material for us."

And I'll begin today's call with some brief comments on the first quarter, and then I'm going to pass it over to Aleem to provide the details on the results. We'll start on Slide 3 of our presentation where we hit the high-level points. Net income for the quarter was $245 million and earnings per share was $0.46, which was $0.33 increase over last quarter and a $0.38 increase over the prior year. Growth in revenue and continued favorable loan deposit and asset quality trends drove the improved results. 
Both net interest income and noninterest income were up over last quarter. On the net interest income side, we benefited from higher loan balances, lower cost deposit growth and a reduction in funding costs, such that our net interest margin expanded 3 basis points. Sequential quarter fee income was up sharply, and most notably in mortgage production, as low interest rates and HARP 2 drove significant refinance activity. On a year-over-year basis, fee income was stable as high mortgage revenue this quarter offset the lost income due to debit interchange changes and lower security gains. 
Expenses declined from prior quarter, and we've made significant progress against our Playbook for Profitable Growth expense savings goal. Today, we've put in place annualized savings of $190 million, and as such, we're on track to achieve the $300 million goal for the program. So while I'm pleased with the progress, this is ultimately about establishing an efficiency-minded culture, which will allow us to exceed our goal without a bounce-back. 
Now moving to the balance sheet. Favorable loan and deposit trends continued this quarter. Performing loans were up 3%, with growth in targeted categories and declines in high-risk loans. We also saw sustained lower-cost deposit growth. Credit quality also continued to improve with marked decreases in all primary credit metrics. Nonperforming loans were down another 9% this quarter, and net charge-offs were down 11% sequentially. 
Lastly, we generated positive capital growth and our capital ratios remained strong and well in excess of our current and proposed regulatory requirements. 
Now that being said, however, let me take a moment to proactively address CCAR. As part of the process moving forward, we'll be resubmitting our capital plan. We're required to submit the revised plan by mid-June and then expect to hear back by the end of the third quarter. First quarter results will be included in our submission, and we'll be running another full stress test. This new submission will only cover any proposed capital actions for the fourth quarter of this year and first quarter of 2013 as anything beyond that will be incorporated in the next year's CCAR process. So we're still in the process of learning all the variables. There's not much to report at this time. We're going to be working closely with our board as we decide what to include in our revised submission. 
So with that, Aleem, let me turn it over to you."

Thank you for joining us. I'll begin my comments this morning on Slide 4 with a high-level overview of the income statement.

I'll begin my comments this morning on Slide 4 with a high-level overview of the income statement. 
Earnings per share this quarter were $0.46, which compares favorably to the $0.13 per shares -- $0.13 per share reported last quarter and the $0.08 per share from last year. The $0.33 sequential quarter increase was driven by both higher revenue and lower expenses. Revenue increased by $171 million with growth in both net interest income and noninterest income, the latter of which was largely mortgage-related. Expenses declined by $126 million, primarily the result of the $120 million fourth quarter accrual for the potential mortgage servicing settlement. 
Relative to the prior year, the $0.38 earnings per share increase was driven by higher net interest income, a lower provision resulting from improved credit quality and the elimination of the TARP dividend drag. In addition to the preferred dividend payments made that quarter, we also incurred a $74 million noncash charge related to the unamortized discount upon the redemption of the TARP shares. 
Let's now delve deeper into each of the major income statement categories, beginning with net interest income on Slide 5. Net interest income increased sequentially by $18 million or 1%. This was driven by higher average loan balances and favorable liability trends, including reduced rates paid on deposits, strong DDA growth and lower average long-term debt. This combination of actions drove a 9 basis point decline in our liability costs this quarter, which more than offset a 5 basis point decrease in our interest-earning asset yield, leading to the 3 basis point increase in net interest margin. This increase exceeded our expectations due primarily to better-than-forecasted deposit trends. 
Relative to the prior year, net interest income grew $65 million or 5%. This increase was driven by a $7 billion increase in average loan balances, improvements in deposit mix and pricing, including a 25% increase in DDA and $5 billion of combined reductions in longer-term debt and CD balances. 
As you're aware, part of our overall interest rate risk management strategy includes hedging certain floating rate commercial loans with received fixed swaps. The swaps effectively convert these loans from floating to fixed rate. Net interest income attributable to the commercial loan swap position was approximately $150 million during the first quarter of 2012. And as previously disclosed, we will see about a $35 million decline from this amount in the second quarter. 
Effectively, some of our previously fixed rate commercial loans are converting back to floating. This $35 million decline will equate to about 10 basis points of net interest margin compression. Assuming no major changes to LIBOR, commercial loan swap income is expected to remain relatively stable at this new run rate for the remainder of the year. 
Let's turn to noninterest income on Slide 6. Noninterest income increased by $153 million from the fourth quarter, driven by higher mortgage-related revenue which was up by $125 million. Excluding the $40 million decline in the mortgage repurchase provision, core mortgage production income was up by $85 million or more than 50%. Production volume this quarter was $7.7 billion, 12% increase from the fourth quarter. 
Locked volume increased more than 30%, and we also saw wider gains on sale. About 3/4 of this quarter's volume was refinance related, and we began to take HARP 2.0 applications. Borrowers are taking advantage of this program, and we're being proactive about helping them as we think this program is a beneficial one for our clients and our country. 
Mortgage servicing income also increased from the prior quarter, up by $59 million. This was due in part to the $38 million MSR write-down we took during the fourth quarter in anticipation of increased prepayment volume from HARP refinancings. Third quarter results also benefited from favorable net hedge performance. 
While mortgage income was strong this quarter, certain fee categories exhibited seasonal weakness, such as deposit service charges and investment banking, which declined by $12 million and $16 million, respectively. Relative to last year, fee income was stable on a reported basis and up 7% on an adjusted basis. The primary puts and takes were higher mortgage production income, due to both increased volume and margins, and lower card fees due to the impact of the new debit interchange regulations. 
Turn to Slide 7 to discuss mortgage repurchases. As shown in the top left portion of this slide, the purchase demands were $448 million this quarter, down by about $190 million from the high level experienced during the fourth quarter. The timing of demands continues to be variable and this quarter's decline was the result of lower demand volume from Fannie Mae. 
Consistent with what we expressed last quarter, we believe the trends suggest that the agencies are making progress and working through the backlog of potential demands from prior years. Specifically, the composition of the demands this quarter remained concentrated in loans that have already been through the foreclosure process while the requests for full loan files, the precursor to future demands, continue to become more skewed toward loans that are delinquent but not yet in foreclosure. 
Pending population, shown in the top right portion of this slide, declined by about $25 million, ending this quarter at $564 million. This was primarily the result of fewer new demands. 
Bottom left portion of the page shows the changes in the mortgage repurchase reserve. Mortgage repurchase provision this quarter was $175 million, which exceeded the $113 million in net charge-offs. The resulting $63 million increase in the reserve was made in light of our expectation for continued high levels of future demands, as well as the belief that the decline in net charge-offs could be timing related. 
Some summary statistics of our sold mortgages are displayed in the bottom right of the page, and we've also provided for you in the appendix the same level of additional detail on the 2006 to 2008 vintages that we shared last quarter. 
Overall, I'd note that our expectations around mortgage repurchases remain similar to a quarter ago. We foresee demand volume remaining high and variable in the coming quarters. However, if the patterns and full file requests and demands continue to play themselves out as expected, we continue to believe we will experience a reduced income statement impact toward the latter part of the year. 
Let's move on to expenses on Slide 8. On a reported basis, expenses declined by $126 million from the fourth quarter. This was largely the result of the $120 million accrual taken in the fourth quarter for the potential mortgage servicing settlement. We also saw a decline in credit-related expenses and operating losses. As usual, we provide some additional information on these expenses in our appendix. You'll see that, collectively, they were down by $91 million, with the primary drivers being seasonally lower credit and collections expenses, lower losses from other real estate owned and lower legal and mortgage servicing-related accruals. 
Employee compensation and benefits increased by $173 million this quarter. You'll recall this line item was abnormally low in the fourth quarter as we curtailed our pension plan and made reductions to our 2011 incentive compensation pools. After you adjust for these 2 items, the increase this quarter was primarily related to the normal seasonal increase in employee benefits costs.
Relative to the prior year, expenses were up by $76 million. Employee compensation and benefits increased by $43 million in light of improved performance and modest annual salary increases. Operating losses were also higher, up $33 million, as a result of specific legal and mortgage servicing accruals. Conversely, marketing and FDIC premiums and regulatory assessments were down by a combined $30 million. 
Before we turn to the balance sheet sliding on slide -- starting on Slide 9, I'll summarize the income statement this quarter by noting that we benefited from many of the favorable trends that began to develop in the second half of 2011, and we were pleased to begin 2012 with a quarter of solid core performance. Average performing loans grew by a healthy $3.3 billion or 3% from the fourth quarter and were up by $8.6 billion or 8% from the prior year. The sequential quarter increase was relatively evenly split between the commercial, residential and consumer loan categories. 
Within the commercial book, C&I was again the primary driver, up $1.1 billion or 2%. Similar to recent quarters, the growth was primarily concentrated in our large corporate and middle market segments. Large corporate growth occurred in most industry verticals, most notably, media, healthcare and energy. And momentum within the middle market segment continued to build as it was up by about 10% sequentially. Residential loan growth was driven by guaranteed loans, which increased by $1.2 billion, and was partially offset by a decline in home equity. All consumer category loans increased, led by student loans, which was up primarily due to the full benefit of loans acquired during the prior quarter. 
The growth from last year was driven entirely by targeted categories, specifically C&I, guaranteed mortgage and consumer loans. C&I increased by $5.4 billion or 12%. Similar to the sequential quarter story, loan growth was widespread across large corporate industry verticals, as well as our middle market segment. Guaranteed mortgages were up $2.2 billion, and consumer loans grew by $4 billion, led by student and auto. Conversely, CRE, construction, home equity and non-guaranteed mortgage balances all were managed down by about $3 billion in total. This contributed to a continued derisking of the loan portfolio, which you see on Slide 10. 
The portfolios that we've categorized as higher risk declined by $13.6 billion or 58% over the past few years, and they were down by another $400 million this quarter with the declines evenly distributed across the 3 major categories. Higher-risk balances were managed down by $2.4 billion or 20% over the prior year. Commercial construction comprised $1 billion of the decline while higher risk home equity and mortgage balances both declined by $700 million. 
As can be seen at the bottom of the page, the overall decline in the higher-risk balances has essentially been offset by increases in government-guaranteed loans, which has helped to significantly alter the risk profile of the portfolio in a relatively short period of time. This improved risk profile becomes evident in our credit trends, which you see on Slide 11. 
Credit quality continued to trend favorably this quarter, with meaningful declines in delinquencies, nonperforming assets and loans and net charge-offs. Early-stage delinquencies, excluding government-guaranteed loans, were down by 9 basis points this quarter. The accelerated rate of improvement from prior quarters is attributable to normal seasonality of delinquency trends, coupled with continued improvements in the loan portfolio. We're happy to report a 29 basis point decline in indirect, a 19 basis point improvement in home equity and an 11 basis point decline in non-guaranteed mortgages. 
Nonperforming assets and nonperforming loans both declined by approximately $250 million this quarter. The 9% sequential quarter reduction in nonperforming loans is primarily driven by declines in commercial construction and residential mortgages. A portion of the residential mortgage decline was the result of our decision to move $86 million of nonperforming loans to held for sale, and we expect to complete the sale of these loans during the second quarter. Relative to the prior year, nonperforming loans declined about $1.3 billion or 33%, with commercial construction, C&I, CRE and residential mortgage the largest contributors. 
Several banks this quarter reclassified into NPL, performing home equity lines that are behind delinquent first mortgages. Based upon our existing accounting policies and practices, we did not believe it was necessary for us to make a similar reclassification. However, I will point out that our reserving methodology takes this issue into account, either by the direct knowledge we have from servicing the first mortgage or via the regular refreshing of FICO scores which quickly respond to borrower delinquencies. Therefore, if we are ever required to reclassify this small population of performing loans as nonperforming, we would expect the income statement impact to be immaterial. 
Net charge-offs were down by $50 million or 11% sequentially, which was better than our expectations. Declines came from most loan categories, most notably C&I, CRE and residential construction. These declines were partially offset by a $10 million increase in residential mortgage charge-offs, the result of the aforementioned move of certain nonperforming loans to held for sale. Relative to the prior year, net charge-offs were lower by about $150 million, driven by commercial construction, residential mortgages and home equity. 
In light of the continued improvement in credit quality, the allowance for loan and lease loss ratio declined by 9 basis points to 1.92%. Excluding government-guaranteed loans from the denominator of the calculation, the ratio at quarter end stood at 2.16%. Overall, we're pleased with the continued improvement in credit trends. As we look to the second quarter, we currently expect to see additional declines in nonperforming loans and relatively stable to down net charge-offs. 
Let's take a look at our deposit performance. This quarter, we again benefited from favorable deposit trends. Average client deposits grew $800 million, with all of that coming from lower-cost categories. DDA was the primary driver, up $1.3 billion or 4%, with growth from both consumer and commercial clients. Conversely, higher-cost time deposit balances continued their decline by $700 million or 4%. Compared to a year ago, client deposits grew by about $5 billion or 4%. DDA increased by over $7 billion or 25%. Savings was up by $600 million or 14% while time deposits declined by $2.4 billion or about 12%. We've been able to achieve this deposit growth while also closely managing pricing, demonstrated by interest-bearing deposit costs coming down 17 basis points from last year. 
Another benefit of our strong liquidity position and DDA growth is that we reduced our average long-term debt by $2.5 billion from last year. Collectively, these favorable liability trends have resulted in an $82 million or 27% year-over-year decline in our overall interest expense, which has been a major driver of our net interest income growth. 
Slide 13 provides information on our capital metrics. Tier 1 common capital increased for the seventh consecutive quarter, up sequentially by another $200 million as a result of retained earnings. Tier 1 common ratio ended the quarter at an estimated 9.3%, up from 9.22% at year end. The tangible common equity ratio increased by 5 basis points due to higher earnings which also led to the increased tangible book value per share shown in the bottom right of the page. 
Let's turn to Slide 14 for a discussion of our Playbook for Profitable Growth Expense program. As you know, our PPG Expense program's ultimate goal is the removal of $300 million from our run rate expenses by the end of next year. To date, we've achieved $190 million of these savings on an annualized basis. This program is comprised of several fundamental expense-savings initiatives. They're broken into 3 main buckets: strategic supply management, consumer bank efficiencies and operations and support staff. You can see on the bottom of the slide that many of our programs are well underway, and we've clearly attained some good initial results. 
Our strategic supply management initiatives have lowered costs with our suppliers, as well as reduced our own demands for such services. In addition to contract renegotiations, savings are being realized through markedly reduced travel and lower usage of temporary labor, courier and print services. 
In the consumer bank efficiencies category, savings have come through branch, staff and location efficiencies that we achieved via technological advancements and strategic investment in lower cost channels. This is a win-win as our clients value the enhanced conveniences, and adoption rates of the new technology have been high. Further, we garnered savings on our rewards check card program by renegotiating what we pay for the rewards and restructuring the rewards earnings rate. 
Several initiatives have driven our operations and support staff savings. We further reduced spend in layers in the organization and initiated Lean process design efforts to streamline key business processes, generate measurable savings and enhance client experiences. Furthermore, we made significant progress in our efforts to leverage digital technology, reducing paper statements by hundreds of thousands. These items, coupled with the progress we made last year, put us in a good position relative to our stated expense savings goal. 
Taking the broader view and looking over the longer term, we are acutely focused on improving our overall efficiency ratio. We've previously articulated our longer-term goal for a sub-60% efficiency ratio upon the abatement of elevated credit- and mortgage-related expenses, and that is what we're actively working toward. This program is the start and is providing the impetus for us to become a more efficiently run organization. 
I'll conclude today with an overview of some changes that we've made to our segment reporting structure. You will recall that we previously reported results for 6 primary lines of business: Retail Banking, Diversified Commercial Banking, Corporate and Investment Banking, Wealth and Investment Management, Mortgage, and Commercial Real Estate, with the remainder in Corporate Other. Starting in 2012, our results are being reported via the 4 segments that you see here: Consumer Banking and Private Wealth Management, Wholesale Banking, Mortgage Banking and Corporate Other. 
Mortgage and Corporate Other are largely unchanged, but there are notable changes in the other 2 segments. First, we formed Consumer Banking and Private Wealth Management by combining our legacy Retail line of business with the private wealth portion of our former Wealth and Investment Management line of business. 
Second, we created Wholesale Banking by combining our previous Corporate and Investment Banking, Diversified Commercial and CRE lines of business. Business Banking, our small business banking unit, which was previously included in Retail, is also now part of Wholesale. Additionally, the other major units of our former Wealth and Investment Management unit GenSpring, our family office, and RidgeWorth, our mutual fund complex, also roll up into the new Wholesale reporting segment.
These changes were made in light of how our clients want to bank with us and how we manage our business. For example, when a business client has cash management, lending, real estate and capital markets needs, we serve this client by delivering SunTrust's full set of capabilities via our Wholesale Banking line of business, and this reporting structure facilitates that delivery approach. Similarly, when a consumer client has traditional banking and wealth management needs, our Consumer Banking and Private Wealth Management line of business is able to seamlessly offer these capabilities. 
To best serve our client needs, we reorganized our management structure last year and appointed an executive to run each of our major segments. Brad Dinsmore is in charge of Consumer Banking and Private Wealth Management. Mark Chancy runs Wholesale Banking, and Jerome Lienhard leads Mortgage Banking. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bill to wrap us up before we go to Q&A."

Before we move on, let me briefly share with you a few comments about our business line performance to help reiterate the improvement we're seeing in our underlying core performance. 
During the quarter, Consumer and Private Wealth Management completed our deposit transformation away from free checking. We retained 98% of our balances through this process, and the average deposit size of a new checking account is up almost 50% in our Everyday Checking product relative to what it was under free checking. Loyalty, as you might expect, took an early dip during the transition, but I'm pleased to say it has rebounded and it now exceeds where we were before the transformation and maybe most importantly, total deposits have continued the favorable trend. 
Now another good sign of early recovery and our execution is evidenced in consumer lending overall, where production has been very strong. It's up 24% on a year-over-year basis, and that's totally organic, not from purchased assets. 
Our Wholesale business continues to perform well. Net income is up 60% from the prior year. Our Corporate Investment Banking business continues to build momentum, and this unit posted its second-highest quarterly profit ever. C&I loan growth, overall, remains solid, though still more concentrated in larger corporate and middle market. Deposits are strong and the Wholesale line of business is generating positive operating leverage. 
While we continue to manage through the legacy issues in Mortgage, origination activity was a bright spot this quarter. Production was up by 1/3 from the prior year, reaffirming our relationship-driven model. So our progress is steady. We're on the path to improved performance relative to our opportunity. 
I'll wrap up my comments on the quarter. I'd characterize our results as a solid start to the year that built upon improved momentum that we established and generated last year. We benefited from the mortgage refinance tailwind this quarter, helping us overcome some of the fee income headwinds on the consumer side. More broadly, though, we see good underlying improving core performance in virtually all of our businesses. 
So with that said, Kris, I'll turn it over to Q&A."

If you think about our markets, the amount of homes underwater, it’s still a significant opportunity for us. So I think HARP as an individual unit probably has more legs than maybe we would have anticipated a quarter ago, and we got off to an early start at HARP. We have to eventually see some purchase volume, though, to sort of keep the momentum up. And while we see sort of glimpses of it and we'll see a week to week or slight improvement, it still is not the big driver, and refinance eventually runs its course. That being said, I think it probably has a few more legs than it did and we need to see that purchase volume. Does that make sense?"

It's the impetus to get that thought process changed. So we'll hit this, and we'll beat it and we'll keep going. Did that get all your question?"

When you look at Q4 versus Q1, our overall noninterest expenses were down $120 million. One way to think about that is that $120 million was really all the reduction of the fourth quarter accrual for mortgage servicing litigation. So that brings us about flat. Within that flat, Q4 to Q1, there were lots of puts and takes. Generally, here's the high-level numbers of what we saw Q4 to Q1. Employee comp and benefits was up about $170 million, as I said. The pieces that went into that $170 million were the low pension number in the fourth quarter as a result of the curtailment, the reduction in other incentive plans we put in place in the fourth quarter and the Q1 seasonal increase in FICA and employee benefits. So those are, basically, the components of the $170 million increase. And that $170 million was basically offset by reductions in marketing, in operating losses, litigation accruals, in FDIC premium and in those credit and collection costs and other noninterest expenses, like legal and consulting, lower PPG severance, et cetera. So net-net, down $120 million but with a lot of puts and takes. Having said that, most of those puts and takes were really a Q4 noise, not Q1 noise. As I think about Q1, it was a relative -- it was a very clean noiseless quarter, and most of the differences were really Q4 items from last year."

Of the remainder, about 1/3 of those, we already service the firsts. So we can see what's going on in the first and we have a good sense of what's going on in that book. Of the remainder where there are seconds and we don't service the firsts, we actually do a FICO refresh every quarter. And if the first does go delinquent, you know it has an immediate impact on FICO, and we're able to see that immediate impact and adjust. So our reserving methodology already takes that into account.

On our normal fashion, I will begin today's call with some brief comments on our performance this quarter and then pass on to Aleem to provide details on our results. Our high-level points are showed on our Slide 3 of our presentation. Our performance continues to steadily improve this quarter. Net income to common shareholders was $270 million and earnings per share of $0.50, a $0.04 increase over last quarter and a $0.17 increase over last year. 
From the revenue side, total revenue was up $28 million over last quarter, driven by higher noninterest income. Strong margins revenue growth $64 million or 7% sequential quarter increase in fee income while our net interest income declined $36 million due to the decrease in swap income. Mortgage production volume remain high this quarter. To date this year, we closed almost $16 billion in mortgage loans, up over 50% from last year which helped over 62,000 clients buy or refinance a home this year including many due to our HARP program. 
Now moving on to expenses. They were stable the last quarter last year. Included in this quarter's expense was a $13 million noncash charge associated with redemption of a $1.2 billion of trust preferred securities. These were higher cost findings and as such, we moved quickly to redeem them once the capital treatment of that occurred allowing us to do so. We made second progress in our efforts to reduce expenses through our PPG program. Today we generated annualized savings of $250 million, and we're now well within our sight of $300 million goal for the program. At the risk of being redundant, I reiterate that we're committed to establishing a more efficiently run organization. The PPG program was the catalyst but was never intended to be the final goal for us. What I'm saying here is when PPG is done, our work is not. The ultimate objective is to getting our efficiency ratio under 60%, and we have high intensity around both revenue and expense initiatives to help us achieve that goal. 
Now taking a look at the balance sheet. Loan growth particularly in C&I drove a $1 billion increase in average performing loan balances over last quarter and nearly a $10 billion increase over last year. At the same time, we've been actively managing down certain real estate related loan balances. Though average client deposits were stable to last quarter's record level, we continue to see the favorable mix shift this quarter. Average DDA balances were up 3% from the prior quarter and 23% from the prior year, while CD balances declined. Credit quality also continued to improve across-the-board. Net charge-offs are 1.14% of average loans, down 17% from the prior quarter. Nonperforming loans were down 7% and early-stage delinquencies declined 7 basis points. Lastly, we generated additional positive capital growth with Tier 1 common ratio estimated at 9.4 at quarter end. Before I wrap up my comments and turn it to Aleem, I'm going to take a minute to address our resubmitted capital plan under the 2012 CCAR process. As you are aware, we submitted our revised capital plan in mid-June. While the Fed is in the process of reviewing our plan come I wanted to share with you in advance of that we elected not to request any increase in the current level of the dividend or any other return of capital at this time. We made this decision in light of the fact that the submission only covered capital actions for the fourth quarter of 2012 and the first quarter of 2013. Additionally, we considered the close proximity of the resubmission to the 2013 CCAR process, which is expected to begin in the fourth quarter of this year shortly after the time we expect to hear back on this plan. We think this is the best course of action for the short-term. It's not indicative of our long-term plans to return capital prudently to shareholders. As a reminder in their review of our original plan submission, the Fed did not object to the trust preferred redemption which I noted earlier have been completed or to maintain the quarterly common stock dividend of $0.05 a share. The 2013 CCAR process, that will begin later this year, will provide us an opportunity to violate capital deployment alternatives for next year. 
So overall, we make continued progress this quarter with momentum building in several key areas of our company. Of note, was the solid noninterest income growth mainly driven by strong mortgage production followed by the pick up in several other the categories as well. We also saw a continuation of a multi-quarter trend in increase performing loan balances, particularly in our C&I book. Looking ahead, challenges remain with a less than ideal operating environment, but I believe SunTrust is well positioned to capitalize upon our opportunities. With that said, let me turn it over to Aleem."

Thank you for joining us today. I will begin my comments this morning on Slide 4. Bill had a lot of the highlights so I will be brief and then we will dig deeper on subsequent slides. As Bill noted earlier, we are pleased to re",3242,"Thanks, Bill. Good morning. Thank you for joining us today. I will begin my comments this morning on Slide 4. Bill had a lot of the highlights so I will be brief and then we will dig deeper on subsequent slides. As Bill noted earlier, we are pleased to report higher earnings per share this quarter of $0.50, which is a $0.04 increase from the prior quarter and $0.17 increase from last year. This sequential quarter income growth is attributable to high revenue and lower loan loss provision. Revenue grew $28 million as higher noninterest income more than offset the swap-related decline in net interest income. Provision declined $17 million with the lower net charge-offs and continued improvement in other credit metrics. Higher revenue and a lower loan loss provision also drove the growth from the second quarter of last year. Revenue increased by $48 million by a combination of higher net interest income and higher fee income. The latter of which was primarily mortgage related. 
Improvements in credit quality were widespread, providing a $92 million decline in the provision, while noninterest expense was essentially unchanged. Year-to-date EPS was $0.96. This is more than double the $0.41 reported during the first 6 months of last year. Revenue was higher, up 2% on a reported basis, by a more meaningful 5% net of the usual quarterly adjustment items we detailed in the appendix. Other drivers were lower loan loss provision and the redemption of the capital purchase program for preferred shares. Let's take a look at each of the major income statement categories, beginning with net interest income on Slide 5. On a sequential quarter basis, net interest income declined by $36 million or 3%, and the net interest margin fell by 10 basis points to 3.39%. Both of these declines were almost entirely due to the previously disclosed reduction in income for maturing commercial loan loss. Excluding the impact of the swap, net interest income and margin were relatively stable as lower loan yields and a smaller securities portfolio offset by the benefits of higher loan balances and and improved deposit mix. 
Despite lower swap income, net interest income increased from the prior year by $20 million or 2%. Interest income declined by $49 million as lower asset yield outweighed the favorable impact of higher loan balances. However, this was more than offset by a $69 million decline in interest expense, driven by favorable liability trends, including strong DDA growth, a 17 basis point reduction in deposit rates paid, and a 65 basis point decline in long-term debt cost. 
I'll spend a few minutes discussing that some of the major drivers of future net interest income and margin. First on the asset side, with a slightly improving economy, we expect to see continued long growth, which would be additive to net interest income. Although as you're well aware, most going on rates are lower than the portfolio's current yield. The securities balance declined somewhat this quarter as we didn't see many attractive alternatives in light of the continued decline in yields. We will continue to monitor the market, and we'll pick our spots to reinvest. 
Commercial loan swap income is expected to stay relatively stable through the next year at its current level of about $120 million per quarter, assuming no major changes to LIBOR. 
Turning to the liability side, during the third quarter, we'll begin to benefit from last week's redemption of $1.2 billion in higher cost trust preferred securities, which had a weighted average cost of about 7%. Positive pricing opportunities are obviously becoming limited at this point given their low absolute rates. This is something that we do continue to evaluate and manage carefully. We will also benefit from higher cost CDs maturing and rolling into lower rate products. All told there are headwinds and tailwinds. As we look specifically to the third quarter, we expect those headwinds and tailwinds to largely offset one another such as that the net interest margin is relatively stable. 
Look at noninterest income on Slide 6. Noninterest income was $940 million, a sequential quarter increase of $64 million on a reported basis or $39 million net of the adjusted items we detailed in the appendix. Mortgage production income was strong this quarter as our origination volumes and gains on sale remain high. 
During the quarter, we closed over $8.2 billion of loans, which was up 8%. Purchase volume was $3 billion, an increase of over $1 billion. Refinance volume declined modestly but remains healthy at $5.2 billion. Mortgage production income was $103 million this quarter or $258 million exclusive of the mortgage repurchase provision. Sequential quarter growth and the reported figure was $40 million, $20 million of which was attributable to a lower repurchase provision and $18 million due to a gain in conjunction with the sale of a portfolio containing government guaranteed mortgages. I'll discuss about of those in more detail in subsequent slides. 
In addition to the increase in mortgage production, we saw growth in numerous other consumer and commercial fee categories. As a couple of examples, loan commitment fees recorded in the other charges and fees line items were strong and card fees grew due to increased client usage. Relative to the prior year, noninterest income was up $28 million on a reported basis and $59 million or 7% on an adjusted basis. The largest driver of the adjusted fee growth was a $99 million increase in mortgage production. The core mortgage production income up $164 million, partially offset by a $65 million increase in the repurchase provision. Fee income was also a driver of the year-over-year growth due to improved market conditions. On the flip side, card fees declined due to the implementation of caps on debit change income. We also saw a decline in investment banking income on lower syndicated finance volumes. 
Let's turn to Slide 7 for a discussion of this quarter's trends in mortgage repurchases. Mortgage repurchase demand show on the top left box were $489 million this quarter. That's an increase of about $40 million from last quarter but within a range of expectations and well below the elevated levels we saw in the fourth quarter of last year. Demand continue to be concentrated in the 2006 to 2008 vintages which have accounted for roughly 90% of all demand activity over the past several years, as well as this quarter. While demand levels may remain elevated in the coming quarters, consistent with what we have expressed for several quarters now, the underlying trends in demands and full power requests continue to suggest to us that the agencies are making progress and working through these higher loss content vintages. For example, full file requests volume has moderated somewhat and continue to transition toward loans that are delinquent but not yet in foreclosure. 
Pending population, shown on the top right portion of the slide increased to $652 million, up roughly $90 million from the prior quarter. This was the result of the increase in new demands as well as a slower income demand resolution. We're taking a deliberate approach to the demand review process, ensuring that we repurchase loans where appropriate yet cure or moderate losses wherever possible. Mortgage repurchase reserve, shown at the bottom left of the page, increased to $434 million, up $51 million from the first quarter. The increase relates primarily to the higher level of the pending population. Said differently, the reserve increase is in part due to the higher level of demands and in part, the reduction in charge-offs, which is merely a function of loss recognition time. Similar to prior quarters some summary statistics of our sold mortgages are displayed at the bottom right of this page, and we've also provided some additional detail on the 2006 to 2008 vintages in the appendix. Overall, I'd note that our expectations around mortgage repurchases remain generally unchanged from what we've shared with you in recent quarters. We foresee demand volume remaining high and variable in the coming quarters. However, if recent patterns and full power requests continue as anticipated, we expect to see a reduced income statement impact towards the end of this year. 
Let's move on to expenses on Slide 8. Expenses were essentially stable to both the prior quarter and prior year. On a sequential quarter basis, employee compensation and benefits declined by $35 million due to seasonal reduction in benefits. This decline was offset by growth in a handful of other categories. Bill mentioned earlier the $13 million noncash charge that we incurred related to the redemption of trust preferred securities. Additionally, operating losses increased $9 million due to specific mortgage related losses and legal accruals. FDIC premiums increased $8 million. This line item was a bit lower than normal in the first quarter and the Q2 level is expected to meet a more normal run rate. 
In credit related expenses, which we detailed for you as usual in the appendix, increased by $7 million. Bill point out that this quarter we refined our methodology by recognizing tax payments on dividend and loans, which resulted in an approximate $10 million increase in credit collection expense. As a result of this change, we should not experience the seasonal fourth quarter spike in this line item that we've seen in prior years. Relative to the prior year, adjusted the expenses declined $11 million, driven by lower FDIC premiums, credit-related expenses and marketing costs. These declines were partially offset by a modest increase in compensation and higher outside processing costs. 
Before we turn to the balance sheet, starting on Slide 9, I will summarize this quarters income statement by noting that we drove continued improvement in our core earning this quarter. Obviously, our absolute level of profitability is still well below our profit generation capability. But overall, we are pleased to note the continued progression towards a more normalized level of earnings. Average performing loans increased again this quarter, up sequentially by a little over $1 billion or about 1%. The growth was driven by commercial loans, specifically C&I, which was up $1.3 billion. Within our wholesale businesses, both continued to be concentrated in larger corporate clients and to be well diversified. Specific industry verticals within our corporate investment bank that drove the bulk of this quarter's growth were health care, diversified, financial services and media. Also bought some modest growth in our Diversified Commercial Banking business driven by auto dealers and not-for-profit clients. While we saw a continued runoff of legacy assets in our commercial real estate, the phase of decline moderated again this quarter. 
The residential portfolio was relatively stable this quarter. Within that, we grew non-guaranteed loans by about $700 million driven by high FICO jumbo loans. That guaranteed portfolio was down approximately $600 million, partially due to the sale of $0.5 billion in loans this quarter. 
Relative to the prior year, performing loans grew almost $10 billion or 9% with the growth coming entirely from our targeted categories, namely C&I, guaranteed mortgages and consumer loans. C&I led the way, up $5.6 million or 12%, driven by large corporate and middle market borrowers. Consumer loans increased to almost $4 billion or 24% with growth across all loan categories most notably student loans. In government guaranteed mortgages we're up $1.5 billion or about 33%. 
The overall portfolio growth was partially offset by intentional declines in certain portfolios, including CRE, construction and home equity, which were managed down by a combined $2.3 billion. The continued impact of this de-risking is evident on Slide 10. The portfolios that we've categorized as higher risks declined by $14 billion or 60% over the past few years, and they were down by another $400 million this quarter. Higher risk balances were managed down by over $2 billion or 18% from the prior year. The decline split relatively evenly between the 3 major categories. This can be seen on the bottom of the page. The overall decline and the higher risk balances over the last 2 years has essentially been offset by increases in government guaranteed loans. This combination has helped to significantly improve the risk profile of the company in a relatively short period of time. Additionally, the increases in government guaranteed balances also served as a bridge at the time of organic loan growth. These quarters higher risk loan balances have declined at a slower pace in the light of the smaller size of this portfolio and its improving risk. Additionally, we've seen a pick-up in organic loan demand. As such and as part of our continued active management of the balance sheet, we elected to sell about $0.5 billion of government guaranteed mortgages this quarter and this resulted in an $18 million gain. 
Let's turn to Slide 11 for a review of credit quality. Credit quality continued to trend favorably this quarter with meaningful declines in delinquencies, nonperforming assets, nonperforming loans and net charge-offs. Early-stage delinquencies, excluding government guaranteed loans, were down by 8 basis points from the prior quarter, driven by residential loans. Non-guaranteed mortgage delinquency rates declined by 23 basis points and home equity improved by 11 basis points. Nonperforming loans declined sequentially by almost $200 million or 7%. Improvements were evident across the portfolio, most notably in commercial real estate and residential and commercial construction. Nonperforming assets declined by over $300 million or 11%, driven by the decline in nonperforming loans, as well as reductions in other real estate owned and the completion of the sale of the nonperforming mortgage loans we commenced last quarter. Year-over-year, nonperforming loans were down $1.2 billion or more than 30%. All loan categories showed improvement with the highest declines coming from commercial construction, CRE and C&I. 
Net charge-offs declined by $72 million or 17% sequentially, and the net charge-off ratio fell by 24 basis points to 1.14%. Non-guaranteed mortgages, home equity and Commercial Real Estate were the biggest drivers of the improvement. Relative to the prior year, net charge-offs were lower by $155 million or about 30% with meaningful improvements seen across most of the portfolios. 
Allowance for loan and lease losses was $2.3 billion at quarter end or 1.86% of loans. In light of the continued favorable trends in credit quality, the allowance declined this quarter, albeit at a more modest pace than recent quarters. Excluding government guaranteed loans from the denominator of the allowance calculation, the ratio stood at 2.07%. Overall, we were pleased with our trends and credit metrics and the improvements exceeded our expectations, particularly in net charge-offs. As we look forward, our recovering economy should continue to support our positive asset quality trend with improvements primarily driven by the residential portfolio as most of the commercial and consumer portfolios are currently nearing more normal credit metric level. 
Looking specifically at the third quarter, we currently expect to see additional declines in nonperforming loans and relatively stable net charge-offs. 
Let's take a look at deposit performance. Average deposit balances were stable at their record first quarter level of approximately $126 billion. The favorable shift in deposit mix continued as DDA and savings increased by higher cost time deposits decline. Compared to last year, client deposits were up $4 billion or 3%. Lower cost deposits drove the increase with DDA up almost $7 billion or 23%. Conversely, time deposits were down almost $3 billion or 14%. This favorable mix shift has contributed to our year-over-year net interest income growth. 
Slide 13 provides information on our capital metrics. Tier 1 common increased for the eighth consecutive quarter, up sequentially by approximately $300 million primarily from increased retained earnings. Tier 1 common ratio ended the quarter at an estimated 9.4%, up another 7 basis points from last quarter's 9.33%. While not shown on this slide, I'll mention the capital impact of our decision to call the $1.2 billion of higher cost trust preferred securities. Redemption of the securities resulted in a reduction of our Basel I Tier 1 ratio, about 90 basis points and that impact is already reflected in our second quarter capital ratio estimates. As you are aware, this will not impact our fully Basel III Tier 1 ratio as trust preferreds are not Tier 1 qualifying instruments. As it relates to our recent Basel III notice of proposed rule making, we continue to evaluate the potential impact to our capital ratios. Under this proposal, we expect to see some increase in risk weighted assets and a corresponding decrease in capital ratios, primarily due to the ranges of risk ratings for residential mortgages and home equity. We've implemented as stated in the recent NPR, our resulting capital ratios that should still comfortably exceed all proposed regulatory requirements. 
Bottom part of this slide shows our tangible common equity ratio and our tangible book value per share. Book were up this quarter due to increases in retained earnings and other comments of income. Tangible common equity ratio increased by 17 basis points to 8.15%, while our tangible book value per share declined about 2% to end the quarter at just about $26. 
Let's turn to Slide 14 for a discussion of our Playbook for Profitable Growth expense program. As you can see, we made continued progress against the $300 million expense savings goal for the PPG program. To date, we've reached $250 million in annualized savings. As you know, this program is comprised of numerous expense savings initiatives, broken into 3 main buckets, strategic supply management, consumer bank efficiencies and operations and support staff. This quarter, we garnered savings in each of the category. And on this slide, you can see the activities that were the primary drivers of the savings. 
On our strategic supply management initiatives, we achieved additional savings through further contract renegotiations. Additionally, we have successfully managed down our own spending on items we consider discretionary, items such as travel, print and wireless service. Our teammates are finding ways everyday to cut out expenses for things that once seemed necessity. There's a high level of commitment here throughout the company and this is something every teammate can do to improve efficiency and meet our goals. 
On the consumer bank efficiencies category, we achieved savings primarily due to 2 key initiatives. First, we revamped our branch staffing model to better align market needs with staff from both the capabilities and a volume perspective. We're achieving greater efficiencies by differentiating staffing by client segments served and market opportunities. Furthermore, we changed our incentive compensation structure for certain types of positions and this is now yielding real dollar savings. Several initiatives have driven our operations and support staff savings. But the chief component of our savings this quarter came from tighter spend in layers with further reduction in FTEs. We also made additional progress in our efforts to leverage digital technologies, taking significant reductions and the number of paper statements that we now process. We are rapidly approaching our goal of $300 million in savings. 
As Bill mentioned earlier, this by no means should imply that we are done with our work here. PPG was the beginning of a process of transformation of SunTrust. We will continue to leverage the strong momentum we have generated and drive toward our ultimate goal of a sub-60% efficiency ratio upon the abatement of elevated credit and mortgage related expenses. PPG program is only the start of our efficiency improvement efforts. That wraps up my comments for today. So I will turn the call back over to Bill."

And before we move into Q&A, I'd like to take a few moments to highlight some of the progress we have been making in our lines of business. These results punctuated the core momentum we are building. I will start by noting that the efficiency ratio is down are each of the lines of business relative to last quarter last year. Of course, their absolute levels are too high. Each business has specific plans aimed at driving continued improvements. In our consuming banking and private while line of business, we generated solid DDA growth of 11% and loan production volume was up a healthy 19% during the first half of the year. From a revenue perspective and the regulatory headwinds continue to challenge noninterest income in this business, however, you'll notice that expenses were down 7% from the second quarter last year due in large part to reductions in staffing driven by our PPG initiatives which Aleem highlighted. Another encouraging statistic is that client loyalty continue to increase in our retail business this quarter solidifying our position as an industry leading bank and our footprint for this metric. Also of note here is our credit card business. The relaunch of this business is in its early stages, but it is going well thus far. account sales more than 4x the levels generated in the second quarter of last year. We've been delivering strong results in our wholesale business. Year-to-date net income was nearly double what it was a year ago. We saw a record net income and revenue in corporate investment banking. It generated the lion's share of the 8% wholesale loan growth over last year. DDA balances were up 24% driven by our diversified commercial banking business. We're also beginning to generate some core commercial real estate growth. Like credit card, we're in early stages here, but we're pleased with our progress and believe commercial real estate loan balances are nearing an inflection point where we start to see some growth in this portfolio in the coming quarters. We are also seeing improving trends in our mortgage line of business. Year-to-date mortgage production volume was up $5.5 billion or over 50% and core mortgage production income was $320 million higher. The overall profitability of our mortgage business continues to be negatively impacted by legacy issues and still operating a net loss position this quarter if the trends are improving. Given the current rate environment and some overall improvements in the housing market, coupled with the HARP pipeline, we expect our near-term mortgage production revenue to remain strong. So overall, line of business performance is trending positively, and we are seeing the results more clearly and the company's financial metrics. SunTrust team is working hard in delivering better results and I'd be remiss in not recognizing them and thanking them for their collective effort. With that said, Kris, let me turn it back over to you."

There've been cost saves for example, in compensation and cost saves in areas discretionary expenses. And as you go down our income statement, those cost saves have showed up pretty well along the way on the line. However, some of those have been offset by cost increases in some other areas. For example, we've got some consulting costs for now that have come in as a result of the mortgage foreclosure review that were not originally anticipated. So you'll see some of those in there. And you will see some compensation increases as a result of increased revenue. And so just as a result of revenue related compensation increases, we've got some increases there. And so that's why overall, you see a netting. That netting is I would consider that to be a really good trade and that we are paying people commissions on revenue they're generating while at the same time, we're reducing core costs."

Let me take it really high level and then we can sort of go down any tributary you want to go down and this is the way I would like to think about it because it's sort of makes it easy and it doesn't make it sort of dependent upon a bunch of exogenous factors. If you normalize a number of facts. So let's assume sort of a flat revenue environment. Let's assume we actually don't get another penny's worth of revenue. If you normalize our net charge-offs/provision at some basis. So normalize it whatever you want to but call it 50 to 70 basis points, which is clearly higher than we have trended in the past. If you normalize for 45, mortgage repurchase and just some number in there, any number, but it would be appreciably smaller than where it is today then you normalize for the credit related expenses, so they've ran about $800 million sort of annualized little higher than now they're running closer to $700 million annualized we're starting to see that benefit. Now it used to be 200. I don't think we'll get to there's. So pick a number and just cut it in half as a thought process. And then put $300 million in PPG on top of that and to get to that point essentially a 60% efficiency ratio on a 1% plus ROE. So at a really high level, that's sort of what gives us confidence. Now it won't work out that way exactly and there'll be puts and takes and the timing will be different. One quarter will be up one quarter will be down. But if you think about that in sort of a goal, that's it. Now to the point of PPG, if some of those things don't materialize, if the credit expenses don't come down like that, or if the charge-offs don't normalize the way I've described or in fact revenues down for some reason unforeseen then the number on the savings will be higher.

In our normal fashion, I'll begin today's call with some brief comments on our performance this quarter and then pass on to Aleem to provide details on the results. The high-level points are shown on Slide 3 of our presentation. 
Core performance continued to steadily improve this quarter. Net income to common shareholders was $270 million, and earnings per share was $0.50, a $0.04 increase over last quarter and a $0.17 increase over last year. 
On the revenue side, total revenue was up $28 million over last quarter, driven by higher noninterest income. Strong Mortgage revenue drove a $64 million or 7% sequential quarter increase in fee income, while our net interest income declined $36 million due to the decrease in swap income. 
Mortgage production volume remained high this quarter. To date this year, we closed almost $16 billion in Mortgage loans, up over 50% from last year, which helped over 62,000 clients buy or refinance their home this year, including many due through the HARP program. 
Now moving to expenses. They were stable the last quarter and last year. Included in this quarter's expense was a $13 million noncash charge associated with redemption of a $1.2 billion of trust preferred securities. These were higher-cost fundings, and as such, we moved quickly to redeem them once the capital treatment of that occurred allowing us to do so. 
We've made significant progress in our efforts to reduce expenses through our PPG program. To date, we've generated annualized savings of $250 million, and we're now well within our sight of $300 million goal for the program. 
Now at the risk of being redundant, I reiterate that we're committed to establishing a more efficiently run organization. The PPG program was the catalyst, but was never intended to be the final goal for us. So what I'm saying here is that when PPG is done, our work is not. The ultimate objective is getting our efficiency ratio under 60%, and we have high intensity around both revenue and expense initiatives to help us achieve that goal. 
Now taking a look at the balance sheet. Targeted loan growth, particularly in C&I, drove a $1 billion increase in average performing loan balances over last quarter and nearly a $10 billion increase over last year. At the same time, we've been actively managing down certain real estate-related loan balances. 
Though average client deposits were stable to last quarter's record level, we continue to see the favorable mix shift this quarter. Average DDA balances were up 3% from the prior quarter and 23% from the prior year, while CD balances declined. 
Credit quality also continued to improve across-the-board. Net charge-offs are 1.14% of average loans, down 17% from the prior quarter. Nonperforming loans were down 7%, and early-stage delinquencies declined 7 basis points. Lastly, we generated additional positive capital growth with Tier 1 common ratio estimated at 9.4% at quarter end. 
Now before I wrap up my comments and turn it over to Aleem, I'm going to take a minute to address our resubmitted capital plan under the 2012 CCAR process. As you're aware, we submitted our revised capital plan in mid-June. While the fed is in the process of reviewing our plan, I wanted to share with you in advance that we elected not to request any increase in the current level of the dividend or any other return of capital at this time. We made this decision in light of the fact that this submission only covered capital actions for the fourth quarter of 2012 and the first quarter of 2013. 
Additionally, we considered the close proximity of the resubmission to the 2013 CCAR process, which is expected to begin in the fourth quarter of this year, shortly after the time we expect to hear back on this plan. And we think this is the best course of action for the short term, but it's not indicative of our long-term plans to return capital prudently to shareholders. 
As a reminder, in their review of our original plan submission, the fed did not object to the trust preferred redemption, which, as I noted earlier, have been completed, or to maintaining the quarterly common stock dividend of $0.05 a share. The 2013 CCAR process, will begin later this year, will provide us an opportunity to evaluate capital deployment alternatives for next year. 
So overall, we made continued progress this quarter with momentum building in several key areas of our company. Of note was the solid noninterest income growth, mainly driven by strong Mortgage production, though with a pick up in several other fee categories as well. We also saw a continuation of a multi-quarter trend in increased performing loan balances, particularly in our C&I book. So looking ahead, challenges remain with the less-than-ideal operating environment, but I believe SunTrust is well positioned to capitalize upon our opportunities. 
And with that said, let me turn it over to Aleem."

Bill had a lot of the highlights, so I'll be brief here and then we'll delve deeper on subsequent slides. 
As Bill noted earlier, we're pleased to report higher earnings per share this quarter of $0.50, which is a $0.04 increase from the prior quarter and a $0.17 increase from last year. This sequential quarter income growth is attributable to higher revenue and a lower loan loss provision. Revenue grew $28 million as higher noninterest income more than offset the swap-related decline in net interest income. Provision declined $17 million due to lower net charge-offs and continued improvements in other credit metrics. 
Higher revenue and a lower loan loss provision also drove the growth from the second quarter of last year, where revenue increased by $48 million by a combination of higher net interest income and higher fee income. The latter of which was primarily mortgage related. Improvements in credit quality were widespread, driving a $92 million decline in the provision, while noninterest expense was essentially unchanged. 
Year-to-date EPS was $0.96. This is more than double the $0.41 reported during the first 6 months of last year. Revenue was higher, up 2% on a reported basis but by a more meaningful 5% net of the usual quarterly adjustment items we detailed in the appendix. Other drivers were lower loan loss provision and a redemption of the capital purchase program preferred shares. 
Let's take a look at each of the major income statement categories, beginning with net interest income on Slide 5. On a sequential quarter basis, net interest income declined by $36 million or 3%, and the net interest margin fell by 10 basis points to 3.39%. Both of these declines were almost entirely due to the previously disclosed reduction in income for maturing commercial loan swaps. Excluding the impact of the swap, net interest income and margin were relatively stable as lower loan yields and a smaller securities portfolio were offset by the benefits of higher loan balances and an improved deposit mix. 
Despite lower swap income, net interest income increased from the prior year by $20 million or 2%. Interest income declined by $49 million as lower asset yield outweighed the favorable impact of higher loan balances. However, this was more than offset by a $69 million decline in interest expense, driven by favorable liability trends, including strong DDA growth, a 17-basis-point reduction in deposit rates paid and a 65 basis point decline in long-term debt costs.
I'll spend a few minutes discussing some of the major drivers of future net interest income and margin. First, on the asset side. With a slightly improving economy, we expect to see continued long growth, which would be additive to net interest income. Although as you're well aware, most going-on rates are lower than the portfolio's current yield. Our securities balances declined somewhat this quarter, as we didn't see many attractive alternatives in light of the continued decline in yields. But we'll continue to monitor the market, and we'll pick our spots to reinvest. Commercial loan swap income is expected to stay relatively stable through the next year at its current level of about $120 million per quarter, assuming no major changes to LIBOR. 
Turning to the liability side. During the third quarter, we'll begin to benefit from last week's redemption of $1.2 billion in higher-cost trust preferred securities, which had a weighted average cost of about 7%. Deposit pricing opportunities are obviously becoming limited at this point, given their low absolute rates, but this is something that we do continue to evaluate and manage carefully. We'll also benefit from higher-cost CDs maturing and rolling into lower rate products. 
So all told, there are headwinds and tailwinds. As we look specifically to the third quarter, we expect those headwinds and tailwinds to largely offset one another, such that the net interest margin is relatively stable. 
Look at noninterest income on Slide 6. Second quarter noninterest income was $940 million, a sequential quarter increase of $64 million on a reported basis or $39 million net of the adjustment items we detailed in the appendix. Mortgage production income was strong this quarter as origination volumes and gains on sale remained high. 
During the quarter, we closed over $8.2 billion of loans, which was up 8%. Purchase volume was $3 billion, an increase of over $1 billion. Refinance volume declined modestly, but remained healthy at $5.2 billion. Mortgage production income was $103 million this quarter or $258 million exclusive of the mortgage repurchase provision. Sequential quarter growth and the reported figure was $40 million, $20 million of which was attributable to a lower repurchase provision and $18 million due to a gain in conjunction with the sale of a portfolio containing government-guaranteed mortgages. And I'll discuss both of those in more detail on subsequent slides. 
In addition to the increase in mortgage production, we saw growth in numerous other consumer and commercial fee categories. As a couple of examples, loan commitment fees, recorded in the other charges and fees line item, were strong, and card fees grew due to increased client usage. Relative to the prior year, noninterest income was up $28 million on a reported basis and $59 million or 7% on an adjusted basis. 
The largest driver of the adjusted fee growth was a $99 million increase in mortgage production. With core mortgage production income up $164 million, partially offset by a $65 million increase in the repurchase provision. Trading income was also a driver of the year-over-year growth due to improved market conditions. On the flip side, card fees declined due to the implementation of caps on debit interchange income. We also saw a decline in investment banking income on lower syndicated finance volume.
Let's turn to Slide 7 for a discussion of this quarter's trends in mortgage repurchases. Mortgage repurchase demands, shown on the top-left box, were $489 million this quarter. That's an increase of about $40 million from last quarter, but within our range of expectations and well below the elevated levels we saw in the fourth quarter of last year. 
Demands continue to be concentrated in the 2006 to 2008 vintages, which have accounted for roughly 90% of all demand activity over the past several years, as well as this quarter. While demand levels may remain elevated in the coming quarters, consistent with what we've expressed for several quarters now, the underlying trends in demands and full file requests continue to suggest to us that the agencies are making progress in working through these higher-loss content vintages. For example, full file request volume has moderated somewhat and continue to transition toward loans that are delinquent but not yet in foreclosure. 
Pending population, shown on the top-right portion of this slide, increased to $652 million, up roughly $90 million from the prior quarter. This was the result of the increase in new demands, as well as a slower rate of demand resolution. We're taking a deliberate approach to the demand review process, ensuring that we repurchase loans where appropriate, yet cure or moderate losses wherever possible. 
Mortgage repurchase reserve, shown at the bottom left of the page, increased to $434 million, up $51 million from the first quarter. The increase relates primarily to the higher level of the pending population. Said differently, the reserve increase is in part due to the higher level of demands and, in part, to a reduction in charge-offs, which is merely a function of loss recognition timing.
Similar to prior quarters, some summary statistics of our sold mortgages are displayed at the bottom right of this page, and we've also provided some additional detail on the 2006 to 2008 vintages in the appendix. 
Overall, I'd note that our expectations around mortgage repurchases remain generally unchanged from what we've shared with you in recent quarters. We foresee demand volume remaining high and variable in the coming quarters. However, if recent patterns and full file request continue as anticipated, we expect to see a reduced income statement impact towards the end of this year. 
Let's move on to expenses on Slide 8. Expenses were essentially stable compared to both the prior quarter and prior year. On a sequential quarter basis, employee compensation and benefits declined by $35 million due to the seasonal reduction in benefits. This decline was offset by growth in a handful of other categories. Bill mentioned earlier the $13 million noncash charge that we incurred related to the redemption of trust preferred securities. 
Additionally, operating losses increased $9 million due to specific mortgage-related losses and legal accruals. FDIC premiums increased $8 million. This line item was a bit lower than normal in the first quarter, and the Q2 level is expected to be a more normal run rate. In credit-related expenses, which we detailed for you, as usual, in the appendix, increased by $7 million. 
I will point out that this quarter, we refined our methodology for recognizing tax payments on dividend and loans, which resulted in an approximate $10 million increase in credit and collection expense. As a result of this change, we should not experience the seasonal fourth quarter spike in this line item that we've seen in prior years. 
Relative to the prior year, adjusted expenses declined $11 million driven by lower FDIC premiums, credit-related expenses and marketing costs. These declines were partially offset by a modest increase in compensation and higher outside processing costs. 
Before we turn to the balance sheet, starting on Slide 9, I'll summarize this quarter's income statement by noting that we drove continued improvement in our core earnings this quarter. Obviously, our lower -- our absolute level of profitability is still well below our profit-generation capability. But overall, we were pleased to note continued progression toward a more normalized level of earnings. 
Average performing loans increased again this quarter, up sequentially by a little over $1 billion or about 1%. Growth was driven by commercial loans, specifically C&I, which was up $1.3 billion. 
Within our Wholesale businesses, growth continued to be concentrated in larger corporate clients and to be well diversified. Specific industry verticals within our Corporate Investment Bank that drove the bulk of this quarter's growth were healthcare, diversified, financial services and media. 
We also booked some modest growth in our Diversified Commercial Banking business, driven by auto dealers and not-for-profit clients. While we saw a continued runoff of legacy assets in our commercial real estate book, the pace of decline moderated again this quarter. 
The residential portfolio was relatively stable this quarter. Within it, we grew non-guaranteed loans by about $700 million driven by high FICO jumbo loans. The guaranteed portfolio was down approximately $600 million, largely due to the sale of $0.5 billion in loans this quarter. 
Relative to the prior year, performing loans grew almost $10 billion or 9%, with the growth coming entirely from our targeted categories, namely C&I, guaranteed mortgages and consumer loans. C&I led the way, up $5.6 billion or 12%, driven by large corporate and middle market borrowers. Consumer loans increased to almost $4 billion or 24%, with growth across all loan categories, most notably student loans. 
In government-guaranteed mortgages, we're up $1.5 billion or about 33%. The overall portfolio growth was partially offset by intentional declines in certain portfolios, including CRE, construction and home equity, which were managed down by a combined $2.3 billion. 
The continued impact of this derisking is evident on Slide 10. Portfolios that we've categorized as higher risk declined by $14 billion or 60% over the past few years, and they were down by another $400 million this quarter. 
Higher-risk balances were managed down by over $2 billion or 18% from the prior year, with the decline split relatively evenly between the 3 major categories. This can be seen at the bottom of the page. The overall decline and the higher risk balances over the past few 2 years has essentially been offset by increases in government-guaranteed loans. This combination has helped to significantly improve the risk profile of the company in a relatively short period of time. 
Additionally, the increases in government-guaranteed balances also served as a bridge to a time of organic loan growth. Recent quarters' higher-risk loan balances have declined at a slower pace in light of the smaller size of this portfolio and its improving risk characteristics. 
Additionally, we've seen a pickup in organic loan demand. As such, and as part of our continued active management of the balance sheet, we elected to sell about $0.5 billion of government-guaranteed mortgages this quarter, and this resulted in an $18 million gain. 
Let's turn to Slide 11 for a review of credit trends. Credit quality continued to trend favorably this quarter, with meaningful declines in delinquencies, nonperforming assets, nonperforming loans and net charge-offs. Early-stage delinquencies, excluding government-guaranteed loans, were down by 8 basis points from the prior quarter, driven by residential loans. Non-guaranteed mortgage delinquency rates declined by 23 basis points, and home equity improved by 11 basis points. 
Nonperforming loans declined sequentially by almost $200 million or 7%. Improvements were evident across the portfolio, most notably in commercial real estate and residential and commercial construction. Nonperforming assets declined by over $300 million or 11%, driven by the decline in nonperforming loans, as well as reductions in other real estate owned and the completion of the sale of the nonperforming mortgage loans that we commenced last quarter. Year-over-year, nonperforming loans were down $1.2 billion or more than 30%. All loan categories showed improvement, with the highest declines coming from commercial construction, CRE and C&I. 
Net charge-offs declined by $72 million or 17% sequentially, and the net charge-off ratio fell by 24 basis points to 1.14%. Non-guaranteed mortgages, home equity and commercial real estate were the biggest drivers of the improvement. Relative to the prior year, net charge-offs were lower by $155 million, or about 30%, with meaningful improvements seen across most of the portfolios.
The allowance for loan and lease losses was $2.3 billion at quarter end or 1.86% of loans. In light of the continued favorable trends in credit quality, the allowance declined this quarter, albeit at a more modest pace than recent quarters. Excluding government-guaranteed loans from the denominator of the allowance calculation, the ratio stood at 2.07%. 
Overall, we were pleased with our trends and credit metrics, and the improvements exceeded our expectations, particularly in net charge-offs. As we look forward, a recovering economy should continue to support our positive asset quality trends with improvements primarily driven by the residential portfolio, as most of the commercial and consumer portfolios are currently nearing more normal credit metric levels. Looking specifically at the third quarter, we currently expect to see additional declines in nonperforming loans and relatively stable net charge-offs. 
Let's take a look at deposit performance. Average deposit balances were stable with their record first quarter level of approximately $126 billion. A favorable shift in deposit mix continued as DDA and savings increased while higher-cost time deposits declined. Compared to last year, client deposits were up $4 billion or 3%. Lower-cost deposits drove the increase, with DDA up almost $7 billion or 23%. Conversely, time deposits were down almost $3 billion or 14%. This favorable mix shift has contributed to our year-over-year net interest income growth. 
Slide 13 provides information on our capital metrics. Tier 1 common increased for the eighth consecutive quarter, up sequentially by approximately $300 million, primarily from increased retained earnings. The Tier 1 common ratio ended the quarter at an estimated 9.4%, up another 7 basis points from last quarter's 9.33%. 
While not shown on this slide, I'll mention the capital impact of our decision to call the $1.2 billion of higher-cost trust preferred securities. The redemption of these securities resulted in a reduction of our Basel I Tier 1 ratio of about 90 basis points, and that impact is already reflected in our second quarter capital ratio estimates. As you're aware, this will not impact our fully phased-in Basel III Tier 1 ratio as trust preferreds are not Tier 1 qualifying instruments. 
As it relates to our recent Basel III notice of proposed rulemaking, we continue to evaluate the potential impact to our capital ratios. Under this proposal, we expect to see some increase in risk-weighted assets and a corresponding decrease in capital ratios, primarily due to the ranges of risk weightings for residential mortgages and home equity. If implemented, as stated in the recent NPR, our resulting capital ratios should still comfortably exceed all proposed regulatory requirements. 
Bottom part of this slide shows our tangible common equity ratio and tangible book value per share. Both were up this quarter due to increases in retained earnings and other comprehensive income. Tangible common equity ratio increased by 17 basis points to 8.15% while our tangible book value per share climbed about 2% to end the quarter just about $26. 
Let's turn to Slide 14 for a discussion of our Playbook for Profitable Growth expense program. As you can see, we made continued progress against the $300 million expense savings goal for the PPG program. To date, we've reached $250 million in annualized savings. 
As you know, this program is comprised of numerous expense savings initiatives, broken into 3 main buckets: strategic supply management, Consumer Bank efficiencies and operations and support staff. This quarter, we garnered savings in each of these categories. And on the slide, you could see the activities that were the primary drivers of the savings. 
In our strategic supply management initiatives, we achieved additional savings through further contract renegotiations. Additionally, we have successfully managed down our own spending on items we consider discretionary, items such as travel, temp labor, print and wireless service. Our teammates are finding ways everyday to cut out expenses for things that once seemed like a necessity. There's a high level of commitment here throughout the company, and this is something every teammate can do to improve efficiency and meet our goals. 
In the Consumer Bank efficiencies category, we've achieved savings primarily due to 2 key initiatives. First, we revamped our branch staffing model to better align market needs with staff, from both the capabilities and a volume perspective. We're achieving greater efficiencies by differentiating staffing by client segment served and market opportunity. Furthermore, we've changed our incentive compensation structure for certain types of positions, and this is now yielding real dollar savings. 
Several initiatives have driven our operations and support staff savings, though the chief component of our savings this quarter came from tighter spans and layers with further reduction in FTEs. We also made additional progress in our efforts to leverage digital technology, making significant reductions in the number of paper statements that we now process. 
Though we are rapidly approaching our goal of $300 million in savings, as Bill mentioned earlier, this, by no means, should imply that we are done with our work here. PPG was the beginning of a process of transformation of SunTrust. We will continue to leverage the strong momentum we have generated to drive toward our ultimate goal of a sub-60% efficiency ratio upon the abatement of elevated credit and mortgage-related expenses. PPG program is only the start of our efficiency improvement efforts. 
That wraps up my comments for today. So I'll call -- I'll turn the call back over to Bill."

And before we move into Q&A, I'd like to take a few moments to highlight some of the progress we've been making in our lines of business. These results punctuate the core momentum we're building. 
I'll start by noting that the efficiency ratio is down at each of the lines of business relative to last quarter and last year. Of course, their absolute levels are too high, but each business has specific plans that aimed at driving continued improvements. 
In our Consumer Banking and Private Wealth line of business, we generated solid DDA growth of 11%, and loan production volume was up a healthy 19% during the first half of the year. From a revenue perspective -- I mean, regulatory headwinds continued to challenge noninterest income in this business, however, you'll notice that expenses were down 7% from the second quarter of last year, due in large part to reductions in staffing driven by our PPG initiatives, which Aleem highlighted. 
Another encouraging statistic is that client loyalty continued to increase in our retail business this quarter, solidifying our position as an industry-leading bank and our footprint for this metric. Also of note here is our credit card business. A relaunch of this business is in its early stages, but it's going well, thus far, with new account sales more than 4x the levels generated in the second quarter of last year. 
We've been delivering strong results in our Wholesale business. Year-to-date net income was nearly double what it was a year ago. We saw a record net income and revenue in Corporate, Investment Banking, and it generated the lion's share of the 8% Wholesale loan growth over last year. DDA balances were up over 20%, driven by our Diversified Commercial Banking business. 
We're also beginning to generate some core commercial real estate growth. Like credit card, we're in early stages here, but we're pleased with our progress and believe commercial real estate loan balances are nearing an inflection point where we start to see some growth in this portfolio in coming quarters. 
We're also seeing improving trends in our Mortgage line of business. Year-to-date, Mortgage production volume was up $5.5 billion or over 50%, and core Mortgage production income was $320 million higher. The overall profitability of our Mortgage business continued to be negatively impacted by legacy issues and still operating a net loss position this quarter, but the trends are improving. Given the current rate environment and some overall improvements in the housing market, coupled with the HARP pipeline, we expect to have near-term Mortgage production revenue to remain strong. 
So overall, line of business performance is trending positively, and we're seeing the results more clearly in the company's financial metrics. Our SunTrust team is working hard in delivering better results, and I'd be remiss in not recognizing them and thanking them for their collective effort. 
So with that said, Kris, let me turn it back over to you."

Having that out I think is going to provide more clarity to the industry as to what the capital -- expected capital ratios are going to look like going forward. Having said that, parts of the NPR, I think, came as a little bit of a surprise. On the numerator side, it came out pretty well as much as the industry expected. But on the denominator side, some of the changes to RWA, for example, were not expected and aren't, actually, part of the Basel proposal. These are U.S. regulatory proposals. We are, along with the rest of the industry, responding to that proposal now, and I think the industry has a deadline of sometime at September to respond back to that. At that point, the regulators will take a look at all of the response letters and come out with final rules at some point probably next year. As we try to estimate what we might look like under this proposal, I think you've seen a lot of banks over the last few days estimate that their final numbers are in -- are going to be in the 8% range, using these proposals on our current portfolios and prior to any management mitigation. And I think it'd be fair, as you look at our portfolio, to say we'll come in around that same kind of level as most other banks are estimating."

And as you go down our income statement, those cost saves have showed up pretty well all the way down the line, however, some of those have been offset by cost increases in some other areas. For example, our -- we've got some consulting cost for now that have come in as a result of the mortgage foreclosure review that were not originally anticipated. So you'll see some of those in there. And you'll see some compensation increases as a result of increased revenue. And so just as a result of revenue-related compensation increases, we've got some increases there. And so that's why, overall, you see a netting, but that netting is -- I would consider that to be a really good trade, in that we're paying people commissions on revenue they're generating, while at the same time, we're reducing core costs."

And this is the way that I like to think about it just because it's sort of makes it easy and it doesn't make it sort of dependent upon a bunch of exogenous factors. If you normalize a number of facts -- so let's assume sort of a flat revenue environment. Let's assume we actually don't get another penny's worth of revenue. If you normalize for a net charge-off/provision at some basis, so normalize it wherever you want to, but call it 50 to 70 basis points, which is clearly higher than we've trended in the past, if you normalize for FIN 45, mortgage repurchase and just put some number in there, pick a number, but it's -- it would be appreciably smaller than where it is today. Then you normalize for the credit-related expenses, so there, they've ran about $800 million sort of annualized little higher, now they're running closer to $700 million annualized, and we're starting to see that benefit. It used to be about $200 million. I don't think we'll get to there. So pick a number, just cut it in half as a thought process and then put $300 million in PPG on top of that and you get to, at that point, essentially a 60% efficiency ratio on a 1% plus ROA. So at a really high level, I mean, that sort of what gives us confidence. Now it won't work out that way exactly, and there'll be puts and takes. And the timing will be different, and one quarter will be up, one quarter will be down. But if you think about that in sort of a goal, that's it. Now to the point of PPG, if some of those things don't materialize, if the credit expenses don't come down like that or if the charge-offs don't normalize the way I've described or, in fact, if revenues down for some reason unforeseen, then the number on the savings will be higher. I mean, that's how I like to think about it, just sort of about a really, really high level. Does that make sense?"

And then again, I try to factor in the $250 million of PPG savings. It looks like your internal expense growth rate is running about 5% to 6% annually. Probably that's a little bit higher than what you would call sort of a normalized growth rate x the PPG savings because of the revenue you talked about and because of the strong mortgage quarter, but can you give us a sense of what you think that sort of normal internal growth rate is x expense savings going forward?

In our normal fashion, I'll begin today's call with some brief comments on our performance this quarter and then pass on to Aleem to provide details on the results. The high-level points are shown on Slide 3 of our presentation. 
Core performance continued to steadily improve this quarter. Net income to common shareholders was $270 million, and earnings per share was $0.50, a $0.04 increase over last quarter and a $0.17 increase over last year. 
On the revenue side, total revenue was up $28 million over last quarter, driven by higher noninterest income. Strong Mortgage revenue drove a $64 million or 7% sequential quarter increase in fee income, while our net interest income declined $36 million due to decrease in swap income. 
Mortgage production volume remained high this quarter. To date this year, we've closed almost $16 billion in Mortgage loans, up over 50% from last year, which helped over 62,000 clients buy or refinance a home this year, including many through the HARP program. 
Now moving to expenses. They were stable the last quarter and last year. Included in this quarter's expense was a $13 million noncash charge associated with redemption of a $1.2 billion of trust preferred securities. These were higher-cost fundings, and as such, we moved quickly to redeem them once the capital treatment of that occurred, allowing us to do so. 
We've made significant progress in our efforts to reduce expenses through our PPG program. To date, we've generated annualized savings of $250 million, and we're now well within our sight of $300 million goal for the program. 
Now at the risk of being redundant, I'll reiterate that we're committed to establishing a more efficiently-run organization. The PPG program was the catalyst, but was never intended to be the final goal for us. So what I'm saying here is that when PPG is done, our work is not. The ultimate objective is getting our efficiency ratio under 60%, and we have high intensity around both revenue and expense initiatives to help us achieve that goal. 
Now taking a look at the balance sheet. Targeted loan growth, particularly in C&I, drove a $1 billion increase in average performing loan balances over last quarter and nearly a $10 billion increase over last year. At the same time, we've been actively managing down certain real estate-related loan balances. 
Though average client deposits were stable to last quarter's record level, we continue to see the favorable mix shift this quarter. Average DDA balances were up 3% from the prior quarter and 23% from the prior year, while CD balances declined. 
Credit quality also continued to improve across-the-board. Net charge-offs are 1.14% of average loans, down 17% from the prior quarter. Nonperforming loans were down 7%, and early-stage delinquencies declined 7 basis points. Lastly, we generated additional positive capital growth with Tier 1 common ratio estimated at 9.4% at quarter end. 
Now before I wrap up my comments and turn it over to Aleem, I'm going to take a minute to address our resubmitted capital plan under the 2012 CCAR process. As you're aware, we submitted our revised capital plan in mid-June. While the fed is in the process of reviewing our plan, I wanted to share with you in advance that we elected not to request any increase in the current level of the dividend or any other return of capital at this time. We made this decision in light of the fact that this submission only covered capital actions for the fourth quarter of 2012 and the first quarter of 2013. 
Additionally, we considered the close proximity of the resubmission to the 2013 CCAR process, which is expected to begin in the fourth quarter of this year, shortly after the time we expect to hear back on this plan. And we think this is the best course of action for the short term, but it's not indicative of our long-term plans to return capital prudently to shareholders. 
As a reminder, in their review of our original plan submission, the fed did not object to the trust preferred redemptions, which, as I noted earlier, have been completed, or to maintaining the quarterly common stock dividend at $0.05 a share. The 2013 CCAR process will begin later this year, will provide us an opportunity to evaluate capital deployment alternatives for next year. 
So overall, we made continued progress this quarter with momentum building in several key areas of our company. Of note was the solid noninterest income growth, mainly driven by strong Mortgage production, though with a pick up in several other fee categories as well. We also saw a continuation of a multi-quarter trend in increased performing loan balances, particularly in our C&I book. So looking ahead, challenges remain with the less-than-ideal operating environment, but I believe SunTrust is well-positioned to capitalize upon our opportunities. 
And with that said, let me turn it over to Aleem."

Bill had a lot of the highlights, so I'll be brief here and then we'll delve deeper on subsequent slides. 
As Bill noted earlier, we're pleased to report higher earnings per share this quarter of $0.50, which is a $0.04 increase from the prior quarter and a $0.17 increase from last year. This sequential quarter income growth is attributable to higher revenue and a lower loan loss provision. Revenue grew $28 million, as higher noninterest income more than offset the swap-related decline in net interest income. Provision declined $17 million due to lower net charge-offs and continued improvements in other credit metrics. 
Higher revenue and a lower loan loss provision also drove the growth from the second quarter of last year, where revenue increased by $48 million by a combination of higher net interest income and higher fee income, the latter of which was primarily mortgage-related. Improvements in credit quality were widespread, driving a $92 million decline in the provision, while noninterest expense was essentially unchanged. 
Year-to-date EPS was $0.96. This is more than double the $0.41 reported during the first 6 months of last year. Revenue was higher, up 2% on a reported basis but by a more meaningful 5% net of the usual quarterly adjustment items we detail in the appendix. Other drivers were a lower loan loss provision and the redemption of the capital purchase program preferred shares. 
Let's take a look at each of the major income statement categories, beginning with net interest income on Slide 5. On a sequential quarter basis, net interest income declined by $36 million or 3%, and the net interest margin fell by 10 basis points to 3.39%. Both of these declines were almost entirely due to the previously disclosed reduction in income for maturing commercial loan swaps. Excluding the impact of the swap, net interest income and margin were relatively stable as lower loan yields and a smaller securities portfolio were offset by the benefits of higher loan balances and an improved deposit mix. 
Despite lower swap income, net interest income increased from the prior year by $20 million or 2%. Interest income declined by $49 million as lower asset yield outweighed the favorable impact of higher loan balances. However, this was more than offset by a $69 million decline in interest expense, driven by favorable liability trends, including strong DDA growth, a 17 basis point reduction in deposit rates paid and a 65 basis point decline in long-term debt costs.
I'll spend a few minutes discussing some of the major drivers of future net interest income and margin. First, on the asset side. With a slightly improving economy, we expect to see continued loan growth, which would be additive to net interest income. Although as you're well aware, most going-on rates are lower than the portfolio's current yield. Our securities balances declined somewhat this quarter, as we didn't see many attractive alternatives in light of the continued decline in yields. But we'll continue to monitor the market, and we'll pick our spots to reinvest. Commercial loan swap income is expected to stay relatively stable through the next year at its current level of about $120 million per quarter, assuming no major changes to LIBOR. 
Turning to the liability side. During the third quarter, we'll begin to benefit from last week's redemption of $1.2 billion in higher-cost trust-preferred securities, which had a weighted average cost of about 7%. Deposit pricing opportunities are obviously becoming limited at this point, given their low absolute rates, but this is something that we do continue to evaluate and manage carefully. We'll also benefit from higher-cost CDs maturing and rolling into lower rate products. 
So all told, there are headwinds and tailwinds. As we look specifically to the third quarter, we expect those headwinds and tailwinds to largely offset one another, such that the net interest margin is relatively stable. 
Look at noninterest income on Slide 6. Second quarter noninterest income was $940 million, a sequential quarter increase of $64 million on a reported basis or $39 million net of the adjustment items we detail in the appendix. Mortgage production income was strong this quarter, as origination volumes and gains on sale remained high. 
During the quarter, we closed over $8.2 billion of loans, which was up 8%. Purchase volume was $3 billion, an increase of over $1 billion. Refinance volume declined modestly, but remained healthy at $5.2 billion. Mortgage production income was $103 million this quarter or $258 million exclusive of the mortgage repurchase provision. Sequential quarter growth and the reported figure was $40 million, $20 million of which was attributable to a lower repurchase provision and $18 million due to a gain in conjunction with the sale of a portfolio containing government-guaranteed mortgages. And I'll discuss both of those in more detail on subsequent slides. 
In addition to the increase in mortgage production, we saw growth in numerous other consumer and commercial fee categories. As a couple of examples, loan commitment fees, recorded in the other charges and fees line item, were strong, and card fees grew due to increased client usage. Relative to the prior year, noninterest income was up $28 million on a reported basis and $59 million or 7% on an adjusted basis. 
The largest driver of the adjusted fee growth was a $99 million increase in mortgage production, with core mortgage production income up $164 million, partially offset by a $65 million increase in the repurchase provision. Trading income was also a driver of the year-over-year growth due to improved market conditions. On the flip side, card fees declined due to the implementation of caps on debit interchange income. We also saw a decline in investment banking income on lower syndicated finance volume.
Let's turn to Slide 7 for a discussion of this quarter's trends in mortgage repurchases. Mortgage repurchase demands, shown in the top-left box, were $489 million this quarter. That's an increase of about $40 million from last quarter, but within our range of expectations and well below the elevated levels we saw in the fourth quarter of last year. 
Demands continue to be concentrated in the 2006 to 2008 vintages, which have accounted for roughly 90% of all demand activity over the past several years, as well as this quarter. While demand levels may remain elevated in the coming quarters, consistent with what we've expressed for several quarters now, the underlying trends in demands and full file requests continue to suggest to us that the agencies are making progress in working through these higher-loss content vintages. For example, full file request volume has moderated somewhat and continue to transition toward loans that are delinquent but not yet in foreclosure. 
Pending population, shown in the top-right portion of this slide, increased to $652 million, up roughly $90 million from the prior quarter. This was the result of the increase in new demands, as well as a slower rate of demand resolution. We're taking a deliberate approach to the demand review process, ensuring that we repurchase loans where appropriate, yet cure or moderate losses wherever possible. 
Mortgage repurchase reserve, shown at the bottom left of the page, increased to $434 million, up $51 million from the first quarter. The increase relates primarily to the higher level of the pending population. Said differently, the reserve increase is in part due to the higher level of demands and, in part, to a reduction in charge-offs, which is merely a function of loss recognition timing.
Similar to prior quarters, some summary statistics of our sold mortgages are displayed at the bottom right of this page, and we've also provided some additional detail on the 2006 to 2008 vintages in the appendix. 
Overall, I'd note that our expectations around mortgage repurchases remain generally unchanged from what we've shared with you in recent quarters. We foresee demand volume remaining high and variable in the coming quarters. However, if recent patterns and full file requests continue as anticipated, we expect to see a reduced income statement impact towards the end of this year. 
Let's move on to expenses on Slide 8. Expenses were essentially stable compared to both the prior quarter and prior year. On a sequential quarter basis, employee compensation and benefits declined by $35 million due to the seasonal reduction in benefits. This decline was offset by growth in a handful of other categories. Bill mentioned earlier the $13 million noncash charge that we incurred related to the redemption of trust preferred securities. 
Additionally, operating losses increased $9 million due to specific mortgage-related losses and legal accruals. FDIC premiums increased $8 million. This line item was a bit lower than normal in the first quarter, and the Q2 level is expected to be a more normal run rate. In credit-related expenses, which we detailed for you, as usual, in the appendix, increased by $7 million. 
I will point out that this quarter, we refined our methodology for recognizing tax payments on delinquent loans, which resulted in an approximate $10 million increase in credit and collection expenses. As a result of this change, we should not experience the seasonal fourth quarter spike in this line item that we've seen in prior years. 
Relative to the prior year, adjusted expenses declined $11 million, driven by lower FDIC premiums, credit-related expenses and marketing costs. These declines were partially offset by a modest increase in compensation and higher outside processing costs. 
Before we turn to the balance sheet starting on Slide 9, I'll summarize this quarter's income statement by noting that we drove continued improvement in our core earnings this quarter. Obviously, our low -- our absolute level of profitability is still well below our profit-generation capability. But overall, we were pleased to note continued progression toward a more normalized level of earnings. 
Average performing loans increased again this quarter, up sequentially by a little over $1 billion or about 1%. Growth was driven by commercial loans, specifically C&I, which was up $1.3 billion. 
Within our Wholesale businesses, growth continued to be concentrated in larger corporate clients and to be well diversified. Specific industry verticals within our Corporate Investment Bank that drove the bulk of this quarter's growth were healthcare, diversified, financial services and media. 
We also booked some modest growth in our Diversified Commercial Banking business, driven by auto dealers and not-for-profit clients. While we saw a continued runoff of legacy assets in our commercial real estate book, the pace of decline moderated again this quarter. 
The residential portfolio was relatively stable this quarter. Within it, we grew non-guaranteed loans by about $700 million, driven by high FICO jumbo loans. The guaranteed portfolio was down approximately $600 million, largely due to the sale of $0.5 billion in loans this quarter. 
Relative to the prior year, performing loans grew almost $10 billion or 9%, with the growth coming entirely from our targeted categories, namely C&I, guaranteed mortgages and consumer loans. C&I led the way, up $5.6 billion or 12%, driven by large corporate and middle market borrowers. Consumer loans increased almost $4 billion or 24%, with growth across all loan categories, most notably student loans. 
And government-guaranteed mortgages were up $1.5 billion or about 33%. The overall portfolio growth was partially offset by intentional declines in certain portfolios, including CRE, construction and home equity, which were managed down by a combined $2.3 billion. 
The continued impact of this derisking is evident on Slide 10. Portfolios that we've categorized as higher risk declined by $14 billion or 60% over the past few years, and they were down by another $400 million this quarter. 
Higher-risk balances were managed down by over $2 billion or 18% from the prior year, with the decline split relatively evenly between the 3 major categories. This can be seen at the bottom of the page. The overall decline and the higher risk balances over the past few years has essentially been offset by increases in government-guaranteed loans. This combination has helped to significantly improve the risk profile of the company in a relatively short period of time. 
Additionally, the increases in government-guaranteed balances also served as a bridge to a time of organic loan growth. Recent quarters' higher-risk loan balances have declined at a slower pace in light of the smaller size of this portfolio and its improving risk characteristics. 
Additionally, we've seen a pickup in organic loan demand. As such, and as part of our continued active management of the balance sheet, we elected to sell about $0.5 billion of government-guaranteed mortgages this quarter, and this resulted in an $18 million gain. 
Let's turn to Slide 11 for a review of credit trends. Credit quality continued to trend favorably this quarter, with meaningful declines in delinquencies, nonperforming assets, nonperforming loans and net charge-offs. Early-stage delinquencies, excluding government-guaranteed loans, were down by 8 basis points from the prior quarter, driven by residential loans. Non-guaranteed mortgage delinquency rates declined by 23 basis points, and home equity improved by 11 basis points. 
Nonperforming loans declined sequentially by almost $200 million or 7%. Improvements were evident across the portfolio, most notably in commercial real estate and residential and commercial construction. Nonperforming assets declined by over $300 million or 11%, driven by the decline in nonperforming loans, as well as reductions in other real estate owned and the completion of the sale of the nonperforming mortgage loans that we commenced last quarter. Year-over-year, nonperforming loans were down $1.2 billion or more than 30%. All loan categories showed improvement, with the highest declines coming from commercial construction, CRE and C&I. 
Net charge-offs declined by $72 million or 17% sequentially, and the net charge-off ratio fell by 24 basis points to 1.14%. Non-guaranteed mortgages, home equity and commercial real estate were the biggest drivers of the improvement. Relative to the prior year, net charge-offs were lower by $155 million, or about 30%, with meaningful improvements seen across most of the portfolios.
The allowance for loan and lease losses was $2.3 billion at quarter end or 1.86% of loans. In light of the continued favorable trends in credit quality, the allowance declined this quarter, albeit at a more modest pace than recent quarters. Excluding government-guaranteed loans from the denominator of the allowance calculation, the ratio stood at 2.07%. 
Overall, we were pleased with our trends in credit metrics, and the improvements exceeded our expectations, particularly in net charge-offs. As we look forward, a recovering economy should continue to support our positive asset quality trends with improvements primarily driven by the residential portfolio, as most of the commercial and consumer portfolios are currently nearing more normal credit metric levels. Looking specifically at the third quarter, we currently expect to see additional declines in nonperforming loans and relatively stable net charge-offs. 
Let's take a look at deposit performance. Average deposit balances were stable with their record first quarter level of approximately $126 billion. A favorable shift in deposit mix continued as DDA and savings increased while higher-cost time deposits declined. Compared to last year, client deposits were up $4 billion or 3%. Lower-cost deposits drove the increase, with DDA up almost $7 billion or 23%. Conversely, time deposits were down almost $3 billion or 14%. This favorable mix shift has contributed to our year-over-year net interest income growth. 
Slide 13 provides information on our capital metrics. Tier 1 common increased for the eighth consecutive quarter, up sequentially by approximately $300 million, primarily from increased retained earnings. The Tier 1 common ratio ended the quarter at an estimated 9.4%, up another 7 basis points from last quarter's 9.33%. 
While not shown on this slide, I'll mention the capital impact of our decision to call the $1.2 billion of higher-cost trust-preferred securities. The redemption of these securities resulted in a reduction of our Basel I Tier 1 ratio of about 90 basis points, and that impact is already reflected in our second quarter capital ratio estimates. As you're aware, this will not impact our fully phased-in Basel III Tier 1 ratio as trust preferreds are not Tier 1 qualifying instruments. 
As it relates to our recent Basel III notice of proposed rulemaking, we continue to evaluate the potential impact to our capital ratios. Under this proposal, we expect to see some increase in risk-weighted assets and a corresponding decrease in capital ratios, primarily due to the ranges of risk weightings for residential mortgages and home equity. If implemented, as stated in the recent NPR, our resulting capital ratios should still comfortably exceed all proposed regulatory requirements. 
Bottom part of this slide shows our tangible common equity ratio and tangible book value per share. Both were up this quarter due to increases in retained earnings and other comprehensive income. Tangible common equity ratio increased by 17 basis points to 8.15%, while our tangible book value per share climbed about 2% to end the quarter just above $26. 
Let's turn to Slide 14 for a discussion of our Playbook for Profitable Growth expense program. As you can see, we made continued progress against the $300 million expense savings goal for the PPG program. To date, we've reached $250 million in annualized savings. 
As you know, this program is comprised of numerous expense savings initiatives broken into 3 main buckets: strategic supply management, Consumer Bank efficiencies and operations and support staff. This quarter, we garnered savings in each of these categories. And on the slide, you can see the activities that were the primary drivers of the savings. 
In our strategic supply management initiatives, we achieved additional savings through further contract renegotiations. Additionally, we have successfully managed down our own spending on items we consider discretionary, items such as travel, temp labor, print and wireless service. Our teammates are finding ways everyday to cut out expenses for things that once seemed like a necessity. There's a high level of commitment here throughout the company, and this is something every teammate can do to improve efficiency and meet our goals. 
In the Consumer Bank efficiencies category, we've achieved savings primarily due to 2 key initiatives. First, we revamped our branch staffing model to better align market needs with staff, from both a capabilities and a volume perspective. We're achieving greater efficiencies by differentiating staffing by client segment served and market opportunity. Furthermore, we've changed our incentive compensation structure for certain types of positions, and this is now yielding real dollar savings. 
Several initiatives have driven our operations and support staff savings, though the chief component of our savings this quarter came from tighter spans and layers with further reductions in FTEs. We also made additional progress in our efforts to leverage digital technology, making significant reductions in the number of paper statements that we now process. 
Though we are rapidly approaching our goal of $300 million in savings, as Bill mentioned earlier, this, by no means, should imply that we are done with our work here. PPG was the beginning of a process of transformation of SunTrust. We will continue to leverage the strong momentum we have generated to drive toward our ultimate goal of a sub-60% efficiency ratio upon the abatement of elevated credit and mortgage-related expenses. PPG program is only the start of our efficiency improvement efforts. 
That wraps up my comments for today. So I'll call -- I'll turn the call back over to Bill."

And before we move into Q&A, I'd like to take a few moments to highlight some of the progress we've been making in our lines of business. These results punctuate the core momentum we're building. 
I'll start by noting that the efficiency ratio is down at each of the lines of business relative to last quarter and last year. Of course, their absolute levels are too high, but each business has specific plans that aimed at driving continued improvements. 
In our Consumer Banking and Private Wealth line of business, we generated solid DDA growth of 11%, and loan production volume was up a healthy 19% during the first half of the year. From a revenue perspective -- I mean, regulatory headwinds continued to challenge noninterest income in this business. However, you'll notice that expenses were down 7% from the second quarter of last year, due in large part to reductions in staffing driven by our PPG initiatives, which Aleem highlighted. 
Another encouraging statistic is that client loyalty continued to increase in our retail business this quarter, solidifying our position as an industry-leading bank and our footprint for this metric. Also of note here is our credit card business. Our relaunch of this business is in its early stages, but it's going well thus far, with new account sales more than 4x the levels generated in the second quarter of last year. 
We've been delivering strong results in our Wholesale business. Year-to-date net income was nearly double what it was a year ago. We saw a record net income and revenue in Corporate, Investment Banking, and it generated the lion's share of the 8% Wholesale loan growth over last year. DDA balances were up over 20%, driven by our Diversified Commercial Banking business. 
We're also beginning to generate some core commercial real estate growth. Like credit card, we're in the early stages here, but we're pleased with our progress and believe commercial real estate loan balances are nearing an inflection point where we'll start to see some growth in this portfolio in coming quarters. 
We're also seeing improving trends in our Mortgage line of business. Year-to-date, Mortgage production volume was up $5.5 billion or over 50%, and core Mortgage production income was $320 million higher. The overall profitability of our Mortgage business continues to be negatively impacted by legacy issues and still operating a net loss position this quarter, but the trends are improving. Given the current rate environment and some overall improvements in the housing market, coupled with the HARP pipeline, we expect to have near-term Mortgage production revenue to remain strong. 
So overall, line of business performance is trending positively, and we're seeing the results more clearly in the company's financial metrics. Our SunTrust team is working hard in delivering better results, and I'd be remiss in not recognizing them and thanking them for their collective effort. 
So with that said, Kris, let me turn it back over to you."

Having that out I think is going to provide more clarity to the industry as to what the capital -- expected capital ratios are going to look like going forward. Having said that, parts of the NPR, I think, came as a little bit of a surprise. On the numerator side, it came out pretty well, as much as the industry expected. But on the denominator side, some of the changes to RWA, for example, were not expected and aren't, actually, part of the Basel proposal. These are U.S. regulatory proposals. We are, along with the rest of the industry, responding to that proposal now, and I think the industry has a deadline of sometime in September to respond back to that. At that point, the regulators will take a look at all of the response letters and come out with final rules at some point, probably next year. As we try to estimate what we might look like under this proposal, I think you've seen a lot of banks over the last few days estimate that their final numbers are in -- are going to be in that 8% range, using these proposals on our current portfolios and prior to any management mitigation. And I think it'd be fair, as you look at our portfolio, to say we'll come in around that same kind of level as most other banks are estimating."

Let me take it really high level, and then we can just let it go down any tributary you want to go down it. And this is the way that I like to think about it, just because it sort of makes it easy and it doesn't make it sort of dependent upon a bunch of exogenous factors. If you normalize a number of facts -- so let's assume sort of a flat revenue environment. Let's assume we actually don't get another penny's worth of revenue. If you normalize for a net charge-off/provision at some basis, so normalize it wherever you want to, but call it 50 to 70 basis points, which is clearly higher than we've trended in the past. If you normalize for FIN 45, mortgage repurchase and just put some number in there, pick a number, but it's -- it would be appreciably smaller than where it is today. Then you normalize for the credit-related expenses, so there, they've run about $800 million, sort of annualized a little higher, now they're running closer to $700 million annualized, and we're starting to see that benefit. It used to be about $200 million. I don't think we'll get to there. So pick a number, just cut it in half as a thought process and then put $300 million in PPG on top of that and you get to, at that point, essentially a 60% efficiency ratio and a 1% plus ROA. So at a really high level, I mean, that sort of what gives us confidence. Now it won't work out that way exactly, and there'll be puts and takes. And the timing will be different, and one quarter will be up, one quarter will be down. But if you think about that in sort of a goal, that's it. Now to the point of PPG, if some of those things don't materialize, if the credit expenses don't come down like that or if the charge-offs don't normalize the way I've described or, in fact, if revenue is down for some reason unforeseen, then the number on the savings will be higher. I mean, that's how I like to think about it, just sort of about a really, really high level. Does that make sense?"

And then again, I try to factor in the $250 million of PPG savings. It looks like your internal expense growth rate is running about 5% to 6% annually. Probably that's a little bit higher than what you would call sort of a normalized growth rate x the PPG savings because of the revenue you talked about and because of the strong mortgage quarter, but can you give us a sense of what you think that sort of normal internal growth rate is x expense savings going forward?

So it's hard for us, or anybody, to grind them down by double digits from here. But we do believe we still have some runway to drop deposit costs further from here, and you may see some of that this quarter. One of the levers we have is maturing CDs. We've got several billion dollars of -- $4 billion of CDs that are going to be maturing between now and the end of the year, and they have the weighted average cost of north of 1%.

In our normal fashion, I will begin today's call with a brief overview of the quarter. After passing it to Aleem, I'll wrap up with an update on our expense saving program and provide some recent business highlights. 
First, I will begin by acknowledging there are a lot of moving parts this quarter. We have endeavored in our remarks today and throughout the presentation of I do clarity on those items and how it impacted the results. Aleem will provide more detail momentarily and I think you'll see that we continue the trend of delivering improved quarter performance. Further, we're positioned more favorably coming out of the quarter in large part due to the actions we announced in September. Our overall risk profiles improved and our balance sheet has strengthened. This is highlighted by lower nonperforming and delinquent loans and a mortgage repurchase reserve that now fully covers estimated remaining losses on the pre-2009 vintage GSE loans. As you know, those are loans from which a vast majority of the mass of losses have been generated, and we are able to accomplish this while continuing to grow our capital base this quarter. 
Now turning to the presentation. Slide 3 summarizes some of the key drivers of our third quarter results. Earnings per share was $1.98 with the actions we announced last month contributing $1.40 per share. The diversity of our revenue streams benefited us this quarter. Mortgage production was again strong and investment banking income also increased, while net interest income and margin were relatively stable to the prior quarter. Expenses were up on a reported basis but excluding the noncore items, they were stable the last quarter and down from the prior year. As you are aware, this continues to be an area where we have lots of focus as we strive to achieve our ultimate goal of a sub-60 efficiency ratio. I'm going to talk about this in the context of our PPG program later in the call. 
Now take a look at the balance sheet. Overall loan growth was slow but growth in targeted categories, particularly C&I, drove a nearly $1 billion increase in average performing loan balances over last quarter and a nearly $10 billion increase over last year. This more than offset certain real estate related loans that we have been actively managing down. Now on the deposit side, the favorable mix continued with average DDA growth of 3% from the prior quarter and 19% from the prior year. From a credit perspective, the de-risking of the balance sheet helped drive a 30% reduction in nonperforming loans over last quarter and a 47% decline from last year. And as I mentioned earlier, our capital position continue to increase with our Tier 1 common equity ratio estimated at 9.8%, up 40 basis points last quarter. 
All in all, we're continuing to demonstrate improved quarter performance. And that, coupled with proactive actions we took this quarter, positions us well for the future. I'm going to turn it over to Aleem and let him walk you through the details and give you more clarity on the quarters results. Aleem?"

After several noise-free quarters and consistently improving results, as Bill noted, we had a number of lumpy items that impacted the third quarter. So I'll spend a few minutes grounding you on them before we get to the operating results. Please turn to Slide 4. I'll start with an update on the items we preannounced in September. The acceleration of the agreement regarding our Coca-Cola shares generated $1.9 billion in securities gains. And the charitable contribution of 1 million coke shares to the SunTrust Foundation resulted in the recognition of $38 million. Our third quarter mortgage repurchase provision was $371 million. Consistent with last month's announcement and as Bill noted earlier, we expect mortgage repurchase reserve to cover the estimated remaining losses from pre-2009 vintage loans sold to the GSE. During the third quarter, we transferred to held-for-sale slightly $500 million of nonperforming mortgage and Commercial Real Estate loans. The total net charge of recognized in the writing the loans not in disposition value was $172 million. The majority of the loan sales were completed during the third quarter with only about $40 million in net balances remaining to be sold this quarter. We also transferred to held-for-sale $1.4 billion of student loans and $500 million of delinquent Ginnie Mae loans. In doing so, we wrote these loans down to the expected sales price and the $92 million charge, most of which was associated with the delinquent Ginnie Mae loans, was a reduction to noninterest income. You will recall, the majority of the combined $1.9 billion in student and Ginnie Mae loans we're selling are more than 90 days delinquent. Their disposition reduces our delinquency ratio and makes the size of our government guaranteed loan volume more consistent with our longer-term balance sheet target. All of the transferred loans were included in loans held-for-sale at the quarter end. The date in the fourth quarter, we have already sold $1 billion of student loans and we expect complete the remaining student and Ginnie Mae sales by year end. 
We also transferred approximately $190 million of affordable housing investments to held-for-sale during the quarter. The $96 million write-down taken upon the transfer was recorded as a noninterest expense, and the resulted carrying value reflects our best estimate of the ultimate disposition price. We expect this sale will be completed in the second quarter of 2013. Combined, the preannounced items contributed $753 million in net income or $1.40 per common share to the third quarter results. This was exactly on our prior guidance. 
Shifting to the bottom portion of Slide 4, you see 4 other items. The first of which relates to credit policy change. During the third quarter, we moved the timing of charge-off recognition for junior lien loans from 180 days to 120 days. Our analysis indicated that when junior liens go 120 days past due, they rarely cure and typically roll to 180 days. Accordingly, we altered our policy, which resulted in the accelerated recognition of $65 million in incremental net charge-offs in the quarter. For clarity, this is not related to the policy change other large banks made this quarter regarding the treatment of consumer loan that were not reaffirmed following Chapter 7 bankruptcy. We have not received to 2 guidance from our regulator and have not taken any action in response. However, we are monitoring development. We do estimate that we have approximately $400 million of such loans, about 35% of which are already classified as performing TDRs. We expect to receive coordinated regulatory guidance on this issue and will take any appropriate action at that time. I'll cover the final 3 items on the page fairly quickly. I'm pleased to note that our credit spreads tightened considerably in the third quarter. Unfortunately, this also resulted in $41 million in mark-to-market losses on our fair value, which reduced noninterest income. Next, we accrued $29 million in severance expense associated with post-PPG efforts to streamline our organization and achieve our efficiency ratio objectives. And lastly, we incurred a $17 million expense associated with reassessments and ultimate reduction of our real estate need. 
Slide 5 provides a summary income statement and the collective impact of the items that I just reviewed. Third quarter noninterest income was up substantial from prior quarters and the gain from the Coca-Cola transaction more than offset the increased mortgage repurchase provision, the write-down on the student and Ginnie Mae loan sales and the mark-to-market loss on the fair value adjustment. Provision for credit losses increased this quarter due to the NPL sales and the credit policy change. Expenses were higher due to the affordable housing write-down, the coke shares donation, severance and the real estate charges. 
Looking at the bottom line, third quarter 2012 earnings per share of $1.98 was up markedly compared to the prior quarters. Obviously, a lot of the favorable variance is driven by the $1.40 per share impact of the September actions. After backing that out, this quarter's EPS of $0.58 continued our favorable core earnings, and it compares favorably to the $0.39 from a year ago and the $0.50 from last quarter. 
Subsequent slides provide clear reviews of our underlying trend. So let's turn to Slide 6 for a discussion of net interest income, which was $1.3 billion this quarter and the margin was 3.38%, both of which were down slightly from the prior quarter. Interest income from assets declined about $50 million sequentially. This was driven by 3 primary factors. First, we experienced 10 basis points of loan yield compression, mainly driven by mortgage and C&I as new loans that were originating are coming on the books at lower yields than those that are paying off. Second, we saw a 38 basis point decline in our securities yield, which was largely attributable to the elimination of the $15 million quarterly Coke dividend. And lastly, we continue to modestly reduce the size of our bond portfolio in light of the lack of attractive investment alternative. 
On the liability side, interest expense declined sequentially by $44 million, and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities was managed down by 14 basis points. This was driven by the reduced funding needs associated with the smaller balance sheet, the previously announced redemption of $1.2 billion of higher cost trust preferred securities earlier in the quarter and the maturity of a population of higher cost CD, which helped drive the overall time deposit down about 20 basis points. Relative to the prior year, net interest income was up modestly and the margin declined 10 basis points. Key drivers were lower earning asset yields, higher loan balances and reduced interest cost associated with an improved deposit mix, lower deposit rates paid and the reduction in long-term debt. 
As we look to the fourth quarter, we expect to see a reduction in the net interest margin on the order of mid-single digit basis points, driven by additional reductions in asset yields, which will partially be offset by lower yet liability costs. In the fourth quarter, we expect the reduction to net interest income as a result of the lower margin, coupled with our smaller balance sheet due to the closed and pending loan sales. 
Let's turn to Slide 7 for a discussion of noninterest income. As we discussed earlier, reported noninterest income was up substantially this quarter due to the favorable net impact associated with the September assets actions. As usual, we've also provided a view of our adjusted noninterest income and we detailed the adjustments in the appendix. The $216 million sequential quarter increase in the mortgage repurchase provision, which is booked as a contra revenue drove the decline in adjusted noninterest income in the second quarter. Otherwise, fee income trends this quarter were solid. Most notable was core mortgage production. Excluding the impact of the repurchase provision, mortgage production income hit a record high this quarter and increased $49 million or almost 20% sequentially. Production volume was high and stable to the second quarter level of about $8 billion, which was split roughly 70-30 between refinancing and repurchasing. 
Looking ahead, while it is reasonable to assume some volume and margin compression, we do expect overall conditions in the mortgage market to continue to remain favorable in the near term. 
Investment banking was another business that was up sequentially, driven by strong syndication volume. Conversely, the other charges and fee category declined as a result of lower commitment fees and card fees fell due to a reclassification of card award process. Relative to the prior year, adjusted noninterest income declined $111 million, driven by a $254 million increase in the mortgage repurchase provision. Apart from this, adjusted noninterest income increased $143 million or 15%. Similar to the sequential quarter comparisons, strong core mortgage production was the primary driver and higher investment banking revenue also contributed, driven by syndication and bond origination fee. Conversely, card fees declined primarily due to the impact of regulatory reform. 
Let's turn to Slide 8 to take a look at mortgage repurchases. For consistency's sake, we've continued to share with you the same layout of this page from prior quarters. But obviously the important news on mortgage repurchase issue for us this quarter was contained within our September announcement. Specifically, as a result of additional information we received from both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, coupled with our own analysis of the patterns of demand and file request, we were able to more precisely estimate the remaining losses on pre-2009 GSE loans, the population of loans that today have accounted for about 95% of all repurchase losses. As such, we recorded a $371 million provision this quarter, and the resulting mortgage reserve, which you can see on the bottom left of this page increased to $694 million. Looking forward, we expect this reserve level to decline as the losses are recognized. 
The top left portion of this slide shows that demand declined $405 million this quarter, driven primarily by the 2006 to '08 vintages. Demand levels could continue to very in the coming quarters. However, the trends and the full requests precursors the future demand are improving in 2 ways. First, the absolute number to full file requests are declining. This suggests that, over time, we should begin seeing a decline in the over level of demand. Second, the percentage of full file requests for loans that have never been 120 days past due is increasing, and more recently delinquent loans tend to have better cure rates. The pending demand population, which is displayed on the top right portion of this page increased to $690 million. This is due to the new demand and a modest extension of resolution timing. We continue to take a deliberate approach in reviewing repurchase demand, ensuring that we purchase loans where appropriate yet cure the defects or moderate losses wherever possible. Overall and in line with what we said in September, the mortgage repurchase trends continue to play out in a manner consistent with our expectations and information we received from the agencies. 
Let's move on to expenses. Adjusted expenses were essentially stable to the prior quarter. Other real estate cost declined $22 million due to lower losses on disposition, and outside processing fell $9 million. These were offset by increases in employee compensation and FDIC premiums. The $18 million compensation increase was largely due to the accelerated vesting of deferred compensation associated with certain organizational changes and to a lesser degree higher contract labor cost. $7 million increase in our FDIC premium is due to quarterly variability in the assessment. Relative to the prior year, adjusted expenses declined $24 million or 2%, credit-related cost of decline driven by a combined $38 million reduction in other real estate and collection services expenses. FDIC premiums also fell by $13 million. Partially offsetting these reductions was an employee compensation and benefits increase of $30 million. This was in part due to the aforementioned accelerated vesting of certain deferred compensation, as well as an overall improvement in business performance. 
As we look to the fourth quarter, we currently expect our adjusted expenses to be flat to down. Higher costs are expected to continue their overall declining trend and employee compensation is expected to decline. Conversely, certain volume and seasonally driven buying items for example, outside processing and advertising may increase. 
Let's turn to the balance sheet on Slide 10. Average performing loans increased by about $900 million or 1%. Growth was driven again this quarter by C&I, which was up $1.1 billion or 2% and came predominantly from large corporate clients with not-for-profit and auto dealer also contributing. and C&I growth was less robust than recent quarters as we saw some slowing in loan demand due to borrowers uncertainty associated with the economic environment and the fiscal cliff. That said, loan pipelines still remain fairly strong. I'll also point out that our corporate investment banking it has benefited in the increased activity on the bond market by improving bond origination fees during the last couple of quarters. Relative to the prior year performing loans increased by $9.5 billion or 8%. C&I was the largest driver up $5.7 billion or 12% with growth across a diverse array of industry verticals. Additionally, the student loans were up by $2.4 billion and guaranteed mortgages, nonguaranteed mortgages and indirect consumer all increased by around $1 billion. The overall portfolio growth was partially offset by intentional decline in home equity, commercial real estate and construction. The effects of this de-risking is shown on Slide 11. The portfolio that we've categorized as higher risk declined by another $0.5 billion this quarter. While we've continue to apply the high-risk label to this grouping of loans, I'd point out that 95% of this book is accruing. And of that, 90% is current on principal and on interest. The nonaccruing high-risk loans has been appropriate reserves for us and the accruing book looks a lot like the rest of our portfolio. For example, the weighted average referenced FICO scores of the high-risk mortgage and equity books are well above 700. Due to the improved performance of the higher risk about and its smaller absolute size, you ask can expect less above this portfolio in future quarters. You see in the bottom part of this page that the government guaranteed portfolio declined by $2.3 billion this quarter. This is largely due to the transfers to held-for-sale of $1.4 billion of student loans and $0.5 billion of Ginnie Mae loans. In the fourth quarter, we also expect a transfer to held-for-sale another approximately $600 million of student loans. This $600 million was included in the loan sales guidance that we gave in September, but did not meet the held-for-sale accounting criteria at quarter end. We do not expect the gain or loss associated with the fourth quarter transfer to be material. 
Let's take a look at Slide 12 for a review of credit trends. Overall, the credit story is again an improving one this quarter. Early stage delinquency ratios were relatively stable to the prior quarter. Consumer loan saw a normal seasonal increases, which were partially offset by declines in home equity delinquencies. Excluding government guaranteed loans, consumer and delinquency ratios were 58 and 18 basis points, respectively, which are at relatively low levels. As such and as is the case with most of our credit metrics, we would expect residential loans to draw in future improvements as residential delinquencies are still somewhat elevated by historical standards at just about 1%. Nonperforming assets and nonperforming loans were down by over $700 million from the prior quarter. A 30% sequential quarter decline in nonperforming loans was largely due to the $544 million sale of the mortgage and CRE NPLs. However, excluding these sales, NPL still declined by about $185 million or over 70%. This decline came despite our adding to NPL. For regulatory guidance, $81 million in junior lien loans are current on their payments but subordinate to delinquent mortgage. At quarter end, our ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans was 1.42%, down from 1.97% last quarter and 2.67% a year ago. This brought our allowance to NPL ratio up to 130%, a rise of 36 percentage points from the second quarter. 
Net charge-offs this quarter were $511 million as compared to $350 million last quarter. Included in this quarter's figure is the $172 million in net charge-offs associated with NPL sales and the $65 million from the junior lien credit policy change. Backing these 2 figures out, net charge-offs were $274 million, down $76 million sequentially. Four net charge-offs have printed favorably for some time, and we expect that overall trend to continue in the coming quarters. We could see some increase in the fourth quarter from this $274 million level though as a function of some normal seasonality and the fact that our recoveries were about $30 million higher this quarter than what we've experienced recently. The allowance for loan and lease losses end of the quarter at $2.2 billion, down about $60 million from the prior quarter due to the improving core credit quality trends. Despite the modest dollar decline and the allowance of this quarter, the allowance ratio remains essentially unchanged at 1.84% on a stated basis or just about 2% when excluding government guaranteed loans from the calculation. 
Taking a step back, when you take a look at what we have done to improve the risk profile of the organization over the last while, the last 2 slides make that real evident. We have been aggressively and intentionally reducing our high-risk book for several years. Those balances are down by $14.6 billion or more than 60% over the past few years. So our de-risking is largely complete. Nonperforming loans have been on a similar trajectory, down by $3.8 billion or almost 70% since their peak in 2009. And we took actions to further accelerate this decline this quarter as well as reduce our 90-day plus delinquency ratio. Overall, we have made meaningful and substantial strides that have resulted in a much improved risk profile for SunTrust. 
Let's next take a look at our deposit loan. Average deposit balances declined modestly from the prior quarter, and the favorable shift in deposit mix continues. Non-interest-bearing deposits were up $1.3 billion or 3%. This was essentially offset by $1.2 billion or 7% reduction in time deposits as we had an above average amount of DDA maturities during the third quarter. We also saw a modest decline in money market balances as we're being deliberate about pricing discipline and have let certain promotional rates expire. Relative to the prior year, deposits were up $2.4 billion or about 2%. Lower-cost accounts are in the driver of the growth, led by almost $6 billion or 19% DDA growth. Conversely, higher cost time deposits are down by $3.4 billion or 17%. 
Slide 14 provides information on our capital metrics. Tier 1 common capital increased by approximately $400 million. Recall that the September actions were essentially neutral to our regulatory capital level, so this quarter's increase is primarily driven by core earnings. The Tier 1 common ratio ended the quarter at an estimated 9.8%, up a healthy 40 basis points from last quarter. Our estimate for the Basel III Tier 1 common ratio, assuming that all the components of the Federal Reserve's recent notice of proposed rulemaking in their current form held relatively stable at 7.9%. 
As shown at the bottom of the page, the tangible common equity ratio increased by 16 basis points sequentially due to a reduction in the asset base, and tangible book value per share ended the quarter at $25.72, down 1% from the prior quarter as the modest tangible book value dilution associated with the September actions was largely offset by this quarter us core earning. 
With that, I will now turn things back over to Bill to cover the last few slides."

And during the third quarter, we achieved our PPG expense program target well ahead of schedule, realizing a little over $75 million in quarterly savings or obviously $300 million on an annualized run rate. The collective effort that got us here so quickly should not be minimized. A lot was accomplished in a relatively short period of time, and that's a result of our teammates intensity around delivering results. With that being said, it's not loss on me or anyone at SunTrust that we still have work to do. The PPG program served as a catalyst towards achieving our ultimate goal of the significantly improving the overall organization. It's been successful and not only garnering meaningful savings, but also in galvanizing our team in pursuit of our sub-60 efficiency ratio goal. 
So now that we've hit our PPG target, what kind of updates can we expect. Well, we're not going to roll out a new program with a new name nor do we publicly track our progress beyond the $300 million goal. But I will tell you that we're not finished in our efforts to improve our efficiency. As a matter fact, we're just getting started. And going forward, I want you to measure us by the same metric that we're holding ourselves accountable, our efficiency ratio. We have incorporated this metric into our incentive compensation plan. We have built a lot of intensity throughout the bank improving revenue and expense components of the calculation. So PPG was instrumental in getting us on the track, and we'll leverage that momentum as we go forward. 
Moving to the next slide and before we move into Q&A, I want to spend a few minutes highlighting the progress we've made from a business perspective. And consumer banking and private wealth management, we spent another quarter of solid loan production growth in the year-to-date volume 15% ahead of last year. Favorable deposit trends also continued as we generated year-over-year DDA growth of 14%. And though from a revenue perspective, this business continues to be challenged due to regulatory headwinds, we have reduced expenses here by about 3% last year. Clients are increasingly utilizing self-service channels, which is just one example that enabled us to make changes to our staffing model to improve our efficiency and effectiveness. Our wholesale business continues to deliver strong results with year-to-date net income nearly double what it was a year ago. Significant growth in capital markets fee, coupled with a higher net interest income drove wholesale revenue gains of 14% over the third quarter of last year. Loans were up 8% and Client deposits increased 5%. Furthermore,, our corporate investment banking business surpassed last quarter's revenue and net income levels marking yet another quarter of record performance. While the mortgage business reported a net loss, primarily due to the increase in mortgage repurchase reserve and the mortgage NPL sale, core trends continue to markedly improve. Year-to-date mortgage production volume was $24 billion, up nearly $8 billion or 48% from last year and core mortgage origination income was $460 million higher, more than 130% increase from last year. The elevated levels of refinance activity have certainly been beneficial to the business while we're also continued to develop resources to purchase activity, our core bread and butter business for us that we think will again be the primary driver of mortgage revenue when the refi volume eventually takes result. Additionally, we also focus on building a catalyst in driving while them with better channel selection to maximize ROI in the longer-term return profile for this business. So overall, this marked another quarter of positively trending core line of business performance. The diversity of our business mix has and will continue to benefit us as we go forward and I'm pleased with the high intensity level that which our team leaders and teammates are operating, focused on meeting our clients need and driving higher levels return of our shareholders. Kris, let me turn it back over to you and we'll take some questions."

Obviously, this quarter's efficiency ratio is a little lower. We were very clear internally that it wasn't mission accomplished.

We were very clear internally that it wasn't mission accomplished. If you think about our core expense base say over the last 6 quarters, it has been fairly stable $1.5 billion so the core expense base but the revenue sort of has gone from $2.2 billion to $2.4 billion. So you could say one side of the coin we expect to see more expense savings at this particular juncture. But we're had a couple of our by this mortgages and mortgage and CIB has been 2 of those examples, we're going to invest in right now because we see good revenue opportunities. So think about it some sort of context what's left, what are the opportunities. And in a pretty significant. We have a lot more to do in the consumer rationalization of our business, expands in layers, incentive efficiencies. You saw some of the charges we took for real estate, so we still have some other real estate opportunities. Core process, consolidation, shared services. I mean the list is actually fairly extensive. And while I said PPG was a start I meant that. It really sort of the ball rolling down the hill. I would tell may be some of them are low-lying fruit now we're going to to get a little higher in the tree but there are significant opportunities. Is it more expense or is it more revenue a lot of that will depend on the the market takes us. If refinance activity continues like we think it will in mortgage, it will be a little slower to get the down with that efficiency ratio. We continue to do what we've been able to do on the CIB. Similarly, it will take a little bit longer. Similarly I think I've been very clear saying that efficiency ratio versus just expense or just revenue initiatives. And I'm confident that we're on the path. I can't commit to the exact time line but I'm confident that we're on the path. If you look into our line of businesses, start looking of efficiency improvements within both and I think they're pretty good leading indicator of where we're going as a total company."

On the positive side, with continuing to manage down our non-deposit maturity rates. Obviously, in the compressed yield environment on liabilities, there's a decreasing opportunity there but we do have more CDs maturing $7 million CDs maturing the next 5 quarters between now and the end of next year. And as those renew, they will renew at lower yields. And against that, we're fighting against the challenging asset yield compressed environment. And as a reminder, we will have another step down as a result of swap rolling off in Q2 next year. So year-over-year, I would think of NII coming down overall, but we know still have some leverage to pull and we're working on those."

So there's a lot of different numbers in there and I would look for that line did also start to come down relatively quickly as we start thinking about 2013 now. And in fairness this number other numbers as well. I've been pretty clear in stating that are going to be conservative and taking some of these cost down. I mean, this was a very expensive system to build. We're really, really good at it. And so some of these hard cost and tracking is down, we're going to probably lag little bit. And I think that's the prudent way to do it. We don't want the truck ahead of the gas line so to speak. So were going to be probably a little bit conservative in bringing this down.

So obviously lag more refinanced, less repurchase. But what we're doing this is a fairly significant sort of redesign of the channels in the business as we're going through this. One of the real silver linings behind the HARP is it really is opportunity to build out our consumer direct channel. And that channel as a percent of our business a year ago was pretty small. It's about 10% of our business now, and it is a much more efficient part of a structure. So not only did you have a traditional tools we're going through a redesigned of the channel mix I'm actually fairly confident that come out of this will come out of this with a higher-margin business relative to how we entered this from the changes we are making now. I would also add one more point I'd also remind you that over the last little while, we have spent several tens of million of dollars around sent order, consulting cost around the independent workload review. And as you look out to next year, I would expect all of those costs to abate, and that will also provide a nice lift to the overall performance of the mortgage loan."

Let me just make a quick comment before we wrap up the call today. We have made significant progress add more favorably positioned the bank for the future. That's through specific actions we've taken during the quarter but really more broadly, through the benefits of some of our strategic operating decisions. We are building a more effective and efficient company, not only through expense savings but also in the way we're approaching revenue generation. A significant opportunity exist the loyalty that we have built and our team has the tools and training they need to uncover more client needs and further deepen those relationships. And that's not to say that the path ahead is not without its challenges, but there is a high level of intensity across of the organization translating opportunity and results. And I believe what we're focusing that energy and areas that can best impact bottom line performance.

In our normal fashion, I'm going to begin today's call with a brief overview of the quarter. After passing it to Aleem, I'll wrap up with an update on our expense saving program and provide some recent line of business highlights. 
First, I will begin by acknowledging there are a lot of moving parts this quarter. We have endeavored in our remarks today and throughout the presentation to provide you clarity on those items and how they impacted the results. Aleem will provide more details momentarily, and I think you'll see that we continued the trend of delivering improved core performance. Further, we're positioned to more favorably coming out of the quarter in large part due to the actions we announced in September. Our overall risk profiles improved, and our balance sheet is strengthened. This is highlighted by lower nonperforming and delinquent loans and a mortgage repurchase reserve that now fully covers estimated remaining losses on the pre-2009 vintage GSE loans. As you know, those are loans from which the vast majority of demands and losses have been generated, and we're able to accomplish all of this while continuing to grow our capital base this quarter. 
Now turning to the presentation. Slide 3 summarizes some of the key drivers of our third quarter results. Earnings per share was $1.98 with the actions we announced last month contributing $1.40 per share. The diversity of our revenue streams benefited us this quarter. Mortgage production was again strong and investment banking income also increased, while net interest income and margin were relatively stable to the prior quarter. Expenses were up on a reported basis, but excluding the non-core items, they were stable the last quarter and down from the prior year. As you're aware, this continues to be an area where we have lots of focus as we strive to achieve our ultimate goal of a sub-60 efficiency ratio. I'm going to talk more about this in context of our PPG program later in the call. 
Taking a look at the balance sheet. Overall loan growth was slower, but growth in targeted categories, particularly C&I, drove a nearly $1 billion increase in average performing loan balances over last quarter and a nearly $10 billion increase over last year. This more than offset certain real estate-related loans that we have been actively managing down. 
Now, on the deposit side, the favorable mix continued with average DDA growth of 3% from the prior quarter and 19% from the prior year. 
From a credit perspective, derisking of the balance sheet helped drive a 30% reduction in nonperforming loans over last quarter and a 47% decline from last year. 
And as I mentioned earlier, our capital position continued to increase with our Tier 1 common equity ratio estimated at 9.8%, up 40 basis points last quarter. 
All in all, we're continuing to demonstrate improved core performance. And that, coupled with proactive actions we took this quarter, positions us well for the future. 
I'm going to turn it over to Aleem, let him walk you through the details and I'll give you more -- and give you more clarity on the quarter's results. Aleem?"

After several noise-free quarters and consistently improving results, as Bill noted, we had a number of lumpy items that impacted the third quarter. So I'll spend a few minutes grounding you on them before we get to the -- into the operating results. 
If you turn to Slide 4, I'll start with an update on the items we preannounced in September. The acceleration of the agreement regarding our Coca-Cola shares generated $1.9 billion in securities gains, and the charitable contribution of 1 million Coke shares to the SunTrust Foundation resulted in the recognition of $38 million of expense. 
Our third quarter mortgage repurchase provision was $371 million. Consistent with last month's announcement, and as Bill noted earlier, we expect the resulting mortgage repurchase reserve to be sufficient to cover the estimated remaining losses from pre-2009 vintage loans sold to the GSEs. 
During the third quarter, we transferred to held for sale slightly over a $0.5 billion of nonperforming mortgage and commercial real estate loans. The total net charge-offs recognized in writing the loans down to disposition value was $172 million. The majority of the loan sales were completed during the third quarter with only about $40 million in net balances remaining to be sold this quarter. 
We also transferred to held for sale $1.4 billion of student loans and a $0.5 billion of delinquent Ginnie Mae loans. In doing so, we wrote these loans down to the expected sales price and the $92 million charge, most of which was associated with the delinquent Ginnie Mae loans, was a reduction to noninterest income. You will recall, the majority of the combined $1.9 billion in student and Ginnie Mae loans we're selling are more than 90 days delinquent. Their disposition reduces our delinquency ratio and makes the size of our government-guaranteed loan portfolio more consistent with our longer-term balance sheet target. All of the transferred loans were included in loans held for sale at quarter end. To date, in the fourth quarter, we've already sold $1 billion of student loans and we expect to complete the remaining student and Ginnie Mae sales by year end. 
We also transferred approximately $190 million of affordable housing investments to held for sale during the quarter. The $96 million write-down taken upon the transfer was recorded as a noninterest expense, and the resulted carrying value reflects our best estimate of the ultimate disposition price. We expect this sale will be completed in the second quarter of 2013. 
Combined, the preannounced items contributed $753 million in net income or $1.40 per common share to the third quarter results. This was exactly on our prior guidance. 
Shifting to the bottom portion of Slide 4, you see 4 other items. The first of which relates to a credit policy change. During the third quarter, we moved the timing of charge-off recognition for junior lien loans from 180 days to 120 days. Our analysis indicated that when junior liens go 120 days past due, they rarely cure and typically roll to 180 days. Accordingly, we altered our policy, which resulted in the accelerated recognition of $65 million in incremental net charge-offs in the quarter. For clarity, this is not related to the policy change other large banks made this quarter regarding the treatment of consumer loans that were not reaffirmed following Chapter 7 bankruptcy. We have not received such guidance from our regulator and have not taken any action in response. However, we are monitoring development. We do estimate that we have approximately $400 million of such loans, about 35% of which are already classified as performing TDRs. We expect to receive coordinated regulatory guidance on this issue and will take any appropriate action at that time. 
I'll cover the final 3 items on the page fairly quickly. I'm pleased to note that our credit spreads tightened considerably in the third quarter. Unfortunately, this also resulted in $41 million in mark-to-market losses on our fair value debt, which reduced noninterest income. Next, we accrued $29 million in severance expense associated with post-PPG efforts to streamline our organization and achieve our efficiency ratio objectives. And lastly, we incurred a $17 million expense associated with reassessments and ultimate reduction of our real estate needs. 
Slide 5 provides a summary income statement and the collective impact of the items that I just reviewed are impaired. Third quarter noninterest income was up substantially from prior quarters and the gain from the Coca-Cola transaction more than offset the increased mortgage repurchase provision, the write-down on the student and Ginnie Mae loan sales and the mark-to-market loss on the fair value debt. Provision for credit losses increased this quarter due to the NPL sales and the credit policy change. Expenses were higher due to the affordable write-- affordable housing write-down, the Coke shares donation, severance and the real estate charges. 
Looking at the bottom line, third quarter 2012 earnings per share of $1.98 was up markedly compared to the prior quarters. Obviously, a lot of the favorable variance is driven by the $1.40 per share impact of the September actions. After backing that out, this quarter's EPS of $0.58 continued our favorable core earning spend, and it compares favorably to the $0.39 from a year ago and the $0.50 from last quarter. 
Subsequent slides provide clearer views of our underlying trend. So let's turn to Slide 6 for a discussion of net interest income, which was $1.3 billion this quarter and the margin was 3.38%, both of which were down slightly from the prior quarter. Interest income from earning assets declined about $50 million sequentially. This was driven by 3 primary factors: first, we experienced 10 basis points of loan yield compression, mainly driven by mortgage and C&I as new loans that were originating are coming on the books at lower yields than those that are paying off; second, we saw a 38 basis point decline in our securities yield, which was largely attributable to the elimination of the $15 million quarterly Coke dividend; and lastly, we continue to modestly reduce the size of our bond portfolio in light of the lack of attractive investment alternative. 
On the liability side, interest expense declined sequentially by $44 million, and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities was managed down by 14 basis points. This was driven by the reduced funding needs associated with the smaller balance sheet, the previously announced redemption of $1.2 billion of higher cost trust preferred securities early in the quarter and the maturity of a population of higher-cost CDs, which helped drive the overall cost of time deposits down about 20 basis points. 
Relative to the prior year, net interest income was up modestly, and the margin declined 10 basis points. Key drivers were lower earning asset yields, higher loan balances and reduced interest costs associated with an improved deposit mix, lower deposit rates paid and the reduction in long-term debt. 
As we look to the fourth quarter, we expect to see a reduction in the net interest margin on the order of mid-single-digit basis points, driven by additional reductions in asset yields, which will partially be offset by lower liability costs. In the fourth quarter, we expect the reduction to net interest income as a result of the lower margin, coupled with our smaller balance sheet due to the closed and pending loan sales. 
Let's turn to Slide 7 for a discussion of noninterest income. As we discussed earlier, reported noninterest income was up substantially this quarter due to the favorable net impact associated with the September actions. As usual, we've also provided a view of our adjusted noninterest income, and we detailed the adjustments in the Appendix. The $216 million sequential quarter increase in the mortgage repurchase provision, which is booked as a contra-revenue drove the decline in adjusted noninterest income from the second quarter. Otherwise, fee income trends this quarter were solid. Most notable was core mortgage production. Excluding the impact of the repurchase provision, mortgage production income hit a record high this quarter and increased $49 million or almost 20% sequentially. Production volume was high and stable to the second quarter level of about $8 billion, which was split roughly 70-30 between refinancings and purchasing. 
Looking ahead, while it is reasonable to assume some volume and margin compression, we do expect overall conditions in the mortgage market to continue to remain favorable in the near term. 
Investment banking was another business that was up sequentially, driven by strong syndication volume. Conversely, the other charges and fee category declined as a result of lower commitment fees, and card fees fell due to a reclassification of card reward process costs. Relative to the prior year, adjusted noninterest income declined $111 million, driven by a $254 million increase in the mortgage repurchase provision. Apart from this, adjusted noninterest income increased $143 million or 15%. Similar to the sequential quarter comparisons, strong core mortgage production was the primary driver and higher investment banking revenue also contributed, driven by syndication and bond origination fees. Conversely, card fees declined, primarily due to the impacts of regulatory reform. 
Let's turn to Slide 8 to take a look at mortgage repurchases. For consistency's sake, we've continued to share with you the same layout of this page from prior quarters. But obviously, the important news on mortgage repurchase issue for us this quarter was contained within our September announcement. Specifically, as a result of additional information we received from both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, coupled with our own analysis of the patterns of demand and profile request, we were able to more precisely estimate the remaining losses on pre-2009 GSE loans, the population of loans that to date have accounted for about 95% of all repurchase losses. As such, we recorded a $371 million provision this quarter, and the resulting mortgage reserve, which you can see on the bottom left of this page, increased to $694 million. Looking forward, we expect this reserve level to decline as the losses are recognized. 
The top left portion of this slide shows that demand has declined $405 million this quarter, driven primarily by the 2006 to '08 vintages. Demand levels could continue to very in the coming quarters, however, the trends and full file requests precursors to future demands are improving in 2 ways: first, the absolute number of full file requests is declining. This suggests that, over time, we should begin seeing a decline in the overall level of demand; second, the percentage of full file requests for loans that have never been 120 days past due is increasing, and more recently, delinquent loans tend to have better cure rates. The pending demand population, which is displayed on the top right portion of this page increased to $690 million. This is due to the new demand and a modest extension of resolution time line. We continue to take a deliberate approach in reviewing repurchase demand, ensuring that we purchase loans where appropriate yet cure the defects or moderate losses wherever possible. Overall, and in line with what we said in September, the mortgage repurchase trends continue to play out in a manner consistent with our expectations and information we received from the agencies. 
Let's move on to expenses. Adjusted expenses were essentially stable to the prior quarter. Other real estate cost declined $22 million due to lower losses on disposition, and outside processing fell $9 million. These were offset by increases in employee compensation and FDIC premiums. The $18 million compensation increase was largely due to the accelerated vesting of deferred compensation associated with certain organizational changes, and to a lesser degree, higher contract labor costs. $7 million increase in our FDIC premium is due to quarterly variability in the assessment. Relative to the prior year, adjusted expenses declined $24 million or 2%, credit-related cost of decline driven by a combined $38 million reduction in other real estate and collection services expenses. FDIC premiums also fell by $13 million. Partially offsetting these reductions was an employee compensation and benefits increase of $30 million. This was in part due to the aforementioned accelerated vesting of certain deferred compensation, as well as an overall improvement in business performance. 
As we look to the fourth quarter, we currently expect our adjusted expenses to be flat to down. Particularly, high costs are expected to continue their overall declining trend and employee compensation is expected to decline. Conversely, certain volume and seasonally driven line items, for example, outside processing and advertising, may increase. 
Let's turn to the balance sheet on Slide 10. Average performing loans increased by about $900 million or 1%. Growth was driven again this quarter by C&I, which was up $1.1 billion or 2%, and came predominantly from large corporate clients with not-for-profit and auto dealer also contributing Period-end C&I growth was less robust than in recent quarters as we saw some slowing of loan demand due to borrowers' uncertainties associated with the economic environment and the fiscal cliff. This said, loan pipelines still remain fairly strong. I'll also point out that our corporate investment banking unit has benefited from the increased activity in the bond market by improving bond origination fees during the last couple of quarters. Relative to the prior year, performing loans increased by $9.5 billion or 8%. C&I was the largest driver, up $5.7 billion or 12%, with growth across a diverse array of industry verticals. Additionally, guaranteed student loans were up by $2.4 billion and guaranteed mortgages, non-guaranteed mortgages and indirect consumer all increased by around $1 billion. The overall portfolio growth was partially offset by intentional declines in home equity, commercial real estate and construction. The effects of this derisking are shown on Slide 11. 
The portfolios that we've categorized as higher risk declined by another $0.5 billion this quarter. While we've continued to apply the higher-risk label to this grouping of loans, I'd point out that 95% of this book is accruing. And of that, 98% is current on principal and interest. The non-accruing higher-risk loans have been appropriately reserved for and the accruing book looks a lot like the rest of our portfolio. For example, the weighted average refreshed FICO scores of the higher-risk mortgage and home equity books are well above 700. Due to the improved performance of the higher-risk book and its smaller absolute size, you can expect to hear less about this portfolio in future quarters. 
You see in the bottom part of this page that the government-guaranteed portfolio declined by $2.3 billion this quarter. This is largely due to the transfers to held for sale of $1.4 billion of student loans and $0.5 billion of Ginnie Mae loans. In the fourth quarter, we also expect a transfer to held for sale another approximately $600 million of student loans. This $600 million was included in the loan sale guidance that we gave in September, but did not meet the held for sale accounting criteria at quarter end. We do not expect the gain or loss associated with the fourth quarter transfer to be material. 
Let's take a look at Slide 12 for a review of credit trends. Overall, the credit story is again an improving one this quarter. Early-stage delinquency ratios were relatively stable to the prior quarter. Consumer loans saw a normal seasonal increases, which were partially offset by declines in home equity delinquencies. Excluding government-guaranteed loans, consumer and delinquency ratios were 58 and 18 basis points, respectively, which are at relatively low levels. As such, and as is the case with most of our credit metrics, we would expect residential loans to drive future improvements as residential delinquencies are still somewhat elevated by historical standards at just above 1%. 
Nonperforming assets and nonperforming loans were down by over $700 million from the prior quarter. A 30% sequential quarter decline in nonperforming loans was largely due to the $544 million sale of the mortgage and CRE NPLs. However, excluding these sales, NPLs still declined by about $185 million or over 7%. This decline came despite our adding to NPL. For regulatory guidance, $81 million in junior lien loans that are current on their payments, but subordinate to a delinquent risk mortgage. At quarter end, our ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans was 1.42%, down from 1.97% last quarter and 2.76% a year ago. This brought our allowance to NPL ratio up to 130%, a rise of 36 percentage points from the second quarter. 
Net charge-offs this quarter were $511 million as compared to $350 million last quarter. Included in this quarter's figure is the $172 million in net charge-offs associated with NPL sales and the $65 million from the junior lien credit policy change. Backing these 2 figures out, net charge-offs were $274 million, down $76 million sequentially. Core net charge-offs have trended favorably for some time and we expect that overall trend to continue in the coming quarters. We could see some increase in the fourth quarter from this $274 million level though as a function of some normal seasonality and the fact that our recoveries were about $30 million higher this quarter than what we've experienced recently. 
The allowance for loan and lease losses ended the quarter at $2.2 billion, down about $60 million from the prior quarter, due to the improving core credit quality trends. Despite the modest dollar decline and the allowance this quarter, the allowance ratio remained essentially unchanged at 1.84% on a stated basis or just above 2% when excluding government-guaranteed loans from the calculation. 
Taking a step back, when you take a look at what we have done to improve the risk profile of the organization over the last little while, the last 2 slides make that really evident. We've been aggressively and intentionally reducing our higher-risk book for several years. Those balances are down by $14.6 billion or more than 60% over the past few years, so our derisking is largely complete. Nonperforming loans have been on a similar trajectory, down by $3.8 billion or almost 70% since their peak in 2009. And we took actions to further accelerate this decline this quarter as well as reduce our 90-day plus delinquency ratio. Overall, we have made meaningful and substantial strides that have resulted in a much improved risk profile for SunTrust. 
Let's next take a look at our deposit performance. Average deposit balances declined modestly from the prior quarter and the favorable shift in deposit mix continued. Noninterest-bearing deposits were up $1.3 billion or 3%. This was essentially offset by $1.2 billion or 7% reduction in time deposits as we had an above average amount of CD maturities during the third quarter. We also saw a modest decline in money market balances as we're being deliberate about pricing discipline and have let certain promotional rates expire. Relative to the prior year, deposits are up $2.4 billion or about 2%. Lower-cost accounts are in the driver of the growth, led by almost $6 billion or 19% DDA growth. Conversely, higher-cost time deposits are down by $3.4 billion or 17%. 
Slide 14 provides information on our capital metrics. Tier 1 common capital increased by approximately $400 million. Recall that the September actions were essentially neutral to our regulatory capital level, so this quarter's increase is primarily driven by core earnings. The Tier 1 common ratio ended the quarter at an estimated 9.8%, up a healthy 40 basis points from last quarter. Our estimate for the Basel III Tier 1 common ratio, assuming that all the components of the Federal Reserve's recent notice of proposed rulemaking are implements in their current form, held relatively stable at 7.9%. 
As shown at the bottom of the page, the tangible common equity ratio increased by 16 basis points sequentially due to a reduction in the asset base, and tangible book value per share ended the quarter at $25.72, down 1% from the prior quarter as the modest tangible book value dilution associated with the September actions was largely offset by this quarter's core earnings. 
With that, I'll now turn things back over to Bill to cover the last few slides."

The collective",684,"Okay, and I'll move to Slide 15. And during the third quarter, we achieved our PPG expense program target well ahead of schedule, realizing a little over $75 million in quarterly savings or obviously $300 million on an annualized run rate. The collective efforts that got us here so quickly should not be minimized. A lot was accomplished in a relatively short period of time, and that's a result of our teammates' intensity around delivering results. But that being said, it's not lost on me or anyone at SunTrust that we still have work to do. The PPG program served as a catalyst towards achieving our ultimate goal of significantly improving the overall efficiency of the organization. It's been successful in not only garnering meaningful savings, but also in galvanizing our team in pursuit of our sub-60 efficiency ratio goal. 
So now that we've hit our PPG target, what kind of updates can you expect from here? Well, we're not going to roll out a new program with a new name nor will we publicly track our progress beyond the $300 million goal. But I will tell you that we're not finished in our efforts to improve our efficiency. As a matter fact, we're just getting started. And going forward, I want you to measure us by the same metric that we're holding ourselves accountable, our efficiency ratio. We've incorporated this metric into our incentive compensation plans. We've built a lot of intensity throughout the bank, around improving both the revenue and expense components of the calculation. So PPG was instrumental in getting us on the track and we'll leverage that momentum as we go forward. 
Now moving to the next slide, and before we move into Q&A, I want to spend a few minutes highlighting the progress we've made from a line-of-business perspective. 
In Consumer Banking and Private Wealth Management, we've had another quarter of solid loan production growth with year-to-date volume 15% ahead of last year. Favorable deposit trends also continued as we generated year-over-year DDA growth of 14%. And though from a revenue perspective, this business continues to be challenged due to regulatory headwinds, we have reduced expenses here by 3% from last year. Clients are increasingly utilizing self-service channels, which is just one example that enabled us to make changes to our staffing model to improve our efficiency and effectiveness. Our Wholesale business continues to deliver strong results with year-to-date net income nearly double what it was a year ago. Significant growth in capital markets fees, coupled with a higher net interest income, drove Wholesale revenue gains of 14% over the third quarter of last year. Loans were up 8% and client deposits increased 5%. Furthermore, our Corporate Investment Banking business surpassed last quarter's revenue and net income levels, marking yet another quarter of record performance. While the Mortgage business reported a net loss, primarily due to the increase in the mortgage repurchase reserve and the mortgage NPL sale, core trends continued to markedly improve. Year-to-date mortgage production volume was $24 billion, up nearly $8 billion or 48% from last year and core mortgage origination income was $460 million higher, more than 130% increase from last year. The elevated levels of refinance activity have certainly been beneficial to the business while we're also continuing to devote resources to purchase activity, a core bread-and-butter business for us, and one that we think will again be the primary driver of mortgage revenue when the refi volume eventually tapers off. Additionally, we're also focused on building out channels and driving volume with better channel selection to maximize ROI and the longer-term return profile for this business. 
So overall, this marked another quarter of positively trending core line of business performance. The diversity of our business mix has and will continue to benefit us as we go forward, and I'm pleased with the heightened intensity level at which our leaders and teammates are operating, focused on meeting our clients' needs and driving higher levels of return for our shareholders. 
So Kris, let me turn it back over to you, and we'll take some questions."

We were very clear internally that it wasn't mission accomplished. If you think about our core expense base, say, over the last 6 quarters, it's been fairly stable, so call it sort of $1.5 billion sort of core expense base. But the revenue sort of has gone from about $2.2 billion to about $2.4 billion. So you could say one side of the coin was we'd expect to see more expense savings at this particular juncture. But we've had a couple of our businesses, mortgages and -- mortgage and CIB has been sort of 2 of the examples that we're going to invest in right now because we see good revenue opportunities. So think about it sort of from that context. So what's left, I mean what are the opportunities? I mean, the list is pretty significant. We have a lot more to do in the consumer rationalization of our business spans and layers, incentive efficiencies. You saw some of the charges we took for real estate, so we still have some other real estate opportunities. Core process, consolidation, shared services. I mean, the list is actually fairly extensive. And while I said PPG was the start, I mean I meant that. I mean, it really sort of got the ball rolling down the hill. I would call that maybe some of the more low-lying fruit. Now, we're going to get a little higher in the tree. But there are significant opportunities. Is it more expense or is it more revenue? A lot of that'll depend on where the market takes us. If refinance activity continues like we think it will in Mortgage, it'll be a little slower to get down to that efficiency ratio. We continue to do what we've been able to do on the CIB side. Similarly, it'll take a little bit longer. So I think it's -- and we've been very clear about saying it's the efficiency ratio versus just expense or just revenue initiatives. And I'm confident that we're on the path. I can't commit to the exact time line, but I'm confident we're on the path. And if you look into our line of businesses, start looking at the efficiency improvements within those and I think they're pretty good leading indicators of where we're going as a total company."

So full year I would think of as being lower next year than this year. There's some positives and negatives there. On the positive side, we are continuing to manage down our non-deposit maturity rates. Obviously, in the compressed yield environment on liabilities, there's a decreasing opportunity there, but we do have more CDs maturing. We have about $7 million of CDs maturing during the next 5 quarters, between now and the end of next year. And as those renew, they will renew at lower yields. And against that, we're fighting against the challenging asset yield compression environment. And as a reminder, we will have another step-down as a result of swaps rolling off in Q2 next year. So year-over-year, I would think of NII coming down overall, but we know we still have some leverage to pull and we're working on those."

I don't know that there's a trigger point that I could point you to, but I think there are sort of several things that you could look at, the improvements that we've made over the last couple of years, particularly some of the actions that we took this quarter also. The sale of some of our NPL loans, the sale of the Ginnie Maes, that should help also reduce some of those credit and collection costs going forward. Those are very labor-intensive loans to attempt to collect and work on over time. So I think -- we would think of that as a little bit of a trigger point. And in operating losses, there are a lot of numbers built into there -- built into that, that includes operational losses, that includes broad losses, it includes items we've got in there to build up litigation reserves. There are a lot of different numbers in there and I would look for that line to also start to come down relatively quickly as we start to think about 2013 now. And in fairness, it's not all these numbers and other numbers as well. But I've been pretty clear in stating that we're going to be conservative in taking some of these costs down. I mean, this was a very expensive system to build. We're really, really good at it. And so some of these hard costs and tracking this down, we're going to probably lag a little bit. And I think that's the prudent way to do it. We don't want the trucks ahead of the gas line, so to speak. So we're going to be probably a little bit conservative in bringing these down. And think about it, a lot of the costs are related to this. They just happened in the third quarter.

So obviously, lag more refinanced and less for purchased. But what we're doing is a fairly significant sort of redesign of the channels in the business as we're going through this. One of the real silver linings behind the HARP is where it really has afforded us the opportunity to build out our consumer direct channel. And that channel, as a percent of our business a year ago, was pretty small. It's about 10% of our business now and it is a much more efficient part of a structure.

When that starts to change, they look at their, sort of as a general comment, they're more deleveraged than they were before. I think this just tries to unlock some of that consumer confidence. We're still more tied to employment than housing values, but that's also seeing some positive trajectory. I mean, take -- use Florida as an example. While still above the national average, the improvement in Florida and unemployment's gone from 10.6 to 8.7. So the largest probably percent of improvement, coupled with housing values, I mean I think it's really a consumer confidence game in terms of the opportunity for us. And we feel it. 
Let me just make a quick comment before we wrap up the call today. We've made significant progress and more favorably positioning the bank through -- for the future. That's through specific actions we've taken during the quarter, but really more broadly, through the benefits of some of our strategic operating decisions. We are building a more effective and efficient company, not only through expense savings, but also in the way that we're approaching revenue generation. A significant opportunity exists to leverage the loyalty that we've built, and our team has the tools and training they need to uncover more client needs and further deepen those relationships. And that's not to say that the path ahead is not without its challenges. But there is a high level of intensity across the organization around translating opportunity and the results. And I believe we're focusing that energy in areas that can best impact bottom line performance. So with that said, thank you for joining us today and please reach out to our Investor Relations team with any other questions you may have."

In our normal fashion, I'm going to begin today's call with a brief overview of the quarter. After passing it to Aleem, I'll wrap up with an update on our expense saving program and provide some recent line of business highlights. 
First, I'll begin by acknowledging there are a lot of moving parts this quarter. We have endeavored in our remarks today and throughout the presentation to provide you clarity on those items and how they impacted the results. Aleem will provide more details momentarily, and I think you'll see that we continued the trend of delivering improved core performance. Further, we're positioned to more favorably coming out of the quarter in large part due to the actions we announced in September. Our overall risk profiles improved, and our balance sheet is strengthened. This is highlighted by lower nonperforming and delinquent loans and a mortgage repurchase reserve that now fully covers estimated remaining losses on the pre-2009 vintage GSE loans. As you know, those are the loans from which the vast majority of demands and losses have been generated, and we're able to accomplish all of this while continuing to grow our capital base this quarter. 
Now turning to the presentation. Slide 3 summarizes some of the key drivers of our third quarter results. Earnings per share was $1.98 with the actions we announced last month contributing $1.40 per share. The diversity of our revenue streams benefited us this quarter. Mortgage production was again strong and investment banking income also increased, while net interest income and margin were relatively stable to the prior quarter. Expenses were up on a reported basis, but excluding the non-core items, they were stable the last quarter and down from the prior year. As you're aware, this continues to be an area where we have lots of focus as we strive to achieve our ultimate goal of a sub-60 efficiency ratio. I'm going to talk more about this in context of our PPG program later in the call. 
Taking a look at the balance sheet. Overall loan growth was slower, but growth in targeted categories, particularly C&I, drove a nearly $1 billion increase in average performing loan balances over last quarter and a nearly $10 billion increase over last year. This more than offset certain real estate-related loans that we have been actively managing down. 
Now on the deposit side, the favorable mix continued with average DDA growth of 3% from the prior quarter and 19% from the prior year. 
From a credit perspective, derisking of the balance sheet helped drive a 30% reduction in nonperforming loans over last quarter and a 47% decline from last year. 
And as I mentioned earlier, our capital position continued to increase with our Tier 1 common equity ratio estimated at 9.8%, up 40 basis points from last quarter. 
All in all, we're continuing to demonstrate improved core performance. And that, coupled with proactive actions we took this quarter, positions us well for the future. 
I'm going to turn it over to Aleem, let him walk you through the details and I'll give you more -- and give you more clarity on the quarter's results. Aleem?"

After several noise-free quarters and consistently improving results, as Bill noted, we had a number of lumpy items that impacted the third quarter. So I'll spend a few minutes grounding you on them before we get to the -- in the operating results. 
If you turn to Slide 4, I'll start with an update on the items we preannounced in September. The acceleration of the agreement regarding our Coca-Cola shares generated $1.9 billion in securities gains, and the charitable contribution of 1 million Coke shares to the SunTrust Foundation resulted in the recognition of $38 million of expense. 
Our third quarter mortgage repurchase provision was $371 million. Consistent with last month's announcement, and as Bill noted earlier, we expect the resulting mortgage repurchase reserve to be sufficient to cover the estimated remaining losses from pre-2009 vintage loans sold to the GSEs. 
During the third quarter, we transferred to held for sale slightly over $0.5 billion of nonperforming mortgage and commercial real estate loans. The total net charge-offs recognized in writing the loans down to disposition value was $172 million. The majority of the loan sales were completed during the third quarter with only about $40 million in net balances remaining to be sold this quarter. 
We also transferred to held for sale $1.4 billion of student loans and $0.5 billion of delinquent Ginnie Mae loans. In doing so, we wrote these loans down to the expected sales price and the $92 million charge, most of which was associated with the delinquent Ginnie Mae loans, was a reduction to noninterest income. You will recall, the majority of the combined $1.9 billion in student and Ginnie Mae loans we're selling are more than 90 days delinquent. Their disposition reduces our delinquency ratio and makes the size of our government-guaranteed loan portfolio more consistent with our longer-term balance sheet targets. All of the transferred loans were included in loans held for sale at quarter end. To date, in the fourth quarter, we've already sold $1 billion of student loans and we expect to complete the remaining student and Ginnie Mae sales by year end. 
We also transferred approximately $190 million of affordable housing investments to held for sale during the quarter. The $96 million write-down taken upon the transfer was recorded as a noninterest expense, and the resultant carrying value reflects our best estimate of the ultimate disposition price. We expect this sale will be completed in the second quarter of 2013. 
Combined, the preannounced items contributed $753 million in net income or $1.40 per common share to the third quarter results. This was exactly on our prior guidance. 
Shifting to the bottom portion of Slide 4, you see 4 other items, the first of which relates to a credit policy change. During the third quarter, we moved the timing of charge-off recognition for junior lien loans from 180 days to 120 days. Our analysis indicated that when junior lien loans go 120 days past due, they rarely cure and typically roll to 180 days. Accordingly, we altered our policy, which resulted in the accelerated recognition of $65 million in incremental net charge-offs in the quarter. For clarity, this is not related to the policy change other large banks made this quarter regarding the treatment of consumer loans that were not reaffirmed following Chapter 7 bankruptcy. We have not received such guidance from our regulator and have not taken any action in response. However, we are monitoring developments. We do estimate that we have approximately $400 million of such loans, about 35% of which are already classified as performing TDRs. We expect to receive coordinated regulatory guidance on this issue and will take any appropriate action at that time. 
I'll cover the final 3 items on the page fairly quickly. I'm pleased to note that our credit spreads tightened considerably in the third quarter. Unfortunately, this also resulted in $41 million in mark-to-market losses on our fair value debt, which reduced noninterest income. Next, we accrued $29 million in severance expense associated with post-PPG efforts to streamline our organization and achieve our efficiency ratio objectives. And lastly, we incurred a $17 million expense associated with reassessments and ultimate reduction of our real estate needs. 
Slide 5 provides a summary income statement and the collective impact of the items that I just reviewed are apparent. Third quarter noninterest income was up substantially from prior quarters and the gain from the Coca-Cola transaction more than offset the increased mortgage repurchase provision, the write-down on the student and Ginnie Mae loan sales and the mark-to-market loss on the fair value debt. Provision for credit losses increased this quarter due to the NPL sales and the credit policy change. Expenses were higher due to the affordable write-- affordable housing write-down, the Coke shares donation, severance and the real estate charges. 
Looking at the bottom line, third quarter 2012 earnings per share of $1.98 is up markedly compared to the prior quarters. Obviously, a lot of the favorable variance is driven by the $1.40 per share impact of the September actions. After backing that out, this quarter's EPS of $0.58 continued our favorable core earnings trends, and it compares favorably to the $0.39 from a year ago and the $0.50 from last quarter. 
Subsequent slides provide clearer views of our underlying trends. So let's turn to Slide 6 for a discussion of net interest income, which was $1.3 billion this quarter and the margin was 3.38%, both of which were down slightly from the prior quarter. Interest income from earning assets declined about $50 million sequentially. This was driven by 3 primary factors: first, we experienced 10 basis points of loan yield compression, mainly driven by mortgage and C&I as new loans that we're originating are coming on the books at lower yields than those that are paying off; second, we saw a 38-basis point decline in our securities yield, which was largely attributable to the elimination of the $15 million quarterly Coke dividend; and lastly, we continue to modestly reduce the size of our bond portfolio in light of the lack of attractive investment alternatives. 
On the liability side, interest expense declined sequentially by $44 million, and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities was managed down by 14 basis points. This was driven by the reduced funding needs associated with the smaller balance sheet, the previously announced redemption of $1.2 billion of higher cost trust preferred securities early in the quarter and the maturity of a population of higher-cost CDs, which helped drive the overall cost of time deposits down about 20 basis points. 
Relative to the prior year, net interest income was up modestly, and the margin declined 10 basis points. Key drivers were lower earning asset yields, higher loan balances and reduced interest costs associated with an improved deposit mix, lower deposit rates paid and a reduction in long-term debt. 
As we look to the fourth quarter, we expect to see a reduction in the net interest margin on the order of mid-single digit basis points, driven by additional reductions in asset yields, which will partially be offset by lower liability costs. In the fourth quarter, we expect a reduction to net interest income as a result of the lower margin, coupled with our smaller balance sheet due to the closed and pending loan sales. 
Let's turn to Slide 7 for a discussion of noninterest income. As we discussed earlier, reported noninterest income was up substantially this quarter due to the favorable net impact associated with the September actions. As usual, we've also provided a view of our adjusted noninterest income, and we detail the adjustments in the Appendix. The $216 million sequential quarter increase in the mortgage repurchase provision, which is booked as a contra-revenue drove the decline in adjusted noninterest income from the second quarter. Otherwise, fee income trends this quarter were solid. Most notable was core mortgage production. Excluding the impact of the repurchase provision, mortgage production income hit a record high this quarter and increased $49 million or almost 20% sequentially. Production volume was high and stable to the second quarter level of about $8 billion, which was split roughly 70-30 between refinancings and purchases. 
Looking ahead, while it is reasonable to assume some volume and margin compression, we do expect overall conditions in the mortgage market to continue to remain favorable in the near term. 
Investment banking was another business that was up sequentially, driven by strong syndication volume. Conversely, the other charges and fee category declined as a result of lower commitment fees, and card fees fell due to a reclassification of card rewards costs. Relative to the prior year, adjusted noninterest income declined $111 million, driven by a $254 million increase in the mortgage repurchase provision. Apart from this, adjusted noninterest income increased $143 million or 15%. Similar to the sequential quarter comparisons, strong core mortgage production was the primary driver and higher investment banking revenue also contributed, driven by syndication and bond origination fees. Conversely, card fees declined, primarily due to the impacts of regulatory reform. 
Let's turn to Slide 8 to take a look at mortgage repurchases. For consistency's sake, we've continued to share with you the same layout of this page from prior quarters. But obviously, the important news on the mortgage repurchase issue for us this quarter was contained within our September announcement. Specifically, as a result of additional information we received from both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, coupled with our own analysis of the patterns of demands and full file requests, we were able to more precisely estimate the remaining losses on pre-2009 GSE loans, the population of loans that to date have accounted for about 95% of all repurchase losses. As such, we recorded a $371 million provision this quarter, and the resulting mortgage reserve, which you can see on the bottom left of this page, increased to $694 million. Looking forward, we expect this reserve level to decline as the losses are recognized. 
The top left portion of this slide shows that demand has declined to $405 million this quarter, driven primarily by the 2006 to '08 vintages. Demand levels could continue to vary in the coming quarters; however, the trends and full file requests precursors to future demands are improving in 2 ways: first, the absolute number of full file requests is declining. This suggests that, over time, we should begin seeing a decline in the overall level of demands; second, the percentage of full file requests for loans that have never been 120 days past due is increasing, and more recently, delinquent loans tend to have better cure rates. The pending demand population, which is displayed on the top right portion of this page increased to $690 million. This is due to the new demands and a modest extension of resolution time lines. We continue to take a deliberate approach in reviewing repurchase demands, ensuring that we repurchase loans where appropriate yet cure the defects or moderate losses wherever possible. Overall, and in line with what we said in September, the mortgage repurchase trends continue to play out in a manner consistent with our expectations and information we receive from the agencies. 
Let's move on to expenses. Adjusted expenses were essentially stable to the prior quarter. Other real estate costs declined $22 million due to lower losses on disposition, and outside processing fell $9 million. These were offset by increases in employee compensation and FDIC premiums. The $18 million compensation increase was largely due to the accelerated vesting of deferred compensation associated with certain organizational changes and, to a lesser degree, higher contract labor costs. $7 million increase in our FDIC premium is due to quarterly variability in the assessment rate. Relative to the prior year, adjusted expenses declined $24 million or 2%, credit-related costs declined driven by a combined $38 million reduction in other real estate and collection services expenses. FDIC premiums also fell by $13 million. Partially offsetting these reductions was an employee compensation and benefits increase of $30 million. This was in part due to the aforementioned accelerated vesting of certain deferred compensation, as well as an overall improvement in business performance. 
As we look to the fourth quarter, we currently expect our adjusted expenses to be flat to down. Cyclically, high costs are expected to continue their overall declining trend and employee compensation is expected to decline. Conversely, certain volume and seasonally driven line items, for example, outside processing and advertising, may increase. 
Let's turn to the balance sheet on Slide 10. Average performing loans increased by about $900 million or 1%. Growth was driven again this quarter by C&I, which was up $1.1 billion or 2%, and came predominantly from large corporate clients with not-for-profit and auto dealer also contributing. Period-end C&I growth was less robust than in recent quarters as we saw some slowing of loan demand due to borrowers' uncertainties associated with the economic environment and the fiscal cliff. This said, loan pipelines still remain fairly strong. I'll also point out that our corporate investment banking unit has benefited from the increased activity in the bond market via improving bond origination fees during the last couple of quarters. Relative to the prior year, performing loans increased by $9.5 billion or 8%. C&I was the largest driver, up $5.7 billion or 12%, with growth across a diverse array of industry verticals. Additionally, guaranteed student loans were up by $2.4 billion and guaranteed mortgages, non-guaranteed mortgages and indirect consumer all increased by around $1 billion. The overall portfolio growth was partially offset by intentional declines in home equity, commercial real estate and construction. The effects of this derisking are shown on Slide 11. 
The portfolios that we've categorized as higher risk declined by another $0.5 billion this quarter. While we've continued to apply the higher-risk label to this grouping of loans, I'd point out that 95% of this book is accruing. And of that, 98% is current on principal and interest. The non-accruing high-risk loans have been appropriately reserved for and the accruing book looks a lot like the rest of our portfolio. For example, the weighted average refreshed FICO scores of the higher-risk mortgage and home equity books are well above 700. Due to the improved performance of the higher-risk book and its smaller absolute size, you can expect to hear less about this portfolio in future quarters. 
You see in the bottom part of this page that the government-guaranteed portfolio declined by $2.3 billion this quarter. This is largely due to the transfers to held for sale of $1.4 billion of student loans and $0.5 billion of Ginnie Mae loans. In the fourth quarter, we also expect to transfer to held for sale another approximately $600 million of student loans. This $600 million was included in the loan sale guidance that we gave in September, but did not meet the held for sale accounting criteria at quarter end. We do not expect the gain or loss associated with the fourth quarter transfer to be material. 
Let's take a look at Slide 12 for a review of credit trends. Overall, the credit story is again an improving one this quarter. Early-stage delinquency ratios were relatively stable to the prior quarter. Consumer loans saw normal seasonal increases, which were partially offset by declines in home equity delinquencies. Excluding government-guaranteed loans, consumer and commercial delinquency ratios were 58 and 18 basis points, respectively, which are at relatively low levels. As such, and as is the case with most of our credit metrics, we would expect residential loans to drive future improvements as residential delinquencies are still somewhat elevated by historical standards at just above 1%. 
Nonperforming assets and nonperforming loans were down by over $700 million from the prior quarter. A 30% sequential quarter decline in nonperforming loans was largely due to the $544 million sale of the mortgage and CRE NPLs. However, excluding these sales, NPLs still declined by about $185 million or over 7%. This decline came despite our adding to NPL, for regulatory guidance, $81 million in junior lien loans that are current on their payments but subordinate to a delinquent risk mortgage. At quarter end, our ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans was 1.42%, down from 1.97% last quarter and 2.76% a year ago. This brought our allowance to NPL ratio up to 130%, a rise of 36 percentage points from the second quarter. 
Net charge-offs this quarter were $511 million as compared to $350 million last quarter. Included in this quarter's figure is the $172 million in net charge-offs associated with the NPL sales and the $65 million from the junior lien credit policy change. Backing these 2 figures out, net charge-offs were $274 million, down $76 million sequentially. Core net charge-offs have trended favorably for some time and we expect that overall trend to continue in the coming quarters. We could see some increase in the fourth quarter from this $274 million level though as a function of some normal seasonality and the fact that our recoveries were about $30 million higher this quarter than what we've experienced recently. 
The allowance for loan and lease losses ended the quarter at $2.2 billion, down about $60 million from the prior quarter, due to the improving core credit quality trends. Despite the modest dollar decline in the allowance this quarter, the allowance ratio remained essentially unchanged at 1.84% on a stated basis or just above 2% when excluding government-guaranteed loans from the calculation. 
Taking a step back, when you take a look at what we have done to improve the risk profile of the organization over the last little while, the last 2 slides make that really evident. We've been aggressively and intentionally reducing our higher-risk book for several years. Those balances are down by $14.6 billion or more than 60% over the past few years, so our derisking is largely complete. Nonperforming loans have been on a similar trajectory, down by $3.8 billion or almost 70% since their peak in 2009. And we took actions to further accelerate this decline this quarter as well as reduce our 90-day plus delinquency ratio. Overall, we have made meaningful and substantial strides that have resulted in a much improved risk profile for SunTrust. 
Let's next take a look at our deposit performance. Average deposit balances declined modestly from the prior quarter and the favorable shift in deposit mix continued. Noninterest-bearing deposits were up $1.3 billion or 3%. This was essentially offset by a $1.2 billion or 7% reduction in time deposits as we had an above average amount of CD maturities during the third quarter. We also saw a modest decline in money market balances as we're being deliberate about pricing discipline and have let certain promotional rates expire. Relative to the prior year, deposits are up $2.4 billion or about 2%. Lower-cost accounts are the driver of the growth, led by almost $6 billion or 19% DDA growth. Conversely, higher-cost time deposits are down by $3.4 billion or 17%. 
Slide 14 provides information on our capital metrics. Tier 1 common capital increased by approximately $400 million. Recall that the September actions were essentially neutral to our regulatory capital level, so this quarter's increase is primarily driven by core earnings. The Tier 1 common ratio ended the quarter at an estimated 9.8%, up a healthy 40 basis points from last quarter. Our estimate for the Basel III Tier 1 common ratio, assuming that all the components of the Federal Reserve's recent notice of proposed rulemaking are implemented in their current form, held relatively stable at 7.9%. 
As shown at the bottom of the page, the tangible common equity ratio increased by 16 basis points sequentially due to a reduction in the asset base, and tangible book value per share ended the quarter at $25.72, down 1% from the prior quarter as the modest tangible book value dilution associated with the September actions was largely offset by this quarter's core earnings. 
With that, I'll now turn things back over to Bill to cover the last few slides."

And during the third quarter, we achieved our PPG expense program target well ahead of schedule, realizing a little over $75 million in quarterly savings or obviously $300 million on an annualized run rate. The collective efforts that got us here so quickly should not be minimized. A lot was accomplished in a relatively short period of time, and that's a result of our teammates' intensity around delivering results. But that being said, it's not lost on me or anyone at SunTrust that we still have work to do. The PPG program served as a catalyst towards achieving our ultimate goal of significantly improving the overall efficiency of the organization. It's been successful in not only garnering meaningful savings, but also in galvanizing our team in pursuit of our sub-60 efficiency ratio goal. 
So now that we've hit our PPG target, what kind of updates can you expect from here? Well, we're not going to roll out a new program with a new name nor will we publicly track our progress beyond the $300 million goal. But I will tell you that we're not finished in our efforts to improve our efficiency. As a matter of fact, we're just getting started. And going forward, I want you to measure us by the same metric that we're holding ourselves accountable, our efficiency ratio. We've incorporated this metric into our incentive compensation plans. We've built a lot of intensity throughout the bank, around improving both the revenue and expense components of the calculation. So PPG was instrumental in getting us on the track and we'll leverage that momentum as we go forward. 
Now moving to the next slide, and before we move into Q&A, I want to spend a few minutes highlighting the progress we've made from a line-of-business perspective. 
In Consumer Banking and Private Wealth Management, we've had another quarter of solid loan production growth with year-to-date volume 15% ahead of last year. Favorable deposit trends also continued as we generated year-over-year DDA growth of 14%. And though from a revenue perspective, this business continues to be challenged due to regulatory headwinds, we have reduced expenses here by 3% from last year. Clients are increasingly utilizing self-service channels, which, as just one example, has enabled us to make changes to our staffing model to improve our efficiency and effectiveness. Our Wholesale business continues to deliver strong results with year-to-date net income nearly double what it was a year ago. Significant growth in capital markets fees, coupled with a higher net interest income, drove Wholesale revenue gains of 14% over the third quarter of last year. Loans were up 8% and client deposits increased 5%. Furthermore, our Corporate Investment Banking business surpassed last quarter's revenue and net income levels, marking yet another quarter of record performance. While the Mortgage business reported a net loss, primarily due to the increase in the mortgage repurchase reserve and the mortgage NPL sale, core trends continued to markedly improve. Year-to-date mortgage production volume was $24 billion, up nearly $8 billion or 48% from last year and core mortgage origination income was $460 million higher, more than 130% increase from last year. The elevated levels of refinance activity have certainly been beneficial to the business while we're also continuing to devote resources to purchase activity, a core bread-and-butter business for us, and one that we think will again be the primary driver of mortgage revenue when the refi volume eventually tapers off. Additionally, we're also focused on building out channels and driving volume with better channel selection to maximize ROI and the longer-term return profile for this business. 
So overall, this marked another quarter of positively trending core line of business performance. The diversity of our business mix has and will continue to benefit us as we go forward, and I'm pleased with the heightened intensity level at which our leaders and teammates are operating, focused on meeting our clients' needs and driving higher levels of return for our shareholders. 
So Kris, let me turn it back over to you, and we'll take some questions."

Obviously, this quarter's efficiency ratio is a little lower. We were very clear internally that it wasn't mission accomplished. If you think about our core expense base, say, over the last 6 quart",406,"Yes, so to start with, I think you've got it figured out. Obviously, this quarter's efficiency ratio is a little lower. We were very clear internally that it wasn't mission accomplished. If you think about our core expense base, say, over the last 6 quarters, it's been fairly stable, so call it sort of $1.5 billion sort of core expense base. But the revenue sort of has gone from about $2.2 billion to about $2.4 billion. So you could say one side of the coin was we'd expect to see more expense savings at this particular juncture. But we've had a couple of our businesses, mortgages and -- mortgage and CIB has been sort of 2 of the examples that we're going to invest in right now because we see good revenue opportunities. So think about it sort of from that context. So what's left, I mean what are the opportunities? I mean, the list is pretty significant. We have a lot more to do in the consumer rationalization of our business spans and layers, incentive efficiencies. You saw some of the charges we took for real estate, so we still have some other real estate opportunities. Core process, consolidation, shared services. I mean, the list is actually fairly extensive. And while I said PPG was the start, I mean I meant that. I mean, it really sort of got the ball rolling down the hill. I would call that maybe some of the more low-lying fruit. Now we're going to get a little higher in the tree. But there are significant opportunities. Is it more expense or is it more revenue? A lot of that'll depend on where the market takes us. If refinance activity continues like we think it will in Mortgage, it'll be a little slower to get down to that efficiency ratio. We continue to do what we've been able to do on the CIB side. Similarly, it'll take a little bit longer. So I think it's -- and we've been very clear about saying it's the efficiency ratio versus just expense or just revenue initiatives. And I'm confident that we're on the path. I can't commit to the exact time line, but I'm confident we're on the path. And if you look into our line of businesses, start looking at the efficiency improvements within those and I think they're pretty good leading indicators of where we're going as a total company."

So full year I would think of as being lower next year than this year. There's some positives and negatives there. On the positive side, we are continuing to manage down our non-deposit maturity rates. Obviously, in the compressed yield environment on liabilities, there's a decreasing opportunity there, but we do have more CDs maturing. We have about $7 billion of CDs maturing during the next 5 quarters, between now and the end of next year. And as those renew, they will renew at lower yields. And against that, we're fighting against the challenging asset yield compression environment. And as a reminder, we will have another step-down as a result of swaps rolling off in Q2 next year. So year-over-year, I would think of NII coming down overall, but we know we still have some levers to pull and we're working on those."

I don't know that there's a trigger point that I could point you to, but I think there are sort of several things that you could look at, the improvements that we've made over the last couple of years, particularly some of the actions that we took this quarter also. The sale of some of our NPL loans, the sale of the Ginnie Maes, that should help also reduce some of those credit and collection costs going forward. Those are very labor-intensive loans to attempt to collect and work on over time. So I think -- we would think of that as a little bit of a trigger point. And in operating losses, there are a lot of numbers built into there -- built into that, that includes operational losses, that includes broad losses, it includes items we've got in there to build up litigation reserves. There are a lot of different numbers in there and I would look for that line to also start to come down relatively quickly as we start to think about 2013 now. And in fairness, it's not all these numbers and it's other numbers as well. But I've been pretty clear in stating that we're going to be conservative in taking some of these costs down. I mean, this was a very expensive system to build. We're really, really good at it. And so some of these hard costs and tracking this down, we're going to probably lag a little bit. And I think that's the prudent way to do it. We don't want the trucks ahead of the gas line, so to speak. So we're going to be probably a little bit conservative in bringing these down.

But in the very short term, the next quarter or 2, while we are -- while we do have some fairly strong pipeline, it does feel like a lot of clients are being very cautious about adding new debt levels to their balance sheet and it's a bit of a challenge out there. It's a bit of a fight every day as we look to try and service our clients and grow assets that we have from here. I would look for growth. I would look for a higher balance sheet.

The expenses related to the Mortgage business sort of don't follow an exact quarter-to-quarter. As I said in my comments, not only sort of what we use, what I'd call the traditional methods, so as you see that decline, you see normal expenses come down and they tend to lag a quarter or 2 depending on how much of the volume is purchased and how much is refinanced. So obviously, it'll lag more for refinanced and less for purchased. But what we're doing is a fairly significant sort of redesign of the channels in the business as we're going through this. One of the real silver linings behind HARP is where it really has afforded us the opportunity to build out our consumer direct channel. And that channel, as a percent of our business a year ago, was pretty small. It's about 10% of our business now and it is a much more efficient part of the structure. So not only sort of do you have the traditional tools, we're also going through a pretty, as I said, a redesign of the channel mix. So I'm actually fairly confident when we come out of this, we'll come out of this with a higher-margin business relative to how we entered this from the changes that we're making now."

While still above the national average, the improvement in Florida and unemployment's gone from 10.6 to 8.7.

Let me just make a quick comment before we wrap up the call today. We've made significant progress in more favorably positioning the bank through -- for the future. That's through specific actions we've taken during the quarter, but really more broadly, through the benefits of some of our strategic operating decisions. We are building a more effective and efficient company, not only through expense savings, but also in the way that we're approaching revenue generation. A significant opportunity exists to leverage the loyalty that we've built, and our team has the tools and training they need to uncover more client needs and further deepen those relationships. And that's not to say that the path ahead is not without its challenges. But there is a high level of intensity across the organization around translating opportunity into results. And I believe we're focusing that energy in areas that can best impact bottom line performance.
