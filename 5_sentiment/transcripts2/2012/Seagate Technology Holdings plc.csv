Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me from Seagate our Pat O'Malley, our Chief Financial Officer; Dave Mosley, Executive Vice President of Operations; and Rocky Pimentel, Chief Sales and Marketing Officer; and Ken Massaroni, Executive Vice President and General Counsel. 
We have posted detailed supplemental information about our fiscal second quarter on our Investor Relations site at www.seagate.com. In today's call, I will review the results for the December 2011 quarter, provide an update on our Thailand operations on our view of the impact of the flooding, share our progress on the Samsung hard drive business integration and provide our outlook for our fiscal third and fourth quarters, as well as calendar year 2012. After that, we'll open up the call to questions and answers. 
For the December quarter, the industry shipped approximately 119 million units which was within our expected range. Seagate reported revenue of $3.28 billion and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.32. We shipped 47 million units during the quarter, and our non-GAAP gross margin was 31.7%. We ended the quarter with $2.3 billion in cash. 
The disaster in Thailand affected a vast number of individuals and thousands of businesses. Although the industry is continuing to increase output, it's important to note that where many observers tend to believe that mid to late October was the low point of industry production, we believe the low point was closer to mid-December. 
Seagate's geographically diversified factory footprint and broad supply chain provided inherent advantages that mitigated the impact of the floods to Seagate's operations, although many of our external component suppliers are still working to recover their businesses and return to full capacity. We have been very impressed with the response and efforts of our suppliers who have worked tirelessly to rebound from the effects of the flooding. There are still clear challenges that lie ahead in our component supply chain, and to help address the gaps in various product lines, Seagate has worked with its customers and suppliers on aggressive qualifications of new parts and factories, allowing us to match pressure supply to end demand. 
I'll now turn the call over to Dave Mosley who'll provide more detail on the situation in Thailand."

The human tragedy that surrounds the flooding in Thailand is deeply troubling, and our thoughts go out all of those affected, especially our employees and their families. To put the disaster in an economic perspective, it is by some measure",424,"Thanks, Steve. The human tragedy that surrounds the flooding in Thailand is deeply troubling, and our thoughts go out all of those affected, especially our employees and their families. To put the disaster in an economic perspective, it is by some measures the fourth largest natural disaster in history. So far, estimates are at $45 billion of damage and 13 million lives were disrupted. 
The damages done by the flooding created by far the most stressful quarter in the history of the disk drive supply chain. The flood was most impactful in the industrial parts approximately 30 miles north of downtown Bangkok, where 7 of our top 10 suppliers suffered direct factory damage. As a result, all of our 20-plus product platforms experienced some form of supply interruption, and for a few products, the damage brought down the supply lines completely. 
Components have had varying degrees of challenges in the recovery. Specifically, a large portion of the precision machining capability that supports the hard drive industry, the motors and base decks to actuators and specialty mechanical parts were catastrophically lost. In some cases, various fixtures were salvaged while in other cases, our suppliers have had to rush to secure new tooling. To date, over 200 requalifications have occurred for motor-based assembly alone. 
Also, many clean room facilities that support the industry where contamination control is critical were destroyed. Even certain electrical component manufacturing was damaged, impacting parts from IC packaging to individual discretes like capacitors. 
In addition, we're seeing much longer than usual lead times for certain pieces of capital equipment. Some sub-suppliers have limited access to capital to rebuild their systems and get back online, and Seagate is working with many of its suppliers to provide assistance where it can to accelerate the return of those businesses. Examples include temporary changes in payment terms, adaptation of our product portfolio to match their capabilities and assistance and funding for capital equipment. We believe these structural changes occurring in the supply chain today will have a lasting impact on the long-term structure of the industry. We're also working to ensure these relationships will lessen future risks and supply chain disruptions. 
With packs and the temporary underutilization of our in-house capacity, our average unit costs went up approximately $2.50 in the December quarter. I would like to thank our suppliers for their efforts in these trying times. In particular, vendors have shown their dedication to our industry and our mutual end customers to prioritize urgent product gaps and restore high-quality production as soon as possible. Steve?"

In response to the supply chain disruptions in the December quarter, Seagate dramatically reduced product configuration complexity and moved the vast majority of our fulfillment process to direct factory shipments. These efforts have fundame",1184,"Thanks, Dave. In response to the supply chain disruptions in the December quarter, Seagate dramatically reduced product configuration complexity and moved the vast majority of our fulfillment process to direct factory shipments. These efforts have fundamentally altered demand planning dynamics with our customers and have resulted in a much better alignment of supply and demand. We expect that these improvements to supply chain management will become standard practice as our industry fully recovers over the course of calendar 2012, benefiting our industry, suppliers and customers. 
Our average selling price per unit for the quarter was approximately $13 higher than they were in the September quarter. While market conditions would've clearly supported the higher price for our products across our portfolio, we balance this condition with the needs of our customers and suppliers, as well as our objective for more stability in our margins. We made the business decision to trade a short-term profit-maximizing opportunity for long-term commitments from customers, stronger relationships and more stable margins. 
As a result of improvements in supply-demand alignment and our approach to cut pricing, nearly all of our largest customers have entered into binding long-term agreements or LTAs, to ensure continuity of their hard disk drive supply. Some of these LTAs extend for multiple years. LTAs of this nature are new to the disk drive industry and represent a structural change in the way we do business. 
These agreements are mutually beneficial and improve the strategic alignment between Seagate and its customers by improving forecast accuracy, unit volume and pricing visibility, product build planning and logistics. The executed LTAs are expected to account for an excess of 60% of our total production capacity during the calendar year. These volume commitments were made while considering our broader business, which includes the global distribution channel, our own branded Retail business and other OEMs who have not executed LTAs. We are receiving additional request for LTAs from our customers, and we will evaluate our ability to meet those requests while ensuring that our customers have adequate supply to achieve their business objectives. 
The current industry environment has also created changes within our distribution channel, including the elimination of programs that historically complicated pricing and reduced transparency. We believe these changes will improve the profitability of our distribution partners and also result in better alignment of supply and demand, reducing the potential for excess inventory. 
Finally, in order to provide our customers another channel to access Seagate products, we are planning to auction approximately 200,000 drives later this week. In addition to making drives available for those qualified customers not covered by an LTA or where LTA volumes are not sufficient to cover their needs, this will allow us to fully understand and gauge marginal pricing. We have over 50 customers already committed to participate in the first auction. Our current expectation is that we will be conducting auctions periodically during this and future quarters. 
As previously mentioned, product configurations were dramatically reduced in the December quarter. As a result, we have accelerated most of the critical product transitions we discussed in last quarter's call. We prioritized transitions in desktop, nearline and mission-critical with speed volume recovery, and we have made substantial progress in manufacturing yields across all these programs. Our 500-gigabyte per disk notebook products are still on the plan and will be substantially completed with this transition in the next 6 months. 
As previously reported, we closed the acquisition of Samsung's hard drive business on December 19, and our integration of the Samsung business is largely complete and the transition has progressed as expected. The logistics to complete the shift of Samsung's disk drive operations to Seagate's system are closely coordinated, and the completion of this move is a testament to the solid work of our integration and operations team.  In the final weeks of 2011, Seagate shipped approximately 700,000 Samsung drives using Seagate's global systems. 
The acquisition includes the addition of Samsung's Spinpoint M8 Series to Seagate's 2.5-inch product portfolio. This product delivers industry-leading capacity and is a volume leader that will significantly improve Seagate's position as a supplier of 2.5-inch products. 
As with many other product lines, external component shortages resulting from the Thailand floods have constrained the production of this product. We are now seeing incremental improvements in the ramp of this product and expect ongoing improvements throughout the calendar year. We are excited about the broader ongoing relationships with Samsung and are pleased to welcome the Samsung employees that have joined Seagate at our new Korean design center and in the sales organization. 
With respect to our forecast for the remainder of the fiscal and calendar year, it is our belief that as a result of the structural damage to the supply chain, there's substantial and growing shortfall in unmet exabyte demand. We believe that the exabyte demand is growing at 40% per year, while areal density growth is increasing at less than 25% per year. We continue to expect that calendar 2012 unit demand will exceed supply, that the exabyte shortage will be more pronounced than the unit shortage and that price declines on a like-for-like basis will be relatively benign throughout the year. We believe the industry will likely exit the calendar year with approximately 100 exabytes of unmet demand. 
Based on Seagate's average capacity per drive shipped last quarter, which was the highest in the industry, this exabyte shortfall equates to approximately 115 million units. For the March quarter, we are expecting drive shipments of at least 60 million units, revenues to be at least $4.3 billion, gross margins to exceed 33% and operating expenses of approximately $405 million. Based on share repurchases completed during the month of January, fully diluted share count used in the EPS calculation is expected to be 465 million shares. 
For the June quarter, we expect that our supply chain capabilities will continue to improve, which will result in revenues of at least $5 billion and gross margins comparable to those expected for the March quarter. In light of the persistent supply-demand imbalances that we believe will exist throughout the calendar year, combined with greater visibility due to our LTAs, we currently expect a relatively benign pricing environment, resulting in revenues of at least $20 billion for calendar year 2012. 
With respect to the capital structure and our priorities for cash, we expect to continue our practice of returning value to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase throughout the calendar year 2012. To the extent market conditions allow, we expect to engage in share repurchases, which should result in a share count of approximately 350 million by the end of the calendar year. 
Last week, the Seagate board authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase program, which adds to the approximately $900 million remaining from the December 2010 authorization. Additionally, the board approved a 39% increase to our quarterly dividend from $0.18 to $0.25 per share. We believe these actions will help us maximize value for our shareholders and demonstrate our ongoing confidence in the business. 
Melanie, we're now open -- ready to open up the call for questions."

I think you have to also look at what pricing was like for our competitors and also mean typically, Seagate would be $10 to $12 a unit ASP higher given our mix in this quarter, it looks like we're $2 lower, which means obviously, that disparity was probably across all channels but probably particularly evident in the distribution channel. So I think you should read into what other people might have to do in channel pricing but what we have to do in channel pricing. We try to keep our pricing competitive in light of the constraints but as I said also, we've been at levels where we don't have a lot of fluctuation to our gross margins. So in certain capacity points, pricing seems to have affected the demand, and therefore, when you're running a portfolio that as broad as ours, there's always opportunity to generate gross profit dollars that are a function of pricing and volume. But overall, I would not expect any drastic reduction in our pricing in any one of our go-to-market channels."

These are firm contracts that are negotiated in terms of volume commitments and our commitment to supply, and they have conditions around them in terms of pricing and availability. And they're not contracts that you can decide 6 months from now that you really didn't want to enter into. I think the bigger point, which if anyone is not understanding, these contracts are extremely beneficial to our customers. They came about because customers that understood the implications of the supply chain disruption understood that access to this technology is going to be absolutely critical to deliver those solutions they're delivering. And while historically, maybe people look to say, ""How do I say $0.50 or $1 buying a disk drive?"" What people learned over the last 6 months is that by doing that, you're putting out risk sometimes anywhere to 10x to 12x that amount in revenue. So I mean, one million disk drives going to a customer is going to generate today even on the client $300 million or $400 million or $500 million or $600 million of revenue, depending on what your client base is. On the enterprise, of course, the numbers are probably 10x that. So this is an opportunity, I think, for a lot of the customers to basically assure themselves that they have access to the products so they can then do their planning, and it's actually one that's against the big shortfall in demand. I guess the analogy I use is if you lost 1/3 of the oil production in the world and everyone realize what that meant in terms of availability to gas for your car or fuel for your home, and you happen to have a relationship with a station owner down the block that happen to have stations all over the world, and they offered you the ability to basically get fuel whenever you wanted to at competitive prices, would you view that as an advantage or a disadvantage? I guess it's pretty clear it's an advantage. So we have a lot of confidence that these contracts will be adhered to. They are involving the highest level of executives at the companies that we engage with them. They are mutually beneficial, they are competitive, and they're giving these companies a great capability to plan their businesses going forward in an environment like we said where we believe there's going to be an exabyte shortage that goes into 2013. With respect to the hybrid technology, we, as you know, are on our second generation of hybrid technology moving into our third generation of hybrid technology, and we're quite confident that the performance and cost aspects of the devices that we'll be delivering over this summer will be best-in-class and basically will have SSD quality performance with marginal cost add so we believe this is a big category for us going forward."

And don't worry, I won't take you back to 1957. So I think if you'd really think about December, the math lays out like this: The industry shipped 120 million units but it only built 105 million. So I think of the earlier forecasts of the industry being able to ship something like 145 million for the March quarter would've been pretty spectacular in light of 105 million built because the figures there's no inventory drawdowns is going to occur in March, right, so I'd say you're talking 105 million going to 145 million. I think that's a stretch. I mean, is it possible? I'd suppose if you mix breakdown and capacity and you're only shooting for unit volume, it might theoretically be possible. But if you look at the first few weeks of production, it looks to us that the industry is on a pace to do something closer to 130 million, 135 million. And therefore to me, 150 million to 160 million is probably the right number for June, again depending on mix and recovery to the supply chain. Did that answer that question?"

Yes, more volume, a relatively stable pricing environment, mix again kind of a function of meeting our customer demand. And you've got to remember that mix is a little different than it's probably been over the last several years, where we got orders from customers and then we basically work with our supply chain to address mix. It's a little bit in reverse right now. We have our supply chain that's presenting a bunch of parts to us, and then we dynamically rework every 24 hours what we can build in order to best satisfy our customer's demand. So it's a little bit in reverse and it won't be fully recovered by June. So they're still going to be a big influence in the June quarter that says, ""Here's what we can build and how we best address the market."" So I think it's really a September quarter, maybe exiting the June quarter where we're going to have the flexibility that you might normally think of a company like Seagate, where you could put an order in sometime 8 weeks ahead of time than we could probably respond to with our supply chain. So that all plays into it, and that's why we believe there's going to be stability to our margins at least for the next 6 months and probably throughout the calendar year. And what was the first part? Sorry, CapEx, I'll let Dave answer the CapEx. The general answer is right now, we're working against, if you will, a capital -- I mean, a productive capacity that's fixed, that's not fully utilized obviously because of supply chain disruption in what we're doing right now is keeping our heads down the work towards getting fuller utilization of the assets that we have. We're also in product positions, which require technology and capital to transition. But generically, there's not a plan to put capital at work to raise that ceiling. And we wouldn't plan on doing that unless we got, let's say, the fall. And it was clear that the unit and exabyte shortages were even more pronounced and of a longer duration than what we're thinking, which is kind of through 2013 and various forms and function. You've the lead times where you probably would have to address increasing capital, then we would obviously come back to our strategic customers and negotiate that commitment with some sort of extension to the various LTAs because we obviously don't want it to be in the load to putting bunch of capital to work and then have excess capacity in the industry."

I mean, I think there's the -- if the question when does all this end, which of course is the biggest question in life. And then what does it look like? And the second biggest question in life. And what I think the answer is it doesn't end. This is a structural event that's happened and the industry has changed. And people want to get into this simplistic model of, and then on July 17 it's going to be just like it was, and there's pricing is going to come down and everybody's margin, it's just not very sophisticated nor I think reflective of the business that we're in. And I think that's what's going on right now is showing that. So I think it's a structural change and we've been saying this for a long, long time. This is structural. And what it looks like when we're through the transition, and I would view the transition to mean like I'm saying before when customers say here's what we need, we can be very responsive with our supply chain and delivery commitments with what they need in very short order. That is the least I year out I think in terms of meeting the unmet demand. So what does it look like then? It looks different and it looks different probably forever. What does that mean in terms of business models and gross margins? I would say that it means higher than what was in place before, because by definition, what was in place before had too much risk in the model. I mean, at the end of the day, the reason the industry is going through what is going through right now is there was excess risk in the system, and that risk in part is a function of gross margins that weren't sustainable for what our industry really delivers, either in terms of productive capability or R&D and capital. So I believe when it's all said and done and partly, there's going to be efficiencies, partly there's going to be more systems put in place, that supply availability is going to be more important than saving $0.50 on a disk drive. And if you ask any customer right now, will they rather have another one million drives or would they rather save $0.50 a drive, they all would tell you, they want another million drives so they can go produce $400 million, $500 million in revenue. I think that's what the smart strategic customers are focused on, and the smart strategic customers are the ones that are going to win."

And then you start getting some margin pressure the back end of that cycle. I think it's a little different now. You're still thinking of obviously all the issues on the front end. And in fact, it may be a little longer and tougher just because the technology is getting tougher in terms of these transitions. But I think the big difference is once you get the margin expansion, and again, when that starts to come down as a function of competitiveness, I do think that you're getting longer tails on margins just because people are driving yields a lot higher. Our industry historically would've said, ""Hey, if you get to the low 80s or mid- low 90s, sorry, mid-80s to high 80s to low 90s on yields, then you kind of start thinking about the next product."" And that's -- it's just a different world now with these capacity points staying in production longer and what's going on competitively, we can drive yields higher than that for longer periods of time, which might give us build a little longer tail in the margins. So this year. I think it's kind of a new phase of the industry right now."

But what I will tell you because I think you hit a good point is that we will learn a lot in terms of better operating models from what we've acquired at Samsung, where they took a different design approach, they took a different quality approach and they took a different manufacturing approach. And there's a lot of good stuff there that we're learning that as it turns out, we can apply to our broader portfolio whether or not again, it has to do with how we call the product, how we ramp it or even how we build it. And they do a great job, the yields are very high, they run very clean factories. And at the end of the day, I think that, that's going to benefit us in terms of our operating efficiency, i.e. lower cost of goods sold for any product made, and it should have an impact that helps us throughout the product line. And I think probably by next quarter, we can maybe start scoping maybe what we think some of that benefit is. You hit another point that pricing kind of masks what's going on. What it does and it doesn't. Like I said, you can see what our margins are at with price increases that were a lot lower than our competition. We're making really good progress on our cost and our yields, and we're getting through some of these transitions that are challenging but like I said, once you get through them, then you basically have a pretty nice product to build for a while. And at these capacity points, when you're at nice round numbers like 1 and 2 terabytes and 500 gigabytes, we think these products are going to be in production for a while so we have to make them at very high yields."

On the call with me from Seagate are: Pat O'Malley, our Chief Financial Officer; Dave Mosley, Executive Vice President of Operations; Rocky Pimentel, Chief Sales and Marketing Officer; and Ken Massaroni, Executive Vice President and General Counsel.
We have posted detailed supplemental information about our fiscal second quarter on our Investor Relations site at www.seagate.com. In today's call, I will review the results for the December 2011 quarter, provide an update on our Thailand operations and our view of the impact of the flooding, share our progress on the Samsung hard drive business integration and provide our outlook for our fiscal third and fourth quarters, as well as calendar year 2012. After that, we'll open up the call to questions and answers.
For the December quarter, the industry shipped approximately 119 million units which was within our expected range. Seagate reported revenue of $3.2 billion and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.32. We shipped 47 million units during the quarter, and our non-GAAP gross margin was 31.7%. We ended the quarter with $2.3 billion in cash.
The disaster in Thailand affected a vast number of individuals and thousands of businesses. Although the industry is continuing to increase output, it's important to note that while many observers tend to believe that mid to late October was the low point of industry production, we believe the low point was closer to mid-December.
Seagate's geographically diversified factory footprint and broad supply chain provided inherent advantages that mitigated the impact of the floods to Seagate's operations, although many of our external component suppliers are still working to recover their businesses and return to full capacity. We have been very impressed with the response and efforts of our suppliers who have worked tirelessly to rebound from the effects of the flooding. There are still clear challenges that lie ahead in our component supply chain, and to help address the gaps in various product lines, Seagate has worked with its customers and suppliers on aggressive qualifications of new parts and factories, allowing us to match precious supply to end demand.
I'll now turn the call over to Dave Mosley who will provide more detail on the situation in Thailand."

The human tragedy that surrounds the flooding in Thailand is deeply troubling, and our thoughts go out all of those affected, especially our employees and their families. To put the disaster in an economic perspective, it is by some measure",426,"Thanks, Steve. The human tragedy that surrounds the flooding in Thailand is deeply troubling, and our thoughts go out all of those affected, especially our employees and their families. To put the disaster in an economic perspective, it is by some measures the fourth largest natural disaster in history. So far, estimates are at $45 billion of damage and 13 million lives were disrupted.
The damages done by the flooding created by far the most stressful quarter in the history of the disk drive supply chain. The flood was most impactful in the industrial parts approximately 30 miles north of downtown Bangkok, where 7 of our top 10 suppliers suffered direct factory damage. As a result, all of our 20-plus product platforms experienced some form of supply interruption, and for a few products, the damage brought down the supply lines completely.
Components have had varying degrees of challenges in the recovery. Specifically, a large portion of the precision machining capability that supports the hard drive industry, the motors and base decks to actuators and specialty mechanical parts were catastrophically lost. In some cases, various fixtures were salvaged while in other cases, our suppliers have had to rush to secure new tooling. To date, over 200 requalifications have occurred for motor base assemblies alone. Also, many clean room facilities that support the industry, where contamination control is critical, were destroyed. Even certain electrical component manufacturing was damaged, impacting parts from IC packaging to individual discretes like capacitors.
In addition, we're seeing much longer than usual lead times for certain pieces of capital equipment. Some sub-suppliers have limited access to capital to rebuild their systems and get back online, and Seagate is working with many of its suppliers to provide assistance where it can to accelerate the return of those businesses. Examples include temporary changes in payment terms, adaptation of our product portfolio to match their capabilities and assistance and funding for capital equipment. We believe these structural changes occurring in the supply chain today will have a lasting impact on the long-term structure of the industry. We are also working to ensure these relationships will lessen future risks in supply chain disruptions.
With these impacts and the temporary underutilization of our in-house capacity, our average unit costs went up approximately $2.50 in the December quarter. I would like to thank our suppliers for their efforts in these trying times. In particular, vendors have shown their dedication to our industry and our mutual end-customers to prioritize urgent product gaps and restore high-quality production as soon as possible. Steve?"

In response to the supply chain disruptions in the December quarter, Seagate dramatically reduced product configuration complexity and moved the vast majority of our fulfillment process to direct factory shipments. These efforts have fundame",1186,"Thanks, Dave. In response to the supply chain disruptions in the December quarter, Seagate dramatically reduced product configuration complexity and moved the vast majority of our fulfillment process to direct factory shipments. These efforts have fundamentally altered demand planning dynamics with our customers and have resulted in a much better alignment of supply and demand. We expect that these improvements to supply chain management will become standard practice as our industry fully recovers over the course of calendar 2012, benefiting our industry, suppliers and customers.
Our average selling price per unit for the quarter was approximately $13 higher than they were in the September quarter. While market conditions would've clearly supported the higher price for our products across our portfolio, we balance this condition with the needs of our customers and suppliers, as well as our objective for more stability in our margins. We made the business decision to trade a short-term, profit-maximizing opportunity for long-term commitments from customers, stronger relationships and more stable margins.
As a result of improvements in supply-demand alignment and our approach to product pricing, nearly all of our largest customers have entered into binding long-term agreements or LTAs, to ensure continuity of their hard disk drive supply. Some of these LTAs extend for multiple years. LTAs of this nature are new to the disk drive industry and represent a structural change in the way we do business. These agreements are mutually beneficial and improved the strategic alignment between Seagate and its customers by improving forecast accuracy, unit volume and pricing visibility, product build planning and logistics.
The executed LTAs are expected to account for an excess of 60% of our total production capacity during the calendar year. These volume commitments were made while considering our broader business, which includes the global distribution channel, our own branded retail business and other OEMs who have not executed LTAs. We are receiving additional request for LTAs from our customers, and we will evaluate our ability to meet those requests while ensuring that our customers have adequate supply to achieve their business objectives.
The current industry environment has also created changes within our distribution channel, including the elimination of programs that historically complicated pricing and reduced transparency. We believe these changes will improve the profitability of our distribution partners and also result in better alignment of supply and demand, reducing the potential for excess inventory.
Finally, in order to provide our customers another channel to access Seagate products, we are planning to auction approximately 200,000 drives later this week. In addition to making drives available for those qualified customers not covered by an LTA or where LTA volumes are not sufficient to cover their needs, this will allow us to fully understand and gauge marginal pricing. We have over 50 customers already committed to participate in the first auction. Our current expectation is that we will be conducting auctions periodically during this and future quarters. 
As previously mentioned, product configurations were dramatically reduced in the December quarter. As a result, we have accelerated most of the critical product transitions we discussed in last quarter's call. We prioritized transitions in desktop, nearline and mission-critical with speed volume recovery, and we have made substantial progress in manufacturing yields across all these programs. Our 500-gigabyte per disk notebook products are still on the plan, and it will be substantially completed with this transition in the next 6 months. 
As previously reported, we closed the acquisition of Samsung's hard drive business on December 19, and our integration of the Samsung business is largely complete and the transition has progressed as expected. The logistics to complete the shift of Samsung's disk drive operations to Seagate's system are closely coordinated, and the completion of this move is a testament to the solid work of our integration and operations team.  In the final weeks of 2011, Seagate shipped approximately 700,000 Samsung drives using Seagate's global systems.
The acquisition includes the addition of Samsung's Spinpoint M8 series to Seagate's 2.5-inch product portfolio. This product delivers industry-leading capacity and is a volume leader that will significantly improve Seagate's position as a supplier of 2.5-inch products.
As with many other product lines, external component shortages resulting from the Thailand floods have constrained the production of this product. We are now seeing incremental improvements in the ramp of this product and expect ongoing improvements throughout the calendar year. We are excited about the broader ongoing relationship with Samsung and are pleased to welcome the Samsung employees that have joined Seagate at our new Korean design center and in the sales organization.
With respect to our forecast for the remainder of the fiscal and calendar year, it is our belief that as a result of the structural damage to the supply chain, there is substantial and growing shortfall in unmet exabyte demand. We believe that the exabyte demand is growing at 40% per year, while areal density growth is increasing at less than 25% per year. We continue to expect that calendar 2012 unit demand will exceed supply, that the exabyte shortage will be more pronounced than the unit shortage; and that price declines on a like-for-like basis will be relatively benign throughout the year. We believe the industry will likely exit the calendar year with approximately 100 exabytes of unmet demand.
Based on Seagate's average capacity per drive shipped last quarter, which was the highest in the industry, this exabyte shortfall equates to approximately 115 million units. For the March quarter, we are expecting drive shipments of at least 60 million units, revenues to be at least $4.3 billion, gross margins to exceed 33% and operating expenses of approximately $405 million. Based on share repurchases completed during the month of January, fully diluted share count used in the EPS calculation is expected to be 465 million shares.
For the June quarter, we expect that our supply chain capabilities will continue to improve, which will result in revenues of at least $5 billion and gross margins comparable to those expected for the March quarter. In light of the persistent supply-demand imbalances that we believe will exist throughout the calendar year, combined with greater visibility due to our LTAs, we currently expect a relatively benign pricing environment resulting in revenues of at least $20 billion for calendar year 2012.
With respect to the capital structure and our priorities for cash, we expect to continue our practice of returning value to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase throughout the calendar year 2012. To the extent market conditions allow, we expect to engage in share repurchases, which should result in a share count of approximately 350 million by the end of the calendar year.
Last week, the Seagate board authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase program, which adds to the approximately $900 million remaining from the December 2010 authorization. Additionally, the board approved a 39% increase to our quarterly dividend from $0.18 to $0.25 per share. We believe these actions will help us maximize value for our shareholders and demonstrate our ongoing confidence in the business.

In this quarter, it looks like we're $2 lower, which means, obviously, that disparity was probably across all channels but probably particularly evident in the distribution channel. So I think you should read into what other people might have to do in channel pricing, what we have to do in channel pricing. We try to keep our pricing competitive in light of the constraints, but as I said also, we've been at levels where we don't have a lot of fluctuation to our gross margins. So in certain capacity points, pricing seems to have affected demand, and therefore, when you're running a portfolio as broad as ours, there's always opportunity to generate gross profit dollars that are a function of pricing and volume.

These are firm contracts that are negotiated in terms of volume commitments and our commitment to supply, and they have conditions around them in terms of pricing and availability. And they're not contracts that you can decide 6 months from now that you really didn't want to enter into. I think the bigger point, which if anyone is not understanding, these contracts are extremely beneficial to our customers. They came about because customers that understood the implications of the supply chain disruption understood that access to this technology is going to be absolutely critical to deliver the solutions they're delivering. And while historically, maybe people look to say, ""How do I say $0.50 or $1 buying a disk drive?"" What people learned over the last 6 months is that by doing that, you're putting at risk, sometimes, anywhere to 10x to 12x that amount in revenue. So I mean, 1 million disk drives going to a customer is going to generate today even on the client $300 million or $400 million or $500 million or $600 million of revenue, depending on what your client base is. And on the enterprise, of course, the numbers are probably 10x that. So this is an opportunity, I think, for a lot of the customers to basically assure themselves that they have access to the products so they can then do their planning, and it's actually one that's against the big shortfall in demand.
I guess the analogy I use is if you lost 1/3 of the oil production in the world and everyone realizes what that meant in terms of availability to gas for your car or fuel for your home, and you happen to have a relationship with a station owner down the block that happen to have stations all over the world, and they offered you the ability to basically get fuel whenever you wanted to at competitive prices, would you view that as an advantage or a disadvantage? I think it's pretty clear, it's an advantage. So we have a lot of confidence that these contracts will be adhered to. They are involving the highest level of executives at the companies that we engage with them. They are mutually beneficial, they are competitive and they're giving these companies a great capability to plan their businesses going forward. And in an environment like we said, where we believe there's going to be an exabyte shortage that goes into 2013. With respect to a hybrid technology, we -- as you know, we're on our second generation of hybrid technology moving into our third generation of hybrid technology, and we're quite confident that the performance and cost aspects of the devices that we'll be delivering over this summer will be best-in-class and basically, we'll have SSD-quality performance with marginal cost add, so we believe this is a big category for us going forward."

And don't worry, I won't take you back to 1957. So I think if you'd really think about December, the math lays out like this: the industry shipped 120 million units but it only built 105 million. So I think the earlier forecasts of the industry being able to ship something like 145 million for the March quarter would have been pretty spectacular in light of 105 million built, because it figures, no inventory drawdowns is going to occur in March, right? So you're talking 105 million going to 145 million. I think that's a stretch. I mean, is it possible? I suppose if your mix way down and capacity, and you're only shooting for unit volume, it might theoretically be possible. But if you look at the first few weeks of production, it looks to us that the industry is on a pace to do something closer to 130 million, 135 million. Look, and therefore to me, 150 million to 160 million is probably the right number for June, again, depending on mix and recovery to the supply chain. Did that answer that question?"

Yes, more volume, relatively stable pricing environment, mix, again, kind of a function of meeting our customer demands. And you've got to remember that mix is a little different than it's probably been in the last several years where we got orders from customers and then we basically work with our supply chain to address mix. It's a little bit in reverse right now. We have our supply chain that's presenting a bunch of parts to us, and then we dynamically rework every 24 hours what we can build in order to best satisfy our customer's demand. So it's a little bit in reverse, and it won't be fully recovered by June. So there's still going to be a big influence in the June quarter that says, ""Here's what we can build and how we best address the market."" So I think it's really a September quarter, maybe exiting the June quarter where we're going to have the flexibility that you might normally think of a company like Seagate, where you could put an order in, sometime 8 weeks ahead of time than we could probably respond to with our supply chain. So that all plays into it, and that's why we believe there's going to be stability to our margins, at least for the next 6 months, and probably throughout the calendar year.
And what was the first part? Sorry, CapEx, I'll let Dave answer the CapEx. The general answer is right now, we're working against, if you will, a capital -- I mean, a productive capacity that's fixed, that's not fully utilized obviously because of supply chain disruption. And what we're doing right now is keeping our heads down the work towards getting fuller utilization of the assets that we have. We're also in product transitions, which require technology and capital to transition. But generically, there's not a plan to put capital at work to raise that ceiling. And we wouldn't plan on doing that unless we got to, let's say, the fall. And it was clear that the unit and exabyte shortages were even more pronounced and of a longer duration than what we're thinking, which is kind of through 2013 and various forms and function. You'll then be  lead times where you probably would have to address increasing capital, and then we would obviously come back to our strategic customers and negotiate that commitment with some sort of extension to the various LTAs because we obviously don't want to be on the hook for putting bunch of capital to work and then have excess capacity in the industry."

But -- and then what does it look like? And the second biggest question in life. And what I think the answer is it doesn't end. This is a structural event that's happened and the industry has changed. And people want to get into this simplistic model of -- and then, on July 17, it's going to be just like it was, and there's pricing is going to come down and everybody's margin, and it's not just -- it's just not very sophisticated nor I think reflective of the business that we're in. And I think that what's going on right now is showing that. So I think it's a structural change and we've been saying this for a long, long time. This is structural. And what it looks like when we're through the transition, and I would view the transition of -- to me, and like I was saying before when customers say ""Here's what we need."" we can be very responsive with our supply chain and deliver commitments with what they need in very short order. That is at least 1 year out, I think, in terms of meeting the unmet demand.
So what does it look like then? It looks different, and it looks different probably forever. What does that mean in terms of business models and gross margins? I would say that it means higher than what was in place before, because by definition, what was in place before had too much risk in the model. I mean, at the end of the day, the reason the industry is going through what it's going through right now is because there was excess risk in the system. And that risk, in part, was a function of gross margins that weren't sustainable for what our industry really delivers, either in terms of productive capability or R&D and capital. So I believe when it's all said and done and partly, there's going to be more efficiencies, partly there's going to be more systems put in place. That supply availability is going to be more important than saving $0.50 on a disk drive. And if you ask any customer right now, would they rather have another million drives or would they rather save $0.50 a drive, they all would tell you, they want another million drives so they can go produce $400 million, $500 million in revenue. I think that's what the smart strategic customers are focused on, and the smart strategic customers are the ones that are going to win."

And then you start getting some margin pressure the back end of that cycle. I think it's a little different now. You still are thinking of obviously all the issues on the front end. And in fact, it may be a little longer and tougher just because the technology is getting tougher in terms of these transitions. But I think the big difference is once you get the margin expansion, and again, when that starts to come down as a function of competitiveness, I do think that you're getting longer tails on margins just because people are driving yields a lot higher. Our industry historically, would've said, ""Hey, if you get to the low 80s or mid- low 90s"" -- sorry, ""mid-80s to high 80s to low 90s on yields, then you kind of start thinking about the next product."" And that's -- it's just a different world now with these capacity points staying in production longer and what's going on competitively, we can drive yields higher than that for longer periods of time, which might give us -- build a little longer tail on the margins, so we'll see.

But what I will tell you, because I think you hit on a good point, is that we will learn a lot in terms of better operating models from what we've acquired at Samsung. They took a different design approach, they took a different quality approach and they took a different manufacturing approach. And there's a lot of good stuff there that we're learning that, as it turns out, we can apply to our broader portfolio, whether or not, again, that has to do with how we call a product, how we ramp it or even how we build it. And they do a great job. The yields are very high. They run very clean factories. And at the end of the day, I think that, that's going to benefit us in terms of our operating efficiency, i.e. lower cost of goods sold for any product made. And it should have an impact that helps us throughout the product line. And I think probably by next quarter, we can maybe start scoping what we think some of that benefit is. You hit another point that pricing kind of masks what's going on. Well, it does and it doesn't. Like I said, you can see what our margins are at with price increases that were a lot lower than our competition. We're making really good progress on our cost and our yields, and we're getting through some of these transitions that are challenging. But like I said, once you get through them, then you basically have a pretty nice product to build for a while. And at these capacity points, when you're at nice round numbers like 1 and 2 terabytes and 500 gigabytes, we think these products are going to be in production for a while, so we have to be able to make them at very high yields."

On the call with me from Seagate are Pat O'Malley, our Chief Financial Officer; Dave Mosley, Executive Vice President of Operations; Rocky Pimentel, Chief Sales and Marketing Officer; and Ken Massaroni, Executive Vice President and General Counsel.
We have posted detailed supplemental information about our fiscal second quarter on our Investor Relations site at seagate.com. In today's call, I will review the results for the December 2011 quarter, provide an update on our Thailand operations and our view of the impact of the flooding, share our progress on the Samsung hard drive business integration and provide our outlook for our fiscal third and fourth quarters, as well as calendar year 2012. After that, we'll open up the call to questions and answers.
For the December quarter, the industry shipped approximately 119 million units, which was within our expected range. Seagate reported revenue of $3.2 billion and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.32. We shipped 47 million units during the quarter, and our non-GAAP gross margin was 31.7%. We ended the quarter with $2.3 billion in cash.
The disaster in Thailand affected a vast number of individuals and thousands of businesses. Although the industry is continuing to increase output, it's important to note that while many observers tend to believe that mid to late October was the low point of industry production, we believe the low point was closer to mid-December.
Seagate's geographically diversified factory footprint and broad supply chain provided inherent advantages that mitigated the impact of the floods to Seagate's operations, although many of our external component suppliers are still working to recover their businesses and return to full capacity. We have been very impressed with the response and efforts of our suppliers, who have worked tirelessly to rebound from the effects of the flooding. There are still clear challenges that lie ahead in our component supply chain. And to help address the gaps in various product lines, Seagate has worked with its customers and suppliers on aggressive qualifications of new parts and factories, allowing us to match precious supply to end demand.
I'll now turn the call over to Dave Mosley, who will provide more detail on the situation in Thailand."

The human tragedy that surrounds the flooding in Thailand is deeply troubling, and our thoughts go out all of those affected, especially our employees and their families. To put the disaster in an economic perspective, it is by some measure",424,"Thanks, Steve. The human tragedy that surrounds the flooding in Thailand is deeply troubling, and our thoughts go out all of those affected, especially our employees and their families. To put the disaster in an economic perspective, it is by some measures the fourth-largest natural disaster in history. So far, estimates are at $45 billion of damage, and 13 million lives were disrupted.
The damages done by the flooding created by far the most stressful quarter in the history of the disk drive supply chain. The flood was most impactful in the industrial parks approximately 30 miles north of downtown Bangkok, where 7 of our top 10 suppliers suffered direct factory damage. As a result, all of our 20-plus product platforms experienced some form of supply interruption, and for a few products, the damage brought down the supply lines completely.
Components have had varying degrees of challenges in the recovery. Specifically, a large portion of the precision machining capability that supports the hard drive industry, the motors and base decks to actuators and specialty mechanical parts, were catastrophically lost. In some cases, various fixtures were salvaged, while in other cases our suppliers have had to rush to secure new tooling. To date, over 200 requalifications have occurred for motor base assemblies alone. Also, many cleanroom facilities that support the industry, where contamination control is critical, were destroyed. Even certain electrical component manufacturing was damaged, impacting parts from IC packaging to individual discretes like capacitors.
In addition, we're seeing much longer than usual lead times for certain pieces of capital equipment. Some sub-suppliers have limited access to capital to rebuild their systems and get back online, and Seagate is working with many of its suppliers to provide assistance where it can to accelerate the return of those businesses. Examples include temporary changes in payment terms, adaptation of our product portfolio to match their capabilities and assistance in funding for capital equipment. We believe these structural changes occurring in the supply chain today will have a lasting impact on the long-term structure of the industry. We are also working to ensure these relationships will lessen future risks in supply chain disruptions.
With these impacts and the temporary underutilization of our in-house capacity, our average unit costs went up approximately $2.50 in the December quarter. I would like to thank our suppliers for their efforts in these trying times. In particular, vendors have shown their dedication to our industry and our mutual end-customers to prioritize urgent product gaps and restore high-quality production as soon as possible. Steve?"

In response to the supply chain disruptions in the December quarter, Seagate dramatically reduced product configuration complexity and moved the vast majority of our fulfillment process to direct factory shipments. These efforts have fundame",1187,"Thanks, Dave. In response to the supply chain disruptions in the December quarter, Seagate dramatically reduced product configuration complexity and moved the vast majority of our fulfillment process to direct factory shipments. These efforts have fundamentally altered demand planning dynamics with our customers and have resulted in a much better alignment of supply and demand. We expect that these improvements to supply chain management will become standard practice as our industry fully recovers over the course of calendar 2012, benefiting our industry, suppliers and customers.
Our average selling price per unit for the quarter was approximately $13 higher than they were in the September quarter. While market conditions would have clearly supported a higher price for our products across our portfolio, we balance this condition with the needs of our customers and suppliers, as well as our objective for more stability in our margins. We made the business decision to trade a short-term, profit-maximizing opportunity for long-term commitments from customers, stronger relationships and more stable margins.
As a result of improvements in supply-demand alignment and our approach to pricing, nearly all of our largest customers have entered into binding long-term agreements or LTAs to ensure continuity of their hard disk drive supply. Some of these LTAs extend for multiple years. LTAs of this nature are new to the disk drive industry and represent a structural change in the way we do business. These agreements are mutually beneficial and improve the strategic alignment between Seagate and its customers by improving forecast accuracy, unit volume and pricing visibility, product build planning and logistics.
The executed LTAs are expected to account for an excess of 60% of our total production capacity during the calendar year. These volume commitments were made while considering our broader business, which includes the global distribution channel, our own branded retail business and other OEMs who have not executed LTAs. We are receiving additional requests for LTAs from our customers, and we will evaluate our ability to meet those requests while ensuring that our customers have adequate supply to achieve their business objectives.
The current industry environment has also created changes within our distribution channel, including the elimination of programs that historically have complicated pricing and reduced transparency. We believe these changes will improve the profitability of our distribution partners and also result in better alignment of supply and demand, reducing the potential for excess inventory.
Finally, in order to provide our customers another channel to access Seagate products, we are planning to auction approximately 200,000 drives later this week. In addition to making drives available for those qualified customers not covered by an LTA or where LTA volumes are not sufficient to cover their needs, this will allow us to fully understand and gauge marginal pricing. We have over 50 customers already committed to participate in the first auction. Our current expectation is that we will be conducting auctions periodically during this and future quarters. 
As previously mentioned, product configurations were dramatically reduced in the December quarter. As a result, we have accelerated most of the critical product transitions we discussed in last quarter's call. We prioritized transitions in desktop, nearline and mission-critical to speed volume recovery, and we have made substantial progress in manufacturing yields across all these programs. Our 500-gigabyte per disk notebook products are still on the plan, and they will be substantially completed with this transition in the next 6 months. 
As previously reported, we closed the acquisition of Samsung's hard drive business on December 19, and our integration of the Samsung business is largely complete, and the transition has progressed as expected. The logistics to complete the shift of Samsung's disk drive operations to Seagate's system are closely coordinated, and the completion of this move is a testament to the solid work of our integration and operations team.  In the final weeks of 2011, Seagate shipped approximately 700,000 Samsung drives using Seagate's global systems.
The acquisition includes the addition of Samsung's Spinpoint M8 series to Seagate's 2.5-inch product portfolio. This product delivers industry-leading capacity and is a volume leader that will significantly improve Seagate's position as a supplier of 2.5-inch products.
As with many other product lines, external component shortages resulting from the Thailand floods have constrained the production of this product. We are now seeing incremental improvements in the ramp of this product and expect ongoing improvements throughout the calendar year. We are excited about the broader ongoing relationship with Samsung and are pleased to welcome the Samsung employees that have joined Seagate at our new Korean design center and in the sales organization.
With respect to our forecast for the remainder of the fiscal and calendar year, it is our belief that as a result of the structural damage to the supply chain, there is substantial and growing shortfall in unmet exabyte demand. We believe that the exabyte demand is growing at 40% per year, while areal density growth is increasing at less than 25% per year. We continue to expect that calendar 2012 unit demand will exceed supply, that the exabyte shortage will be more pronounced than the unit shortage, and that price declines on a like-for-like basis will be relatively benign throughout the year. We believe the industry will likely exit the calendar year with approximately 100 exabytes of unmet demand.
Based on Seagate's average capacity per drive shipped last quarter, which was the highest in the industry, this exabyte shortfall equates to approximately 150 million units. For the March quarter, we are expecting drive shipments of at least 60 million units, revenues to be at least $4.3 billion, gross margins to exceed 33% and operating expenses of approximately $405 million. Based on share repurchases completed during the month of January, fully diluted share count used in the EPS calculation is expected to be 465 million shares.
For the June quarter, we expect that our supply chain capabilities will continue to improve, which will result in revenues of at least $5 billion and gross margins comparable to those expected for the March quarter. In light of the persistent supply-demand imbalances that we believe will exist throughout the calendar year, combined with greater visibility due to our LTAs, we currently expect a relatively benign pricing environment resulting in revenues of at least $20 billion for calendar year 2012.
With respect to the capital structure and our priorities for cash, we expect to continue our practice of returning value to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase throughout the calendar year 2012. To the extent market conditions allow, we expect to engage in share repurchases, which should result in a share count of approximately 350 million by the end of the calendar year.
Last week, the Seagate board authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase program, which adds to the approximately $900 million remaining from the December 2010 authorization. Additionally, the board approved a 39% increase to our quarterly dividend from $0.18 to $0.25 per share. We believe these actions will help us maximize value for our shareholders and demonstrate our ongoing confidence in the business.
Melanie, we're now open -- ready to open up the call for questions."

So I don't think you should read into what other people might have to do in channel pricing what we have to do in channel pricing. We've tried to keep our pricing competitive in light of the constraints, but as I said also, leave it at levels where we don't have a lot of fluctuation to our gross margin. So in certain capacity points, pricing seems to have affected demand, and therefore, when you're running a portfolio as broad as ours, there's always opportunity to generate gross profit dollars that are a function of pricing and volume. But overall, I would not expect any drastic reduction in our pricing in any one of our go-to-market channels."

These are firm contracts that are negotiated in terms of volume commitments and our commitment to supply, and they have conditions around them in terms of pricing and availability. And they're not contracts that you can decide 6 months from now that you really didn't want to enter into. I think the bigger point, which if anyone is not understanding, these contracts are extremely beneficial to our customers. They came about because customers that understood the implications of the supply chain disruption understood that access to this technology is going to be absolutely critical to deliver the solutions they're delivering. And while historically, maybe people look to say, ""How do I save $0.50 or $1 buying a disk drive?"" what people learned over the last 6 months is that by doing that, you're putting at risk, sometimes, anywhere to 10x to 12x that amount in revenue. So I mean, 1 million disk drives going to a customer is going to generate today even on the client $300 million or $400 million or $500 million or $600 million of revenue, depending on what your client base is. And on the enterprise, of course, the numbers are probably 10x that. So this is an opportunity, I think, for a lot of the customers to basically assure themselves that they have access to the product so they can then do their planning, and especially when it's against a big shortfall in demand.  I guess the analogy I use is if you lost 1/3 of the oil production in the world and everyone realized what that meant in terms of availability to gas for your car or fuel for your home, and you happen to have a relationship with a station owner down the block that happened to have stations all over the world, and they offered you the ability to basically get fuel whenever you wanted to at competitive prices, would you view that as an advantage or a disadvantage? I think it's pretty clear it's an advantage. So we have a lot of confidence that these contracts will be adhered to. They are involving the highest level of executives at the companies that we engage with them. They are mutually beneficial, they are competitive and they're giving these companies a great capability to plan their businesses going forward. And in an environment like we said, where we believe there's going to be an exabyte shortage that could -- that goes into 2013. With respect to a hybrid technology, we -- as you know, we're on our second generation of hybrid technology moving into our third generation of hybrid technology, and we're quite confident that the performance and cost aspects of the devices that we'll be delivering over the summer will be best-in-class and basically will have SSD-quality performance with marginal cost adder [ph], so we believe this is a big category for us going forward."

And don't worry, I won't take you back to 1957. So I think if you really think about December, the math lays out like this: the industry shipped 120 million units, but it only built 105 million. So I think the earlier forecast of the industry being able to ship something like 145 million for the March quarter would have been pretty spectacular in light of 105 million built, because you figures there's no inventory drawdowns that's going to occur in March, right? So you're talking about 105 million going to 145 million. I think that's a stretch. I mean, is it possible? I suppose if you mix way down in capacity, and you're only shooting for unit volume, it might theoretically be possible. But if you look at the first few weeks of production, it looks to us that the industry is on a pace to do something closer to 130 million, 135 million. You can therefore -- to me, 150 million to 160 million is probably the right number for June, again, depending on mix and recovery to the supply chain."

Yes, more volume, relatively stable pricing environment, mix, again, kind of a function of meeting our customer demands. And you've got to remember that mix is a little different than it's probably been in the last several years where we get orders from customers and then we basically work with our supply chain to address mix. It's a little bit in reverse right now. We have our supply chain that's presenting a bunch of parts to us, and then we dynamically rework every 24 hours what we can build in order to best satisfy our customers' demand. So it's a little bit in reverse, and it won't be fully recovered by June. So there's still going to be a big influence in the June quarter that says, ""Here's what we can build and how do we best address the market?"" So I think it's really a September quarter, maybe exiting the June quarter where we're going to have the flexibility that you might normally think of a company like Seagate, where you could put an order in, sometime 8 weeks ahead of time, and we could probably respond to it with our supply chain. So that all plays into it, and that's why we believe there's going to be stability to our margins, at least for the next 6 months, and probably throughout the calendar year.  And what was the first part? Sorry, CapEx. I'll let Dave answer the CapEx. The general answer is right now, we're working against, if you will, a capital -- I mean, a productive capacity that's fixed, that's not fully utilized, obviously, because of supply chain disruption. And what we're doing right now is keeping our heads down to work towards getting fuller utilization of the assets that we have. We're also in product transitions, which require technology and capital to transition. But generically, there's not a plan to put capital at work to raise that ceiling. And we wouldn't plan on doing that unless we got to, let's say, the fall, and it was clear that the unit and exabyte shortages were even more pronounced and of a longer duration than what we're thinking, which is kind of through 2013 in various forms and function. You'd then be  into lead times where you probably would have to address increasing capital, and then we would obviously come back to our strategic customers and negotiate that commitment with some sort of extension to the various LTAs because we obviously don't want to be on the hook for putting a bunch of capital to work and then have excess capacity in the industry."

This is a structural event that's happened, and the industry has changed. And people want to get into the simplistic model of ""and then, on July 17, it's going to be just like it was, and there's pricing is going to come down and everybody's margin."" I mean, this -- and that's just -- that's just not very sophisticated nor I think reflective of the business that we're in. And I think that what's going on right now is showing that. So I think it's a structural change and we've been saying this for a long, long time. This is structural. And what it looks like when we're through the transition -- and I would view the transition to mean, like I was saying before, when customers say ""Here's what we need,"" we can be very responsive with our supply chain and deliver commitments with what they need in very short order. That is at least 1 year out, I think, in terms of meeting the unmet demand.  So what does it look like then? It looks different, and it looks different probably forever. What does that mean in terms of business models and gross margins? I would say that it means higher than what was in place before, because by definition, what was in place before had too much risk in the model. I mean, at the end of the day, the reason the industry is going through what it's going through right now is because there was excess risk in the system. And that risk, in part, was a function of gross margins that weren't sustainable for what our industry really delivers, either in terms of productive capability or R&D and capital. So I believe when it's all said and done and partly, there's going to be more efficiencies, partly there's going to be more systems put in place. That supply availability is going to be more important than saving $0.50 on a disk drive. And if you ask any customer right now, would they rather have another million drives or would they rather save $0.50 a drive, they all will tell you, they want another million drives so they can go produce $400 million or $500 million in revenue. And I think that's what the smart strategic customers are focused on, and the smart strategic customers are the ones that are going to win."

If you asked that question 5 years ago, you would say that you have compressed margins at the front end of that transition just because you're putting a lot of capital to work in new equipment and yields are low, and then you kind of get this margin expansion that might last 4 or 5 quarters, depending on what's going on competitive with that particular product. And then you start getting some margin pressure the back end of that cycle. I think it's a little different now. You still are thinking of obviously all the issues on the front end. And in fact, it may be a little longer and tougher just because the technology is getting tougher in terms of these transitions. But I think the big difference is once you get the margin expansion, and again, when that starts to come down is a function of competitiveness, I do think that you're getting longer tails on margins just because people are driving yields a lot higher. Our industry historically would've said, ""Hey, if you get to the low 80s or mid- low 90s"" -- sorry, ""mid-80s to high 80s to low 90s on yields, then you kind of start thinking about the next product."" And that's -- it's just a different world now with these capacity points staying in production longer and what's going on competitively, we can drive yields higher than that for longer periods of time, which might give us a little longer tail on the margin, so we'll see. It's -- I think, it's kind of a new phase of the industry right now."

But what I will tell you, because I think you hit on a good point, is that we will learn a lot in terms of better operating models from what we've acquired at Samsung. They took a different design approach, they took a different qual approach and they took a different manufacturing approach. And there's a lot of good stuff there that we're learning that, as it turns out, we can apply to our broader portfolio, whether or not, again, that has to do with how we qual the product, how we ramp it or even how we build it. And they do a great job. The yields are very high. They run very clean factories. And at the end of the day, I think that, that's going to benefit us in terms of our operating efficiency, i.e. lower cost of goods sold for any product made. And it should have an impact that helps us throughout a product line. And I think probably by next quarter, we can maybe start scoping what we think some of that benefit is. You hit another point that pricing kind of masks what's going on. Well, it does and it doesn't. Like I said, you can see what our margins are at with price increases that were a lot lower than our competition. We're making really good progress on our cost and our yields, and we're getting through some of these transitions that are challenging. But like I said, once you get through them, then you basically have a pretty nice product to build for a while. And at these capacity points, when you're at nice round numbers like 1 and 2 terabytes and 500 gigabytes, we think these products are going to be in production for a while, so we have to be able to make them at very high yields."

We have posted detailed supplemental information about our fiscal second quarter on our Investor Relations site at seagate.com. In today's call, I will review the results for the December 2011 quarter, provide an update on our Thailand operations and our view of the impact of the flooding, share our progress on the Samsung hard drive business integration and provide our outlook for our fiscal third and fourth quarters, as well as calendar year 2012. After that, we'll open up the call to questions and answers.
For the December quarter, the industry shipped approximately 119 million units, which was within our expected range. Seagate reported revenue of $3.2 billion and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.32. We shipped 47 million units during the quarter, and our non-GAAP gross margin was 31.7%. We ended the quarter with $2.3 billion in cash.
The disaster in Thailand affected a vast number of individuals and thousands of businesses. Although the industry is continuing to increase output, it's important to note that while many observers tend to believe that mid to late October was the low point of industry production, we believe the low point was closer to mid-December.
Seagate's geographically diversified factory footprint and broad supply chain provided inherent advantages that mitigated the impact of the floods to Seagate's operations, although many of our external component suppliers are still working to recover their businesses and return to full capacity. We have been very impressed with the response and efforts of our suppliers, who have worked tirelessly to rebound from the effects of the flooding. There are still clear challenges that lie ahead in our component supply chain. And to help address the gaps in various product lines, Seagate has worked with its customers and suppliers on aggressive qualifications of new parts and factories, allowing us to match precious supply to end demand.
I'll now turn the call over to Dave Mosley, who will provide more detail on the situation in Thailand."

The human tragedy that surrounds the flooding in Thailand is deeply troubling, and our thoughts go out all of those affected, especially our employees and their families. To put the disaster in an economic perspective, it is by some measures the fourth-largest natural disaster in history. So far, estimates are at $45 billion of damage, and 13 million lives were disrupted.
The damages done by the flooding created by far the most stressful quarter in the history of the disk drive supply chain. The flood was most impactful in the industrial parks approximately 30 miles north of downtown Bangkok, where 7 of our top 10 suppliers suffered direct factory damage. As a result, all of our 20-plus product platforms experienced some form of supply interruption, and for a few products, the damage brought down the supply lines completely.
Components have had varying degrees of challenges in the recovery. Specifically, a large portion of the precision machining capability that supports the hard drive industry, the motors and base decks to actuators and specialty mechanical parts, were catastrophically lost. In some cases, various fixtures were salvaged, while in other cases our suppliers have had to rush to secure new tooling. To date, over 200 requalifications have occurred for motor base assemblies alone. Also, many cleanroom facilities that support the industry, where contamination control is critical, were destroyed. Even certain electrical component manufacturing was damaged, impacting parts from IC packaging to individual discretes like capacitors.
In addition, we're seeing much longer than usual lead times for certain pieces of capital equipment. Some sub-suppliers have limited access to capital to rebuild their systems and get back online, and Seagate is working with many of its suppliers to provide assistance where it can to accelerate the return of those businesses. Examples include temporary changes in payment terms, adaptation of our product portfolio to match their capabilities and assistance in funding for capital equipment. We believe these structural changes occurring in the supply chain today will have a lasting impact on the long-term structure of the industry. We are also working to ensure these relationships will lessen future risks in supply chain disruptions.
With these impacts and the temporary underutilization of our in-house capacity, our average unit costs went up approximately $2.50 in the December quarter. I would like to thank our suppliers for their efforts in these trying times. In particular, vendors have shown their dedication to our industry and our mutual end-customers to prioritize urgent product gaps and restore high-quality production as soon as possible. Steve?"

These efforts have fundame",1187,"Thanks, Dave. In response to the supply chain disruptions in the December quarter, Seagate dramatically reduced product configuration complexity and moved the vast majority of our fulfillment process to direct factory shipments. These efforts have fundamentally altered demand planning dynamics with our customers and have resulted in a much better alignment of supply and demand. We expect that these improvements to supply chain management will become standard practice as our industry fully recovers over the course of calendar 2012, benefiting our industry, suppliers and customers.
Our average selling price per unit for the quarter was approximately $13 higher than they were in the September quarter. While market conditions would have clearly supported a higher price for our products across our portfolio, we balance this condition with the needs of our customers and suppliers, as well as our objective for more stability in our margins. We made the business decision to trade a short-term, profit-maximizing opportunity for long-term commitments from customers, stronger relationships and more stable margins.
As a result of improvements in supply-demand alignment and our approach to pricing, nearly all of our largest customers have entered into binding long-term agreements or LTAs to ensure continuity of their hard disk drive supply. Some of these LTAs extend for multiple years. LTAs of this nature are new to the disk drive industry and represent a structural change in the way we do business. These agreements are mutually beneficial and improve the strategic alignment between Seagate and its customers by improving forecast accuracy, unit volume and pricing visibility, product build planning and logistics.
The executed LTAs are expected to account for an excess of 60% of our total production capacity during the calendar year. These volume commitments were made while considering our broader business, which includes the global distribution channel, our own branded retail business and other OEMs who have not executed LTAs. We are receiving additional requests for LTAs from our customers, and we will evaluate our ability to meet those requests while ensuring that our customers have adequate supply to achieve their business objectives.
The current industry environment has also created changes within our distribution channel, including the elimination of programs that historically have complicated pricing and reduced transparency. We believe these changes will improve the profitability of our distribution partners and also result in better alignment of supply and demand, reducing the potential for excess inventory.
Finally, in order to provide our customers another channel to access Seagate products, we are planning to auction approximately 200,000 drives later this week. In addition to making drives available for those qualified customers not covered by an LTA or where LTA volumes are not sufficient to cover their needs, this will allow us to fully understand and gauge marginal pricing. We have over 50 customers already committed to participate in the first auction. Our current expectation is that we will be conducting auctions periodically during this and future quarters. 
As previously mentioned, product configurations were dramatically reduced in the December quarter. As a result, we have accelerated most of the critical product transitions we discussed in last quarter's call. We prioritized transitions in desktop, nearline and mission-critical to speed volume recovery, and we have made substantial progress in manufacturing yields across all these programs. Our 500-gigabyte per disk notebook products are still on the plan, and they will be substantially completed with this transition in the next 6 months. 
As previously reported, we closed the acquisition of Samsung's hard drive business on December 19, and our integration of the Samsung business is largely complete, and the transition has progressed as expected. The logistics to complete the shift of Samsung's disk drive operations to Seagate's system are closely coordinated, and the completion of this move is a testament to the solid work of our integration and operations team.  In the final weeks of 2011, Seagate shipped approximately 700,000 Samsung drives using Seagate's global systems.
The acquisition includes the addition of Samsung's Spinpoint M8 series to Seagate's 2.5-inch product portfolio. This product delivers industry-leading capacity and is a volume leader that will significantly improve Seagate's position as a supplier of 2.5-inch products.
As with many other product lines, external component shortages resulting from the Thailand floods have constrained the production of this product. We are now seeing incremental improvements in the ramp of this product and expect ongoing improvements throughout the calendar year. We are excited about the broader ongoing relationship with Samsung and are pleased to welcome the Samsung employees that have joined Seagate at our new Korean design center and in the sales organization.
With respect to our forecast for the remainder of the fiscal and calendar year, it is our belief that as a result of the structural damage to the supply chain, there is substantial and growing shortfall in unmet exabyte demand. We believe that the exabyte demand is growing at 40% per year, while areal density growth is increasing at less than 25% per year. We continue to expect that calendar 2012 unit demand will exceed supply, that the exabyte shortage will be more pronounced than the unit shortage, and that price declines on a like-for-like basis will be relatively benign throughout the year. We believe the industry will likely exit the calendar year with approximately 100 exabytes of unmet demand.
Based on Seagate's average capacity per drive shipped last quarter, which was the highest in the industry, this exabyte shortfall equates to approximately 150 million units. For the March quarter, we are expecting drive shipments of at least 60 million units, revenues to be at least $4.3 billion, gross margins to exceed 33% and operating expenses of approximately $405 million. Based on share repurchases completed during the month of January, fully diluted share count used in the EPS calculation is expected to be 465 million shares.
For the June quarter, we expect that our supply chain capabilities will continue to improve, which will result in revenues of at least $5 billion and gross margins comparable to those expected for the March quarter. In light of the persistent supply-demand imbalances that we believe will exist throughout the calendar year, combined with greater visibility due to our LTAs, we currently expect a relatively benign pricing environment resulting in revenues of at least $20 billion for calendar year 2012.
With respect to the capital structure and our priorities for cash, we expect to continue our practice of returning value to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase throughout the calendar year 2012. To the extent market conditions allow, we expect to engage in share repurchases, which should result in a share count of approximately 350 million by the end of the calendar year.
Last week, the Seagate board authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase program, which adds to the approximately $900 million remaining from the December 2010 authorization. Additionally, the board approved a 39% increase to our quarterly dividend from $0.18 to $0.25 per share. We believe these actions will help us maximize value for our shareholders and demonstrate our ongoing confidence in the business.
Melanie, we're now open -- ready to open up the call for questions."

We've tried to keep our pricing competitive in light of the constraints, but as I said also, leave it at levels where we don't have a lot of fluctuation to our gross margin. So in certain capacity points, pricing seems to have affected demand, and therefore, when you're running a portfolio as broad as ours, there's always opportunity to generate gross profit dollars that are a function of pricing and volume.

And on the enterprise, of course, the numbers are probably 10x that. So this is an opportunity, I think, for a lot of the customers to basically assure themselves that they have access to the product so they can then do their planning, and especially when it's against a big shortfall in demand.  I guess the analogy I use is if you lost 1/3 of the oil production in the world and everyone realized what that meant in terms of availability to gas for your car or fuel for your home, and you happen to have a relationship with a station owner down the block that happened to have stations all over the world, and they offered you the ability to basically get fuel whenever you wanted to at competitive prices, would you view that as an advantage or a disadvantage? I think it's pretty clear it's an advantage. So we have a lot of confidence that these contracts will be adhered to. They are involving the highest level of executives at the companies that we engage with them. They are mutually beneficial, they are competitive and they're giving these companies a great capability to plan their businesses going forward. And in an environment like we said, where we believe there's going to be an exabyte shortage that could -- that goes into 2013. With respect to a hybrid technology, we -- as you know, we're on our second generation of hybrid technology moving into our third generation of hybrid technology, and we're quite confident that the performance and cost aspects of the devices that we'll be delivering over the summer will be best-in-class and basically will have SSD-quality performance with marginal cost adder [ph], so we believe this is a big category for us going forward."

And don't worry, I won't take you back to 1957. So I think if you really think about December, the math lays out like this: the industry shipped 120 million units, but it only built 105 million. So I think the earlier forecast of the industry being able to ship something like 145 million for the March quarter would have been pretty spectacular in light of 105 million built, because you figure there's no inventory drawdowns that's going to occur in March, right? So you're talking about 105 million going to 145 million. I think that's a stretch. I mean, is it possible? I suppose if you mix way down in capacity, and you're only shooting for unit volume, it might theoretically be possible. But if you look at the first few weeks of production, it looks to us that the industry is on a pace to do something closer to 130 million, 135 million. You can therefore -- to me, 150 million to 160 million is probably the right number for June, again, depending on mix and recovery to the supply chain."

Yes, more volume, relatively stable pricing environment, mix, again, kind of a function of meeting our customer demands. And you've got to remember that mix is a little different than it's probably been in the last several years where we get orders from customers and then we basically work with our supply chain to address mix. It's a little bit in reverse right now. We have our supply chain that's presenting a bunch of parts to us, and then we dynamically rework every 24 hours what we can build in order to best satisfy our customers' demand. So it's a little bit in reverse, and it won't be fully recovered by June. So there's still going to be a big influence in the June quarter that says, ""Here's what we can build and how do we best address the market?"" So I think it's really a September quarter, maybe exiting the June quarter where we're going to have the flexibility that you might normally think of a company like Seagate, where you could put an order in, sometime 8 weeks ahead of time, and we could probably respond to it with our supply chain. So that all plays into it, and that's why we believe there's going to be stability to our margins, at least for the next 6 months, and probably throughout the calendar year.  And what was the first part? Sorry, CapEx. I'll let Dave answer the CapEx. The general answer is right now, we're working against, if you will, a capital -- I mean, a productive capacity that's fixed, that's not fully utilized, obviously, because of supply chain disruption. And what we're doing right now is keeping our heads down to work towards getting fuller utilization of the assets that we have. We're also in product transitions, which require technology and capital to transition. But generically, there's not a plan to put capital at work to raise that ceiling. And we wouldn't plan on doing that unless we got to, let's say, the fall, and it was clear that the unit and exabyte shortages were even more pronounced and of a longer duration than what we're thinking, which is kind of through 2013 in various forms and function. You'd then be  into lead times where you probably would have to address increasing capital, and then we would obviously come back to our strategic customers and negotiate that commitment with some sort of extension to the various LTAs because we obviously don't want to be on the hook for putting a bunch of capital to work and then have excess capacity in the industry."

It's just, first of all, when all this ends, I mean, I think there's the -- the question when does all this end, which of course is the biggest question in life. But -- and then what does it look like? And the second biggest question in life. And what I think the answer is, it doesn't end. This is a structural event that's happened, and the industry has changed. And people want to get into the simplistic model of ""and then, on July 17, it's going to be just like it was, and there's pricing is going to come down and everybody's margin."" I mean, this -- and that's just -- that's just not very sophisticated nor I think reflective of the business that we're in. And I think that what's going on right now is showing that. So I think it's a structural change and we've been saying this for a long, long time. This is structural. And what it looks like when we're through the transition -- and I would view the transition to mean, like I was saying before, when customers say ""Here's what we need,"" we can be very responsive with our supply chain and deliver commitments with what they need in very short order. That is at least 1 year out, I think, in terms of meeting the unmet demand.  So what does it look like then? It looks different, and it looks different probably forever. What does that mean in terms of business models and gross margins? I would say that it means higher than what was in place before, because by definition, what was in place before had too much risk in the model. I mean, at the end of the day, the reason the industry is going through what it's going through right now is because there was excess risk in the system. And that risk, in part, was a function of gross margins that weren't sustainable for what our industry really delivers, either in terms of productive capability or R&D and capital. So I believe when it's all said and done and partly, there's going to be more efficiencies, partly there's going to be more systems put in place. That supply availability is going to be more important than saving $0.50 on a disk drive. And if you ask any customer right now, would they rather have another million drives or would they rather save $0.50 a drive, they all will tell you, they want another million drives so they can go produce $400 million or $500 million in revenue. And I think that's what the smart strategic customers are focused on, and the smart strategic customers are the ones that are going to win."

If you asked that question 5 years ago, you would say that you have compressed margins at the front end of that transition just because you're putting a lot of capital to work in new equipment and yields are low, and then you kind of get this margin expansion that might last 4 or 5 quarters, depending on what's going on competitive with that particular product. And then you start getting some margin pressure the back end of that cycle. I think it's a little different now. You still are thinking of obviously all the issues on the front end. And in fact, it may be a little longer and tougher just because the technology is getting tougher in terms of these transitions. But I think the big difference is once you get the margin expansion, and again, when that starts to come down is a function of competitiveness, I do think that you're getting longer tails on margins just because people are driving yields a lot higher. Our industry historically would've said, ""Hey, if you get to the low 80s or mid- low 90s"" -- sorry, ""mid-80s to high 80s to low 90s on yields, then you kind of start thinking about the next product."" And that's -- it's just a different world now with these capacity points staying in production longer and what's going on competitively, we can drive yields higher than that for longer periods of time, which might give us a little longer tail on the margin, so we'll see. It's -- I think, it's kind of a new phase of the industry right now."

I mean, I don't -- we don't have a number for you yet. Maybe by next quarter we can start gauging that for you. Although, of course, as we go through time obviously, it's all Seagate. But what I will tell you, because I think you hit on a good point, is that we will learn a lot in terms of better operating models from what we've acquired at Samsung. They took a different design approach, they took a different qual approach and they took a different manufacturing approach. And there's a lot of good stuff there that we're learning that, as it turns out, we can apply to our broader portfolio, whether or not, again, that has to do with how we qual the product, how we ramp it or even how we build it. And they do a great job. The yields are very high. They run very clean factories. And at the end of the day, I think that, that's going to benefit us in terms of our operating efficiency, i.e. lower cost of goods sold for any product made. And it should have an impact that helps us throughout a product line. And I think probably by next quarter, we can maybe start scoping what we think some of that benefit is. You hit another point that pricing kind of masks what's going on. Well, it does and it doesn't. Like I said, you can see what our margins are at with price increases that were a lot lower than our competition. We're making really good progress on our cost and our yields, and we're getting through some of these transitions that are challenging. But like I said, once you get through them, then you basically have a pretty nice product to build for a while. And at these capacity points, when you're at nice round numbers like 1 and 2 terabytes and 500 gigabytes, we think these products are going to be in production for a while, so we have to be able to make them at very high yields."

Seagate's third quarter results reflect strong operating performance by the company against the backdrop of a continued recovery of the hard drive industry. Our main focus this quarter were on operational execution in order to meet our customer's requirements and returning value to our shareholders. We delivered successfully on both fronts. In our fiscal third quarter, Seagate achieved revenue of $4.4 billion, diluted earnings per share of $2.48. Cash flow from operations was $938 million and we ended the quarter with approximately $2.1 billion in cash. Through the extraordinary efforts of our suppliers and the outstanding execution from our operations, Seagate successfully delivered our portfolio of products to a broad base of customers. We also returned significant value to our shareholders this quarter, with over $1.2 billion in dividends, share repurchases and debt repurchase. The 43.1 million share repurchase during the March quarter reflected approximately 10% of the outstanding ordinary shares of the company. We increased our unit shipments by 29% over last quarter, shipping 61 million drives, which equates to approximately 42 exabytes. Shipments of our client products improved, with the notebook market almost fully recovered as expected. We expect the market for desktop drives to remain constrained, most likely through the fall. In the enterprise, the mission-critical market segment market seems to have almost fully recovered, while business-critical continues to be constrained as demand for storage continues to increase rapidly with the ongoing buildout of the cloud infrastructure. 
We believe we are well-positioned for these cloud-based trends because of our broad product portfolio, which represents several high demand sole supply product offerings. Our Samsung label products represented approximately 13% of our shipments this quarter. We are very pleased with the value this business has brought to Seagate. We've increased manufacturing capacity and have successfully increased our additional design engineering headcount by over 25% at our green design centers since the acquisition was completed. 
Gross margin for the third quarter was 37%. As expected, pricing was relatively benign in the quarter and Seagate's operational performance exceeded our expectations, as we were able to ship units at an increasing average capacity per drive with improving yields. We believe our average capacity per drive was at least 15% higher than the industry average. 
Our long-term agreements with our largest customers have been mutually successful and we delivered over 100% of our committed volume this quarter. The number of executed LTAs increased 50% this quarter. We expect these long-term agreements to account for approximately 60% of our total production capacity for the calendar year. LTA pricing was more favorable to the customer than the company's average pricing, reflecting the benefit of longer-term visibility of supply and demand. Our new auction program continues to evolve and we have multiple auctions worldwide throughout the quarter, selling 100% of the products offered at or above the company's average pricing. As the industry recovered during the quarter, supply to the distribution channel improved. Distribution pricing remains well above historical spreads with respect to OEM pricing. As the drive industry works towards bringing supply and demand into balance, there are several market dynamics that remain unsettled in addition to a variety of supply constraints that have resulted in our customers mixing download capacity requirements. Most interesting is a possible market share shift in favor of OEMs versus white box manufacturers and fulfilled through distribution. The longer-term implication of these adjustments is not entirely clear yet. Regardless, we believe there remains a substantial and growing shortfall in unmet exabyte demand resulting from the supply-chain disruptions caused by the floods. 
Consistent with industry analyst projections, we believe that the June quarter TAM will be approximately 160 million units. Given these dynamics, the pricing environment remains benign and we are raising our non-GAAP gross margin expectation to be at least 34.5% for the June quarter. We expect to achieve revenue of at least $5 billion and operating expenses of approximately $400 million to $500 million. Fully diluted share count for the June quarter is expected to be approximately 440 million. 
For the second half of the calendar year, we are planning that the industry will continue its current pace of recovery, and combined with the demand for cloud infrastructure and the introduction of Win 8 and new thin and light notebook products, the December quarter TAM should exceed 185 million units. Under these conditions, we believe Seagate will maintain market share of approximately 43% and will be on track to achieve calendar 2012 revenues of at least $20 billion. In addition, we are planning for non-GAAP gross margin's to remain above 30% exiting calendar 2012. With respect to our capital structure and priorities for cash, we expect to continue to return value to shareholders through dividends, share repurchases, and when appropriate, early retirement of debt. To the extent market and business conditions allow, we expect to continue the share repurchase at a pace to result in a basic share count of approximately 350 million shares by the end of the calendar year. Melanie, we're now ready to open up the call for questions."

I think when we had our call in January, the reason we were probably a little under the 140 million was that when we looked at the billed rates for the first 3 weeks of January, it was extremely low. And it wasn't clear to us that the industry would be able to ramp to the 140 million or 140 million plus that were shipped. I think a lot of that was done by continuing mix down, which is done of course while addressing unit shortfall, which is good in terms of getting drives into our customers' hands, we can keep demand overall strong. It's obviously addressing this exabyte shortage that we're focused on as well."

What we said in January is that we thought that the June quarter would be basically a minimum equal to what we guided in March, 33%. We're saying 34.5% now. Our performance in the March quarter was benefited by some really outstanding operational execution and we certainly hope to deliver on that in the June quarter as well. If we do, then we will obviously outperform our plan of at least 34.5%. I think to your question, this is like do you say potato, do I say potato, are margins going up or are margins going down? I think the things that are putting pressure on margins would be for us, as we continue to mix up our notebook product, and a lot of it is what we acquired from Samsung. Obviously, the notebook product pricing from a perspective is lower than average and margins, we don't really talk about margins by products or markets. I'm not going to do that here. But there's also this issue that I try to point out between distribution and then the OEM distribution mix. So clearly, with the distribution price premium being significantly higher than the historical norm right now, to the extent that distribution regains more of that white box share, then that would benefit our margins. To the extent that the OEMs continue to take share there, then that would obviously result in lower margins and we have our own view on how that all plays out, which is highly competitive. But when it's all said and done, that's how we get through our gross line margin guidance. I think the other big thing is what you hit is we're working through some product transitions here that are pretty significant. We've really transitioned the entire portfolio over the last 6 months, which again I think is a real statement of the company's performance operationally to not only where we're chasing a supply chain that was severely disrupted but we actually were transitioning probably the hardest technical transitions that the industry has gone through. And as we do that, as you know, that allows us to obviously have margin relief. And so as we mix up in either capacity or as we mix to the newer products and then as yields grow on those products, that would obviously benefit margins. So you have all the triggers of net-net, which ones influence the margins which way and our modeling basically results in the guidance that we gave."

So it's different markets, different products have many different dynamics. I think like Steve alluded to, the box count has gone up but the average gigabyte per drive in the industry went down appreciably as a function of this mix down to basically chase that because there's such a dearth of the CDs in the past 6 months. Now going forward, the question is does that dynamic continue to those low capacity points, if you will? Or do we start to grow up the value chain for more capacity from the box? And then obviously with the cloud growing, those are high-capacity drives as well. So I think we will be available to be able to do that. I personally just knowing the supply chain the way I do, I don't feel that numbers that are much more than that are really capable industries really capable of.

Given the commentary about basically meeting supply and demand in the quarter for those 2 segments in particular, can you just talk about with the customers that have signed LTAs, how their behavior was at the moment of balance?

Pricing is effectively done for the LTA customers for the June quarter and as Pat just indicated, there's been little change to no change in pricing overall. I would say that the behavior through the quarter is there's been a lot of continued chasing of demand, even in those 2 segments. What we've noticed is the LTA customers seem to be taking share and what's really interesting is the LTA customers with the longer-term LTAs seem to be even taking more share. And that maybe a function of their ability to do some long-range planning knowing that they have the supply available, particularly in some of these product categories where Seagate is sole supplier and is likely to be a sole supplier for anywhere up to 12 to 18 months. So I'd say in general, as notebook came in to balance, the pricing has remained totally stable. And basically, it's the same thing in mission-critical business. And I think pricing is really a function of an industry that has a lot of capital to recover, probably at least a couple of billion dollars after we reabsorb into the industry and the supply chain is still not functioning anywhere near where we need it to be functioning and that's our job to address this as an industry, is to be able to more closely align supply and demand with our customers."

I think it was the very first question. I don't know if you were on the call or not. If you weren't, I'll just repeat it briefly. One is that there seems to be a shift going on right now between OEMs and distribution. That's not clearly understood in terms of how long it's going to last. But to the extent that it's a more permanent shift and given the fact that distribution pricing substantially higher than OEM, then that would obviously reduce the lower margin structure. That's Seagate because of our share gains in notebook as a result of the Samsung acquisition, our mix is basically increasing more notebook drives and that's putting margin pressure on us as well. And then to your point, we hope to offset that with mix up and with yield improvement. Did I miss anything?"

So it's not really a comment on in the health of our channel partners because they're fine. They can either take drives and motherboards and some of the white box companies or they can ship both systems and there might the marketing. They actually like shipping whole systems better. I think with the price deltas at the component level that we've seen going into the channel, that's provided an opportunity for the OEMs, and especially for the OEMs that have had supply visibility through the LTAs to gain share. How that plays out I think is a good question and we're just going to have to watch it. That's one of the issues around, if you will, supply in the channel.

Our main focus this quart",855,"Thanks, Kate. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. Seagate's third quarter results reflect strong operating performance by the company against the backdrop of a continued recovery of the hard drive industry. Our main focus this quarter were on operational execution in order to meet our customer's requirements and returning value to our shareholders. We delivered successfully on both fronts.
In our fiscal third quarter, Seagate achieved revenue of $4.4 billion, diluted earnings per share of $2.48. Cash flow from operations was $938 million and we ended the quarter with approximately $2.1 billion in cash. Through the extraordinary efforts of our suppliers and outstanding execution from our operations, Seagate successfully delivered our portfolio of products to a broad base of customers. We also returned significant value to our shareholders this quarter, with over $1.2 billion in dividends, share repurchases and debt repurchase. The 43.1 million share repurchased during the March quarter reflected approximately 10% of the outstanding ordinary shares of the company.
We increased our unit shipments by 29% over last quarter, shipping 61 million drives, which equates to approximately 42 exabytes. Shipments of our client products improved, with the notebook market almost fully recovered, as expected. We expect the market for desktop drives to remain constrained, most likely through the fall. In the enterprise, the mission-critical market segment market seems to have almost fully recovered, while business-critical continues to be constrained as demand for storage continues to increase rapidly with the ongoing build out of the cloud infrastructure.
We believe we are well-positioned for these cloud-based trends because of our broad product portfolio, which represents several high-demand, sole-supply product offerings. Our Samsung label products represented approximately 13% of our shipments this quarter. We are very pleased with the value this business has brought to Seagate. We have increased manufacturing capacity and have successfully increased our additional design engineering headcount by over 25% at our Korean design centers since the acquisition was completed.
Gross margin for the third quarter was 37%. As expected, pricing was relatively benign in the quarter and Seagate's operational performance exceeded our expectations, as we were able to ship units at an increasing average capacity per drive with improving yields. We believe our average capacity per drive was at least 15% higher than the industry average.
Our long-term agreements with our largest customers have been mutually successful and we delivered over 100% of our committed volume this quarter. The number of executed LTAs increased to 50% this quarter. We expect these long-term agreements to account for approximately 60% of our total production capacity for the calendar year. LTA pricing was more favorable to the customer than the company's average pricing, reflecting the benefit of longer-term visibility of supply and demand. Our new auction program continues to evolve and we held multiple auctions worldwide throughout the quarter, selling 100% of the products offered at or above the company's average pricing.
As the industry recovered during the quarter, supply to the distribution channel improved. Distribution pricing remains well above historical spreads with respect to OEM pricing. As the drive industry works towards bringing supply and demand into balance, there are several market dynamics that remain unsettled in addition to a variety of supply constraints that have resulted in our customers mixing down their capacity requirements. Most interesting is a possible market share shift in favor of OEMs versus white box manufacturers who fulfill through distribution. The longer-term implication of these adjustments is not entirely clear yet. Regardless, we believe there remains a substantial and growing shortfall in unmet exabyte demand resulting from the supply-chain disruptions caused by the floods.
Consistent with industry analyst projections, we believe that the June quarter TAM will be approximately 160 million units. Given these dynamics, the pricing environment remains benign and we are raising our non-GAAP gross margin expectation to be at least 34.5% for the June quarter. We expect to achieve revenue of at least $5 billion and operating expenses of approximately $400 million to $500 million. Fully diluted share count for the June quarter is expected to be approximately 440 million.
For the second half of the calendar year, we are planning that the industry will continue its current pace of recovery, and combined with the demand for cloud infrastructure and the introduction of Win 8 and new thin and light notebook products, the December quarter TAM should exceed 185 million units. Under these conditions, we believe Seagate will maintain market share of approximately 43% and will be on track to achieve calendar 2012 revenues of at least $20 billion. In addition, we are planning for non-GAAP gross margin's to remain above 30% exiting calendar 2012.
With respect to our capital structure and priorities for cash, we expect to continue to return value to shareholders through dividends, share repurchases, and when appropriate, early retirement of debt. To the extent market and business conditions allow, we expect to continue the share repurchase at a pace to result in a basic share count of approximately 350 million shares by the end of the calendar year.
Melanie, we're now ready to open up the call for questions."

I think when we had our call in January, the reason we were probably a little under the 140 million was that when we looked at the build rates for the first 3 weeks of January, it was extremely low. And we weren't -- it wasn't clear to us if the industry would be able to ramp to the 140 million or 140 million-plus that were shipped. And I think a lot of that was done by continuing mix down, which is done of course while addressing unit shortfall, which is good in terms of getting drives into our customers' hands, so we can keep demand overall strong. It's obviously addressing this exabyte shortage that we're focused on as well."

Well, I guess one of the challenge that we guided down, we actually guided up relative to what we said in January. What we said in January is that we thought that the June quarter would be basically a minimum equal to what we guided in March. This 33%, we're saying 34.5% now. Our performance in the March quarter was benefited by some really outstanding operational execution and we certainly hope to deliver on that in the June quarter as well. And if we do, then we will obviously outperform our plan of at least 34.5%. I think to your question of this is like, do you say potato, do I say potato, are margins going up, are margins going down? I think the things that are putting pressure on margins would be for us, as we continue to mix up our notebook product, and a lot of it is what we acquired from Samsung. Obviously, the notebook product pricing, so from an AUP perspective is lower than average. And then margins, we don't really talk about margins by products or markets. I'm not going to do that here. But there's also this issue that I try to point out between distribution and then the OEM distribution mix. So clearly, with the OE -- with the distribution price premium being significantly higher than historical norm right now, to the extent that distribution regains more of that white box share, then that would benefit our margins. To the extent that the OEMs continue to take share there, then that would obviously result in lower margins and we have our own view on how that all plays out, which is highly competitive. But when it's all said and done, that's how we get through our gross margin guidance. I think the other big thing, is what you hit, is we're working through some product transitions here that are pretty significant. We've really transitioned the entire portfolio over the last 6 months, which again, I think is a real statement of the company's performance operationally to not only where we're chasing a supply chain that was severely disrupted but we actually were transitioning probably with the hardest technical transitions that the industry has gone through. And as we do that, as you know, that allows us to obviously have margin relief. And so as we mix up in either capacity or as we mix to the newer products and then as yields grow on those products, that would obviously benefit margins. So you got all the triggers of net-net, which ones influence the margins, which way, and our modeling basically results in the guidance that we gave."

And as Pat just indicated, there's been little change to no change in pricing overall. I would say that the behavior through the quarter is there's been a lot of continued chasing of demand, even in those 2 segments. What we've noticed is the LTA customers seem to be taking share and what's really interesting is the LTA customers with the longer-term LTAs seem to be even taking more share. And that may be a function of their ability to do some long-range planning knowing that they have the supply available, particularly in some of these product categories where Seagate is a sole supplier and is likely to be a sole supplier for anywhere up to 12 to 18 months. So I'd say, in general, as notebook came into balance, the pricing has remained fairly stable and certainly, the same thing in mission-critical business grew. And I think pricing is really a function of an industry that has a lot of capital to recover, probably at least a couple of billion dollars have to be reabsorb into the industry, and the supply chain is still not functioning anywhere near where we need it to be functioning, and that's our job to address this throughout the industry, is to be able to more closely align supply and demand with our customers' needs."

The channel is kind of like the last customer base, if you will, to kind of get a flow of drive certainly from Seagate as we supported our LTA customers. And again, I think there's also this issue around, how much of the channel business is being fulfilled by the systems vendor. So it's not really a comment on the health of our channel partners because they're fine. They can either take drives and motherboards in some of the white box companies or they can ship whole systems and there might the marketing, that says they actually like shipping whole systems better. I think with the price deltas at the component level that we've seen going into the channel, that's provided an opportunity for the OEMs, and especially for the OEMs that have had supply visibility through the LTAs to gain share. How that plays out, I think, is a good question and we're just going to have to watch it. That's one of the issues around, if you will, supply in the channel. So we're watching it very close and to the extent that we feel that the channel isn't moving the product, then we'll probably see that in the OEM side, because clearly, at the end of the day, all those bars and systems integrators need disk drives."

They do very well with certain products and we expect that they're going to continue to be a relevant player in the tune of 14% to 16% market share, which is still a nice business.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. Seagate's third quarter results reflect strong operating performance by the company against the backdrop of a continued recovery of the hard drive industry. Our main focus this quart",855,"Thanks, Kate. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. Seagate's third quarter results reflect strong operating performance by the company against the backdrop of a continued recovery of the hard drive industry. Our main focus this quarter were on operational execution in order to meet our customers' requirements and returning value to our shareholders. We delivered successfully on both fronts.
In our fiscal third quarter, Seagate achieved revenue of $4.4 billion, diluted earnings per share of $2.48. Cash flow from operations was $938 million and we ended the quarter with approximately $2.1 billion in cash. Through the extraordinary efforts of our suppliers and outstanding execution from our operations, Seagate successfully delivered our portfolio of products to a broad base of customers. We also returned significant value to our shareholders this quarter, with over $1.2 billion in dividends, share repurchases and debt repurchase. The 43.1 million share repurchased during the March quarter reflected approximately 10% of the outstanding ordinary shares of the company.
We increased our unit shipments by 29% over last quarter, shipping 61 million drives, which equates to approximately 42 exabytes. Shipments of our client products improved, with the notebook market almost fully recovered, as expected. We expect the market for desktop drives to remain constrained, most likely through the fall. In the enterprise, the mission-critical market segment market seems to have almost fully recovered, while business-critical continues to be constrained as demand for storage continues to increase rapidly with the ongoing build out of the cloud infrastructure.
We believe we are well-positioned for these cloud-based trends because of our broad product portfolio, which represents several high-demand, sole-supply product offerings. Our Samsung label products represented approximately 13% of our shipments this quarter. We are very pleased with the value this business has brought to Seagate. We have increased manufacturing capacity and have successfully increased our additional design engineering headcount by over 25% at our Korean design center since the acquisition was completed.
Gross margin for the third quarter was 37%. As expected, pricing was relatively benign in the quarter and Seagate's operational performance exceeded our expectations, as we were able to ship units at an increasing average capacity per drive with improving yields. We believe our average capacity per drive was at least 15% higher than the industry average.
Our long-term agreements with our largest customers have been mutually successful and we delivered over 100% of our committed volume this quarter. The number of executed LTAs increased to 50% this quarter. We expect these long-term agreements to account for approximately 60% of our total production capacity for the calendar year. LTA pricing was more favorable to the customer than the company's average pricing, reflecting the benefit of longer-term visibility of supply and demand. Our new auction program continues to evolve and we held multiple auctions worldwide throughout the quarter, selling 100% of the products offered at or above the company's average pricing.
As the industry recovered during the quarter, supply to the distribution channel improved. Distribution pricing remains well above historical spreads with respect to OEM pricing. As the drive industry works towards bringing supply and demand into balance, there are several market dynamics that remained unsettled in addition to a variety of supply constraints that have resulted in our customers mixing down their capacity requirements. Most interesting is a possible market share shift in favor of OEMs versus white box manufacturers who fulfill through distribution. The longer-term implication of these adjustments is not entirely clear yet. Regardless, we believe there remains a substantial and growing shortfall in unmet exabyte demand resulting from the supply-chain disruptions caused by the floods.
Consistent with industry analyst projections, we believe that the June quarter TAM will be approximately 160 million units. Given these dynamics, the pricing environment remains benign and we are raising our non-GAAP gross margin expectation to be at least 34.5% for the June quarter. We expect to achieve revenue of at least $5 billion and operating expenses of approximately $400 million to $500 million. Fully diluted share count for the June quarter is expected to be approximately 440 million.
For the second half of the calendar year, we are planning that the industry will continue its current pace of recovery, and combined with the demand for cloud infrastructure and the introduction of Win 8 and new thin and light notebook products, the December quarter TAM should exceed 185 million units. Under these conditions, we believe Seagate will maintain market share of approximately 43% and will be on track to achieve calendar 2012 revenues of at least $20 billion. In addition, we are planning for non-GAAP gross margins to remain above 30% exiting calendar 2012.
With respect to our capital structure and priorities for cash, we expect to continue to return value to shareholders through dividends, share repurchases, and when appropriate, early retirement of debt. To the extent market and business conditions allow, we expect to continue the share repurchase at a pace to result in a basic share count of approximately 350 million shares by the end of the calendar year.

I think when we had our call in January, the reason we were probably a little under the 140 million was that when we looked at the build rates for the first 3 weeks of January, it was extremely low. And we weren't -- it wasn't clear to us if the industry would be able to ramp to the 140 million or 140 million-plus that were shipped.

Well, I guess I want to challenge that we guided down, we actually guided up relative to what we said in January. What we said in January is that we thought that the June quarter would be basically a minimum equal to what we guided in March, which was 33%, we're saying 34.5% now. Our performance in the March quarter was benefited by some really outstanding operational execution and we certainly hope to deliver on that in the June quarter as well. And if we do, then we will obviously outperform our plan of at least 34.5%. I think to your question of this is like, do you say potato, do I say potato, are margins going up, are margins going down? I think the things that are putting pressure on margins would be for us, as we continue to mix up our notebook product, and a lot of it is what we acquired from Samsung. Obviously, the notebook product pricing, so from an AUP perspective is lower than average. And then margins, we don't really talk about margins by products or markets. I'm not going to do that here. But there's also this issue that I try to point out between distribution and then the OEM distribution mix. So clearly, with the OE -- with the distribution price premium being significantly higher than historical norm right now, to the extent that distribution regains more of that white box share, then that would benefit our margins. To the extent that the OEMs continue to take share there, then that would obviously result in lower margins and we have our own view on how that all plays out, which is highly competitive. But when it's all said and done, that's how we get to our gross margin guidance. I think the other big thing, is what you hit, is we're working through some product transitions here that are pretty significant. We've really transitioned the entire portfolio over the last 6 months, which again, I think is a real statement of the company's performance operationally to not only were we chasing a supply chain that was severely disrupted but we actually were transitioning probably with the hardest technical transitions that the industry has gone through. And as we do that, as you know, that allows us to obviously have margin relief. And so as we mix up in either capacity or as we mix to the newer products and then as yields grow on those products, that would obviously benefit margins. So you got all the triggers of net-net, which ones influence the margins, which way, and our modeling basically results in the guidance that we gave."

What we've noticed is the LTA customers seem to be taking share and what's really interesting is the LTA customers with the longer-term LTAs seem to be even taking more share. And that may be a function of their ability to do some longer-range planning knowing that they have the supply available, particularly in some of these product categories where Seagate is a sole supplier and is likely to be a sole supplier for anywhere up to 12 to 18 months. So I'd say, in general, as notebook came into balance, the pricing has remained fairly stable and certainly, the same thing in mission-critical business grew [ph]. And I think pricing is really a function of an industry that has a lot of capital to recover, probably at least a couple of billion dollars have to be reabsorbed into the industry, and the supply chain is still not functioning anywhere near where we need it to be functioning, and that's our job through the rest of this year as an industry, is to be able to more closely align supply and demand with our customers' needs."

How much more improvements do you think you have to make relative to the supply chain and just your own internal production?

I'm never going to be totally happy with them but they're way ahead of plan right now and that's flowing through our numbers quite a bit. Are we done yet? There's a couple of product transitions that I think we still have yet to finish but I'd say, like we talked about last quarter, mission-critical, business-critical, those are the product transitions are complete now. The desktop transition is largely complete and we'll balance that as time goes on. And then notebook products are still in the process of transitioning. The notebook yields, though, I'm very happy with the progress we've made last quarter. So mix aside, I think in these products we're doing well."

That's where all the petabyte growth is and whether or not it is private or public clouds to changing infrastructure that is back-end storage weighted.

So I think there's absolutely big growth and whether or not it's some sliver or Tier 0, that's SSD or bigger piece of Tier 0 that's hybrid or the rest of it, which is 95% of it, which is going to be rotating mass storage. That's just the big petabyte growth requirement that we're going to be chasing hard as an industry. In the enterprise, those numbers are probably in the 40% to 50% annual growth rates and their density growth, as you know, is half that. So that's a big puzzle for the industry to solve.

I think with the price deltas at the component level that we've seen going into the channel, that's provided an opportunity for the OEMs, and especially for the OEMs that have had supply visibility through the LTAs to gain share. How that plays out, I think, is a good question and we're just going to have to watch it. That's one of the issues around, if you will, supply in the channel.

It's been an honor to be such an important part of the business transformation of this leading industrial country, and we thank all the employees, community members and government officials who have played such an important role in Seagate's overall success. 
Seagate's fourth quarter and year-end results reflect the overall strong operational performance by the company and our commitment to returning value to our shareholders. In the June quarter, we achieved record revenues of $4.5 billion and record shipments of 66 million units, which represented an approximately 42% market share.
We had very strong profitability with non-GAAP net income of $1 billion and diluted earnings per share of $2.41. Non-GAAP gross margin was 33.6%. Fiscal 2012 revenues were $14.9 billion, with non-GAAP net income of $3 billion and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $6.75 and non-GAAP gross margins of 31.7%. 
We also achieved record operating cash flow of $1.4 billion in the June quarter, and we returned over 90% of our operating cash flow for the quarter to shareholders in the form of dividends and share redemptions. As further evidence of our commitment to returning value to our shareholders and as a reflection of our confidence in the company's future, we announced today that we have raised our quarterly dividend payout 28% to $0.32 per share. 
For the fiscal year, Seagate generated over $3.2 billion in operating cash flow, of which we returned over 85% to shareholders through dividends and share redemptions. We ended the quarter and the fiscal year with approximately $2.2 billion in cash, restricted cash and short-term investments. We are on plan to reduce our share count to 350 million ordinary shares outstanding by calendar year end 2012. 
Assuming market and macroeconomic conditions and the company's performance and valuation metrics are similar to what they are today, we plan to reduce our share count to 250 million ordinary shares by calendar year end 2014. Given the assumptions stated above, we expect that we will continue to increase our dividend payments in a meaningful manner while continuing our redemption plan over the course of the next several years.
We achieved many of our goals in the June quarter and set records in revenue and unit shipments. There were, however, a few areas where we did not perform as expected, which we highlighted in our preliminary results announcement a few weeks ago. I'll discuss the dynamics of the quarter and our thoughts on the business outlook for the September quarter and fiscal year 2013. 
Looking at our overall business activity in the quarter, we executed on our OEM agreements, and we resumed more typical volume shipments to the channel and retail markets. Overall, unconstrained demand was lower than we expected going into the quarter. Against this demand profile, industry shipments have ramped to the point where supply and demand have come back in the balance earlier than we have believed at the start of the quarter. 
The company is encouraged by its performance in transitioning to the next-generation technology across its entire portfolio. We believe Seagate is leading in technology transitions in all product categories. As a result, our inventory is comprised primarily of the newest generation products. 
In our Enterprise business, we had a strong year-over-year growth, reflecting demand for common infrastructure buildouts and enterprise storage. Our shipments to call the applications grew faster than the market, increasing 70% year-over-year. 
Offsetting some of this strength in the quarter was an isolated supplier issue in one of our mission-critical products that impacted our Enterprise business. From an operations standpoint, it was a unique problem that required a thorough and timely investigation in order to determine the root cause. Given the nature of the problem, which was a powerful contaminant coming from a supplier 3 levels down in the supply chain, determining the root cause was a challenging endeavor. Once we identified the issue, we were able to switch to an alternate supplier, and we resumed shipping the product within the June quarter. 
Despite our efforts to solve this issue quickly, the timing we're out of the market impacted Enterprise sales by approximately 1.5 million hard drives. As a result, our earnings were impacted by approximately $0.48 per share. 
We recognize the fact that an issue like this requires additional engagement with our customers to regain their confidence. Given the overall strength of our, shipments were relatively flat sequentially and our share decreased marginally to 56%. Our notebook drive sales were up 12%, resulting in nearly twice the sequential growth of the market due to the strength of the 7-millimeter product line and the successful ramp of the Samsung product line. 
Our consumer electronics and retail businesses achieved sequential growth, and during the June quarter, we made an important investment in our retail business with the proposed acquisition of LaCie, known for its premium external storage business. 
The overall breadth and depth of our hard drive product portfolio leads the industry, and we are aligning our technology roadmap to broaden our ability to provide customers with hybrid and solid-state products that leverage NAND flash technology. To facilitate this effort, we announced today that Gary Gentry will be rejoining Seagate as Senior Vice President and General Manager of our SSD business. Prior to rejoining Seagate, Gary was General Manager of Micron's Enterprise SSD business. 
In the fall, we will be introducing our third-generation client hybrid drives, which will be in the 7-millimeter form factor. We will also be shipping demonstration units of our Enterprise hybrid drives later this calendar year. We are encouraged by our engagements to date on this product as several OEMs have requested exclusive access to this technology. 
In addition to the Enterprise SSD products we are shipping today, our technology partnership with Samsung has progressed on plan and has resulted in a highly competitive Tier 0 product. We expect to be shipping customer test units of this product at the end of this quarter. 
To further deepen our SSD capabilities, we made a strategic investment in Densbits technology, and we are also jointly developing a next-generation solid state controller technology with Densbits that is focused on breaking through current costs, reliability and performance benchmarks in the client and enterprise markets. 
We continue to believe that hybrid drives and SSDs are an important complementary technology to HDDs. We are confident in our approach to these markets where we leverage our customer relationships and technical capabilities and focus on building core technology with strategic partners to produce best-in-class devices and solutions. 
Turning to our September quarter outlook. We believe that the industry is operating with sufficient supply -- with supply sufficient to meet demands. We continue to monitor several key indicators in the market, including macroeconomic dynamics, overall PC demand, product mix, growth in tablets and smartphones, the upcoming release of Windows 8 and the numerous thin and light product initiatives. 
Based on current planning indications from a broad base of customers, we are approaching the September quarter conservatively, focusing on supply-demand balance and are currently aligning our business for relatively flat demand sequentially and continued improvement in the average capacity per drive shipped. 
For the September quarter, we expect to maintain market share, achieve revenue of approximately $4 billion, deliver gross margins exceeding 30% and have operating expenses that remain relatively flat. At this time, we believe that December quarter's addressable market will improve from the September quarter, and these conditions will put us on a path of revenues of at least $17 billion in calendar 2012 and exiting the year with margins above 30%. 
For fiscal 2013, assuming modest market growth, we are planning to maintain market share and deliver at least 25% annual growth in non-GAAP earnings. 
With respect to our capital structure and priorities for cash, as previously discussed, we expect to continue to enhance shareholder value through dividends and share redemptions.

I think the issues that you have to think about are mixed more maybe than pricing and how mix relates to pricing and AUPs. So with the pricing overall being relatively high compared to preflood, a lot of the OEMs have mixed down in order to preserve the budgets that they have going towards storage. So it's one of the factors that we are still learning a lot about in terms of what happens with different pricing moves different capacity point and how does that result in volume changes and how does that result in AUP changes. So price erosion is one measure but AUP is another. And so we try and think about AUPs that aren't hopefully falling that very high rates in the course, one of the things you can prevent AUPs falling is adding mixed up. What we're continuing to model with our customers in order to help them achieve what they're trying to achieve is also maintaining the benign kind of environment we have. And it's fairly consistent with the outlook that was given by WD also in light of, I think, a September quarter that right now is a little bit vague from the OEM perspective so we want to make sure that we're cautious in terms of what the OEMs are seeing. And I guess we'll hear more about that in a month or so when 2 of the biggest OEMs report."

And we've kind of consistently said that in the enterprise, we view this as a 2015 market where we want to be significantly engaged and I feel like we're still on that path. Our work with Samsung has really progressed very, very well. We feel very good about the performance of the controller that we developed with them, and we're getting really quite good feedback from the test beds that we run, which we run at kind of enterprise HDD grade, which is quite a bit more stressful than what a lot of the SSD companies were on. So I do feel good about the path that we're on, and our paths, like I said, is really leveraging our customer relationships, leveraging a lot about with enterprise, storage and enterprise workloads and then complementing that with significant technology. So if there's technologies out there that we feel are going to be important going forward, then that's something we investigate ethically in a partnership and manner as we've done so far. Densbits, I think, is really an indication of what I would say next, next generation. It's really about a controller technology that has the potential for significantly reducing the overall cost of the flash in both enterprise and client applications. And we're hard at work with them. We haven't disclosed yet when we expect to deliver a jointly developed technology, but we'd probably be talking to that more specifically in the September analyst meeting.

First just on Samsung if you can give us a view into, I don't know whether contribution in terms of percentage of units or just where that integration stands. And then secondly, just keeping with the flash discussion, you guys historically have obviously been the biggest proponents of hybrid drives. But if you look at the interest that's building in just using a flat-yield small flash cache module plus the drive, where do you see that demand shaking out versus hybrid? I mean, do you think that's an interim step were willing to really get to 3 setups drive-only, full hybrid and then maybe in between using the flash cache plus the drive?"

From a sales perspective, it's a separate entity. So everything that's revolved around the customer interaction, product planning, order, pricing, commitments, roadmaps that's all a separate team. And that would continue to be in place under the requirements of through at least December this year, depending on whether or not the agreement with Magticom terminates at that time or not. So it's integrated as much as we can and it's operating well, and we don't break out separately the unit volumes of the Samsung product line. On your question on hybrid and flash cache modules, I mean, not to discredit any other great technology companies, we believe there are certain performance advantages to a real hybrid device. And we still believe that, that's got some performance characteristics, both in terms of endurance and absolute performance that are better than other alternatives. But my guess is you have you lots of different implementations of how flash presents itself in a system even with people calling things hybrid drives that maybe wouldn't call a hybrid drive i.e. you could stick some flash and between that you ram and rotating risk and call it a hybrid but if you don't have the algorithms that we've developed over the 3 or 4 years to optimize one and how you cash both on rotating medias as well as on the silicon and error correction code and, there is going to be a lot of different flavors out here. So again for us, I think the benchmark that we've tried to establish in our portfolio whether or not it's on the client side or on the enterprise side is maintaining or bettering HDD performance, which is a technology that is robust and is standing the test of time on workloads. And I think it's one of the biggest challenges of flash obviously, is write performance and write endurance especially as you get to small and linear density or newer technologies that have to be compute grid is one thing that's done something down on the memory stick and it's another to be really maintaining your corporate data in it. And so that's what we think we bring a lot of value add in the equation. So yes, I think there will all sorts of different versions, not just 3 but we're primarily focused on hybrid and full SSD along with HDD at this point."

Well, I was just going to say no but since you said in the December quarter, look, I think it's -- you're on the point, which is that the industry, I think, has to be very cautious about maintaining supply-demand balance this quarter, particularly in light of the macroeconomic conditions, potential issues around our fiscal cliff and then weighing that against an opportunity in the December quarter that we're actually pretty bullish on, primarily driven by Windows 8. So it's just something that we're going to watch very closely and probably going into the quarter fairly conservatively in terms of build and inventory management. Again, I think it's important to recognize that in the case of Seagat, I'm not saying that it's not the case in WD, it's just not in my position to talk to them. We're really running full on now with all of our new technology transitions. So across the portfolio, on the products that we're building, our products that we'll be building for a couple of years at least. Therefore, the management of the inventory is important but we never kind of feel bad that we're stuck with some ""stale technology or stale products."" So it's something we're watching closely. Where do I think people are? I think it's hard to say right now. The June quarter is always a tough quarter, and then you flow in the July and August which are slowing in the September usually is very strong. So I think it's just something that we have to keep an active engagement with our customers on and make sure that neither us at the component level or they at the systems level get too out of balance.

And the fact that September is down seems pretty conserve -- flat seems pretty consistent with what most technology companies are saying, which is they feel like it's still beautiful, they're still fairly confident about December and the first half of 2013. So now obviously flat relative to what a normal September would be, you could argue is down 5% or 7%, right? I think that's a reflection of what we're reading in the newspaper everyday.

It's been going on for 4 to 5 years really. And in terms of the OEMs, since we've had OEMs that have asked us for exclusivity, I would say that it would really obnoxious for them to ask for exclusivity that will require redundancy will probably get over that heartache. The performance on these drives and certain attributes that certain segments require is pretty impressive given the dollar investment relative to pure SSD. So it's a pretty exciting opportunity, and I think people will feel quite comfortable. Probably half of our portfolio, we're the only company that provides right now. So it's not like we're not sole sourced through a lot of our customers in the enterprise. Most of the small form factors SSD products, we're really the only supplier of right now so that's something that they're pretty comfortable with."

So Dave, you can answer the question about what our direct shipments were over the course of the quarter.

So we got those tailwinds behind us, and of course, the one that why we put it near to the 30 and we're not talking how close is that, there are macro concerns that we're just going to be very partial about but our goal is to exceed what we're putting out there, but we're also being very cautious.

But at 3x cash flow, I think, everyone's or 4x cash flow or whatever the company's trading right now, it makes sense obviously to reduce the equity base and then continue to increase dividends and as I said in a meaningful way. So that's the plan and I think in September, we'll probably a little more descriptive in terms of how we review our payout ratio, if you will, and how we split that between dividends and buyback. But again, the dynamic situation that's driven primarily as a function of company performance and valuation metrics, we're not ignoring either one of them. We think that they're both important to enhance the value of the shareholders that's primarily driven obviously by our in terms of our operating performance. And we're going to continue to have an active dialogue and hopefully strike balance that satisfies both classes of investors that like to see a smaller share base and those that like to see a bigger dividend. And we honestly think we can do both and I think we've shown that we can do both. So we'll stay on the path as long as the operating performance is there.
Okay, great. So with that, I think again on behalf of the entire management team, I want to thank our employees, our customers, partners, suppliers and shareholders for your support and your commitment and we look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Thanks a lot."

As Kate mentioned, we are in 2 locations today. Pat and I are in Cupertino, and Dave is in Singapore. We've just celebrated the 30th anniversary of Seagate's Singapore operations. It's been an honor to be such an important part of the business transformation of this leading industrial country, and we thank all the employees, community members and government officials who have played such an important role in Seagate's overall success. 
Seagate's fourth quarter and year-end results reflect the overall strong operational performance by the company and our commitment to returning value to our shareholders. In the June quarter, we achieved record revenues of $4.5 billion and record shipments of 66 million units, which represented an approximately 42% market share.
We had very strong profitability with non-GAAP net income of $1 billion and diluted earnings per share of $2.41. Non-GAAP gross margin was 33.6%. Fiscal 2012 revenues were $14.9 billion, with non-GAAP net income of $3 billion and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $6.75 and non-GAAP gross margins of 31.7%. We also achieved record operating cash flow of $1.4 billion in the June quarter, and we returned over 90% of our operating cash flow for the quarter to shareholders in the form of dividends and share redemptions. 
As further evidence of our commitment to returning value to our shareholders and as a reflection of our confidence in the company's future, we announced today that we have raised our quarterly dividend payout 28% to $0.32 per share. For the fiscal year, Seagate generated over $3.2 billion in operating cash flow, of which we returned over 85% to shareholders through dividends and share redemptions. We ended the quarter and the fiscal year with approximately $2.2 billion in cash, restricted cash and short-term investments. 
We are on plan to reduce our share count to 350 million ordinary shares outstanding by calendar year-end 2012. Assuming market and macroeconomic conditions and the company's performance and valuation metrics are similar to what they are today, we plan to reduce our share count to 250 million ordinary shares by calendar year-end 2014. Given the assumptions stated above, we expect that we will continue to increase our dividend payments in a meaningful manner while continuing our redemption plan over the course of the next several years.
We achieved many of our goals in the June quarter and set records in revenue and unit shipments. There were, however, a few areas where we did not perform as expected, which we highlighted in our preliminary results announcement a few weeks ago. I'll discuss the dynamics of the quarter and our thoughts on the business outlook for the September quarter and fiscal year 2013. 
Looking at our overall business activity in the quarter, we executed on our OEM agreements, and we resumed more typical volume shipments to the channel and retail markets. Overall unconstrained demand was lower than we expected going into the quarter. Against this demand profile, industry shipments have ramped to the point where supply and demand have come back into balance earlier than we had believed at the start of the quarter. 
The company is encouraged by its performance in transitioning to the next-generation technology across its entire portfolio. We believe Seagate is leading in technology transitions in all product categories. As a result, our inventory is comprised primarily of the newest generation products. 
In our enterprise business, we had a strong year-over-year growth, reflecting demand for cloud infrastructure build-outs and enterprise storage. Our shipments to cloud applications grew faster than the market, increasing 70% year-over-year. 
Offsetting some of this strength in the quarter was an isolated supplier issue in one of our mission-critical products that impacted our enterprise business. From an operations standpoint, it was a unique problem that required a thorough and timely investigation in order to determine the root cause. Given the nature of the problem, which was a particle contaminant coming from a supplier 3 levels down in the supply chain, determining the root cause was a challenging endeavor. Once we identified the issue, we were able to switch to an alternate supplier, and we resumed shipping the product within the June quarter. 
Despite our efforts to solve this issue quickly, the time we were out of the market impacted enterprise sales by approximately 1.5 million hard drives. As a result, our earnings were impacted by approximately $0.48 per share. 
We recognize the fact that an issue like this requires additional engagement with our customers to regain their confidence. Given the overall strength of our [indiscernible], shipments were relatively flat sequentially, and our share decreased marginally to 56%. Our notebook drive sales were up 12%, resulting in nearly twice the sequential growth of the market due to the strength of the 7-millimeter product line and the successful ramp of the Samsung product line. 
Our consumer electronics and retail businesses achieved sequential growth, and during the June quarter, we made an important investment in our retail business with the proposed acquisition of LaCie, known for its premium external storage business. 
The overall breadth and depth of our hard drive product portfolio leads the industry, and we are aligning our technology road map to broaden our ability to provide customers with hybrid and solid state products that leverage NAND flash technology. To facilitate this effort, we announced today that Gary Gentry will be rejoining Seagate as Senior Vice President and General Manager of our SSD business. Prior to rejoining Seagate, Gary was General Manager of Micron's Enterprise SSD business. 
In the fall, we will be introducing our third-generation client hybrid drives, which will be in the 7-millimeter form factor. We will also be shipping demonstration units of our enterprise hybrid drives later this calendar year. We are encouraged by our engagements to date on this product as several OEMs have requested exclusive access to this technology. 
In addition to the enterprise SSD products we are shipping today, our technology partnership with Samsung has progressed on plan and has resulted in a highly competitive Tier 0 product. We expect to be shipping customer test units of this product at the end of this quarter. 
To further deepen our SSD capabilities, we made a strategic investment in DensBits technology, and we are also jointly developing a next-generation solid state controller technology with DensBits that is focused on breaking through current cost, reliability and performance benchmarks in the client and enterprise markets. 
We continue to believe that hybrid drives and SSDs are an important complementary technology to HDDs. We are confident in our approach to these markets, where we leverage our customer relationships and technical capabilities and focus on building core technology with strategic partners to produce best-in-class devices and solutions. 
Turning to our September quarter outlook. We believe that the industry is operating with sufficient supply -- with supply sufficient to meet demand. We continue to monitor several key indicators in the market, including macroeconomic dynamics, overall PC demand, product mix, growth in tablets and smartphones, the upcoming release of Windows 8 and the numerous thin and light product initiatives. 
Based on current planning indications from a broad base of customers, we are approaching the September quarter conservatively, focusing on supply-demand balance, and are currently aligning our business for relatively flat demand sequentially and continued improvement in the average capacity per drive shipped. 
For the September quarter, we expect to maintain market share, achieve revenue of approximately $4 billion, deliver gross margins exceeding 30% and have operating expenses that remain relatively flat. At this time, we believe the December quarter's addressable market will improve for the September quarter, and these conditions will put us on a path to revenues of at least $17 billion in calendar 2012 and exiting the year with margins above 30%. For fiscal 2013, assuming modest market growth, we are planning to maintain market share and deliver at least 25% annual growth in non-GAAP earnings. 
With respect to our capital structure and priorities for cash, as previously discussed, we expect to continue to enhance shareholder value through dividends and share redemptions. 
Seagate is well positioned in the current environment, and we look forward to updating you on our vision and strategic plan at our Investor Meeting on September 21. Melanie, we are now ready to open up the call to questions."

I think the issues that you have to think about are mix more maybe than pricing and how mix relates to pricing and AUP. So with the pricing overall being relatively high compared to pre-flood, a lot of the OEMs have mixed down in order to preserve the budgets that they have going towards storage. So it's one of the factors that we're still learning a lot about in terms of what happens with different price moves at different capacity points and how does that result in volume changes and how does that result in AUP changes. So price erosion is one measure, but AUP is another. And so we try and think about AUPs that aren't hopefully falling at very high rates. And of course, one of the ways you can prevent AUPs from falling is by having mix up. So those are what we're continuing to model with our customers in order to kind of help them achieve. What they're trying to achieve is also maintaining a -- the benign -- kind of the benign environment we have. I mean, it's fairly consistent with the outlook that was given by WD also in light of, I think, a September quarter that right now is a little bit vague from the OEM perspective. So we want to make sure that we're cautious in terms of what the OEMs are seeing. And I guess we'll hear more about that in a month or so when 2 of the biggest OEMs report."

And we've kind of consistently said that in the enterprise, we view this as a 2015 market where we want to be significantly engaged, and I feel like we're still on that path. Our work with Samsung has really progressed very, very well. We feel very good about the performance of the controller that we developed with them, and we're getting really quite good feedback from the test beds that we run, which we run at kind of enterprise HDD grade, which is quite a bit more stressful than what a lot of the SSD companies are on. So I do feel good about the path that we're on. And our paths, like I said, is really leveraging our customer relationships, leveraging a lot of what we know about enterprise-class storage and enterprise workloads and then complementing that with significant technology. So if there's technologies out there that we feel are going to be important going forward, then that's something we investigate typically in a partnership manner, as we've done so far. DensBits, I think, is a -- is really an indication of what I would say next, next generation. It's really about a controller technology that has the potential for significantly reducing the overall cost of the flash in both enterprise and client applications. And we're hard at work with them. We haven't disclosed yet when we expect to deliver a jointly developed technology, but we'd probably be talking to that more specifically in the September analyst meeting.

So the March quarter, we were up. From an operations perspective, we were fully integrated. From a sales perspective, it's a separate entity. So everything that's revolved around the customer interaction, product planning, order, pricing, commitments, road maps, that's all a separate team. And that would continue to be in place under the requirements of ModCom [ph] through at least December this year, depending on whether or not the -- our agreement with ModCom [ph] terminates at that time or not. So it's integrated as much as we can, and it's operating well. And we don't break out separately the unit volumes of the Samsung product line. On your question on hybrid and flash cache modules, I mean, not to discredit any other great technology companies, we believe there are certain performance advantages to a real hybrid device. And we still believe that that's got some performance characteristics, both in terms of endurance and absolute performance that are better than other alternatives. But my guess is, is you have a world [ph] where you'll see lots of different implementations of how flash presents itself in a system, even with people calling things hybrid drives that maybe we wouldn't call a hybrid drive, i.e., you could stick some flash in between the DRAM and a rotating disk and call it a hybrid, but if you don't have the algorithms that we've developed over those 3 or 4 years to optimize one in how you cache both on a rotating media as well as on the silicon and your error correction code n, n, n -- there is going to be a lot of different flavors out here. So again for us, I think the benchmark that we've tried to establish in our portfolio, whether or not it's on the client side or in the enterprise side, is maintaining or bettering HDD performance, which is a technology that is robust and is step -- is standing the test of time on workloads. And I think it's one of the biggest challenges of flash, obviously, is write performance and write endurance, especially as you get to small and linear density or newer technologies that have to be compute grade. It's one thing to dump something down on a memory stick, and it's another to be really maintaining your corporate data in it. So that's where we think we bring a lot of value-add to the equation. So yes, so I think there will be all sorts of different versions, not just 3, but we're primarily focused on hybrid and full SSD, along with HDD, at this point."

How much inventory rebalancing is there? And again, we want to be conservative. If it turns out that the TAMs are bigger or the inventories are going to be replenished, then we can easily chase upside.

But I'd say right now, growth is probably a good thing and period [ph] relative to what a lot of other companies and industries are facing. So -- and the fact that September is down seems pretty -- flat seems pretty consistent with what most technology companies are saying, which is they feel like it's a beautiful [ph] world, but they're still fairly confident about December and the first half of 2013. So now, obviously, flat relative to what a normal September would be, you could argue, is down 5% or 7%, right? I think that's a reflection of what we' reading in the newspaper every day.

And we're well aware of all the various constituencies and lobbying about which one of those deserve priority. But at 3x cash flow, I think everyone's -- or 4x cash flow or wherever the company's trading right now, it makes sense, obviously, to reduce the equity base and then continue to increase dividends in a, as I said, in a meaningful way. So that's the plan. And I think in September, we'll probably be a little more descriptive in terms of how we view our payout ratio, if you will, and how we split that between dividends and buyback. But again, it's a dynamic situation that's driven primarily as a function of company performance and valuation metrics. We're not ignoring either one of them. We think that they're both important to enhance the value of shareholders. That's primarily driven, obviously, by our operating performance. And we're going to continue to have an active dialogue and hopefully strike a balance that satisfies both classes of investors that like to see a smaller share base and those that like to see a bigger dividend. And we honestly think we can do both, and I think we've shown that we can do both. So we'll stay on the path as long as the operating performance is there.
Okay, great. So with that, I think, again, on behalf of the entire management team, I want to thank our employees, our customers, partners, suppliers and shareholders for your support and your commitment, and we look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Thanks a lot."

As Kate mentioned, we are in 2 locations today. Pat and I are in Cupertino, and Dave is in Singapore. We've just celebrated the 30th anniversary of Seagate's Singapore operations. It's been an honor to be such an important part of the business transformation of this leading industrial country, and we thank all the employees, community members and government officials who have played such an important role in Seagate's overall success. 
Seagate's fourth quarter and year-end results reflect the overall strong operational performance by the company and our commitment to returning value to our shareholders. In the June quarter, we achieved record revenues of $4.5 billion and record shipments of 66 million units, which represented an approximately 42% market share.
We had very strong profitability with non-GAAP net income of $1 billion and diluted earnings per share of $2.41. Non-GAAP gross margin was 33.6%. Fiscal 2012 revenues were $14.9 billion, with non-GAAP net income of $3 billion and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $6.75 and non-GAAP gross margins of 31.7%. We also achieved record operating cash flow of $1.4 billion in the June quarter, and we returned over 90% of our operating cash flow for the quarter to shareholders in the form of dividends and share redemptions. 
As further evidence of our commitment to returning value to our shareholders and as a reflection of our confidence in the company's future, we announced today that we have raised our quarterly dividend payout 28% to $0.32 per share. For the fiscal year, Seagate generated over $3.2 billion in operating cash flow, of which we returned over 85% to shareholders through dividends and share redemptions. We ended the quarter and the fiscal year with approximately $2.2 billion in cash, restricted cash and short-term investments. 
We are on plan to reduce our share count to 350 million ordinary shares outstanding by calendar year-end 2012. Assuming market and macroeconomic conditions and the company's performance and valuation metrics are similar to what they are today, we plan to reduce our share count to 250 million ordinary shares by calendar year-end 2014. Given the assumptions stated above, we expect that we will continue to increase our dividend payments in a meaningful manner while continuing our redemption plan over the course of the next several years.
We achieved many of our goals in the June quarter and set records in revenue and unit shipments. There were, however, a few areas where we did not perform as expected, which we highlighted in our preliminary results announcement a few weeks ago. I'll discuss the dynamics of the quarter and our thoughts on the business outlook for the September quarter and fiscal year 2013. 
Looking at our overall business activity in the quarter, we executed on our OEM agreements, and we resumed more typical volume shipments to the channel and retail markets. Overall unconstrained demand was lower than we expected going into the quarter. Against this demand profile, industry shipments have ramped to the point where supply and demand have come back into balance earlier than we had believed at the start of the quarter. 
The company is encouraged by its performance in transitioning to the next-generation technology across its entire portfolio. We believe Seagate is leading in technology transitions in all product categories. As a result, our inventory is comprised primarily of the newest generation products. 
In our enterprise business, we had a strong year-over-year growth, reflecting demand for cloud infrastructure build-outs and enterprise storage. Our shipments to cloud applications grew faster than the market, increasing 70% year-over-year. 
Offsetting some of this strength in the quarter was an isolated supplier issue in one of our mission-critical products that impacted our enterprise business. From an operations standpoint, it was a unique problem that required a thorough and timely investigation in order to determine the root cause. Given the nature of the problem, which was a particle contaminant coming from a supplier 3 levels down in the supply chain, determining the root cause was a challenging endeavor. Once we identified the issue, we were able to switch to an alternate supplier, and we resumed shipping the product within the June quarter. 
Despite our efforts to solve this issue quickly, the time we were out of the market impacted enterprise sales by approximately 1.5 million hard drives. As a result, our earnings were impacted by approximately $0.48 per share. 
We recognize the fact that an issue like this requires additional engagement with our customers to regain their confidence. Given the overall strength of our [indiscernible], shipments were relatively flat sequentially, and our share decreased marginally to 56%. Our notebook drive sales were up 12%, resulting in nearly twice the sequential growth of the market due to the strength of the 7-millimeter product line and the successful ramp of the Samsung product line. 
Our consumer electronics and retail businesses achieved sequential growth, and during the June quarter we made an important investment in our retail business with the proposed acquisition of LaCie, known for its premium external storage business. 
The overall breadth and depth of our hard drive product portfolio leads the industry, and we are aligning our technology road map to broaden our ability to provide customers with hybrid and solid state products that leverage NAND flash technology. To facilitate this effort, we announced today that Gary Gentry will be rejoining Seagate as Senior Vice President and General Manager of our SSD business. Prior to rejoining Seagate, Gary was General Manager of Micron's Enterprise SSD business. 
In the fall, we will be introducing our third-generation client hybrid drives, which will be in the 7-millimeter form factor. We will also be shipping demonstration units of our enterprise hybrid drives later this calendar year. We are encouraged by our engagements to date on this product, as several OEMs have requested exclusive access to this technology. 
In addition to the enterprise SSD products we are shipping today, our technology partnership with Samsung has progressed on plan and has resulted in a highly competitive Tier 0 product. We expect to be shipping customer test units of this product at the end of this quarter. 
To further deepen our SSD capabilities, we made a strategic investment in DensBits technology, and we are also jointly developing a next-generation solid state controller technology with DensBits that’s focused on breaking through current cost, reliability and performance benchmarks in the client and enterprise markets. 
We continue to believe that hybrid drives and SSDs are an important complementary technology to HDDs. We are confident in our approach to these markets, where we leverage our customer relationships and technical capabilities and focus on building core technology with strategic partners to produce best-in-class devices and solutions. 
Turning to our September quarter outlook, we believe that the industry is operating with sufficient supply -- with supply sufficient to meet demand. We continue to monitor several key indicators in the market, including macroeconomic dynamics, overall PC demand, product mix, growth in tablets and smartphones, the upcoming release of Windows 8 and the numerous thin and light product initiatives. 
Based on current planning indications from a broad base of customers, we are approaching the September quarter conservatively, focusing on supply-demand balance and are currently aligning our business for relatively flat demand sequentially and continued improvement in the average capacity per drive shipped. 
For the September quarter, we expect to maintain market share, achieve revenue of approximately $4 billion, deliver gross margins exceeding 30% and have operating expenses that remain relatively flat. At this time, we believe the December quarter's addressable market will improve for the September quarter, and these conditions will put us on a path to revenues of at least $17 billion in calendar 2012 and exiting the year with margins above 30%. For fiscal 2013, assuming modest market growth, we are planning to maintain market share and deliver at least 25% annual growth in non-GAAP earnings. 
With respect to our capital structure and priorities for cash, as previously discussed, we expect to continue to enhance shareholder value through dividends and share redemptions. 
Seagate is well positioned in the current environment, and we look forward to updating you on our vision and strategic plan at our Investor Meeting on September 21. Melanie, we are now ready to open up the call to questions."

So 45-42, could those shift by about a point or 2? Yes, but I mean, I still think that that's the general market share splits.

So I'd just like -- I'd like to understand a little bit in the context of where you're seeing pricing going right now and how you're factoring that into your assumptions over the -- for calendar '12 but also looking out for fiscal '13.

I think the issues that you have to think about are mix more maybe than pricing and how mix relates to pricing and AUP. So with the pricing overall being relatively high compared to pre-flood, a lot of the OEMs have mixed down in order to preserve the budgets that they have going towards storage. So it's one of the factors that we're still learning a lot about in terms of what happens with different price moves at different capacity points and how does that result in volume changes and how does that result in AUP changes. So price erosion is one measure, but AUP is another. And so we try and think about AUPs that aren't hopefully falling at very high rates. And of course, one of the ways you can prevent AUPs from falling is by having mix up. So those are what we're continuing to model with our customers in order to kind of help them achieve what they're trying to achieve is also maintaining a -- the benign -- kind of the benign environment we have. I mean, it's fairly consistent with the outlook that was given by WD also in light of, I think, a September quarter that right now is a little bit vague from the OEM perspective. So we want to make sure that we're cautious in terms of what the OEMs are seeing. And I guess we'll hear more about that in a month or so when 2 of the biggest OEMs report."

And we've kind of consistently said that in the enterprise, we view this as a 2015 market where we want to be significantly engaged, and I feel like we're still on that path. Our work with Samsung has really progressed very, very well. We feel very good about the performance of the controller that we developed with them, and we're getting really quite good feedback from the test beds that we run, which we run at kind of enterprise HDD grade, which is quite a bit more stressful than what a lot of the SSD companies run. So I do feel good about the path that we're on. And our path, like I said, is really leveraging our customer relationships, leveraging a lot of what we know about enterprise-class storage and enterprise workloads and then complementing that with significant technology. So if there's technologies out there that we feel are going to be important going forward, then that's something we investigate typically in a partnership manner, as we've done so far. DensBits, I think, is a -- is really an indication of what I would say next, next generation. It's really about a controller technology that has the potential for significantly reducing the overall cost of the flash in both enterprise and client applications. And we're hard at work with them. We haven't disclosed yet when we expect to deliver a jointly developed technology, but we'd probably be talking to that more specifically in the September analyst meeting.

But my guess is that yeah, it’s a world where you'll see lots of different implementations of how flash presents itself in a system, even with people calling things hybrid drives that maybe we wouldn't call a hybrid drive, i.e., you could stick some flash in between the DRAM and a rotating disk and call it a hybrid, but if you don't have the algorithms that we've developed over those 3 or 4 years to optimize one in how you cache both on a rotating media as well as on the silicon and your error correction code n, n, n -- there is going to be a lot of different flavors out here. So again for us, I think the benchmark that we've tried to establish in our portfolio, whether or not it's on the client side or in the enterprise side is maintaining or bettering HDD performance, which is a technology that is robust and is step -- is standing the test of time on workloads. And I think it's one of the biggest challenges of flash, obviously, is write performance and write endurance, especially as you get to small and linear density or newer technologies that have to be compute grade. It's one thing to dump something down on a memory stick, and it's another to be really maintaining your corporate data in it. So that's where we think we bring a lot of value-add to the equation. So yes, so I think there will be all sorts of different versions, not just 3, but we're primarily focused on hybrid and full SSD along with HDD at this point."

So it's just something that we're going to watch very closely and probably going into the quarter fairly conservatively in terms of build and inventory management. Again, I think it's important to recognize that in the case of Seagate, I'm not saying that it's not the case in WD, it's just not my position to talk to them, we're really running full on now with all of our new technology transitions, so -- across the portfolio, the products that we're building are products that we'll be building for a couple of years at least."

So -- and the fact that September is down seems pretty -- flat seems pretty consistent with what most technology companies are saying, which is they feel like it's a bit of a roll, but they're still fairly confident about December and the first half of 2013. So now, obviously flat relative to what a normal September would be, you could argue is down 5% or 7%, right? I think that's a reflection of what we're reading in the newspaper every day.

So that's step 1. And step 2, we'll continue to monitor -- as Steve said in the script, we'll continue to look at enhancing shareholder value through redemptions and dividends.

And we're well aware of all the various constituencies and lobbying about which one of those deserve priority. But at 3x cash flow, I think everyone's -- or 4x cash flow or wherever the company's trading right now, it makes sense, obviously, to reduce the equity base and then continue to increase dividends in, as I said, in a meaningful way. So that's the plan. And I think in September, we'll probably be a little more descriptive in terms of how we view our payout ratio, if you will, and how we split that between dividends and buyback. But again, it's a dynamic situation that's driven primarily as a function of company performance and valuation metrics. We're not ignoring either one of them. We think that they're both important to enhance the value of shareholders. That's primarily driven, obviously, by our operating performance. And we're going to continue to have an active dialogue and hopefully strike a balance that satisfies both classes of investors that like to see a smaller share base and those that like to see a bigger dividend. And we honestly think we can do both, and I think we've shown that we can do both. So we'll stay on the path as long as the operating performance is there.
Okay, great. So with that, I think again, on behalf of the entire management team, I want to thank our employees, our customers, partners, suppliers and shareholders for your support and your commitment, and we look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Thanks a lot."

I'd first like to express our concern and sympathies to those that have been impacted by the storm in the East Coast and are enduring difficult times. I also want to thank all of past and present Seagate employees, as well as local and central government officials in China, as we just celebrated the production of our 1 billionth drive from our China operations. We accomplished this remarkable feat in just 17 years, and we expect that the company will ship its 2 billionth disk drive this quarter. Congratulations to all involved. 
Seagate's first quarter results reflects strong operational performance as the company responded quickly to demand and product mix shifts in a challenging environment. We effectively adjusted production and maintained inventory turns in our target range and ended the quarter with inventory levels lower than the June quarter. 
For the September quarter, we achieved revenues of $3.7 billion, non-GAAP net income of $594 million and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.45. We maintained our commitment to returning value to shareholders with over 70% of the $1.1 billion in operating cash flow generated during the quarter returned to shareholders through share redemptions and dividends.  Over the last 3 quarters, Seagate's ordinary share count has been reduced by 17% and dilution from options and equity awards has been reduced by 45%.
As with most global technology companies, our financial performance is being impacted by a wide range of factors, including sluggish macroeconomic growth in all major markets as well as a slowdown in the BRIC economies; business spending restraint related to the U.S. Federal deficits and the upcoming fiscal cliff in the United States; supply chain and systems inventory adjustments by our major PC OEMs; weaker enterprise demand in Europe; adjustments to PC systems related to the Windows 8 release; changes in PC demand related to tablets; and lastly, the lack of significant product innovation in the notebook space. Due to these factors, the September quarter was more than seasonally backend loaded, and the overall industry demand environment was approximately 10% lower than we had expected going into the quarter. 
Despite the reduced addressable market, we effectively balanced supply and demand shipping approximately 43 exabytes of storage and maintaining market share. Our shipments into the client market declined 12% quarter-over-quarter, which is in line with unit declines reported by other technology companies in the PC space and slightly better than the decline reported in tablet sales. 
The enterprise market was weaker than we expected this quarter, down 26% sequentially. Despite the reduction in the addressable market, on a year-over-year basis, Seagate group unit shipments by 14% and increased average capacity per drive by 17% to 738 gigabytes.
Non-GAAP product margins for the September quarter were 29%, which is at the midpoint of our long-term margin range of 27% to 32% but was slightly below our expectations. The pricing environment and the benefit we received from cost improvements from product transitions were within the expected ranges for the quarter. However, sales volumes and mix from enterprise products were below expectations. In addition, margins on the sale of our products at Brazil were materially lower than we expected, impacting gross margins by approximately 100 basis points. 
As we discussed at our strategic update in New York a few weeks ago, as the hard drive industry has evolved and matured, this improved alignment of supply and demand particularly in an environment is just one we are in now, where demand is less than what the industry forecast and the industry and each company is capable of producing more drives than current demand requires. Seagate will continue to adjust and quickly adjust in-quarter production to align to the demand requirements we are experiencing, and we will manage our inventory aggressively as evidenced in the September quarter. Further, we will reduce our capital expenditures and align our investments to meet near-term demand signals as opposed to deploying capital and anticipation of a recovery of demand. As a result, Seagate is in a better position to focus on effective supply and demand balances and financial model resiliency in both the near term, as well as with respect to long-term return on our research and development and capital investments.
Looking ahead, we are approaching the December quarter conservatively based on current planning indications from a broad base of customers and on our current assessment of the following issues I previously outlined. In general, we remain concerned with global macroeconomic conditions. While we do see some signs of China stabilizing, we do not anticipate significant improvements to the current growth rates in China until late spring 2013. In the United States, it is uncertain that the fiscal cliff will be avoided. Regardless, large Federal state and local budget deficits will continue to weigh on growth prospects. We expect continued economic weakness in Europe. 
In addition to these economic answers, we remain cautious in OEM demand as many customers are still working through client systems inventory balances. We expect enterprise demand to remain weak, particularly due to the enterprise markets exposure to the European economies. We believe that tablet offerings will continue to evolve and may result in the notebook refresh cycle to lengthen depending on macroeconomic conditions and competitive product offerings. We are optimistic that the wide variety of new notebook offerings, including systems will result in renewed growth in this market over the next 12 months.  We also remain optimistic about the long-term impact of Windows 8 and other operating systems that enhance the user experience by incorporating touch, keyboard, hand, voice and gesture. 
Based on all these considerations, our forecast for the December quarter assumes the market to be relatively flat sequentially, and as a result, we are continuing to constrain builds and manage inventory. Based on already completed negotiations associated with the current quarter, we expect that ASPs will decline about 5%. We are currently forecasting second fiscal quarter revenues of approximately $3.5 billion, with margins at the lower end of our new long term range of 27% to 32%. 
For the December quarter, we are planning for our operating expenses to increase slightly sequentially and reflect the full quarter of expenses from the acquisition of LaCie in our retail business. The vast majority of our capital expenditures continue to be used for maintaining our existing operations, including investments related to technology transitions as opposed to installing new capacity. We expect to maintain capital spending at or below our long-term targeted range of 6% to 8% of revenue, including a replacement of our media r&D facility in Fremont, California in November. 
In terms of returning value to shareholders, we are planning to return approximately 70% of our operating cash flow this fiscal year through our share redemption program and dividends. We are maintaining our target for approximately $350 million ordinary shares outstanding at the end of the December quarter. 
In conjunction with our purchase of the Samsung Hard Drive business line last year, our shareholder agreement requires us to file an S3 and register the 45.2 million shares we issued to them by September 19. Samsung has indicated that they intend to maintain their position in Seagate for the foreseeable future. And as a reminder, these shares were already reflected in our ordinary share count.
Given the flat demand environment we are experiencing, as well as the uncertainly around the issues we discussed impacting demand, we expect to be in a better position to update our financial expectations for the fiscal year and calendar year when we report our second quarter fiscal results in January. With respect to price negotiations that will occur this quarter related to the March quarter, we expect that ASPs will remain relatively flat. 
We currently expect macro unpredictability and rapid technology and computer industry change to continue, and we continue to implement investment and business processes designed to build the business model with higher margins to withstand fluctuations in demand. We believe the best reflection of this effort is represented by the low-end of our gross margin range being higher than the high end of our previous gross margin range.
Data consumption and creation and global Internet connectivity growth continue to be very robust. At the same time computing is changing fundamentally and at the rapid place, driven by open source software, cloud infrastructure and architectures and mobility. Because of our leadership position in storage, we have a high degree of engagement with a wide spectrum of customers from end-users to OEMs to cloud service providers. We are now on our third-generation, solid-state hybrid notebook drives and we are expanding this technology into desktop and enterprise products.  We also have new 7-millimeter and 5-millimeter products that customers qualification and evaluation, which position us very well for the new thin and light notebook systems. 
In summary, we believe Seagate is all position to sustain strong financial performance this challenging economic environment, as well as to address the opportunities associated with the needs of cloud computing and mobile connectivity. 
John, we're now ready to open up the call to questions."

We're definitely seeing more customers that are building various types of either private or public cloud infrastructures that our purchasing systems may be away from the traditional OEMs, whether or not they're going directly or whether or not they may be buying architectures from smaller start ups. So I think it's the right combination between people that acquired inventory in the March and June quarters in anticipation or concern around recovery still in enterprise from the supply chain disruptions caused by the flood, combined with the slowdown. So I think there is an inventory overhang that's still being addressed. And then there's also I think some competitive issues where certain of the OEMs, maybe to start having to sell through that they thought they were, which may be related to macro or maybe competitive issues. But it's definitely a combination of the 3 things of a changing customer base that's responding to a new architecture. And then inventory absorption, as well as I do think the macro impact is significant, though I've been a little surprised that the European situation hasn't kind of shown its head earlier just because most of the enterprise companies still have somewhere between 25% and 40% of the revenue exposure in Europe, which is different than the client side or consumer technology companies."

One is the device level inventory and then the other is the system level inventory. And I think the comments I just made, I think at the device level I think there was probably a fair amount of buy in really in the June quarter with still some concerns around the recovery of the drive industry. And then I think that, that buy in happened to coincide with the slowdown that really started at the tail end of the June quarter. I mean to me 2012 feels a lot like 2010 where we should start to get this rollover in May and things never recovered for the rest of the year. And I think for the OEMs they were buying in inventory and then things started to slow down and it's still a little confusing into nothing slow down because it's a summer and it's typically a slow period anyhow, and you hope it recovers in September. We really didn't see that recover, and I think people clearly are grasping the macroeconomic issues a little better now as being more significant than maybe we thought 3, 4, 5 months ago. So I think at the OEM level, it's a combination of a lot of system inventory and initially in the summer and device inventory. Then I think probably trying to believe down that inventory in anticipation of Windows 8, clearly people are trying to get lean on how many of the old systems they're carrying in order to be prepared to ramp as the Windows 8 is released. And then depending on the robustness of demand for Windows 8, I think there'll be a response. So I think it's again I think it's a similar story just different reasons maybe more related to Windows as opposed to cloud architecture changing."

Our business unit's at about 1 million units less than it was last quarter and within our range of 4 to 6 weeks. I'm not that concerned about the distribution channel. I think in the OEMs, depending on the customer, there's probably still some work to be done. I would say at the margin, I feel -- I wish inventories at the customer level were a little lower, both on the systems side and probably on the device side. That's one of the reasons being on our flat hand assumption. I think end-user is actually probably going to grow by low single digits or maybe even mid-single digits.

On the March pricing, I think Stephen, the mix assumptions -- look, we've been kind of off on mix for a couple of 3 quarters in a row here, where the mix assumptions we had basically don't come to fruition and part of that I think just because of the pressure of the systems vendors are under to maintain margins. I think mix is the assumptions for mix are basically pretty conservative for the March quarter. So if there was actually improvement in mix, which would be what we would've hoped, especially if there's any set of recovery in March in the enterprise, then I think that the relatively flat ASPs hopefully will prove to be conservative. So we have tried to at least this time assume a pretty conservative view on mix to stay relatively flat ASPs. Obviously with new products coming on and mix improving is will actually probably increase ASPs. On the macroeconomic situation and how long does it have to last for it to be really painful, that's a good question. And I would say if we had -- I guess, the question is do you have clarity on that it's going to maybe 9 to 12 months. If we know if was going to be flat and weak for the next 9 to 12 months, we probably do one side of things. But if you're kind of making decision quarter-to-quarter, you have a little bit less flexibility, obviously. But to answer your question, I think the good news is for the drive industry or certainly for Seagate, and I guess getting to be that way for WD and Hitachi, is for us it's about absorbing heads and disks really. It's where most of our R&D and most of our capital is deployed. And as long as we're absorbing heads and disks at these levels, we're okay. And if we had to reduce drive output, that's actually fairly easy capital for us to address in part because a lot of it is test capacity, which we can actually increase test times and also with aerial density -- sorry, with average capacity for drive increasing test times and are increasing anyhow. So in a certain sense, as challenging as the environment is, I'd say for the drive industry given the aerial density and the petabyte growth, it's manageable. Now if TAMs dropped 120 million units, that's a different story. The industry probably how to take a hard look at a lot of things with respect to internal components and supply, as well as drive level capacity. But I'd say right now for us, while we're operating well below our theoretical capacity, we can maintain the margin structures and the cost objectives that we have at this level of demand, even if it lasted 9 or 12 months."

So we like to talk more in terms of ASPs. So you're generally right though that if it was a 5% price erosion that the ASPs probably wouldn't erode by 5% gross margins would be healthier. So price erosion is higher than 5%, ASP erosion will be about 5%. And if mix improves either within each category right, mix meaning capacity per drive, if you will, or heads and disks per drive, or if the mix improves in terms of enterprise nearline versus client, notebook and desktop, those are all things obviously that boost ASPs. We've taken a pretty conservative approach as I said on the enterprise market opportunity in part because of the inventory and in part because of European concerns."

So what happens in 2013 though as you pointed out is we do run in to a Section 382 problem where if we redeem too many shares, it could trigger a loss of our NOLs, which are fairly substantial. And we'd rather avoid doing that, not that we've used NOLs or necessarily see any need to use NOLs. But it's nice to have them in case you need them. So we'll probably be reasonable in sidestepping that problem unless the value proposition is just too great, in which case obviously we'll go ahead and buy our stock and deal with losing NOLs we may or may not need. So what that would mean obviously is a slowdown in redemption in 2013 and then an acceleration in 2014 to get to our target, and in the meantime, obviously maintaining our dividend policy, which is, as we said, a minimum increase, targeted increase of 10% per year."

My guess is 3% to 7%, but I think we're not going to see it just because of inventory absorption. So that may mean real TAM for December in terms of sales out of systems in the 150 range, in which case then March probably for us sales will be like that. So that's what we're assuming, but it doesn't really matter. The point is capacity is way above that. Capacity is 170 so you're not going to pick up anything, you're not going to pick up 30 million units with pricing. The issue was not pricing of systems. The issue is macroeconomic conditions.

And then you have Brazil was like 100 basis points. So I mean even with the first 2 items, we would have hit the 30% if it was for the Brazil issue. And that was basically a function of -- it's a fairly complicated story, but in Brazil, there is a requirement that if you're building computer systems at Brazil, a certain number or a certain percentage of the components have to be purchased in-country. And we've invested a fair amount of money in part as an extension of the investments that Samsung had to make sure that we can actually provide in-country built drives. Our estimation of what that business should have been in the last couple of quarters was high and we're still digging into why that is. But as a result, the pricing that we deployed was too aggressive because we didn't get the absorption that we should have. So we've made the adjustments in terms of our expectations. We'll make adjustments in terms of pricing, and we won't get all of that 100 basis points back next quarter, but we think this quarter but we'll probably get half of it back and then we should be kind of through that hole."

But I think that again we made some really fundamental advancements in our cross functional management of the supply chain through customer fulfillment."

But I guess what would be behind it is customers can hope they buy directly instead of buying wrapped up systems being a huge markup on disk drives for. But I don't know that they can really do that because if they are buying from OEMs, the OEMs really controls that through their maintenance and service contracts. So you can't really buy a system and then buy drives from Seagate if you're buying a system from a traditional OEM because then your service contract typically is invalidated. So no one's willing to do that. So we haven't really seen that. But I do think that if you were talking about OEMs, I mean I do think architecturally that's happening, people are starting to design systems where they can incrementally add the storage they need. If those aren't really necessary through the AOMs. I Think best more new architectures.

I'd first like to express our concern and sympathies to those that have been impacted by the storm on the East Coast and are enduring difficult times. I also want to thank all past and present Seagate employees, as well as local and central government officials in China, as we just celebrated the production of our 1 billionth drive from our China operations. We accomplished this remarkable feat in just 17 years, and we expect that the company will ship its 2 billionth disk drive this quarter. Congratulations to all involved. 
Seagate's first quarter results reflect strong operational performance as the company responded quickly to demand and product mix shifts in a challenging environment. We effectively adjusted production and maintained inventory turns in our target range and ended the quarter with inventory levels lower than the June quarter. 
For the September quarter, we achieved revenues of $3.7 billion, non-GAAP net income of $594 million and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.45. We maintained our commitment to returning value to shareholders with over 70% of the $1.1 billion in operating cash flow generated during the quarter, returned to shareholders through share redemptions and dividends. Over the last 3 quarters, Seagate's ordinary share count has been reduced by 17%, and dilution from options and equity awards has been reduced by 45%.
As with most global technology companies, our financial performance is being impacted by a wide range of factors, including: sluggish macroeconomic growth in all major markets, as well as a slowdown in the BRIC economies; business-spending restraint related to the U.S. Federal deficits and the upcoming fiscal cliff in the United States; supply chain and systems inventory adjustments by our major PC OEMs; weaker enterprise demand in Europe; adjustments to PC systems related to the Windows 8 release; changes in PC demand related to tablets; and lastly, the lack of significant product innovation in the notebook space. Due to these factors, the September quarter was more than seasonally back-end loaded, and the overall industry demand environment was approximately 10% lower than we had expected going into the quarter. 
Despite the reduced addressable market, we effectively balanced supply and demand, shipping approximately 43 exabytes of storage and maintaining market share. Our shipments into the client market declined 12% quarter-over-quarter, which is in line with unit declines reported by other technology companies in the PC space and slightly better than the decline reported in tablet sales. 
The enterprise market was weaker than we expected this quarter, down 26% sequentially. Despite this potential reduction in the addressable market, on a year-over-year basis, Seagate grow unit shipments by 14% and increased average capacity per drive by 17% to 738 gigabytes.
Non-GAAP product margins for the September quarter were 29%, which is at the midpoint of our long-term margin range of 27% to 32%, but was slightly below our expectations. The pricing environment and the benefit we received from cost improvements from product transitions were within the expected ranges for the quarter. However, sales volumes and mix from enterprise products were below expectations. In addition, margins on the sale of our products at Brazil were materially lower than we expected, impacting gross margins by approximately 100 basis points. 
As we discussed at our strategic update in New York a few weeks ago, as the hard drive industry has evolved and matured, that's improved its alignment of supply and demand, particularly in an environment such as the one we are in now, where demand is less than what the industry forecast and the industry and each company is capable of producing more drives than current demand requires. 
Seagate will continue to adjust and -- quickly adjust in quarter production to align to the demand requirements we are experiencing. And we will manage our inventory aggressively, as evidenced in the September quarter. Further, we will reduce our capital expenditures and align our investments to meet near-term demand signals as opposed to deploying capital in anticipation of a recovery of demand. As a result, Seagate is in a better position to focus on effective supply and demand balances and financial model resiliency in both the near term, as well as with respect to long-term return on our research and development and capital investments.
Looking ahead, we are approaching the December quarter conservatively based on current planning indications from a broad base of customers and on our current assessment of the following issues I previously outlined. In general, we remain concerned with global macroeconomic conditions. While we do see some signs of China stabilizing, we do not anticipate significant improvements to the current growth rates in China until late spring 2013. In the United States, it is uncertain that the fiscal cliff will be avoided. Regardless, large federal state and local budget deficits will continue to weigh on growth prospects. We expect continued economic weakness in Europe. 
In addition to these economic concerns, we remain cautious in OEM demand as many customers are still working through client systems inventory balances. We expect enterprise demand to remain weak, particularly due to the enterprise markets exposure to the European economies. We believe that tablet offerings will continue to evolve and may result in the notebook refresh cycle to lengthen, depending on macroeconomic conditions and competitive product offerings. We are optimistic that the wide variety of new notebook offerings, including thin and light systems will result in renewed growth in this market over the next 12 months. We also remain optimistic about the long-term impact of Windows 8 and other operating systems that enhance the user experience by incorporating touch, keyboard, hand, voice and gesture. 
Based on all these considerations, our forecast for the December quarter assumes the market to be relatively flat sequentially. And as a result, we are continuing to constrain builds and manage inventory. Based on already completed negotiations associated with the current quarter, we expect that the ASPs will decline about 5%. We are currently forecasting second fiscal quarter revenues of approximately $3.5 billion, with margins at the lower end of our new long-term range of 27% to 32%. 
For the December quarter, we are planning for our operating expenses to increase slightly sequentially and reflect the full quarter of expenses from the acquisition of LaCie in our retail business. The vast majority of our capital expenditures continue to be used for maintaining our existing operations, including investments related to technology transitions as opposed to installing new capacity. We expect to maintain capital spending at or below our long-term targeted range of 6% to 8% of revenue, including a replacement of our media R&D facility in Fremont, California in November. 
In terms of returning value to shareholders, we are planning to return approximately 70% of our operating cash flow this fiscal year through our share redemption program and dividends. We are maintaining our target for approximately $350 million ordinary shares outstanding at the end of the December quarter. 
In conjunction with our purchase of the Samsung hard drive business line last year, our shareholder agreement requires us to file an S3 and register the 45.2 million shares we issued to them by September 19. Samsung has indicated that they intend to maintain their position in Seagate for the foreseeable future. And as a reminder, these shares were already reflected in our ordinary share count.
Given the flat demand environment we are experiencing, as well as the uncertainty around the issues we discussed impacting demand, we expect to be in a better position to update our financial expectations for the fiscal year and calendar year when we report our second quarter fiscal results in January. With respect to price negotiations that will occur this quarter related to the March quarter, we expect that ASPs will remain relatively flat. 
We currently expect macro unpredictability and rapid technology and computer industry change to continue, and we continue to implement investment and business processes designed to build a business model with higher margins to withstand fluctuations in demand. We believe the best reflection of this effort is represented by the low end of our gross margin range being higher than the high end of our previous gross margin range.
Data consumption and creation and global Internet connectivity growth continue to be very robust. At the same time, computing is changing fundamentally and a the rapid place, driven by open source software, cloud infrastructure and architectures and mobility. Because of our leadership position in storage, we have a high degree of engagement with a wide spectrum of customers from end users to OEMs to cloud service providers. We are now on our third generation, solid-state hybrid notebook drives and we are expanding this technology into desktop and enterprise products. We also have new 7 millimeter and 5-millimeter products that customers for qualification and evaluation, which positioned us very well for the new thin and light notebook systems. 
In summary, we believe Seagate is well positioned to sustain strong financial performance in  this challenging economic environment, as well as to address the opportunities associated with the needs of cloud computing and mobile connectivity. 
John, we're now ready to open up the call to questions."

And unfortunately, it's a little hard to see, because I think the third element that's probably playing into that is the architectural changes as well. We're definitely seeing more customers that are building various types of either private or public cloud infrastructures that our purchasing systems, may be away from the traditional OEMs, whether or not they're going directly or whether or not they may be buying architectures from smaller start-ups. But I think it's the right combination between people that acquired inventory in the March and June quarters in anticipation or concern around recovery still in enterprise from the supply chain disruptions caused by the flood combined with the slowdown. So I think there is an inventory overhang that's still being addressed. And then there's also, I think, some competitive issues where certain of the OEMs, maybe to start having to sell through that they thought they were, which may be related to macro or maybe competitive issues. But it's definitely a combination of the 3 things of a changing customer base that's responding to a new architecture. And then inventory absorption, as well as -- I do think the macro impact is significant, though I've been a little surprised that the European situation hasn't kind of shown its head earlier just because most of the enterprise companies still have somewhere between 25% and 40% of the revenue exposure in Europe, which is different than the client side or consumer technology companies."

One is the device level inventory and then the other is the system level inventory. And I think the comments I just made, I think, at the device level, I think there was probably a fair amount of buy-in really in the June quarter with still some concerns around the recovery of the drive industry. And then I think that, that buy-in happened to coincide with the slowdown that really started at the tail end of the June quarter. I mean to me, 2012 feels a lot like 2010, where should we start getting this rollover in May and then things never recovered for the rest of the year. And I think for the OEMs, they were buying in inventory, and then things started to slow down. And it's always a little confusing in June when things slow down because it's the summer, and that's a typically a slow period anyhow. And you hope it recovers in September. We really didn't see that recovery, and I think people, clearly, are grasping the macroeconomic issues a little better now as being more significant than maybe we thought 3, 4, 5 months ago. So I think at the OEM level, it's a combination of a lot of system inventory, and initially, in the summer and device inventory. Then I think probably, trying to bleed down that inventory in anticipation of Windows 8. Clearly, people are trying to get lean on how many of the old systems they're carrying in order to be prepared to ramp as the Windows 8's released. And then depending on the robustness of demand for Windows 8, I think they'll be able to respond. So I think it's -- again, I think it's a similar story, just different reasons, maybe more related to Windows as opposed to cloud architecture changing."

Our business unit's about 1 million units less than it was last quarter and within our range of 4 to 6 weeks. I'm not that concerned about the distribution channel. I think in the OEMs, there's -- depending on the customer, there's probably still some work to be done. I would say at the margin, I feel -- I wish inventories at the customer level were a little lower, both on the systems side, probably on the device side. So again, that's one of the reasons that's weighing on our flat TAM assumption. I think probably end user TAM is actually probably going to grow by low-single digits or maybe even mid-single digits.

So if you think about it in reverse, for the quarter we're in now, we negotiated those prices in September or late August. And I would say that I kind of feel that the December pricing probably got away from us just a touch with the demand falling off as much as it did in September. And trying to, I think, recognize what was the real TAM going to be for the December quarter. I think the industry and probably our customers were hoping that it was going to be more in the 150 or 155 range. So I think the industry is probably recognized that the March quarter is likely to be pretty flat to or maybe marginally up. And that we're really not going to buy TAM with pricing. And so I think, we've obviously got the pricing levels at our -- as low as we want to see them if we're bumping on the bottom end of our range. And so, it's important for us to make sure we maintain discipline going forward, so we can get our R&D and capital investments where we want for the long term.

On the first thing, on March pricing, I think Steven, the mix assumptions -- look, we've been kind of off on mix for a couple of 3 quarters in a row here where the mix assumptions we've had, basically, don't come to fruition. And part, I think, is that's just because the pressure that the systems vendors are under to maintain margins. I think mix is -- the assumptions for mix are basically pretty conservative for the March quarter. So if there was actually improvement in mix, which would be what we would hope, especially if there's any sort of recovery in March on the enterprise, then I think that the relatively flat ASPs, hopefully, will prove to be conservative. So we have tried to, at least this time, assume a pretty conservative view on mix to stay relatively flat ASPs. Obviously, with new products coming on and mix improving, it actually, probably, increased ASPs. On the macroeconomic situation and how long does it have to last for it to be really painful. That's a good question. And I would say if we had -- I guess, the question is do you have clarity on that it's going to be 9 to 12 months. If we knew it was going to be flat and weak for the next 9, 12 months, we'd probably do one set of things. But if you're kind of making that decision quarter-to-quarter, you have a little bit less flexibility, obviously. But to answer your question, I think the good news is for the drive industry, or certainly, for Seagate, and I guess getting to be that way for WD and Hitachi, is for us, it's about absorbing heads and disks really. It's where most of our R&D and where most of our capital is deployed. And as long as we're absorbing heads and disks at these levels, we're okay. And if we had to reduce drive output, that's actually fairly easy capital for us to address, in part, because a lot of it is test capacity, which we can actually increase test times and also with aerial density -- sorry, with average capacity for drive increase, and test times are increasing anyhow. So in a certain sense, as challenging as the environment is, I'd say for the drive industry, given the aerial density and the petabyte growth, it's manageable. Now if TAMs dropped 120 million units, that's a different story. Then the industry would probably have to take a hard look at a lot of things with respect to internal components and supply, as well as drive level capacity. But I'd say right now for us, while we're operating well below our theoretical capacity, we can maintain the margin structures and the cost objectives that we have at this level of demand, even if it lasted 9 or 12 months."

But again, price erosion is a tricky little term in the drive industry that's, unfortunately, got a legacy that went back to when there's only about 5 different products as opposed to 700 different products. So we like to talk more in terms of ASPs. So you're generally right though that if it was a 5% price erosion that ASPs probably wouldn't erode by 5%, and gross margins would be healthier. So price erosion is higher than 5%, ASP erosion will be about 5%. And if mix improves either within each category, right -- mix meaning capacity per drive, if you will, or heads and disks per drive, or if the mix improves in terms of enterprise nearline versus client, notebook and desktop, those are all things obviously that boost ASPs. We've taken a pretty conservative approach, as I said on the enterprise market opportunity, in part because of the inventory and in part because of European concerns."

And of course, we've got the 2014 end of year target of $250 million ordinary shares outstanding. So what happens in 2013 though, as you pointed out, is we do run in, into a Section 382 problem where, if we redeemed too many shares, it could trigger a loss of our NOLs, which are fairly substantial. And we'd rather avoid doing that, not that we've used NOLs or necessarily see any need to use NOLs. But it's nice to have them in case you need them. So we'll probably be reasonable in sidestepping that problem, unless the value proposition is just too great, in which case, obviously then, we'll go ahead and buy our stock and deal with losing NOLs that we may or may not need. So what that would mean obviously is a slowdown in redemption in 2013 and then an acceleration in 2014 to get to our target. And in the meantime, obviously, maintaining our dividend policy, which is, as we said, a minimum increase, targeted increase of 10% per year."

Whether or not, I'd say 140 or 150, while some analysts may get a little exercise about that, the reality is it's the same number from an operations perspective. So I would assume a flat TAM, whether or not that means 140 or even 155, I think is possible. Like I said, I think the December system sales will probably actually be up. My guess is 3% to 7%, but I think we're not going to see it just because of inventory absorption. So that may mean real TAM for December, in terms of sales out of systems in the 150 range, in which case, then March probably, for us, sales will be like that. So that's what we're assuming, but it doesn't really matter. The point is, capacity is way above that. Capacity is 170, so you're not going to pick up anything. You're not going to pick up 30 million units with pricing. The issue was not pricing of systems. The issue is macroeconomic conditions. So the TAM's 140. We'll build whatever it is, 56 million drives, and we're going to price them, so we can maintain the margins that we need to invest in our business long term."

So I mean even with the first 2 items, we would have hit the 30%, if it was for the Brazil issue. And that was basically a function of -- it's a fairly complicated story. But in Brazil, there is a requirement that if you are building computer systems at Brazil, a certain number or a certain percentage of the components have to be purchased in-country. And we've invested a fair amount of money, in part, as an extension of the investments that Samsung had to make sure that we can actually provide in country-built drives. Our estimation of what that business should have been in the last couple of quarters was high, and we're still digging into why that is. But as a result, the pricing that we deployed was too aggressive because we didn't get the absorption that we should have. So we've made the adjustments in terms of our expectations. We'll make adjustments in terms of pricing. And we won't get all of that 100 basis points back next quarter, but we think this quarter. But we'll probably get half of it back, and then we should kind of be through that, not whole [ph]."

That helps straight out of the factories. And then working with our customers to develop hubs that makes sense versus hubs that are spread all over the place where we can late-stage postpone some of the configuration issues that they need out the field. With product simplification, that's helping us quite a bit. And then once you get those hubs set up, you could take advantage of [indiscernible].

But I guess what would be behind it is customers that hope they buy directly instead of buying wrapped-out systems that they're paying a huge markup on disk drives for. But I don't know that they can really do that, because if they're buying from OEMs, the OEMs really controls that through their maintenance and service contracts. So you can't really buy a system and then buy drives from Seagate if you're buying a system from a traditional OEM because then your service contract typically is invalidated. So no one's willing to do that. So we haven't really seen that. But I do think that if you were talking about OEMs, I mean I do think, architecturally, that's happening, that people are starting to design systems, where they can incrementally add the storage they need. If those aren't really necessarily through the OEMs. I think it's -- that's more -- some of the new architectures.

I'd first like to express our concern and sympathies to those that have been impacted by the storm on the East Coast and are enduring difficult times. I also want to thank all past and present Seagate employees, as well as local and central government officials in China, as we just celebrated the production of our 1 billionth drive from our China operations. We accomplished this remarkable feat in just 17 years, and we expect that the company will ship its 2 billionth disk drive this quarter. Congratulations to all involved. 
Seagate's first quarter results reflect strong operational performance as the company responded quickly to demand and product mix shifts in a challenging environment. We effectively adjusted production and maintained inventory turns in our target range and ended the quarter with inventory levels lower than the June quarter. 
For the September quarter, we achieved revenues of $3.7 billion, non-GAAP net income of $594 million and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.45. We maintained our commitment to returning value to shareholders with over 70% of the $1.1 billion in operating cash flow generated during the quarter, returned to shareholders through share redemptions and dividends. Over the last 3 quarters, Seagate's ordinary share count has been reduced by 17%, and dilution from options and equity awards has been reduced by 45%.
As with most global technology companies, our financial performance is being impacted by a wide range of factors, including: sluggish macroeconomic growth in all major markets, as well as a slowdown in the BRIC economies; business-spending restraint related to the U.S. federal deficits and the upcoming fiscal cliff in the United States; supply chain and systems inventory adjustments by our major PC OEMs; weaker enterprise demand in Europe; adjustments to PC systems related to the Windows 8 release; changes in PC demand related to tablets; and lastly, the lack of significant product innovation in the notebook space. Due to these factors, the September quarter was more than seasonally back-end loaded, and the overall industry demand environment was approximately 10% lower than we had expected going into the quarter. 
Despite the reduced addressable market, we effectively balanced supply and demand, shipping approximately 43 exabytes of storage and maintaining market share. Our shipments into the client market declined 12% quarter-over-quarter, which is in line with unit declines reported by other technology companies in the PC space and slightly better than the decline reported in tablet sales. 
The enterprise market was weaker than we expected this quarter, down 26% sequentially. Despite the sequential reduction in the addressable market, on a year-over-year basis, Seagate grow unit shipments by 14% and increased average capacity per drive by 17% to 738 gigabytes.
Non-GAAP product margins for the September quarter were 29%, which is at the midpoint of our long-term margin range of 27% to 32%, but was slightly below our expectations. The pricing environment and the benefit we received from cost improvements from product transitions were within the expected ranges for the quarter. However, sales volumes and mix from enterprise products were below expectations. In addition, margins on the sale of our products at Brazil were materially lower than we expected, impacting gross margins by approximately 100 basis points. 
As we discussed at our strategic update in New York a few weeks ago, as the hard drive industry has evolved and matured, it has improved its alignment of supply and demand, particularly in an environment such as the one we are in now, where demand is less than what the industry forecast and the industry and each company is capable of producing more drives than current demand requires. 
Seagate will continue to adjust in -- quickly adjust in-quarter production to align to the demand requirements we are experiencing. And we will manage our inventory aggressively, as evidenced in the September quarter. Further, we will reduce our capital expenditures and align our investments to meet near-term demand signals as opposed to deploying capital in anticipation of a recovery of demand. As a result, Seagate is in a better position to focus on effective supply and demand balances and financial model resiliency in both the near term, as well as with respect to long-term return on our research and development and capital investments.
Looking ahead, we are approaching the December quarter conservatively based on current planning indications from a broad base of customers and on our current assessment of the following issues I previously outlined. In general, we remain concerned with global macroeconomic conditions. While we do see some signs of China stabilizing, we do not anticipate significant improvements to the current growth rates in China until late spring 2013. In the United States, it is uncertain that the fiscal cliff will be avoided. Regardless, large federal, state and local budget deficits will continue to weigh on growth prospects. We expect continued economic weakness in Europe. 
In addition to these economic concerns, we remain cautious in OEM demand as many customers are still working through client systems inventory balances. We expect enterprise demand to remain weak, particularly due to the enterprise markets' exposure to the European economies. We believe that tablet offerings will continue to evolve and may result in the notebook refresh cycle to lengthen, depending on macroeconomic conditions and competitive product offerings. We are optimistic that the wide variety of new notebook offerings, including thin and light systems, will result in renewed growth in this market over the next 12 months. We also remain optimistic about the long-term impact of Windows 8 and other operating systems that enhance the user experience by incorporating touch, keyboard, pen, voice and gesture. 
Based on all these considerations, our forecast for the December quarter assumes the market to be relatively flat sequentially. And as a result, we are continuing to constrain builds and manage inventory. Based on already completed negotiations associated with the current quarter, we expect that the ASPs will decline about 5%. We are currently forecasting second fiscal quarter revenues of approximately $3.5 billion, with margins at the lower end of our new long-term range of 27% to 32%. 
For the December quarter, we are planning for our operating expenses to increase slightly sequentially and reflect a full quarter of expenses from the acquisition of LaCie in our retail business. The vast majority of our capital expenditures continue to be used for maintaining our existing operations, including investments related to technology transitions as opposed to installing new capacity. We expect to maintain capital spending at or below our long-term targeted range of 6% to 8% of revenue, including a replacement of our media R&D facility in Fremont, California in November. 
In terms of returning value to shareholders, we are planning to return approximately 70% of our operating cash flow this fiscal year through our share redemption program and dividends. We are maintaining our target for approximately $350 million ordinary shares outstanding at the end of the December quarter. 
In conjunction with our purchase of the Samsung hard drive business line last year, our shareholder agreement requires us to file an S-3 and register the 45.2 million shares we issued to them by September 19. Samsung has indicated that they intend to maintain their position in Seagate for the foreseeable future. And as a reminder, these shares were already reflected in our ordinary share count.
Given the flat demand environment we are experiencing, as well as the uncertainty around the issues we discussed impacting demand, we expect to be in a better position to update our financial expectations for the fiscal year and calendar year when we report our second quarter fiscal results in January. With respect to price negotiations that will occur this quarter related to the March quarter, we expect that ASPs will remain relatively flat. 
We currently expect macro unpredictability and rapid technology and computer industry change to continue, and we continue to implement investment and business processes designed to build a business model with higher margins to withstand fluctuations in demand. We believe the best reflection of this effort is represented by the low end of our gross margin range being higher than the high end of our previous gross margin range.
Data consumption and creation and global Internet connectivity growth continue to be very robust. At the same time, computing is changing fundamentally and at a rapid place, driven by open source software, cloud infrastructure and architectures, and mobility. Because of our leadership position in storage, we have a high degree of engagement with a wide spectrum of customers from end users to OEMs to cloud service providers. We are now on our third-generation, solid-state hybrid notebook drives, and we are expanding this technology into desktop and enterprise products. We also have new 7-millimeter and 5-millimeter products at customers for qualification and evaluation, which position us very well for the new thin and light notebook systems. 
In summary, we believe Seagate is well positioned to sustain strong financial performance in this challenging economic environment, as well as to address the opportunities associated with the needs of cloud computing and mobile connectivity. 
John, we're now ready to open up the call to questions."

And unfortunately, it's a little hard to see, because I think the third element that's probably playing into that is the architectural changes as well. We're definitely seeing more customers that are building various types of either private or public cloud infrastructures that are purchasing systems maybe away from the traditional OEMs, whether or not they're going directly or whether or not they may be buying architectures from smaller start-ups. But I think it's the right combination between people that acquired inventory in the March and June quarters in anticipation or concern around recovery still in enterprise from the supply chain disruptions caused by the flood combined with the slowdown. So I think there is an inventory overhang that's still being addressed. And then there's also, I think, some competitive issues where certain of the OEMs maybe just aren't having the sell-through that they thought they were, which may be related to macro or may be competitive issues. But it's definitely a combination of the 3 things of a changing customer base that's responding to a new architecture and then inventory absorption, as well as -- I do think the macro impact is significant, though I've been a little surprised that the European situation hasn't kind of shown its head earlier just because most of the enterprise companies still have somewhere between 25% and 40% of the revenue exposure in Europe, which is different than the client side or consumer technology companies."

One is the device level inventory and then the other is the system level inventory. And I think the comments I just made, I think, at the device level, I think there was probably a fair amount of buy-in really in the June quarter with still some concerns around the recovery of the drive industry. And then I think that, that buy-in happened to coincide with the slowdown that really started at the tail end of the June quarter. I mean to me, 2012 feels a lot like 2010, where we start getting this rollover in May and then things never recovered for the rest of the year. And I think for the OEMs, they were buying in inventory, and then things started to slow down. And it's always a little confusing in June when things slow down because it's the summer, and that's a typically slow period anyhow. And you hope it recovers in September. We really didn't see that recovery, and I think people, clearly, are grasping the macroeconomic issues a little better now as being more significant than maybe we thought 3, 4, 5 months ago. So I think at the OEM level, it's a combination of a lot of system inventory, and initially, in the summer, and device inventory. Then I think probably, trying to bleed down that inventory in anticipation of Windows 8. Clearly, people are trying to get lean on how many of the old systems they're carrying in order to be prepared to ramp as Windows 8's released. And then depending on the robustness of demand for Windows 8, I think they'll be able to respond. So I think it's -- again, I think it's a similar story, just different reasons, maybe more related to Windows as opposed to cloud architecture changing."

Our position is about 1 million units less than it was last quarter and within our range of 4 to 6 weeks. I'm not that concerned about the distribution channel. I think in the OEMs, there's -- depending on the customer, there's probably still some work to be done. I would say at the margin, I feel -- I wish inventories at the customer level were a little lower, both on the systems side probably and the device side. So again, that's one of the reasons that's weighing on our flat TAM assumption. I think probably end user TAM is actually probably going to grow by low-single digits or maybe even mid-single digits.

I think the major point that we're trying to convey is in -- this quarter is when we negotiate prices for next quarter. So if you think about it in reverse, for the quarter we're in now, we negotiated those prices in September or late August. And I would say that I kind of feel that the December pricing probably got away from us just a touch with the demand falling off as much as it did in September. And trying to, I think, recognize what was the real TAM going to be for the December quarter, I think the industry and probably our customers were hoping that it was going to be more in the 150 or 155 range. So I think the industry is probably recognized that the March quarter is likely to be pretty flat to or maybe marginally up. And that we're really not going to buy TAM with pricing. And so I think, we've obviously gotten to pricing levels that are as low as we want to see them if we're bumping on the bottom end of our range. And so, it's important for us to make sure we maintain discipline going forward, so we can get our R&D and capital investments where we want for the long term.

And then secondly, Steve, you talked a lot about macro pressures that are hard to figure out when they're going to end and so on.

On the first thing, on March pricing, I think, Steven, the mix assumptions -- look, we've been kind of off on mix for a couple of 3 quarters in a row here where the mix assumptions we've had, basically, don't come to fruition. And part, I think, is that's just because the pressure that the systems vendors are under to maintain margins. I think mix is -- the assumptions for mix are basically pretty conservative for the March quarter. So if there was actually an improvement in mix, which would be what we would hope, especially if there's any sort of recovery in March on the enterprise, then I think that the relatively flat ASPs, hopefully, will prove to be conservative. So we have tried to, at least this time, assume a pretty conservative view on mix, to say relatively flat ASPs, because as you know, obviously, with new products coming on and mix improving, it actually probably increase ASPs. On the macroeconomic situation and how long does it have to last for it to be really painful. That's a good question. And I would say if we had -- I guess, the question is do you have clarity on that it's going to be 9 to 12 months. If we knew it was going to be flat and weak for the next 9 to 12 months, we'd probably do one set of things. But if you're kind of making that decision quarter-to-quarter, you have a little bit less flexibility, obviously. But to answer your question, I think the good news is for the drive industry, or certainly, for Seagate, and I guess getting to be that way for WD and Hitachi, is for us, it's about absorbing heads and disks really. It's where most of our R&D and where most of our capital is deployed. And as long as we're absorbing heads and disks at these levels, we're okay. And if we had to reduce drive output, that's actually fairly easy capital for us to address, in part, because a lot of it is test capacity, which we can actually increase test times and also with aerial density -- sorry, with average capacity per drive increasing, test times are increasing anyhow. So in a certain sense, as challenging as the environment is, I'd say for the drive industry, given the aerial density and the petabyte growth, it's manageable. Now if TAMs dropped to 120 million units, that's a different story. Then the industry would probably have to take a hard look at a lot of things with respect to internal components and supply, as well as drive level capacity. But I'd say right now for us, while we're operating well below our theoretical capacity, we can maintain the margin structures and the cost objectives that we have at this level of demand, even if it lasted 9 or 12 months."

But again, price erosion is a tricky little term in the drive industry that's, unfortunately, got a legacy that went back to when there was only about 5 different products as opposed to 700 different products. So we like to talk more in terms of ASPs. So you're generally right though that if it was a 5% price erosion that the ASPs probably wouldn't erode by 5%, and gross margins would be healthier. So price erosion is higher than 5%, ASP erosion will be about 5%. And if mix improves either within each category, right -- mix meaning capacity per drive, if you will, or heads and disks per drive, or if the mix improves in terms of enterprise nearline versus client, notebook and desktop, those are all things obviously that boost ASPs. We've taken a pretty conservative approach, as I said on the enterprise market opportunity, in part because of the inventory and in part because of European concerns."

And of course, we've got the 2014 end of year target of $250 million ordinary shares outstanding. So what happens in 2013 though, as you pointed out, is we do run into a Section 382 problem where, if we redeem too many shares, it could trigger a loss of our NOLs, which are fairly substantial. And we'd rather avoid doing that, not that we've used NOLs or necessarily see any need to use NOLs. But it's nice to have them in case you need them. So we'll probably be reasonable in sidestepping that problem, unless the value proposition is just too great, in which case, obviously then, we'll go ahead and buy our stock and deal with losing NOLs that we may or may not need. So what that would mean obviously is a slowdown in redemption in 2013 and then an acceleration in 2014 to get to our target. And in the meantime, obviously, maintaining our dividend policy, which is, as we said, a minimum increase, targeted increase of 10% per year."

So I would assume a flat TAM, whether or not that means 140 or even 155, I think is possible. Like I said, I think the December system sales will probably actually be up. My guess is 3% to 7%, but I think we're not going to see it just because of inventory absorption. So that may mean real TAM for December, in terms of sales out of systems in the 150 range, in which case, then March probably, for us, sales will be like that. So that's what we're assuming, but it doesn't really matter. The point is, capacity is way above that. Capacity is 170, so you're not going to pick up anything. You're not going to pick up 30 million units with pricing. The issue is not pricing of systems. The issue is macroeconomic conditions. So the TAM's 140.

But in Brazil, there is a requirement that if you are building computer systems in Brazil, a certain number or a certain percentage of the components have to be purchased in-country. And we've invested a fair amount of money, in part, as an extension of the investments that Samsung had to make sure that we can actually provide in-country-built drives. Our estimation of what that business should have been in the last couple of quarters was high, and we're still digging into why that is. But as a result, the pricing that we deployed was too aggressive because we didn't get the absorption that we should have. So we've made the adjustments in terms of our expectations. We'll make adjustments in terms of pricing. And we won't get all of that 100 basis points back next quarter, but we think -- this quarter, but we'll probably get half of it back, and then we should kind of be through that knothole [ph]."

I mean if you look at our inventory position, I think it's -- to have less inventory than we did in June, in a quarter that fell off pretty dramatically relative to expectations, I feel that the company responded pretty well. I think linearity is a different issue. I think -- I still think that we and our customers have a lot of work to do around linearity and velocity. And Dave Mosley can talk just a little bit, with Rocky. I mean we're doing a lot of -- it's funny. The flood, for all of its challenges, also, I think, resulted in some really good business process improvements between us and our customers in order to reduce inventory and increase velocity. Some customers are continuing with that. Others are going back to their lazy ways that basically somehow revolve around carrying a lot of inventory to solve business process problems. And I just don't think that's healthy. I think our industry's got to address that with our customers that at the end of the day, that's not good for anybody. So the only way we can really do that is keeping a really tight control on builds. Dave's done a lot of work in this area on the supply chain side, all the way through demand fulfillment. So maybe I'll just ask him to talk to you a little bit, and then Rocky can weigh in on what he's seeing on the customer side in terms of those that are kind of moving towards a model that is maybe more focused on velocity versus inventory."

That helps it straight out of the factories. And then working with our customers to develop hubs that make sense versus hubs that are spread all over the place where we can late-stage postpone some of the configuration issues that they need out the field. With product simplification, that's helping us quite a bit. And then once you get those hubs set up, you can take advantage of [indiscernible]. So I think there's a lot of things that we're doing around that, working with some of the customers that have really kind of come to the table after the flood that Steve talked about that's really paying good benefits efficiency wise.

And working with manufacturing, I think we've really improved the business process of the supply chain with the customers and holding the customers accountable for their commitments. And I think it's resulted in that efficiency you've seen in inventory. It's a continued battle every week-to-week in the volatility to the market we're in. But I think that, again, we made some really fundamental advancements in our cross-functional management of the supply chain through customer fulfillment."

One of the things we're doing internally, Jayson, is we're actually changing our sales comp programs to be rewarded on basically, forecast accuracy and linearity, which is not something that typically we had done, not certainly at the level or priority that we're going to do it now. And the other again is just working with customers. I mean we had a customer last week that made a big change order on enterprise from one product to another. And we try to explain to them why that was difficult. And the response was, well, it's just a mix change. As if you just wave a wand over these drives and somehow make them something different. So it's just a different dialogue that has to occur that look, if you order one of these things, then we're building it for you and you're buying it. And if you're not, then there's going to be a penalty associated to it, not that we'll just swap these things out, like you can go to the hardware store and decide you want 1/4 inch screws instead of 3/8. So a lot of work the industry has to do, I think, to got the right discipline in."

But what I guess would be behind it is customers that hope that they can buy directly instead of buying racked-out systems that they're paying a huge markup on disk drives for. But I don't know that they can really do that, because if they're buying from OEMs, the OEMs really control that through their maintenance and service contracts. So you can't really buy a system and then buy drives from Seagate if you're buying a system from a traditional OEM because then your service contract typically is invalidated. So no one's willing to do that. So we haven't really seen that. But I do think that if you weren't talking about OEMs, I mean, I do think, architecturally, that's happening, that people are starting to design systems where they can incrementally add the storage they need. If those aren't really necessarily through the OEMs. I think it's -- that's more some of the new architectures. 
All right. Well, on behalf of the entire management team, I'd like to thank all of our employees and customers and partner suppliers and shareholders for your support and commitment, and best of luck to everyone on the East Coast as you recover from the storm. Thanks a lot."
