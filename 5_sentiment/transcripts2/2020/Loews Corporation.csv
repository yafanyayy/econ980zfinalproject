For those of you who follow those closely, I must sound like a broken record. I've been saying for a while that we believe Loews' stock looks cheap and trades at a deep discount to our view of its intrinsic value. Rather than complain, we have acted. From January 1, 2018, through Friday, we repurchased more than 45 million shares of Loews common stock for a total cost of just under $2.25 billion. That represents more than 15% of our currently outstanding shares. Typically, most of the funds we've used to repurchase our shares have come from dividends paid to Loews from our subsidiaries. And in recent years, most of those dividends have come from CNA. However, dividends paid to Loews represent only a portion of the free cash flow generated by our subsidiaries.
Our businesses may also decide to use their free cash flow either to fund growth or to pay down debt. And to the extent that they have the opportunity to profitably reinvest their cash flow into their businesses, we encourage them to do so. However, if there is no other productive use for their free cash flow. More often than not, they'll distribute that cash.
To pull back the curtain a bit on this process. In 2019, Loews received more than $180 million from Loews Hotels. This cash came both from the sale of hotels and free cash flow from operations, both after Loews Hotels invested around $70 million into construction of new properties. We expect Loews Hotels to return capital again in 2020, but the amount will likely be smaller because the hotel companies will continue to invest in its own development and we expect fewer proceeds from the sale of hotel properties. No matter what, to the extent that the hotel company has economically attractive projects in which to invest, we want them to do so.
This year, we have 3 new hotels opening in St. Louis, Orlando and Kansas City. These hotels represent more than 3,000 new keys for our company. These properties will either be focused on transient and group business, like the new Loews Kansas City, which is attached to the Kansas City Convention Center. Or they will have built in demand generators like the Endless Summer Hotel in Orlando.
Additionally, in late December of 2019, Loews Hotels received the necessary approvals from the Arlington Texas City Council to build a $550 million (888) room hotel that will be connected to a new convention center. The Arlington Convention Center Complex, which will be at the base of AT&T Stadium and Globe Life field will offer 216,000 square feet of meeting and outdoor function space. It's part of an overall effort by the city to increase convention and tourism business in Arlington, which is nestled between Dallas and Fort Worth and 15 minutes from the DFW airport.
Since 2013, Loews Hotels has more than tripled its adjusted EBITDA, going from $68 million back then to $227 million last year. We believe the company's future is bright and that it will be a strong growth engine for the parent company.
In other subsidiary news, those of you who look at our earnings supplement may notice that CCC, our packaging subsidiary, recently changed its name to Altium. The rationale for the change is that CCC had been well-known with the industry as the water and milk container company, but their product lines and capabilities are much broader. With Altium's recent acquisitions, the company has expanded even further the number of segments of the packaging industry, it can service. The new name is meant to underscore the company's diverse capabilities and help to continue to grow its customer base.
Before turning the call over to David, I want to briefly talk about our results for 2019. Loews had a good year driven by seller results at CNA as well as good investment income at the parent company level. CNA's underlying combined ratio continued to improve in 2019 despite a competitive environment. Since 2016, CNA's underlying combined ratio improved by more than 3 points. Additionally, CNA grew net written premiums by 5% for 2019 and driven by particularly strong growth in commercial lines, rate increased 5% for CNA's P&C operations last year. It goes without saying that we remain very bullish on CNA, both on the fundamentals of the insurance industry and on CNA's growth trajectory within the industry. CNA will continue to focus on maintaining and improving its strong underwriting culture and building on its expertise in areas of deep specialization. These steps will help CNA reach its goal of sustaining top quartile underwriting performance. CNA represents a significant portion of Loews' sum of the parts, and as such, our repurchases underscore our confidence in our insurance business.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to David."

Today, we reported fourth quarter net income of $217 million or $0.73 per share compared to a net loss of $165 million or $0.53 per share in last year's fourth quarter. For the full year, we reported net income of $932 mi",1421,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning. Today, we reported fourth quarter net income of $217 million or $0.73 per share compared to a net loss of $165 million or $0.53 per share in last year's fourth quarter. For the full year, we reported net income of $932 million or $3.07 per share, up from $636 million or $1.99 per share in 2018.
I will start by summarizing our much improved fourth quarter results and then turn to the full year. The earnings turnaround in Q4 was driven mainly by investment results at both CNA and the parent company as well as higher P&C underwriting income at CNA. CNA's net income contribution swung from a $75 million loss in Q4 2018 to income of $244 million, an improvement of $319 million. Returns on CNA's holdings of LPs and common stocks accounted for $146 million of the improvement and a pivot from net investment losses to net investment gains accounted for another $61 million.
P&C underwriting income at CNA accounted for $119 million of our year-over-year net income increase, driven by lower losses and stronger underlying underwriting results. CNA's overall combined ratio declined almost 10 points from Q4 2018 to 95.6. And its underlying combined ratio, which excludes cats and prior year development, improved 3.1 points to 94.9.
Like CNA, Loews' parent company investment results benefited from more favorable equity market conditions as they swung from a $57 million after-tax loss to income of $67 million in Q4. Loews Hotels and CNA's corporate segment were the main year-over-year negatives. Loews Hotels incurred a $69 million after-tax charge from the impairment of 2 hotel properties in Q4. Absent discharge and other nonrecurring items such as preopening expenses on properties under development, Loews Hotels contribution to our net income would have been up around 20% as operating results continued to be robust.
CNA booked a $48 million after-tax charge in Q4 related to its legacy asbestos and environmental pollution reserves, which reduced our net income by $43 million. In last year's fourth quarter, CNA incurred a net retroactive reinsurance charge that reduced our net income by $24 million. As a reminder, in 2010, CNA ceded substantially all its legacy asbestos and environmental pollution liabilities to national indemnity, pursuant to a loss portfolio transfer.
Before turning to the full year, one last observation on the quarter. Average shares outstanding declined about 6% from last year's fourth quarter, reflecting our ongoing share repurchase activity.
Now for our full year results. We reported net income of $932 million, up 47% over 2018. CNA, Boardwalk and the parent company investment portfolio drove the increase with Diamond and Loews Hotels posting year-over-year declines.
Let me start with CNA, whose net income contribution rose 23% in 2019 to $894 million, as CNA itself posted net income of $1 billion. Favorable investment performance propelled to increase. Net investment income rose thanks to LPs and common stock investments, while net investment gains swung from losses in 2018 to gains in 2019. The swing in net investment gains was dominated by the change in market value of CNA's holdings of nonredeemable preferred stock.
P&C underwriting income was essentially flat year-over-year as better underlying underwriting income and lower catastrophe losses were offset by a lower level of favorable net prior year development in 2019 than in the prior year. For the year, CNA posted an underlying combined ratio of 94.8, marking its third consecutive year of improvement. This result included an underlying loss ratio of 61. While CNA has already made great strides in enhancing its underwriting profitability, it remains laser-focused on further reducing both its loss and expense ratios.
The long-term care reserve charge taken in the third quarter was the main detractor from CNA's 2019 results. During 2019, CNA unlocked and strengthened its long-term care active life reserves and action it hadn't taken since year-end 2015. This charge reduced Loews' net income by $151 million. When factoring in long-term care claims reserve releases in both years, however, LTC reserve actions accounted for a $133 million year-over-year reduction in CNA's contribution to our net income.
The bottom line is this. CNA's balance sheet is strong, its underwriting performance continues to improve, with opportunities for further premium growth and the combined ratio reduction and its long-term care business continues to be aggressively and prudently managed to reduce risk and improve results.
Boardwalk also had a good year, as reflected by the significant increases in its contribution to our pretax and net income. Since the increase in net income contribution is due in large part to increasing our ownership from 51% to 100% in July of 2018, I will focus my comments on pretax income. Pretax income was up $50 million in 2019 to $281 million, as revenues generated by growth projects more than offset net revenue losses from contract restructurings, expirations and renewals. Also, about half of the year-over-year increase was from proceeds received when a customer filed for bankruptcy.
The parent company portfolio of cash and investments was the final driver of our year-over-year improvement. This portfolio generated $188 million of after-tax income in 2019 versus an $8 million loss in 2018. The beat was almost entirely attributable to returns on equity holdings. The parent company portfolio of cash and investments averaged $3.9 billion in 2018 and $3.4 billion in 2019.
On the flip side, Diamond and Loews Hotels, both showed year-to-year income declines. Diamond had a tough year, with its pretax loss growing from $226 million in 2018 and to $402 million in 2019. Diamond's 2019 can be summarized by 2 statistics. Revenue earning days, up 4%, but average daily rate, down 17%. As a result, contract drilling revenues were down 12% and contract drilling margin declined from 32% to 15%.
Contract drilling expenses were up almost 10%, largely due to the mix of rigs working in 2019 versus 2018 as well as the accelerated amortization of contract preparation costs on several rigs. In 2019, Diamond invested approximately $325 million in its fleet to ensure its rigs continue to be considered top-tier by customers. The company expects significantly reduced capital spending in 2020. Diamond ended the year with an undrawn revolver of almost $1.2 billion. Revolver capacity will decline to $950 million later this year.
Loews Hotels had a strong year operationally but its contribution to our reported income was impacted by impairment charges and nonrecurring preopening expenses. The company reported an annual net loss of $31 million versus net income last year of $48 million. Excluding impairments and other nonrecurring items, Loews Hotels net income increased 8% from $49 million to $53 million. Loews Hotels adjusted EBITDA, which is defined and disclosed in our quarterly earnings supplement, was essentially flat from 2018 to 2019 at $227 million. However, when properties that Loews Hotels no longer owns are excluded in both years, adjusted EBITDA was up about 2%.
Turning to the parent company. We continue to maintain an extremely strong liquid balance sheet. At year-end, the parent company portfolio totaled $3.3 billion, with 77% in cash and equivalents and 22% in LP investments and marketable equity securities.
During the fourth quarter, we received $110 million in dividends from our subsidiaries, $85 million from CNA and $25 million from Boardwalk. For the full year, we received total dividends of $927 million from CNA and Boardwalk, with CNA contributing $825 million of that amount. Today, CNA declared a $2 per share special dividend and an increased regular quarterly dividend of $0.37. Combining the 2, Loews will receive $575 million in dividends from CNA this quarter.
Please note that since Boardwalk is now wholly owned, it will no longer pay Loews a fixed quarterly dividend and will likely pay an annual dividend toward the end of the year. We currently expect Boardwalk's dividend to Loews in 2020 to approximate 2019's $100 million.
I would highlight that we have worked diligently over the past couple of years to streamline the parent company. Net corporate operating expenses, which include investment expenses now netted against investment income and exclude corporate interest expense dropped about 20% from 2018 to 2019. We while some of this decrease relates to slightly higher allocations to our subsidiaries, much of it relates to parent company efficiencies.
We repurchased 8.3 million shares in the fourth quarter for $417 million and 21.5 million shares during all of 2019 for $1 billion. Since year-end, we have repurchased an additional 3.3 million shares for a total of $172 million.
I will now hand the call back to Mary."

First of all, it provides transparency. Transparency for credit agencies and regulators, which I think they value very much and they like seeing a public stub for CNA. Number two, it's a barometer for all Loews shareholders of just what the market is valuing CNA. And I daresay, if CNA went public, then a lot of people would be asking, why don't we take it public so that they can actually see what the value of CNA is in the free market. Additionally, in order to attract the best talent, it's important to have a public shares so that it can be -- those shares can be used for employee compensation plans. And I daresay, if CNA weren't public, if we didn't have those shares directly reflecting the value of CNA, it might be more difficult to attract the best and the top talent.
One other thing that I'd add is that as long as Loews owns over 80% of CNA. And right now, it owns close to 90%. But as long as we own over 80%, we can do a tax consolidation and get all the benefits of owning 100% of the stock. So there's absolutely no penalty vis-à-vis cash income taxes resulting from Loews owning 90% instead of 80% of the stock. 90% -- I'm sorry, instead of 100% of the stock."

But our downside is really limited to our stake in the company which today represents less than $1 per Loews Corporation share. I would say that the current share price diamond is really trading more like an option than it is like a stock. Regarding to the offshore drilling industry in '89, knowing that it was highly cyclical. When the current downturn started in '14. We thought we've seen this movie before, having weathered a number of drilling cycle downturn. However, this downturn now has lasted much longer than we or I daresay, anyone could have anticipated. Nonetheless, timing, the management continues to focus managing its costs and maximizing earnings potential on the assets through diversification and good operating performance. One other thing. I think the bearishness in Diamond is really -- has been around just since the beginning of the year. At the end of last year, oil prices, West Texas intermediate was $61 a barrel. It traded up to $63 a barrel in early January. And now, as you all know, it's down to $50. And I think that moved down to $50, which was due in large part to the coronavirus and also a sense that the world production capacity would be a bit higher than demand this year, but not in the future. So those 2 factors have caused a dark bearishness to overcome the whole offshore drilling industry. I can easily foresee at some point, oil prices getting back to the $60 and $65 barrel level, I think that shale oil cannot be -- the growth will not -- in shale oil production will not grow significantly at those prices. And I ultimately say next year could see oil prices at the $65 to $70 a barrel level, which was, I believe, lead to significant improvement in the offshore drilling industry. What's happened now is that this is an industry-wide phenomenon. What's going on is not just affecting diamond offshore. The low day rates are going to affect all companies. And in order for  day rates to improve, I think we need to see an increase in oil prices, which, as I said, I think, is coming in, as we say, the fullness of time."

The rationale for the change is that CCC had been well-known with the industry as the water and milk container company, but their product lines and capabilities are much broader. With Altium's recent acquisitions, the company has expanded even further the number of segments of the packaging industry it can service. The new name is meant to underscore the company's diverse capabilities and help to continue to grow its customer base.
Before turning the call over to David, I want to briefly talk about our results for 2019. Loews had a good year driven by seller results at CNA as well as good investment income at the parent company level. CNA's underlying combined ratio continued to improve in 2019 despite a competitive environment. Since 2016, CNA's underlying combined ratio improved by more than 3 points. Additionally, CNA grew net written premiums by 5% for 2019, driven by particularly strong growth in commercial lines, rate increased 5% for CNA's P&C operations last year. It goes without saying that we remain very bullish on CNA, both on the fundamentals of the insurance industry and on CNA's growth trajectory within the industry. CNA will continue to focus on maintaining and improving its strong underwriting culture and building on its expertise in areas of deep specialization. These steps will help CNA reach its goal of sustaining top quartile underwriting performance. CNA represents a significant portion of Loews' sum of the parts, and as such, our repurchases underscore our confidence in our insurance business.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to David."

Today, we reported fourth quarter net income of $217 million or $0.73 per share compared to a net loss of $165 million or $0.53 per share in last year's fourth quarter. For the full year, we reported net income of $932 mi",1422,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning. Today, we reported fourth quarter net income of $217 million or $0.73 per share compared to a net loss of $165 million or $0.53 per share in last year's fourth quarter. For the full year, we reported net income of $932 million or $3.07 per share, up from $636 million or $1.99 per share in 2018.
I will start by summarizing our much improved fourth quarter results and then turn to the full year. The earnings turnaround in Q4 was driven mainly by investment results at both CNA and the parent company, as well as higher P&C underwriting income at CNA. CNA's net income contribution swung from a $75 million loss in Q4 2018 to income of $244 million, an improvement of $319 million. Returns on CNA's holdings of LPs and common stocks accounted for $146 million of the improvement and a pivot from net investment losses to net investment gains accounted for another $61 million.
P&C underwriting income at CNA accounted for $119 million of our year-over-year net income increase, driven by lower cat losses and stronger underlying -- underwriting results. CNA's overall combined ratio declined almost 10 points from Q4 2018 to 95.6. And its underlying combined ratio, which excludes cats and prior year development, improved 3.1 points to 94.9.
Like CNA, Loews' parent company investment results benefited from more favorable equity market conditions as they swung from a $57 million after-tax loss to income of $67 million in Q4. Loews Hotels and CNA's corporate segment were the main year-over-year negatives. Loews Hotels incurred a $69 million after-tax charge from the impairment of 2 hotel properties in Q4. Absent this charge and other nonrecurring items such as preopening expenses on properties under development, Loews Hotels' contribution to our net income would have been up around 20% as operating results continued to be robust.
CNA booked a $48 million after-tax charge in Q4 related to its legacy asbestos and environmental pollution reserves, which reduced our net income by $43 million. In last year's fourth quarter, CNA incurred a net retroactive reinsurance charge that reduced our net income by $24 million. As a reminder, in 2010, CNA ceded substantially all its legacy asbestos and environmental pollution liabilities to national indemnity, pursuant to a loss portfolio transfer.
Before turning to the full year, one last observation on the quarter. Average shares outstanding declined about 6% from last year's fourth quarter, reflecting our ongoing share repurchase activity.
Now for our full year results. We reported net income of $932 million, up 47% over 2018. CNA, Boardwalk and the parent company investment portfolio drove the increase with Diamond and Loews Hotels posting year-over-year declines.
Let me start with CNA, whose net income contribution rose 23% in 2019 to $894 million as CNA itself posted net income of $1 billion. Favorable investment performance propelled to increase. Net investment income rose, thanks to LPs and common stock investments, while net investment gains swung from losses in 2018 to gains in 2019. The swing in net investment gains was dominated by the change in market value of CNA's holdings of nonredeemable preferred stock.
P&C underwriting income was essentially flat year-over-year as better underlying underwriting income and lower catastrophe losses were offset by a lower level of favorable net prior year development in 2019 than in the prior year. For the year, CNA posted an underlying combined ratio of 94.8, marking its third consecutive year of improvement. This result included an underlying loss ratio of 61. While CNA has already made great strides in enhancing its underwriting profitability, it remains laser-focused on further reducing both its loss and expense ratios.
The long-term care reserve charge taken in the third quarter was the main detractor from CNA's 2019 results. During 2019, CNA unlocked and strengthened its long-term care active life reserves and action it hadn't taken since year-end 2015. This charge reduced Loews' net income by $151 million. When factoring in long-term care claims reserve releases in both years, however, LTC reserve actions accounted for a $133 million year-over-year reduction in CNA's contribution to our net income.
The bottom line is this. CNA's balance sheet is strong, its underwriting performance continues to improve, with opportunities for further premium growth and combined ratio reduction and its long-term care business continues to be aggressively and prudently managed to reduce risk and improve results.
Boardwalk also had a good year, as reflected by the significant increases in its contribution to our pretax and net income. Since the increase in net income contribution is due in large part to increasing our ownership from 51% to 100% in July of 2018, I will focus my comments on pretax income. Pretax income was up $50 million in 2019 to $281 million, as revenues generated by growth projects more than offset net revenue losses from contract restructurings, expirations and renewals. Also, about half of the year-over-year increase was from proceeds received when a customer filed for bankruptcy.
The parent company portfolio of cash and investments was the final driver of our year-over-year improvement. This portfolio generated $188 million of after-tax income in 2019 versus an $8 million loss in 2018. The beat was almost entirely attributable to returns on equity holdings. The parent company portfolio of cash and investments averaged $3.9 billion in 2018 and $3.4 billion in 2019.
On the flip side, Diamond and Loews Hotels both showed year-to-year income declines. Diamond had a tough year, with its pretax loss growing from $226 million in 2018 to $402 million in 2019. Diamond's 2019 can be summarized by 2 statistics. Revenue earning days, up 4%, but average daily rate, down 17%. As a result, contract drilling revenues were down 12% and contract drilling margin declined from 32% to 15%.
Contract drilling expenses were up almost 10%, largely due to the mix of rigs working in 2019 versus 2018 as well as the accelerated amortization of contract preparation costs on several rigs. In 2019, Diamond invested approximately $325 million in its fleet to ensure its rigs continue to be considered top-tier by customers. The company expects significantly reduced capital spending in 2020. Diamond ended the year with an undrawn revolver of almost $1.2 billion. Revolver capacity will decline to $950 million later this year.
Loews Hotels had a strong year operationally, but its contribution to our reported income was impacted by impairment charges and nonrecurring preopening expenses. The company reported an annual net loss of $31 million versus net income last year of $48 million. Excluding impairments and other nonrecurring items, Loews Hotels' net income increased 8% from $49 million to $53 million. Loews Hotels adjusted EBITDA, which is defined and disclosed in our quarterly earnings supplement, was essentially flat from 2018 to 2019 at $227 million. However, when properties that Loews Hotels no longer owns are excluded in both years, adjusted EBITDA was up about 2%.
Turning to the parent company. We continue to maintain an extremely strong liquid balance sheet. At year-end, the parent company portfolio totaled $3.3 billion, with 77% in cash and equivalents and 22% in LP investments and marketable equity securities.
During the fourth quarter, we received $110 million in dividends from our subsidiaries, $85 million from CNA and $25 million from Boardwalk. For the full year, we received total dividends of $927 million from CNA and Boardwalk, with CNA contributing $825 million of that amount. Today, CNA declared a $2 per share special dividend and an increased regular quarterly dividend of $0.37. Combining the 2, Loews will receive $575 million in dividends from CNA this quarter.
Please note that since Boardwalk is now wholly owned, it will no longer pay Loews a fixed quarterly dividend and will likely pay an annual dividend toward the end of the year. We currently expect Boardwalk's dividend to Loews in 2020 to approximate 2019's $100 million.
I would highlight that we have worked diligently over the past couple of years to streamline the parent company. Net corporate operating expenses, which include investment expenses, now netted against investment income and exclude corporate interest expense dropped about 20% from 2018 to 2019. We while some of this decrease relates to slightly higher allocations to our subsidiaries, much of it relates to parent company efficiencies.
We repurchased 8.3 million shares in the fourth quarter for $417 million and 21.5 million shares during all of 2019 for $1 billion. Since year-end, we have repurchased an additional 3.3 million shares for a total of $172 million.
I will now hand the call back to Mary."

First of all, it provides transparency. Transparency for credit agencies and regulators, which I think they value very much and they like seeing a public stub for CNA. Number two, it's a barometer for all Loews shareholders of just what the market is valuing CNA. And I daresay, if CNA went public, then a lot of people would be asking, why don't we take it public so that they can actually see what the value of CNA is in the free market. Additionally, in order to attract the best talent, it's important to have a public shares so that it can be -- those shares can be used for employee compensation plans. And I daresay, if CNA weren't public, if we didn't have those shares directly reflecting the value of CNA, it might be more difficult to attract the best and the top talent.
One other thing that I'd add is that as long as Loews owns over 80% of CNA. And right now, it owns close to 90%. But as long as we own over 80%, we can do ourtax consolidation and get all the benefits of owning 100% of the stocks. So there's absolutely no penalty vis-à-vis cash income taxes resulting from Loews owning 90% instead of 80% of the stock. 90% -- I'm sorry, instead of 100% of the stock."

But the our downside is really limited to our stake in the company, which today represents less than $1 per Loews Corporation share. I would say that the current share price, Diamond is really trading more like an option than it is like a star. Regarding to the offshore drilling industry in '89, knowing that it was highly cyclical. When the current downturn started in '14. We thought we've seen this movie before, having weathered a number of drilling cycle downturn. However, this downturn now has lasted much longer than we, or I daresay, anyone could have anticipated. Nonetheless, timing, the management continues to focus managing its costs and maximizing earnings potential on the assets through diversification and good operating performance. One other thing. I think the bearishness in Diamond is really -- has been around just since the beginning of the year. At the end of last year, oil prices -- West Texas intermediate was $61 a barrel. It traded up to $63 a barrel in early January. And now, as you all know, it's down to $50. And I think that moved down to $50, which was due in large part to the coronavirus and also a sense that the world production capacity would be a bit higher than demand this year, but not in the future. So those 2 factors have caused a dark bearishness to overcome the whole offshore drilling industry. I can easily foresee at some point, oil prices getting back to the $60 and $65 barrel level, I think that shale oil cannot be -- the growth will not -- in shale oil production will not grow significantly at those prices. And I ultimately say next year could see oil prices at the $65 to $70 a barrel level, which was, I believe, lead to significant improvement in the offshore drilling industry. What happened now is that this is an industry-wide phenomenon. What's going on is not just affecting Diamond offshore. The low day rates are going to affect all companies. And in order for day rates to improve, I think we need to see an increase in oil prices, which, as I said, I think, is coming in, as we say, the fullness of time."

Before we get into the details of the quarter and our year-end results, I want to mention share repurchases. For those of you who follow those closely, I must sound like a broken record. I've been saying for a while that",826,"Thank you, Mary, and good morning. Before we get into the details of the quarter and our year-end results, I want to mention share repurchases. For those of you who follow those closely, I must sound like a broken record. I've been saying for a while that we believe Loews' stock looks cheap and trades at a deep discount to our view of its intrinsic value. Rather than complain, we have acted. From January 1, 2018, through Friday, we repurchased more than 45 million shares of Loews common stock for a total cost of just under $2.25 billion. That represents more than 15% of our currently outstanding shares. Typically, most of the funds we've used to repurchase our shares have come from dividends paid to Loews from our subsidiaries. And in recent years, most of those dividends have come from CNA. However, dividends paid to Loews represent only a portion of the free cash flow generated by our subsidiaries.
Our businesses may also decide to use their free cash flow either to fund growth or to pay down debt. And to the extent that they have the opportunity to profitably reinvest their cash flow into their businesses, we encourage them to do so. However, if there is no other productive use for their free cash flow, more often than not, they'll distribute that cash.
To pull back the curtain a bit on this process, in 2019, Loews received more than $180 million from Loews Hotels. This cash came both from the sale of hotels and free cash flow from operations, both after Loews Hotels invested around $70 million into construction of new properties. We expect Loews Hotels to return capital again in 2020, but the amount will likely be smaller because the hotel companies will continue to invest in its own development and we expect fewer proceeds from the sale of hotel properties. No matter what, to the extent that the hotel company has economically attractive projects in which to invest, we want them to do so.
This year, we have 3 new hotels opening in St. Louis, Orlando and Kansas City. These hotels represent more than 3,000 new keys for our company. These properties will either be focused on transient and group business, like the new Loews Kansas City, which is attached to the Kansas City Convention Center, or they will have built-in demand generators like the Endless Summer Hotel in Orlando.
Additionally, in late December of 2019, Loews Hotels received the necessary approvals from the Arlington Texas City Council to build a $550 million 888-room hotel that will be connected to a new convention center, the Arlington Convention Center complex, which will be at the base of AT&T Stadium and Globe Life field, will offer 216,000 square feet of meeting and outdoor function space. It's part of an overall effort by the city to increase convention and tourism business in Arlington, which is nestled between Dallas and Fort Worth and 15 minutes from the DFW airport.
Since 2013, Loews Hotels has more than tripled its adjusted EBITDA, going from $68 million back then to $227 million last year. We believe the company's future is bright and that it will be a strong growth engine for the parent company.
In other subsidiary news, those of you who look at our earnings supplement may notice that CCC, our packaging subsidiary, recently changed its name to Altium.

When factoring in long-term care claims reserve releases in both years, however, LTC reserve actions accounted for a $133 million year-over-year reduction in CNA's contribution to our net income.
The bottom line is this. CNA's balance sheet is strong, its underwriting performance continues to improve, with opportunities for further premium growth and combined ratio reduction, and its long-term care business continues to be aggressively and prudently managed to reduce risk and improve results.
Boardwalk also had a good year, as reflected by the significant increases in its contribution to our pretax and net income. Since the increase in net income contribution is due in large part to increasing our ownership from 51% to 100% in July of 2018, I will focus my comments on pretax income. Pretax income was up $50 million in 2019 to $281 million, as revenues generated by growth projects more than offset net revenue losses from contract restructurings, expirations and renewals. Also, about half of the year-over-year increase was from proceeds received when a customer filed for bankruptcy.
The parent company portfolio of cash and investments was the final driver of our year-over-year improvement. This portfolio generated $188 million of after-tax income in 2019 versus an $8 million loss in 2018. The beat was almost entirely attributable to returns on equity holdings. The parent company portfolio of cash and investments averaged $3.9 billion in 2018 and $3.4 billion in 2019.
On the flip side, Diamond and Loews Hotels both showed year-to-year income declines. Diamond had a tough year, with its pretax loss growing from $226 million in 2018 to $402 million in 2019. Diamond's 2019 can be summarized by 2 statistics: revenue earning days, up 4%; but average daily rate, down 17%. As a result, contract drilling revenues were down 12%, and contract drilling margin declined from 32% to 15%.
Contract drilling expenses were up almost 10%, largely due to the mix of rigs working in 2019 versus 2018 as well as the accelerated amortization of contract preparation costs on several rigs. In 2019, Diamond invested approximately $325 million in its fleet to ensure its raise continue to be considered top-tier by customers. The company expects significantly reduced capital spending in 2020. Diamond ended the year with an undrawn revolver of almost $1.2 billion. Revolver capacity will decline to $950 million later this year.
Loews Hotels had a strong year operationally, but its contribution to our reported income was impacted by impairment charges and nonrecurring preopening expenses. The company reported an annual net loss of $31 million versus net income last year of $48 million. Excluding impairments and other nonrecurring items, Loews Hotels' net income increased 8% from $49 million to $53 million. Loews Hotels' adjusted EBITDA, which is defined and disclosed in our quarterly earnings supplement, was essentially flat from 2018 to 2019 at $227 million. However, when properties that Loews Hotels no longer owns are excluded in both years, adjusted EBITDA was up about 2%.
Turning to the parent company. We continue to maintain an extremely strong and liquid balance sheet. At year-end, the parent company portfolio totaled $3.3 billion, with 77% in cash and equivalents and 22% in LP investments and marketable equity securities.
During the fourth quarter, we received $110 million in dividends from our subsidiaries, $85 million from CNA and $25 million from Boardwalk. For the full year, we received total dividends of $927 million from CNA and Boardwalk, with CNA contributing $825 million of that amount. Today, CNA declared a $2 per share special dividend and an increased regular quarterly dividend of $0.37. Combining the 2, Loews will receive $575 million in dividends from CNA this quarter.
Please note that since Boardwalk is now wholly owned, it will no longer pay Loews a fixed quarterly dividend and will likely pay an annual dividend toward the end of the year. We currently expect Boardwalk's dividend to Loews in 2020 to approximate 2019's $100 million.
I would highlight that we have worked diligently over the past couple of years to streamline the parent company. Net corporate operating expenses, which include investment expenses now netted against investment income and exclude corporate interest expense, dropped about 20% from 2018 to 2019. While some of this decrease relates to slightly higher allocations to our subsidiaries, much of it relates to parent company efficiencies.
We repurchased 8.3 million shares in the fourth quarter for $417 million and 21.5 million shares during all of 2019 for $1 billion. Since year-end, we have repurchased an additional 3.3 million shares for a total of $172 million.
I will now hand the call back to Mary."

First of all, it provides transparency, transparency for credit agencies and regulators, which I think they value very much and they like seeing a public stub for CNA. 
Number two, it's a barometer for all Loews shareholders of just what the market is valuing CNA. And I daresay, if CNA went public, then a lot of people would be asking, why don't we take it public so that they can actually see what the value of CNA is in the free market. 
Additionally, in order to attract the best talent, it's important to have a public shares so that it can be -- those shares can be used for employee compensation plans. And I daresay, if CNA weren't public, if we didn't have those shares directly reflecting the value of CNA, it might be more difficult to attract the best and the top talent.
One other thing that I'd add is that as long as Loews owns over 80% of CNA, and right now, it owns close to 90%, but as long as we own over 80%, we can do our tax consolidation and get all the benefits of owning 100% of the stock. So there's absolutely no penalty vis-à-vis cash income taxes resulting from Loews owning 90% instead of 80% of the stock. 90%, I'm sorry, instead of 100% of the stock."

But our downside is really limited to our stake in the company, which today represents less than $1 per Loews Corporation share. I would say that the current share price, Diamond is really trading more like an option than it is like a stock. We got into the offshore drilling industry in '89 knowing that it was highly cyclical. When the current downturn started in '14, we thought we've seen this movie before, having weathered a number of drilling cycle downturn. However, this downturn now has lasted much longer than we or I daresay anyone could have anticipated. Nonetheless, Diamond, the management continues to focus managing its costs and maximizing earnings potential on the assets through diversification and good operating performance. 
One other thing. I think the bearishness in Diamond is really -- has been around just since the beginning of the year. At the end of last year, oil prices -- West Texas Intermediate was $61 a barrel. It traded up to $63 a barrel in early January. And now, as you all know, it's down to $50. And I think that moved down to $50, which was due in large part to the coronavirus and also a sense that the world production capacity would be a bit higher than demand this year, but not in the future. So those 2 factors have caused a dark bearishness to overcome the whole offshore drilling industry. I can easily foresee, at some point, oil prices getting back to the $60 and $65 barrel level. I think that shale oil cannot be -- the growth will not -- in shale oil production will not grow significantly at those prices. And I ultimately say next year could see oil prices at the $65 to $70 a barrel level, which would, I believe, lead to significant improvement in the offshore drilling industry. What happened now is that this is an industry-wide phenomenon. What's going on is not just affecting Diamond offshore. The low day rates are going to affect all companies. And in order for day rates to improve, I think we need to see an increase in oil prices, which, as I said, I think, is coming in, as we say, the fullness of time."

Before we get into the details of the quarter and our year-end results, I want to mention share repurchases. For those of you who follow those closely, I must sound like a broken record. I've been saying for a while that",826,"Thank you, Mary, and good morning. Before we get into the details of the quarter and our year-end results, I want to mention share repurchases. For those of you who follow those closely, I must sound like a broken record. I've been saying for a while that we believe Loews' stock looks cheap and trades at a deep discount to our view of its intrinsic value. Rather than complain, we have acted. From January 1, 2018, through Friday, we repurchased more than 45 million shares of Loews common stock for a total cost of just under $2.25 billion. That represents more than 15% of our currently outstanding shares. Typically, most of the funds we've used to repurchase our shares have come from dividends paid to Loews from our subsidiaries. And in recent years, most of those dividends have come from CNA. However, dividends paid to Loews represent only a portion of the free cash flow generated by our subsidiaries.
Our businesses may also decide to use their free cash flow either to fund growth or to pay down debt. And to the extent that they have the opportunity to profitably reinvest their cash flow into their businesses, we encourage them to do so. However, if there is no other productive use for their free cash flow, more often than not, they'll distribute that cash.
To pull back the curtain a bit on this process, in 2019, Loews received more than $180 million from Loews Hotels. This cash came both from the sale of hotels and free cash flow from operations, both after Loews Hotels invested around $70 million into construction of new properties. We expect Loews Hotels to return capital again in 2020, but the amount will likely be smaller because the hotel companies will continue to invest in its own development and we expect fewer proceeds from the sale of hotel properties. No matter what, to the extent that the hotel company has economically attractive projects in which to invest, we want them to do so.
This year, we have 3 new hotels opening in St. Louis, Orlando and Kansas City. These hotels represent more than 3,000 new keys for our company. These properties will either be focused on transient and group business, like the new Loews Kansas City, which is attached to the Kansas City Convention Center, or they will have built-in demand generators like the Endless Summer Hotel in Orlando.
Additionally, in late December of 2019, Loews Hotels received the necessary approvals from the Arlington Texas City Council to build a $550 million 888-room hotel that will be connected to a new convention center, the Arlington Convention Center complex, which will be at the base of AT&T Stadium and Globe Life field, will offer 216,000 square feet of meeting and outdoor function space. It's part of an overall effort by the city to increase convention and tourism business in Arlington, which is nestled between Dallas and Fort Worth and 15 minutes from the DFW airport.
Since 2013, Loews Hotels has more than tripled its adjusted EBITDA, going from $68 million back then to $227 million last year. We believe the company's future is bright and that it will be a strong growth engine for the parent company.
In other subsidiary news, those of you who look at our earnings supplement may notice that CCC, our packaging subsidiary, recently changed its name to Altium. The rationale for the change is that CCC had been well-known with the industry as the water and milk container company, but their product lines and capabilities are much broader. With Altium's recent acquisitions, the company has expanded even further the number of segments of the packaging industry it can service. The new name is meant to underscore the company's diverse capabilities and help to continue to grow its customer base.
Before turning the call over to David, I want to briefly talk about our results for 2019. Loews had a good year driven by seller results at CNA as well as good investment income at the parent company level. CNA's underlying combined ratio continued to improve in 2019 despite a competitive environment. Since 2016, CNA's underlying combined ratio improved by more than 3 points. Additionally, CNA grew net written premiums by 5% for 2019 driven by particularly strong growth in commercial lines. Rate increased 5% for CNA's P&C operation last year. It goes without saying that we remain very bullish on CNA, both on the fundamentals of the insurance industry and on CNA's growth trajectory within the industry. CNA will continue to focus on maintaining and improving its strong underwriting culture and building on its expertise in areas of deep specialization. These steps will help CNA reach its goal of sustaining top quartile underwriting performance. CNA represents a significant portion of Loews' sum of the parts, and as such, our repurchases underscore our confidence in our insurance business.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to David."

Today, we reported fourth quarter net income of $217 million or $0.73 per share compared to a net loss of $165 million or $0.53 per share in last year's fourth quarter. For the full year, we reported net income of $932 mi",1422,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning. Today, we reported fourth quarter net income of $217 million or $0.73 per share compared to a net loss of $165 million or $0.53 per share in last year's fourth quarter. For the full year, we reported net income of $932 million or $3.07 per share, up from $636 million or $1.99 per share in 2018.
I will start by summarizing our much improved fourth quarter results and then turn to the full year. The earnings turnaround in Q4 was driven mainly by investment results at both CNA and the parent company, as well as higher P&C underwriting income at CNA. CNA's net income contribution swung from a $75 million loss in Q4 2018 to income of $244 million, an improvement of $319 million. Returns on CNA's holdings of LPs and common stocks accounted for $146 million of the improvement, and a pivot from net investment losses to net investment gains accounted for another $61 million.
P&C underwriting income at CNA accounted for $119 million of our year-over-year net income increase, driven by lower cat losses and stronger underlying -- underwriting results. CNA's overall combined ratio declined almost 10 points from Q4 2018 to 95.6. And its underlying combined ratio, which excludes cats and prior year development, improved 3.1 points to 94.9.
Like CNA, Loews' parent company investment results benefited from more favorable equity market conditions as they swung from a $57 million after-tax loss to income of $67 million in Q4. Loews Hotels and CNA's corporate segment were the main year-over-year negatives. Loews Hotels incurred a $69 million after-tax charge from the impairment of 2 hotel properties in Q4. Absent this charge and other nonrecurring items such as preopening expenses on properties under development, Loews Hotels' contribution to our net income would have been up around 20% as operating results continued to be robust.
CNA booked a $48 million after-tax charge in Q4 related to its legacy asbestos and environmental pollution reserves, which reduced our net income by $43 million. In last year's fourth quarter, CNA incurred a net retroactive reinsurance charge that reduced our net income by $24 million. As a reminder, in 2010, CNA ceded substantially all its legacy asbestos and environmental pollution liabilities to national indemnity, pursuant to a loss portfolio transfer.
Before turning to the full year, one last observation on the quarter. Average shares outstanding declined about 6% from last year's fourth quarter, reflecting our ongoing share repurchase activity.
Now for our full year results. We reported net income of $932 million, up 47% over 2018. CNA, Boardwalk and the parent company investment portfolio drove the increase with Diamond and Loews Hotels posting year-over-year declines.
Let me start with CNA, whose net income contribution rose 23% in 2019 to $894 million as CNA itself posted net income of $1 billion. Favorable investment performance propelled the increase. Net investment income rose, thanks to LPs and common stock investments, while net investment gains swung from losses in 2018 to gains in 2019. The swing in net investment gains was dominated by the change in market value of CNA's holdings of nonredeemable preferred stock.
P&C underwriting income was essentially flat year-over-year as better underlying underwriting income and lower catastrophe losses were offset by a lower level of favorable net prior year development in 2019 than in the prior year. For the year, CNA posted an underlying combined ratio of 94.8, marking its third consecutive year of improvement. This result included an underlying loss ratio of 61. While CNA has already made great strides in enhancing its underwriting profitability, it remains laser-focused on further reducing both its loss and expense ratios.
The long-term care reserve charge taken in the third quarter was the main detractor from CNA's 2019 results. During 2019, CNA unlocked and strengthened its long-term care active life reserves and action it hadn't taken since year-end 2015. This charge reduced Loews' net income by $151 million. When factoring in long-term care claims reserve releases in both years, however, LTC reserve actions accounted for a $133 million year-over-year reduction in CNA's contribution to our net income.
The bottom line is this. CNA's balance sheet is strong, its underwriting performance continues to improve, with opportunities for further premium growth and combined ratio reduction, and its long-term care business continues to be aggressively and prudently managed to reduce risk and improve results.
Boardwalk also had a good year, as reflected by the significant increases in its contribution to our pretax and net income. Since the increase in net income contribution is due in large part to increasing our ownership from 51% to 100% in July of 2018, I will focus my comments on pretax income. Pretax income was up $50 million in 2019 to $281 million, as revenues generated by growth projects more than offset net revenue losses from contract restructurings, expirations and renewals. Also, about half of the year-over-year increase was from proceeds received when a customer filed for bankruptcy.
The parent company portfolio of cash and investments was the final driver of our year-over-year improvement. This portfolio generated $188 million of after-tax income in 2019 versus an $8 million loss in 2018. The beat was almost entirely attributable to returns on equity holdings. The parent company portfolio of cash and investments averaged $3.9 billion in 2018 and $3.4 billion in 2019.
On the flip side, Diamond and Loews Hotels both showed year-to-year income declines. Diamond had a tough year, with its pretax loss growing from $226 million in 2018 to $402 million in 2019. Diamond's 2019 can be summarized by 2 statistics: revenue earning days, up 4%; but average daily rate, down 17%. As a result, contract drilling revenues were down 12%, and contract drilling margin declined from 32% to 15%.
Contract drilling expenses were up almost 10%, largely due to the mix of rigs working in 2019 versus 2018 as well as the accelerated amortization of contract preparation costs on several rigs. In 2019, Diamond invested approximately $325 million in its fleet to ensure its raise continue to be considered top-tier by customers. The company expects significantly reduced capital spending in 2020. Diamond ended the year with an undrawn revolver of almost $1.2 billion. Revolver capacity will decline to $950 million later this year.
Loews Hotels had a strong year operationally, but its contribution to our reported income was impacted by impairment charges and nonrecurring preopening expenses. The company reported an annual net loss of $31 million versus net income last year of $48 million. Excluding impairments and other nonrecurring items, Loews Hotels' net income increased 8% from $49 million to $53 million. Loews Hotels' adjusted EBITDA, which is defined and disclosed in our quarterly earnings supplement, was essentially flat from 2018 to 2019 at $227 million. However, when properties that Loews Hotels no longer owns are excluded in both years, adjusted EBITDA was up about 2%.
Turning to the parent company. We continue to maintain an extremely strong and liquid balance sheet. At year-end, the parent company portfolio totaled $3.3 billion, with 77% in cash and equivalents and 22% in LP investments and marketable equity securities.
During the fourth quarter, we received $110 million in dividends from our subsidiaries, $85 million from CNA and $25 million from Boardwalk. For the full year, we received total dividends of $927 million from CNA and Boardwalk, with CNA contributing $825 million of that amount. Today, CNA declared a $2 per share special dividend and an increased regular quarterly dividend of $0.37. Combining the 2, Loews will receive $575 million in dividends from CNA this quarter.
Please note that since Boardwalk is now wholly owned, it will no longer pay Loews a fixed quarterly dividend and will likely pay an annual dividend toward the end of the year. We currently expect Boardwalk's dividend to Loews in 2020 to approximate 2019's $100 million.
I would highlight that we have worked diligently over the past couple of years to streamline the parent company. Net corporate operating expenses, which include investment expenses now netted against investment income and exclude corporate interest expense, dropped about 20% from 2018 to 2019. While some of this decrease relates to slightly higher allocations to our subsidiaries, much of it relates to parent company efficiencies.
We repurchased 8.3 million shares in the fourth quarter for $417 million and 21.5 million shares during all of 2019 for $1 billion. Since year-end, we have repurchased an additional 3.3 million shares for a total of $172 million.

First of all, it provides transparency, transparency for credit agencies and regulators, which I think they value very much and they like seeing a public stub for CNA. 
Number two, it's a barometer for all Loews shareholders of just what the market is valuing CNA. And I daresay, if CNA went public, then a lot of people would be asking, why don't we take it public so that they can actually see what the value of CNA is in the free market. 
Additionally, in order to attract the best talent, it's important to have a public shares so that it can be -- those shares can be used for employee compensation plans. And I daresay, if CNA weren't public, if we didn't have those shares directly reflecting the value of CNA, it might be more difficult to attract the best and the top talent.
One other thing that I'd add is that as long as Loews owns over 80% of CNA, and right now, it owns close to 90%, but as long as we own over 80%, we can do our tax consolidation and get all the benefits of owning 100% of the stock. So there's absolutely no penalty vis-à-vis cash income taxes resulting from Loews owning 90% instead of 80% of the stock. 90%, I'm sorry, instead of 100% of the stock."

But our downside is really limited to our stake in the company, which today represents less than $1 per Loews Corporation share. I would say that the current share price, Diamond is really trading more like an option than it is like a stock. We got into the offshore drilling industry in '89 knowing that it was highly cyclical. When the current downturn started in '14, we thought we've seen this movie before, having weathered a number of drilling cycle downturn. However, this downturn now has lasted much longer than we or I daresay anyone could have anticipated. Nonetheless, Diamond, the management continues to focus managing its costs and maximizing earnings potential on the assets through diversification and good operating performance. 
One other thing. I think the bearishness in Diamond is really -- has been around just since the beginning of the year. At the end of last year, oil prices -- West Texas Intermediate was $61 a barrel. It traded up to $63 a barrel in early January. And now, as you all know, it's down to $50. And I think that moved down to $50, which was due in large part to the coronavirus and also a sense that the world production capacity would be a bit higher than demand this year, but not in the future. So those 2 factors have caused a dark bearishness to overcome the whole offshore drilling industry. I can easily foresee, at some point, oil prices getting back to the $60 and $65 barrel level. I think that shale oil cannot be -- the growth will not -- in shale oil production will not grow significantly at those prices. And I ultimately say next year could see oil prices at the $65 to $70 a barrel level, which would, I believe, lead to significant improvement in the offshore drilling industry. What happened now is that this is an industry-wide phenomenon. What's going on is not just affecting Diamond offshore. The low day rates are going to affect all companies. And in order for day rates to improve, I think we need to see an increase in oil prices, which, as I said, I think, is coming in, as we say, the fullness of time."

Before we discuss how Lowe's is addressing the many challenges presented by the coronavirus, I want to take a moment to acknowledge everyone on the front lines of the fight against this pandemic. They are true heroes. I speak for all of us at Loews' Corporation when I thank them for their bravery, for their selflessness and for everything they are doing to save lives. To express our things a bit more concretely, I'm proud to announce that Loews' has donated $1 million that has been allocated between several different funds that provide direct support to these frontline health care heroes. I'm glad we're able to help these individuals who are risking their own lives to help others.
It's astonishing how quickly the coronavirus has altered our lives. Loews' 2019 letter to shareholders is dated February 11 of this year. In it, we described the dramatic changes brought about over the last decade by disruptive technologies, shifting trade relations and an array of market and geopolitical forces. Little did I know when we completed our letter that the most dramatic change was directly ahead. What started out as a promising year has quickly and dramatically morphed into a global economic free fall.
Like so many other companies, Lowe's and its subsidiaries started operating remotely overnight as travel restrictions and shelter in place orders were issued by governments around the world.
Since Loews in our subsidiaries that are already put into place the enhanced IT infrastructure required for a quick and efficient transition to remote operations, our company has moved to working from home went even more smoothly than I would have expected. Our employees rose to the challenge with resilience and focus. I want to thank them all for their dedication, which has enabled Loews' to move forward.
So back to our operations. The coronavirus has impacted each of Loews' businesses in different ways. Some of our subsidiaries have been hard hit, and others have not. Specifically, Diamond Offshore and Loews Hotels have felt the most pain. Let me lead off with Diamond Offshore and the sequence of events that resulted in the company's Chapter 11 announcement on April 26.
It's no secret that the offshore drilling industry has been experiencing a protracted downturn since 2014. It's been a long hard road for the offshore drillers, played by an oversupply of rigs, coupled with persistently low oil prices. Earlier this year, however, we thought we saw the funds start to break through the cloud. At the beginning of January, oil was priced at $60 a barrel and global oil demand was expected to grow. Unfortunately, that sunny moment was short-lived. Over the first quarter, Saudi Arabia and Russia failed to reach a production agreement, and global demand experienced a sudden and cataclysmic decline due to the spread of COVID-19. These factors caused oil prices to drop to about $20 per barrel. That's a 2/3 decline in price in a 3-month period. In response, oil companies significantly reduced their capital budgets. Travel bans further complicated offshore drillers' ability to staff their rigs, and E&P companies use every opportunity they could to cancel or renegotiate contracts. Talk about impactable bad timing.
Keep in mind that even before this unfortunate confluence of events, Loews' exposure to Diamond was limited to our equity stake, which by mid-March, had a market value of between $100 million and $200 million.
Later in this call, our CFO, David Edelson, we'll walk you through the GAAP impact to Loews of the Diamond Chapter 11 filing. But it's important to remember that while the backed deconsolidation loss is significant, it's a noncash loss. Loews' balance sheet remains strong and being the quarter with $3.1 billion in cash and investments.
While we are incredibly disappointed about the sequence of world events that led Diamond to make its April 26 announcement. I am very proud of the work that Diamond offshore has done over the years. Diamond has been a leader in the offshore drilling industry. The company's CEO, Mark Edwards, has been outstanding, and his team has worked hard in a very tough environment. Diamond is comprised of talented and resilient individuals facing extraordinary circumstances. We hope for a brighter future for the company in the years to come.
Moving on to the rest of the Loews portfolio, I'd like to do a quick review of our businesses and their operations today, how they are faring and functioning in this ever changing new normal world. As you know, for the last couple of years, it has been our practice to take questions from shareholders. Since the questions we have received over the last month has been very consistent, I'm going to address them as part of my prepared remarks and in the context of this review.
First up is CNA. Operationally, CNA's performance has been quite strong. The company's underlying combined ratio for the quarter was slightly better than in the first quarter of 2019, driven primarily by a reduction in the expense ratio. CNA also had solid rate increases of 8% as the hard market continued. All in all, CNA has the balance sheet, the business mix, management team and infrastructure to manage adeptly through this crisis.
In terms of the pandemic's impact on CNA's future earnings, it's too early to make concrete statements. But we imagine that the P&C industry will face some headwinds. These will include low interest rates and lower premium levels as a result of the decline in GDP. CNA is monitoring the situation closely as it unfolds, and we have a lot of confidence in the expertise and judgment of CNA's CEO, Dino Robusto, and his senior management team.
Our shareholders' questions for CNA focused on 2 topics: business interruption insurance and the effects of the turbulent markets on CNA's investment portfolio. Let me address each 1 of these. On their call earlier this morning, Dino made some very clear statements regarding business interruption insurance, which I will reiterate here. Dino said, and I quote, CNA's property policies require direct physical damage to the property from a covered peril for coverage to attach. Additionally, the property policies, whether issued in the United States or internationally, have exclusion borrowing coverage for viruses. There are very few policies where coverage may exist on small participations in our Loews -- Lloyd's operations, but the total limits exposed are de minimis. So with respect to property business interruption insurance, CNA's policy line, which does not cover COVID-19 in virtually all cases, and the company never collected premiums for it.""
In terms of CNA's investment portfolio, in the first quarter, CNA's unrealized gain position declined from $4 billion at the end of 2019 to $2 billion at the end of the first quarter. To put this in context, CNA's unrealized gain position has typically varied between $2 billion and $4 billion since 2011, with $4 billion being the high watermark. Since the end of this year's first quarter, the unrealized gain in CNA's portfolio has rebounded off its lows and is now about $3 billion.
Interest rates across asset classes other than treasuries went up at the end of the first quarter due to spread widening that provided CNA with a rare opportunity to add high-quality assets at attractive yields. This opportunity has since diminished somewhat as the fixed income markets have come roaring back. Over the last several years, CNA has been reducing its exposure to risk assets. Including equities, hedge funds and below investment-grade securities to the lowest level in over a decade.
Next up is Boardwalk Pipelines. The company is operationally sound and benefiting from growth projects coming online. While revenue declined slightly in the first quarter, the decline was due to the now completed recontracting of Boardwalk's expansion projects placed in service in the 2008 to 2010 time frame.
Shareholders have asked us about the effect of lower oil prices on Boardwalk. Additionally, we've gotten questions about the financial stability of Boardwalk's customers. Let me address both of these queries. Boardwalk's business has not been significantly impacted by the drop in oil prices. In the first quarter of 2020, Boardwalk's natural gas throughput and liquids volume increased slightly from the comparable period last year. Since the crisis hit in mid-March, Boardwalk has maintained uninterrupted service to its customers while also taking measures to ensure the safety of its employees and to maintain efficient operations.
At the end of the first quarter, Boardwalk had a backlog of well over $9 billion in contracted revenues with about $370 million of new contracts added in the first quarter. More than 70% of Boardwalk's revenue backlog is derived from investment-grade companies. Boardwalk has letters of credit from some of its customers that are not investment-grade or not rated, which provide an additional measure of security.
To reiterate, so far, Boardwalk's operations and financial performance have not been materially impacted by the coronavirus or the drop in oil prices. Boardwalk anticipates another solid year of financial performance. Almost 90% of Boardwalk's revenues are backed by fixed fee take-or-pay agreements. Revenue in 2020 is expected to be about $60 million lower than 2019 due primarily to the expiration of the legacy contracts. At the end of 2020, Boardwalk should have a debt-to-EBITDA ratio below 5x leverage.
With industry veteran, Stan Horton, at the helm, leading a seasoned team of senior managers, the company expects to finance its capital needs this year, primarily by using internally-generated cash flow.
Let's move on to Altium, our plastic packaging manufacturer. Altium is actually benefiting from the ongoing surge in their consumer retail segment, primarily due to increased purchases of beverage and cleaning products. Under the top-notch leadership of the company's CEO, Sean Fallman, Altium HAS taken a number of precautions to ensure the safety of its employees and its manufacturing plants. These precautions include making sure employees comply with social distancing protocols, installing sanitizing stations, distributing masks and gloves, taking temperatures pre-shift and increasing employee fit days. These new measures have helped Altium's manufacturing plants operate smoothly, even with the increase in volume. We expect Altium's EBITDA to be up nicely this year, with a good portion coming from completed acquisitions as well as from organic growth.
Finally, let me comment on Loews Hotels. We had great hotel -- we had great expectations for our hotel business in 2020. But today's reality couldn't be further from what we had envisioned. Travel bans, shelter in place orders and social distancing protocols have had a profound effect on Loews Hotels as well as on all of its competitors. The company work from being in growth mode to being forced to do everything it could to contain costs.
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting government mandates to halt the spread of the virus, most of Loews Hotels -- most of Loews on hotels have temporarily suspended operations. Only 4 hotels remain operational, and those have very limited occupancy. Unfortunately, the catastrophic loss of business made it necessary to further -- nearly 90% of Loews Hotels employees. This was a painful decision made in order to ensure that the company could continue to operate over the long term.
Having taken this tough step, Loews Hotels then followed up with significant assistance for its furloughed team members. The company has set up a multimillion-dollar relief fund for affected employees and has also continued to cover medical insurance costs for up to 3 months for employees enrolled in company benefits. Additionally, in solidarity with all Loews Hotels team members were being impacted financially by the crisis. The members of the office of the President, me, Andrew Tisch and Loews Hotel, CEO, John Kish; reduced our salaries by 50% as of April 1 and reduced our bonuses by 50% for the entire year.
At this point in time, it's difficult to predict when Loews Hotels will resume normal operations. We expect that circumstances will vary by hotel property with occupancy at hotels increasing gradually as the industry recovers from the effects of the pandemic.
Before turning the call over to David, I want to comment on the parent company and our current view of the world. We have always said that we like to sleep at night, and that is still true today. In our current circumstances as we experience so much uncertainty, we plan to maintain a substantial cash position as our rainy day fund. With over $3 billion in cash and investments and no significant calls on those resources, Loews remains strong. We will reevaluate our capital allocation strategies once we have more clarity as to the path forward for our company, our subsidiaries and our country.
And now I'd like to hand the call over to our CFO, David Elison."
285930,665832577,1969419,"Loews Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, May 04, 2020",2020-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Loews Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone.

This year's first quarter loss and a su",1682,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. For the first quarter, Loews reported a net loss of $632 million or $2.20 per share compared to net income of $394 million or $1.27 per share in last year's first quarter. This year's first quarter loss and a substantial year-over-year decline had 2 main causes: investment losses at CNA and the parent company, which were caused by financial market disruptions as the COVID-19 pandemic spread and rig impairments at Diamond Offshore. Also worth noting, as Jim did, is the dramatic falloff in results at Loews Hotels caused by the pandemic.
Let me start by providing more details about the quarter, focusing on these 3 items. I will also discuss the accounting implications of Diamond's recent Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing as well as some of the issues we are monitoring as the pandemic impacts our businesses. The financial markets experienced tremendous volatility in March in response to the spreading coronavirus pandemic and its economic fallout. Equity markets plummeted and credit spreads widened. Both CNA and the parent company suffered investment losses as a result.
At CNA, after-tax net investment income declined $186 million from last year, with common stocks and limited partnership investments accounting for almost 95% of that amount. Common stocks and LPs earned $96 million pretax in Q1 2019, but lost $125 million in this year's first quarter. Additionally, CNA swung from net investment gains of $24 million, after-tax, last year to losses of $169 million this year. This year's losses were mainly attributable to the decline in market value of nonredeemable preferred stock, as well as impairment losses on corporate bonds.
The parent company's investment portfolio generated net after-tax loss of $130 million in the quarter versus income of $67 million last year, driven by declines in public equities. In total, investment activities at CNA and the parent company were responsible for $536 million of the year-over-year decline in our first quarter net income. I would hasten to point out that some of these losses were recouped in April as financial markets became more favorable.
Diamond's financial outlook deteriorated as the quarter progressed. Ultimately causing Diamond to impair 4 of its drilling rigs and take a $774 million pretax impairment charge. The steep and rapid decline in oil prices during the quarter especially since early March, has pushed Diamond's customers to slash their capital budgets, including their offshore drilling programs. This chain of events caused Diamond management to take a more pessimistic view of the prospects for these 4 rigs. Diamond's impairment charge reduced our first quarter net income by $408 million. There were no rig impairments during last year's first quarter.
Loews Hotels business was strong during January and February and into the first week of March, only to decline precipitously thereafter. So precipitously, in fact, that most of their properties temporarily suspended operations between March 19 and the end of the quarter. By way of example, the Universal Orlando Theme park closed on March 15, and our hotels on that campus suspended operations on March 20. The Loews Miami Beach hotel suspended operations on March 23, pursuant to a requirement to close issued by the county and city.
After outperforming its plan during the first 2 months of the quarter, Loews Hotels posted a quarterly net loss of $25 million, as compared to net income of $13 million last year, for a negative swing of $38 million. The hotel company's adjusted EBITDA, which is defined in our earnings supplement, decreased $44 million year-over-year to $17 million.
Stepping back, these 3 items, investment results at CNA in the parent company, rig impairments of Diamond and Loews Hotels, comprised 96% of the sizable year-over-year decline in our first quarter net income.
Turning to Diamond's Chapter 11 filing. Diamond and certain of its subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the U.S. bankruptcy code on April 26. Loews has determined that as of that date, we no longer control Diamond and thus, we will no longer consolidate Diamond for GAAP purposes. Going forward, we will account for Diamond on the cost method and hold our stake in Diamond at fair value. Our Diamond stake will be included in parent company cash and investments just as we do with all our non-control equity holdings.
Our second quarter results will include a significant loss related to Diamond. Let me briefly explain the main moving pieces in the second quarter. We will consolidate our share of Diamond's losses through the bankruptcy filing date. We will then deconsolidate Diamond effective april 26. At which time, we will record a loss equal to the difference between our then carrying value of Diamond, and the fair value of our interest in Diamond immediately following the bankruptcy filing. Our GAAP carrying value of Diamond at quarter end was approximately $1 billion. The fair value of our stake immediately after the filing was about $15 million. If the fair value remains the same through June 30, our net loss in Q2, attributable to Diamond, will be around $1 billion. Importantly, this will be a noncash loss.
Jim previously highlighted several bright spots in the quarter. Let me reiterate just a few. P&C underwriting results at CNA continued their positive momentum. Rates increased an average of 8% across the book. The underlying combined ratio was 93.9%, which was better than full year 2019, and new business was robust.
At Boardwalk, natural gas throughput and liquid volumes increased more than 10% from the first quarter of 2019. While revenues were down slightly due largely to expiring contracts being recontracted at lower rates, the company has essentially completed the process of recontracting its pipeline projects placed in service 10 to 12 years ago. Boardwalk's EBITDA and income were slightly ahead of management's expectations and its debt metrics improved during the quarter.
And Altium experienced strong growth in EBITDA as it benefited from its recent acquisitions, namely its pharmaceutical packaging business as well as increased demand for such core products as water, milk, household products and specialty chemicals. Volume was robust at Altium, rising about 8% in the quarter over the prior year period.
Before I conclude my remarks, I wanted to add briefly to Jim's comments about the COVID-19 pandemic. All our subsidiaries have been and will continue to be affected by COVID-19 and the related economic impacts. We are focused on ensuring that our subsidiaries implement effective policies and procedures to protect the safety and health of their employees.
Loews' long-term success Russ on the success of our subsidiaries. So the well-being of their employees is our foremost concern. We are also focused on ensuring that our subsidiaries identify and manage the risks and opportunities caused by this terrible pandemic. On its call today, CNA discussed many risks, including risks to the investment portfolio and underwriting risks, including pressure on premiums, and COVID related losses. Of course, CNA is also looking for opportunities to better service clients to its clients in this changed world.
As Jim mentioned, Boardwalk's business has thus far been relatively unaffected by the pandemic. Yet management is actively monitoring such risks as the credit quality of its customers as the declines in crude oil and natural gas prices could cause the financial condition of 1 or more of its producer customers to deteriorate.
Loews Hotels took dramatic action to temporarily suspend operations at most of its properties in response to the pandemic. Going forward, the critical decisions for Loews Hotels will be when to reopen those properties and how to refine its operations to ensure the continued health and safety of its employees and guests while meeting guests' expectations. Decisions to reopen properties will be made case by case, considering such factors as governmental public health restrictions and when management believes enough demand exists to resume operations rather than remain suspended.
Even though Loews Hotels has aggressively reduced its cost structure, the huge revenue decline has caused the company to begin generating negative cash flow. As such, we will invest cash in Loews Hotels this year, although the exact amount is uncertain, given the unknowns around property reopening and ramp up schedules.
What we do know is this, during each month, operations are almost completely suspended, as they are now. Management forecasts that the hotel company will generate negative cash flow of about $25 million. Once properties begin reopening, however, that monthly amount should decline as management intends to reopen properties only when doing so improves cash flow. So while the COVID related negative cash flow situation at Loews Hotels is unfortunate, it is entirely manageable given our parent company liquidity.
Altium has on that, benefited from increased demand for certain of its products as the pandemic reached North America. The company is focused on serving its customers with packaging solutions, so its customers can meet today's demand, while also being prepared for an uncertain future.
Finally, a few words about the state of the parent company. As always, and as Jim mentioned, we are focused on maintaining a strong and highly liquid balance sheet. At quarter end, the parent company portfolio of cash and investments totaled $3.1 billion, with about 80% in cash and equivalents, and the remainder mainly in marketable equity securities and a small portfolio of limited partnership investments.
We received $575 million in dividends from CNA during the first quarter, which includes the $0.37 regular quarterly dividend and the $2 special dividend. As a reminder, Boardwalk has adopted an annual dividend policy. We repurchased 9.7 million shares of our common stock during the first quarter for a total of $445 million. We repurchased no shares following quarter end. As Jim mentioned, we are prioritizing liquidity during these uncertain times.

Before we discuss how Loews is addressing the many challenges presented by the coronavirus, I want to take a moment to acknowledge everyone on the front lines of the fight against this pandemic. They are true heroes. I speak for all of us at Loews' Corporation when I thank them for their bravery, for their selflessness and for everything they are doing to save lives. To express our thank a bit more concretely, I'm proud to announce that Loews has donated $1 million that has been allocated between several different funds that provide direct support to these frontline health care heroes. I'm glad we're able to help these individuals who are risking their own lives to help others. 
It's astonishing how quickly the coronavirus has altered our lives. Loews' 2019 letter to shareholders is dated February 11 of this year. In it, we described the dramatic changes brought about over the last decade by disruptive technologies, shifting trade relations and an array of market and geopolitical forces. Little did I know when we completed our letter that the most dramatic change was directly ahead. What started out as a promising year has quickly and dramatically morphed into a global economic free fall. 
Like so many other companies, Loews and its subsidiaries started operating remotely overnight as travel restrictions and shelter-in-place orders were issued by governments around the world.  Since Loews and our subsidiaries have already put into place the enhanced IT infrastructure required for a quick and efficient transition to remote operations, our company's move to working from home went even more smoothly than I would have expected. Our employees rose to the challenge with resilience and focus. I want to thank them all for their dedication, which has enabled Loews' to move forward. 
So back to our operations. The coronavirus has impacted each of Loews' businesses in different ways. Some of our subsidiaries have been hard hit, and others have not. Specifically, Diamond Offshore and Loews Hotels have felt the most pain. Let me lead off with Diamond Offshore and the sequence of events that resulted in the company's Chapter 11 announcement on April 26. 
It's no secret that the offshore drilling industry has been experiencing a protracted downturn since 2014. It's been a long, hard road for the offshore drillers, plagued by an oversupply of rigs, coupled with persistently low oil prices. Earlier this year, however, we thought we saw the funds start to break through the clouds. At the beginning of January, oil was priced at $60 a barrel and global oil demand was expected to grow. Unfortunately, that sunny moment was short-lived. Over the first quarter, Saudi Arabia and Russia failed to reach a production agreement, and global demand experienced a sudden and cataclysmic decline due to the spread of COVID-19. These factors caused oil prices to drop to about $20 per barrel. That's a 2/3 decline in price in a 3-month period. In response, oil companies significantly reduced their capital budgets. Travel bans further complicated offshore drillers' ability to staff their rigs, and E&P companies used every opportunity they could to cancel or renegotiate contracts. Talk about impeccably bad timing. 
Keep in mind that even before this unfortunate confluence of events, Loews' exposure to Diamond was limited to our equity stake, which by mid-March, had a market value of between $100 million and $200 million. 
Later in this call, our CFO, David Edelson, will walk you through the GAAP impact to Loews of the Diamond Chapter 11 filing. But it's important to remember that while the GAAP deconsolidation loss is significant, it's a noncash loss. Loews' balance sheet remains strong and ending the quarter with $3.1 billion in cash and investments. 
While we are incredibly disappointed about the sequence of world events that led Diamond to make its April 26 announcement. I am very proud of the work that Diamond offshore has done over the years. Diamond has been a leader in the offshore drilling industry. The company's CEO, Marc Edwards, has been outstanding, and his team has worked hard in a very tough environment. Diamond is comprised of talented and resilient individuals facing extraordinary circumstances. We hope for a brighter future for the company in the years to come. 
Moving on to the rest of the Loews portfolio, I'd like to do a quick review of our businesses and their operations today, how they are faring and functioning in this ever changing new normal world. As you know, for the last couple of years, it has been our practice to take questions from shareholders. Since the questions we have received over the last month have been very consistent, I'm going to address them as part of my prepared remarks and in the context of this review. 
First up is CNA. Operationally, CNA's performance has been quite strong. The company's underlying combined ratio for the quarter was slightly better than in the first quarter of 2019, driven primarily by a reduction in the expense ratio. CNA also had solid rate increases of 8% as the hard market continued. All in all, CNA has the balance sheet, the business mix, management team and infrastructure to manage adeptly through this crisis. 
In terms of the pandemic's impact on CNA's future earnings, it's too early to make concrete statements. But we imagine that the P&C industry will face some headwinds. These will include low interest rates and lower premium levels as a result of the decline in GDP. CNA is monitoring the situation closely as it unfolds, and we have a lot of confidence in the expertise and judgment of CNA's CEO, Dino Robusto, and his senior management team. 
Our shareholders' questions for CNA focused on 2 topics: business interruption insurance and the effects of the turbulent markets on CNA's investment portfolio. Let me address each 1 of these. On their call earlier this morning, Dino made some very clear statements regarding business interruption insurance, which I will reiterate here. Dino said, and I quote, ""CNA's property policies require direct physical damage to the property from a covered peril for coverage to attach. Additionally, the property policies, whether issued in the United States or internationally, have exclusion borrowing coverage for viruses. There are very few policies where coverage may exist on small participations in our Loews -- Lloyd's operations, but the total limits exposed are de minimis. So with respect to property business interruption insurance, CNA's policy line, which does not cover COVID-19 in virtually all cases, and the company never collected premiums for it."" 
In terms of CNA's investment portfolio, in the first quarter, CNA's unrealized gain position declined from $4 billion at the end of 2019 to $2 billion at the end of the first quarter. To put this in context, CNA's unrealized gain position has typically varied between $2 billion and $4 billion since 2011, with $4 billion being the high watermark. Since the end of this year's first quarter, the unrealized gain in CNA's portfolio has rebounded off its lows and is now about $3 billion. Interest rates across asset classes other than treasuries went up at the end of the first quarter due to spread widening that provided CNA with a rare opportunity to add high-quality assets at attractive yields. This opportunity has since diminished somewhat as the fixed income markets have come roaring back. 
Over the last several years, CNA has been reducing its exposure to risk assets. Including equities, hedge funds and below investment-grade securities to the lowest level in over a decade. 
Next up is Boardwalk Pipelines. The company is operationally sound and benefiting from growth projects coming online. While revenue declined slightly in the first quarter, the decline was due to the now completed recontracting of Boardwalk's expansion projects placed in service in the 2008 to 2010 time frame. Shareholders have asked us about the effect of lower oil prices on Boardwalk. Additionally, we've gotten questions about the financial stability of Boardwalk's customers. Let me address both of these queries. 
Boardwalk's business has not been significantly impacted by the drop in oil prices. In the first quarter of 2020, Boardwalk's natural gas throughput and liquids volume increased slightly from the comparable period last year. Since the crisis hit in mid-March, Boardwalk has maintained uninterrupted service to its customers while also taking measures to ensure the safety of its employees and to maintain efficient operations. 
At the end of the first quarter, Boardwalk had a backlog of well over $9 billion in contracted revenues with about $370 million of new contracts added in the first quarter. More than 70% of Boardwalk's revenue backlog is derived from investment-grade companies. Boardwalk has letters of credit from some of its customers that are not investment-grade or not rated, which provide an additional measure of security. 
To reiterate, so far, Boardwalk's operations and financial performance have not been materially impacted by the coronavirus or the drop in oil prices. Boardwalk anticipates another solid year of financial performance. Almost 90% of Boardwalk's revenues are backed by fixed fee take-or-pay agreements. Revenue in 2020 is expected to be about $60 million lower than 2019, due primarily to the expiration of the legacy contracts.  At the end of 2020, Boardwalk should have a debt-to-EBITDA ratio below 5x leverage. With industry veteran, Stan Horton, at the helm leading a seasoned team of senior managers, the company expects to finance its capital needs this year, primarily, by using internally-generated cash flow.
Let's move on to Altium, our plastic packaging manufacturer. Altium is actually benefiting from the ongoing surge in their consumer retail segment, primarily due to increased purchases of beverage and cleaning products. Under the top-notch leadership of the company's CEO, Sean Fallman, Altium has taken a number of precautions to ensure the safety of its employees and its manufacturing plants. These precautions include making sure employees comply with social distancing protocols, installing sanitizing stations, distributing masks and gloves, taking temperatures pre-shift and increasing employee sick days. These new measures have helped Altium's manufacturing plants operate smoothly, even with the increase in volume. We expect Altium's EBITDA to be up nicely this year, with a good portion coming from completed acquisitions as well as from organic growth.
Finally, let me comment on Loews Hotels. We had great hotel -- we had great expectations for our hotel business in 2020. But today's reality couldn't be further from what we had envisioned. Travel bans, shelter-in-place orders and social distancing protocols have had a profound effect on Loews Hotels as well as on all of its competitors. The company went from being in growth mode to being forced to do everything it could to contain costs.
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting government mandates to halt the spread of the virus, most of Loews Hotels -- most of Loews' hotels have temporarily suspended operations. Only 4 hotels remain operational, and those have very limited occupancy. Unfortunately, the catastrophic loss of business made it necessary to [ further ] nearly 90% of Loews Hotels' employees. This was a painful decision made in order to ensure that the company could continue to operate over the long term.
Having taken this tough step, Loews Hotels then followed up with significant assistance for its furloughed team members. The company has set up a multimillion-dollar relief fund for affected employees and has also continued to cover medical insurance costs for up to 3 months for employees enrolled in company benefits. Additionally, in solidarity with all Loews Hotels team members who are being impacted financially by the crisis, the members of the office of the President; me; Andrew Tisch; and Loews Hotel CEO, John Kish, reduced our salaries by 50% as of April 1 and reduced our bonuses by 50% for the entire year.
At this point in time, it's difficult to predict when Loews Hotels will resume normal operations. We expect that circumstances will vary by hotel property, with occupancy at hotels increasing gradually as the industry recovers from the effects of the pandemic.
Before turning the call over to David, I want to comment on the parent company and our current view of the world. We have always said that we like to sleep at night, and that is still true today. In our current circumstances as we experience so much uncertainty, we plan to maintain a substantial cash position as our rainy day fund. With over $3 billion in cash and investments and no significant calls on those resources, Loews remains strong. We will reevaluate our capital allocation strategies once we have more clarity as to the path forward for our company, our subsidiaries and our country.
And now I'd like to hand the call over to our CFO, David Edelson."

For the first quarter, Loews reported a net loss of $632 million or $2.20 per share, compared to net income of $394 million or $1.27 per share in last year's first quarter. This year's first quarter loss and the",1625,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. For the first quarter, Loews reported a net loss of $632 million or $2.20 per share, compared to net income of $394 million or $1.27 per share in last year's first quarter. This year's first quarter loss and the substantial year-over-year decline had 2 main causes: investment losses at CNA and the parent company, which were caused by financial market disruptions as the COVID-19 pandemic spread; and rig impairments at Diamond Offshore. Also worth noting, as Jim did, is the dramatic falloff in results at Loews Hotels caused by the pandemic.
Let me start by providing more details about the quarter, focusing on these 3 items. I will also discuss the accounting implications of Diamond's recent Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing as well as some of the issues we are monitoring as the pandemic impacts our businesses. 
The financial markets experienced tremendous volatility in March in response to the spreading coronavirus pandemic and its economic fallout. Equity markets plummeted and credit spreads widened. Both CNA and the parent company suffered investment losses as a result.
At CNA, after-tax net investment income declined $186 million from last year, with common stocks and limited partnership investments accounting for almost 95% of that amount. Common stocks and LPs earned $96 million pretax in Q1 2019, but lost $125 million in this year's first quarter. Additionally, CNA swung from net investment gains of $24 million, after-tax last year to losses of $169 million this year. This year's losses were mainly attributable to the decline in market value of nonredeemable preferred stock, as well as impairment losses on corporate bonds.
The parent company's investment portfolio generated net after-tax loss of $130 million in the quarter versus income of $67 million last year, driven by declines in public equities. In total, investment activities at CNA and the parent company were responsible for $536 million of the year-over-year decline in our first quarter net income. I would hasten to point out that some of these losses were recouped in April as financial markets became more favorable.
Diamond's financial outlook deteriorated as the quarter progressed, ultimately causing Diamond to impair 4 of its drilling rigs and take a $774 million pretax impairment charge. The steep and rapid decline in oil prices during the quarter, especially since early March, has pushed Diamond's customers to slash their capital budgets, including their offshore drilling programs. This chain of events caused Diamond management to take a more pessimistic view of the prospects for these 4 rigs. Diamond's impairment charge reduced our first quarter net income by $408 million. There were no rig impairments during last year's first quarter.
Loews Hotels business was strong during January and February and into the first week of March, only to decline precipitously thereafter. So precipitously in fact, that most of their properties temporarily suspended operations between March 19 and the end of the quarter. By way of example, the Universal Orlando Theme park closed on March 15, and our hotels on that campus suspended operations on March 20. The Loews Miami Beach hotel suspended operations on March 23, pursuant to a requirement to close issued by the county and city.
After outperforming its plan during the first 2 months of the quarter, Loews Hotels posted a quarterly net loss of $25 million, compared to net income of $13 million last year, for a negative swing of $38 million. The hotel company's adjusted EBITDA, which is defined in our earnings supplement, decreased $44 million year-over-year to $17 million.
Stepping back, these 3 items, investment results at CNA and the parent company, rig impairments at Diamond and Loews Hotels, comprised 96% of the sizable year-over-year decline in our first quarter net income.
Turning to Diamond's Chapter 11 filing. Diamond and certain of its subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the U.S. bankruptcy code on April 26. Loews has determined that as of that date, we no longer control Diamond, and thus, we will no longer consolidate Diamond for GAAP purposes. Going forward, we will account for Diamond on the cost method and hold our stake in Diamond at fair value. Our Diamond stake will be included in parent company cash and investments just as we do with all our non-control equity holdings.
Our second quarter results will include a significant loss related to Diamond. Let me briefly explain the main moving pieces in the second quarter. We will consolidate our share of Diamond's losses through the bankruptcy filing date. We will then deconsolidate Diamond effective April 26. At which time, we will record a loss equal to the difference between our then carrying value of Diamond, and the fair value of our interest in Diamond immediately following the bankruptcy filing. Our GAAP carrying value of Diamond at quarter end was approximately $1 billion. The fair value of our stake immediately after the filing was about $15 million. If the fair value remains the same through June 30, our net loss in Q2 attributable to Diamond will be around $1 billion. Importantly, this will be a noncash loss.
Jim previously highlighted several bright spots in the quarter. Let me reiterate just a few. P&C underwriting results at CNA continued their positive momentum. Rates increased an average of 8% across the book. The underlying combined ratio was 93.9%, which was better than full year 2019, and new business was robust.
At Boardwalk, natural gas throughput and liquid volumes increased more than 10% from the first quarter of 2019. While revenues were down slightly due largely to expiring contracts being recontracted at lower rates, the company has essentially completed the process of recontracting its pipeline projects placed in service 10 to 12 years ago. Boardwalk's EBITDA and income were slightly ahead of management's expectations and its debt metrics improved during the quarter.
And Altium experienced strong growth in EBITDA as it benefited from its recent acquisitions, namely its pharmaceutical packaging business as well as increased demand for such core products as water, milk, household products and specialty chemicals. Volume was robust at Altium, rising about 8% in the quarter over the prior year period.
Before I conclude my remarks, I wanted to add briefly to Jim's comments about the COVID-19 pandemic. All our subsidiaries have been and will continue to be affected by COVID-19 and the related economic impacts. We are focused on ensuring that our subsidiaries implement effective policies and procedures to protect the safety and health of their employees.  Loews' long-term success rests on the success of our subsidiaries. So the well-being of their employees is our foremost concern. 
We are also focused on ensuring that our subsidiaries identify and manage the risks and opportunities caused by this terrible pandemic. On its call today, CNA discussed many risks, including risks to the investment portfolio and underwriting risks, including pressure on premiums and COVID-related losses. Of course, CNA is also looking for opportunities to better service clients to its clients in this changed world.
As Jim mentioned, Boardwalk's business has thus far been relatively unaffected by the pandemic. Yet management is actively monitoring such risks as the credit quality of its customers, as the declines in crude oil and natural gas prices could cause the financial condition of 1 or more of its producer customers to deteriorate.
Loews Hotels took dramatic action to temporarily suspend operations at most of its properties in response to the pandemic. Going forward, the critical decisions for Loews Hotels will be when to reopen those properties and how to refine its operations to ensure the continued health and safety of its employees and guests while meeting guests' expectations. Decisions to reopen properties will be made case by case, considering such factors as governmental public health restrictions and when management believes enough demand exists to resume operations rather than remain suspended.
Even though Loews Hotels has aggressively reduced its cost structure, the huge revenue decline has caused the company to begin generating negative cash flow. As such, we will invest cash in Loews Hotels this year, although the exact amount is uncertain, given the unknowns around property reopening and ramp up schedules.
What we do know is this, during each month, operations are almost completely suspended, as they are now. Management forecasts that the hotel company will generate negative cash flow of about $25 million. Once properties begin reopening, however, that monthly amount should decline as management intends to reopen properties only when doing so improves cash flow. So while the COVID-related negative cash flow situation at Loews Hotels is unfortunate, it is entirely manageable given our parent company liquidity.
Altium has on that, benefited from increased demand for certain of its products as the pandemic reached North America. The company is focused on serving its customers with packaging solutions so its customers can meet today's demand while also being prepared for an uncertain future.
Finally, a few words about the state of the parent company. As always, and as Jim mentioned, we are focused on maintaining a strong and highly liquid balance sheet. At quarter end, the parent company portfolio of cash and investments totaled $3.1 billion, with about 80% in cash and equivalents, and the remainder mainly in marketable equity securities and a small portfolio of limited partnership investments.
We received $575 million in dividends from CNA during the first quarter, which includes the $0.37 regular quarterly dividend and the $2 special dividend. As a reminder, Boardwalk has adopted an annual dividend policy. We repurchased 9.7 million shares of our common stock during the first quarter for a total of $445 million. We repurchased no shares following quarter end. As Jim mentioned, we are prioritizing liquidity during these uncertain times.
I will now hand the call back to Mary."

But it's important to remember that while the GAAP deconsolidation loss is significant, it's a noncash loss. Loews' balance sheet remains strong and ending the quarter with $3.1 billion in cash and investments. 
While we are incredibly disappointed about the sequence of world events that led Diamond to make its April 26 announcement. I am very proud of the work that Diamond offshore has done over the years. Diamond has been a leader in the offshore drilling industry. The company's CEO, Marc Edwards, has been outstanding, and his team has worked hard in a very tough environment. Diamond is comprised of talented and resilient individuals facing extraordinary circumstances. We hope for a brighter future for the company in the years to come. 
Moving on to the rest of the Loews portfolio, I'd like to do a quick review of our businesses and their operations today, how they are faring and functioning in this ever changing new normal world. As you know, for the last couple of years, it has been our practice to take questions from shareholders. Since the questions we have received over the last month have been very consistent, I'm going to address them as part of my prepared remarks and in the context of this review. 
First up is CNA. Operationally, CNA's performance has been quite strong. The company's underlying combined ratio for the quarter was slightly better than in the first quarter of 2019, driven primarily by a reduction in the expense ratio. CNA also had solid rate increases of 8% as the hard market continued. All in all, CNA has the balance sheet, the business mix, management team and infrastructure to manage adeptly through this crisis. 
In terms of the pandemic's impact on CNA's future earnings, it's too early to make concrete statements. But we imagine that the P&C industry will face some headwinds. These will include low interest rates and lower premium levels as a result of the decline in GDP. CNA is monitoring the situation closely as it unfolds, and we have a lot of confidence in the expertise and judgment of CNA's CEO, Dino Robusto, and his senior management team. 
Our shareholders' questions for CNA focused on 2 topics: business interruption insurance and the effects of the turbulent markets on CNA's investment portfolio. Let me address each 1 of these. On their call earlier this morning, Dino made some very clear statements regarding business interruption insurance, which I will reiterate here. Dino said, and I quote, ""CNA's property policies require direct physical damage to the property from a covered peril for coverage to attach. Additionally, the property policies, whether issued in the United States or internationally, have exclusion borrowing coverage for viruses. There are very few policies where coverage may exist on small participations in our Loews -- Lloyd's operations, but the total limits exposed are de minimis. So with respect to property business interruption insurance, CNA's policy line, which does not cover COVID-19 in virtually all cases, and the company never collected premiums for it."" 
In terms of CNA's investment portfolio, in the first quarter, CNA's unrealized gain position declined from $4 billion at the end of 2019 to $2 billion at the end of the first quarter. To put this in context, CNA's unrealized gain position has typically varied between $2 billion and $4 billion since 2011, with $4 billion being the high watermark. Since the end of this year's first quarter, the unrealized gain in CNA's portfolio has rebounded off its lows and is now about $3 billion. Interest rates across asset classes other than treasuries went up at the end of the first quarter due to spread widening that provided CNA with a rare opportunity to add high-quality assets at attractive yields. This opportunity has since diminished somewhat as the fixed income markets have come roaring back. 
Over the last several years, CNA has been reducing its exposure to risk assets. Including equities, hedge funds and below investment-grade securities to the lowest level in over a decade. 
Next up is Boardwalk Pipelines. The company is operationally sound and benefiting from growth projects coming online. While revenue declined slightly in the first quarter, the decline was due to the now completed recontracting of Boardwalk's expansion projects placed in service in the 2008 to 2010 time frame. Shareholders have asked us about the effect of lower oil prices on Boardwalk. Additionally, we've gotten questions about the financial stability of Boardwalk's customers. Let me address both of these queries. 
Boardwalk's business has not been significantly impacted by the drop in oil prices. In the first quarter of 2020, Boardwalk's natural gas throughput and liquids volume increased slightly from the comparable period last year. Since the crisis hit in mid-March, Boardwalk has maintained uninterrupted service to its customers while also taking measures to ensure the safety of its employees and to maintain efficient operations. 
At the end of the first quarter, Boardwalk had a backlog of well over $9 billion in contracted revenues with about $370 million of new contracts added in the first quarter. More than 70% of Boardwalk's revenue backlog is derived from investment-grade companies. Boardwalk has letters of credit from some of its customers that are not investment-grade or not rated, which provide an additional measure of security. 
To reiterate, so far, Boardwalk's operations and financial performance have not been materially impacted by the coronavirus or the drop in oil prices. Boardwalk anticipates another solid year of financial performance. Almost 90% of Boardwalk's revenues are backed by fixed fee take-or-pay agreements. Revenue in 2020 is expected to be about $60 million lower than 2019, due primarily to the expiration of the legacy contracts. At the end of 2020, Boardwalk should have a debt-to-EBITDA ratio below 5x leverage. With industry veteran, Stan Horton, at the helm leading a seasoned team of senior managers, the company expects to finance its capital needs this year, primarily, by using internally generated cash flow.
Let's move on to Altium, our plastic packaging manufacturer. Altium is actually benefiting from the ongoing surge in their consumer retail segment, primarily due to increased purchases of beverage and cleaning products. Under the top-notch leadership of the company's CEO, Sean Fallmann, Altium has taken a number of precautions to ensure the safety of its employees and its manufacturing plants. These precautions include making sure employees comply with social distancing protocols, installing sanitizing stations, distributing masks and gloves, taking temperatures pre-shift and increasing employee sick days. These new measures have helped Altium's manufacturing plants operate smoothly, even with the increase in volume. We expect Altium's EBITDA to be up nicely this year, with a good portion coming from completed acquisitions as well as from organic growth.
Finally, let me comment on Loews Hotels. We had great hotel -- we had great expectations for our hotel business in 2020. But today's reality couldn't be further from what we had envisioned. Travel bans, shelter-in-place orders and social distancing protocols have had a profound effect on Loews Hotels as well as on all of its competitors. The company went from being in growth mode to being forced to do everything it could to contain costs.
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting government mandates to halt the spread of the virus, most of Loews Hotels -- most of Loews' hotels have temporarily suspended operations. Only 4 hotels remain operational, and those have very limited occupancy. Unfortunately, the catastrophic loss of business made it necessary to [ further ] nearly 90% of Loews Hotels' employees. This was a painful decision made in order to ensure that the company could continue to operate over the long term.
Having taken this tough step, Loews Hotels then followed up with significant assistance for its furloughed team members. The company has set up a multimillion-dollar relief fund for affected employees and has also continued to cover medical insurance costs for up to 3 months for employees enrolled in company benefits. Additionally, in solidarity with all Loews Hotels team members who are being impacted financially by the crisis, the members of the office of the President; me; Andrew Tisch; and Loews Hotel CEO, John Kish, reduced our salaries by 50% as of April 1 and reduced our bonuses by 50% for the entire year.
At this point in time, it's difficult to predict when Loews Hotels will resume normal operations. We expect that circumstances will vary by hotel property, with occupancy at hotels increasing gradually as the industry recovers from the effects of the pandemic.
Before turning the call over to David, I want to comment on the parent company and our current view of the world. We have always said that we like to sleep at night, and that is still true today. In our current circumstances as we experience so much uncertainty, we plan to maintain a substantial cash position as our rainy day fund. With over $3 billion in cash and investments and no significant calls on those resources, Loews remains strong. We will reevaluate our capital allocation strategies once we have more clarity as to the path forward for our company, our subsidiaries and our country.
And now I'd like to hand the call over to our CFO, David Edelson."
285930,665832577,2020650,"Loews Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, May 04, 2020",2020-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Loews Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. For the first quarter, Loews reported a net loss of $632 million or $2.20 per share, compared to net income of $394 million or $1.27 per share in last year's first quarter. This year's first quarter loss and the",1624,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. For the first quarter, Loews reported a net loss of $632 million or $2.20 per share, compared to net income of $394 million or $1.27 per share in last year's first quarter. This year's first quarter loss and the substantial year-over-year decline had 2 main causes: investment losses at CNA and the parent company, which were caused by financial market disruptions as the COVID-19 pandemic spread; and rig impairments at Diamond Offshore. Also worth noting, as Jim did, is the dramatic falloff in results at Loews Hotels caused by the pandemic.
Let me start by providing more details about the quarter, focusing on these 3 items. I will also discuss the accounting implications of Diamond's recent Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing as well as some of the issues we are monitoring as the pandemic impacts our businesses. 
The financial markets experienced tremendous volatility in March in response to the spreading coronavirus pandemic and its economic fallout. Equity markets plummeted and credit spreads widened. Both CNA and the parent company suffered investment losses as a result.
At CNA, after-tax net investment income declined $186 million from last year, with common stocks and limited partnership investments accounting for almost 95% of that amount. Common stocks and LPs earned $96 million pretax in Q1 2019, but lost $125 million in this year's first quarter. Additionally, CNA swung from net investment gains of $24 million, after-tax last year to losses of $169 million this year. This year's losses were mainly attributable to the decline in market value of nonredeemable preferred stock, as well as impairment losses on corporate bonds.
The parent company's investment portfolio generated net after-tax loss of $130 million in the quarter versus income of $67 million last year, driven by declines in public equities. In total, investment activities at CNA and the parent company were responsible for $536 million of the year-over-year decline in our first quarter net income. I would hasten to point out that some of these losses were recouped in April as financial markets became more favorable.
Diamond's financial outlook deteriorated as the quarter progressed, ultimately causing Diamond to impair 4 of its drilling rigs and take a $774 million pretax impairment charge. The steep and rapid decline in oil prices during the quarter, especially since early March, has pushed Diamond's customers to slash their capital budgets, including their offshore drilling programs. This chain of events caused Diamond management to take a more pessimistic view of the prospects for these 4 rigs. Diamond's impairment charge reduced our first quarter net income by $408 million. There were no rig impairments during last year's first quarter.
Loews Hotels business was strong during January and February and into the first week of March, only to decline precipitously thereafter. So precipitously in fact, that most of their properties temporarily suspended operations between March 19 and the end of the quarter. By way of example, the Universal Orlando Theme park closed on March 15, and our hotels on that campus suspended operations on March 20. The Loews Miami Beach hotel suspended operations on March 23, pursuant to a requirement to close issued by the county and city.
After outperforming its plan during the first 2 months of the quarter, Loews Hotels posted a quarterly net loss of $25 million, compared to net income of $13 million last year, for a negative swing of $38 million. The hotel company's adjusted EBITDA, which is defined in our earnings supplement, decreased $44 million year-over-year to $17 million.
Stepping back, these 3 items, investment results at CNA and the parent company, rig impairments at Diamond and Loews Hotels, comprised 96% of the sizable year-over-year decline in our first quarter net income.
Turning to Diamond's Chapter 11 filing. Diamond and certain of its subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the U.S. bankruptcy code on April 26. Loews has determined that as of that date, we no longer control Diamond, and thus, we will no longer consolidate Diamond for GAAP purposes. Going forward, we will account for Diamond on the cost method and hold our stake in Diamond at fair value. Our Diamond stake will be included in parent company cash and investments just as we do with all our non-control equity holdings.
Our second quarter results will include a significant loss related to Diamond. Let me briefly explain the main moving pieces in the second quarter. We will consolidate our share of Diamond's losses through the bankruptcy filing date. We will then deconsolidate Diamond effective April 26. At which time, we will record a loss equal to the difference between our then carrying value of Diamond, and the fair value of our interest in Diamond immediately following the bankruptcy filing. Our GAAP carrying value of Diamond at quarter end was approximately $1 billion. The fair value of our stake immediately after the filing was about $15 million. If the fair value remains the same through June 30, our net loss in Q2 attributable to Diamond will be around $1 billion. Importantly, this will be a noncash loss.
Jim previously highlighted several bright spots in the quarter. Let me reiterate just a few. P&C underwriting results at CNA continued their positive momentum. Rates increased an average of 8% across the book. The underlying combined ratio was 93.9%, which was better than full year 2019, and new business was robust.
At Boardwalk, natural gas throughput and liquid volumes increased more than 10% from the first quarter of 2019. While revenues were down slightly due largely to expiring contracts being recontracted at lower rates, the company has essentially completed the process of recontracting its pipeline projects placed in service 10 to 12 years ago. Boardwalk's EBITDA and income were slightly ahead of management's expectations and its debt metrics improved during the quarter.
And Altium experienced strong growth in EBITDA as it benefited from its recent acquisitions, namely its pharmaceutical packaging business as well as increased demand for such core products as water, milk, household products and specialty chemicals. Volume was robust at Altium, rising about 8% in the quarter over the prior year period.
Before I conclude my remarks, I wanted to add briefly to Jim's comments about the COVID-19 pandemic. All our subsidiaries have been and will continue to be affected by COVID-19 and the related economic impacts. We are focused on ensuring that our subsidiaries implement effective policies and procedures to protect the safety and health of their employees. Loews' long-term success rests on the success of our subsidiaries. So the well-being of their employees is our foremost concern. 
We are also focused on ensuring that our subsidiaries identify and manage the risks and opportunities caused by this terrible pandemic. On its call today, CNA discussed many risks, including risks to the investment portfolio and underwriting risks, including pressure on premiums and COVID-related losses. Of course, CNA is also looking for opportunities to better service clients to its clients in this changed world.
As Jim mentioned, Boardwalk's business has thus far been relatively unaffected by the pandemic. Yet management is actively monitoring such risks as the credit quality of its customers, as the declines in crude oil and natural gas prices could cause the financial condition of 1 or more of its producer customers to deteriorate.
Loews Hotels took dramatic action to temporarily suspend operations at most of its properties in response to the pandemic. Going forward, the critical decisions for Loews Hotels will be when to reopen those properties and how to refine its operations to ensure the continued health and safety of its employees and guests while meeting guests' expectations. Decisions to reopen properties will be made case by case, considering such factors as governmental public health restrictions and when management believes enough demand exists to resume operations rather than remain suspended.
Even though Loews Hotels has aggressively reduced its cost structure, the huge revenue decline has caused the company to begin generating negative cash flow. As such, we will invest cash in Loews Hotels this year, although the exact amount is uncertain, given the unknowns around property reopening and ramp-up schedules.
What we do know is this, during each month, operations are almost completely suspended, as they are now. Management forecasts that the hotel company will generate negative cash flow of about $25 million. Once properties begin reopening, however, that monthly amount should decline as management intends to reopen properties only when doing so improves cash flow. So while the COVID-related negative cash flow situation at Loews Hotels is unfortunate, it is entirely manageable given our parent company liquidity.
Altium has on that, benefited from increased demand for certain of its products as the pandemic reached North America. The company is focused on serving its customers with packaging solutions so its customers can meet today's demand while also being prepared for an uncertain future.
Finally, a few words about the state of the parent company. As always, and as Jim mentioned, we are focused on maintaining a strong and highly liquid balance sheet. At quarter end, the parent company portfolio of cash and investments totaled $3.1 billion, with about 80% in cash and equivalents, and the remainder mainly in marketable equity securities and a small portfolio of limited partnership investments.
We received $575 million in dividends from CNA during the first quarter, which includes the $0.37 regular quarterly dividend and the $2 special dividend. As a reminder, Boardwalk has adopted an annual dividend policy. We repurchased 9.7 million shares of our common stock during the first quarter for a total of $445 million. We repurchased no shares following quarter end. As Jim mentioned, we are prioritizing liquidity during these uncertain times.
I will now hand the call back to Mary."

Before we discuss how Loews is addressing the many challenges presented by the coronavirus, I want to take a moment to acknowledge everyone on the front lines of the fight against this pandemic. They are true heroes. I speak for all of us at Loews' Corporation when I thank them for their bravery, for their selflessness and for everything they are doing to save lives. To express our thanks a bit more concretely, I'm proud to announce that Loews has donated $1 million that has been allocated between several different funds that provide direct support to these frontline health care heroes. I'm glad we're able to help these individuals who are risking their own lives to help others. 
It's astonishing how quickly the coronavirus has altered our lives. Loews' 2019 letter to shareholders is dated February 11 of this year. In it, we described the dramatic changes brought about over the last decade by disruptive technologies, shifting trade relations and an array of market and geopolitical forces. Little did I know when we completed our letter that the most dramatic change was directly ahead. What started out as a promising year has quickly and dramatically morphed into a global economic free fall. 
Like so many other companies, Loews and its subsidiaries started operating remotely overnight as travel restrictions and shelter-in-place orders were issued by governments around the world. Since Loews and our subsidiaries have already put into place the enhanced IT infrastructure required for a quick and efficient transition to remote operations, our company's move to working from home went even more smoothly than I would have expected. Our employees rose to the challenge with resilience and focus. I want to thank them all for their dedication, which has enabled Loews' to move forward. 
So back to our operations. The coronavirus has impacted each of Loews' businesses in different ways. Some of our subsidiaries have been hard hit, and others have not. Specifically, Diamond Offshore and Loews Hotels have felt the most pain. Let me lead off with Diamond Offshore and the sequence of events that resulted in the company's Chapter 11 announcement on April 26. 
It's no secret that the offshore drilling industry has been experiencing a protracted downturn since 2014. It's been a long, hard road for the offshore drillers, plagued by an oversupply of rigs, coupled with persistently low oil prices. Earlier this year, however, we thought we saw the funds start to break through the clouds. At the beginning of January, oil was priced at $60 a barrel and global oil demand was expected to grow. Unfortunately, that sunny moment was short-lived. Over the first quarter, Saudi Arabia and Russia failed to reach a production agreement, and global demand experienced a sudden and cataclysmic decline due to the spread of COVID-19. These factors caused oil prices to drop to about $20 per barrel. That's a 2/3 decline in price in a 3-month period. In response, oil companies significantly reduced their capital budgets. Travel bans further complicated offshore drillers' ability to staff their rigs, and E&P companies used every opportunity they could to cancel or renegotiate contracts. Talk about impeccably bad timing. 
Keep in mind that even before this unfortunate confluence of events, Loews' exposure to Diamond was limited to our equity stake, which by mid-March, had a market value of between $100 million and $200 million. 
Later in this call, our CFO, David Edelson, will walk you through the GAAP impact to Loews of the Diamond Chapter 11 filing. But it's important to remember that while the GAAP deconsolidation loss is significant, it's a noncash loss. Loews' balance sheet remains strong and ending the quarter with $3.1 billion in cash and investments. 
While we are incredibly disappointed about the sequence of world events that led Diamond to make its April 26 announcement. I am very proud of the work that Diamond offshore has done over the years. Diamond has been a leader in the offshore drilling industry. The company's CEO, Marc Edwards, has been outstanding, and his team has worked hard in a very tough environment.

Only 4 hotels remain operational, and those have very limited occupancy. Unfortunately, the catastrophic loss of business made it necessary to [ further ] nearly 90% of Loews Hotels' employees. This was a painful decision made in order to ensure that the company could continue to operate over the long term.
Having taken this tough step, Loews Hotels then followed up with significant assistance for its furloughed team members. The company has set up a multimillion-dollar relief fund for affected employees and has also continued to cover medical insurance costs for up to 3 months for employees enrolled in company benefits. Additionally, in solidarity with all Loews Hotels team members who are being impacted financially by the crisis, the members of the office of the President; me; Andrew Tisch; and Loews Hotel CEO, John Kish, reduced our salaries by 50% as of April 1 and reduced our bonuses by 50% for the entire year.
At this point in time, it's difficult to predict when Loews Hotels will resume normal operations. We expect that circumstances will vary by hotel property, with occupancy at hotels increasing gradually as the industry recovers from the effects of the pandemic.
Before turning the call over to David, I want to comment on the parent company and our current view of the world. We have always said that we like to sleep at night, and that is still true today. In our current circumstances as we experience so much uncertainty, we plan to maintain a substantial cash position as our rainy day fund. With over $3 billion in cash and investments and no significant calls on those resources, Loews remains strong. We will reevaluate our capital allocation strategies once we have more clarity as to the path forward for our company, our subsidiaries and our country.
And now I'd like to hand the call over to our CFO, David Edelson."

This year's first quarter loss and the",1624,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. For the first quarter, Loews reported a net loss of $632 million or $2.20 per share, compared to net income of $394 million or $1.27 per share in last year's first quarter. This year's first quarter loss and the substantial year-over-year decline had 2 main causes: investment losses at CNA and the parent company, which were caused by financial market disruptions as the COVID-19 pandemic spread; and rig impairments at Diamond Offshore. Also worth noting, as Jim did, is the dramatic falloff in results at Loews Hotels caused by the pandemic.
Let me start by providing more details about the quarter, focusing on these 3 items. I will also discuss the accounting implications of Diamond's recent Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing as well as some of the issues we are monitoring as the pandemic impacts our businesses. 
The financial markets experienced tremendous volatility in March in response to the spreading coronavirus pandemic and its economic fallout. Equity markets plummeted and credit spreads widened. Both CNA and the parent company suffered investment losses as a result.
At CNA, after-tax net investment income declined $186 million from last year, with common stocks and limited partnership investments accounting for almost 95% of that amount. Common stocks and LPs earned $96 million pretax in Q1 2019, but lost $125 million in this year's first quarter. Additionally, CNA swung from net investment gains of $24 million, after-tax last year to losses of $169 million this year. This year's losses were mainly attributable to the decline in market value of nonredeemable preferred stock, as well as impairment losses on corporate bonds.
The parent company's investment portfolio generated net after-tax loss of $130 million in the quarter versus income of $67 million last year, driven by declines in public equities. In total, investment activities at CNA and the parent company were responsible for $536 million of the year-over-year decline in our first quarter net income. I would hasten to point out that some of these losses were recouped in April as financial markets became more favorable.
Diamond's financial outlook deteriorated as the quarter progressed, ultimately causing Diamond to impair 4 of its drilling rigs and take a $774 million pretax impairment charge. The steep and rapid decline in oil prices during the quarter, especially since early March, has pushed Diamond's customers to slash their capital budgets, including their offshore drilling programs. This chain of events caused Diamond management to take a more pessimistic view of the prospects for these 4 rigs. Diamond's impairment charge reduced our first quarter net income by $408 million. There were no rig impairments during last year's first quarter.
Loews Hotels business was strong during January and February and into the first week of March, only to decline precipitously thereafter. So precipitously in fact, that most of their properties temporarily suspended operations between March 19 and the end of the quarter. By way of example, the Universal Orlando Theme park closed on March 15, and our hotels on that campus suspended operations on March 20. The Loews Miami Beach hotel suspended operations on March 23, pursuant to a requirement to close issued by the county and city.
After outperforming its plan during the first 2 months of the quarter, Loews Hotels posted a quarterly net loss of $25 million, compared to net income of $13 million last year, for a negative swing of $38 million. The hotel company's adjusted EBITDA, which is defined in our earnings supplement, decreased $44 million year-over-year to $17 million.
Stepping back, these 3 items, investment results at CNA and the parent company, rig impairments at Diamond and Loews Hotels, comprised 96% of the sizable year-over-year decline in our first quarter net income.
Turning to Diamond's Chapter 11 filing. Diamond and certain of its subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the U.S. bankruptcy code on April 26. Loews has determined that as of that date, we no longer control Diamond, and thus, we will no longer consolidate Diamond for GAAP purposes. Going forward, we will account for Diamond on the cost method and hold our stake in Diamond at fair value. Our Diamond stake will be included in parent company cash and investments just as we do with all our non-control equity holdings.
Our second quarter results will include a significant loss related to Diamond. Let me briefly explain the main moving pieces in the second quarter. We will consolidate our share of Diamond's losses through the bankruptcy filing date. We will then deconsolidate Diamond effective April 26. At which time, we will record a loss equal to the difference between our then carrying value of Diamond, and the fair value of our interest in Diamond immediately following the bankruptcy filing. Our GAAP carrying value of Diamond at quarter end was approximately $1 billion. The fair value of our stake immediately after the filing was about $15 million. If the fair value remains the same through June 30, our net loss in Q2 attributable to Diamond will be around $1 billion. Importantly, this will be a noncash loss.
Jim previously highlighted several bright spots in the quarter. Let me reiterate just a few. P&C underwriting results at CNA continued their positive momentum. Rates increased an average of 8% across the book. The underlying combined ratio was 93.9%, which was better than full year 2019, and new business was robust.
At Boardwalk, natural gas throughput and liquid volumes increased more than 10% from the first quarter of 2019. While revenues were down slightly due largely to expiring contracts being recontracted at lower rates, the company has essentially completed the process of recontracting its pipeline projects placed in service 10 to 12 years ago. Boardwalk's EBITDA and income were slightly ahead of management's expectations and its debt metrics improved during the quarter.
And Altium experienced strong growth in EBITDA as it benefited from its recent acquisitions, namely its pharmaceutical packaging business as well as increased demand for such core products as water, milk, household products and specialty chemicals. Volume was robust at Altium, rising about 8% in the quarter over the prior year period.
Before I conclude my remarks, I wanted to add briefly to Jim's comments about the COVID-19 pandemic. All our subsidiaries have been and will continue to be affected by COVID-19 and the related economic impacts. We are focused on ensuring that our subsidiaries implement effective policies and procedures to protect the safety and health of their employees. Loews' long-term success rests on the success of our subsidiaries. So the well-being of their employees is our foremost concern. 
We are also focused on ensuring that our subsidiaries identify and manage the risks and opportunities caused by this terrible pandemic. On its call today, CNA discussed many risks, including risks to the investment portfolio and underwriting risks, including pressure on premiums and COVID-related losses. Of course, CNA is also looking for opportunities to better service clients to its clients in this changed world.
As Jim mentioned, Boardwalk's business has thus far been relatively unaffected by the pandemic. Yet management is actively monitoring such risks as the credit quality of its customers, as the declines in crude oil and natural gas prices could cause the financial condition of 1 or more of its producer customers to deteriorate.
Loews Hotels took dramatic action to temporarily suspend operations at most of its properties in response to the pandemic. Going forward, the critical decisions for Loews Hotels will be when to reopen those properties and how to refine its operations to ensure the continued health and safety of its employees and guests while meeting guests' expectations. Decisions to reopen properties will be made case by case, considering such factors as governmental public health restrictions and when management believes enough demand exists to resume operations rather than remain suspended.
Even though Loews Hotels has aggressively reduced its cost structure, the huge revenue decline has caused the company to begin generating negative cash flow. As such, we will invest cash in Loews Hotels this year, although the exact amount is uncertain, given the unknowns around property reopening and ramp-up schedules.
What we do know is this, during each month, operations are almost completely suspended, as they are now. Management forecasts that the hotel company will generate negative cash flow of about $25 million. Once properties begin reopening, however, that monthly amount should decline as management intends to reopen properties only when doing so improves cash flow. So while the COVID-related negative cash flow situation at Loews Hotels is unfortunate, it is entirely manageable given our parent company liquidity.
Altium has on that, benefited from increased demand for certain of its products as the pandemic reached North America. The company is focused on serving its customers with packaging solutions so its customers can meet today's demand while also being prepared for an uncertain future.
Finally, a few words about the state of the parent company. As always, and as Jim mentioned, we are focused on maintaining a strong and highly liquid balance sheet. At quarter end, the parent company portfolio of cash and investments totaled $3.1 billion, with about 80% in cash and equivalents, and the remainder mainly in marketable equity securities and a small portfolio of limited partnership investments.
We received $575 million in dividends from CNA during the first quarter, which includes the $0.37 regular quarterly dividend and the $2 special dividend. As a reminder, Boardwalk has adopted an annual dividend policy. We repurchased 9.7 million shares of our common stock during the first quarter for a total of $445 million. We repurchased no shares following quarter end. As Jim mentioned, we are prioritizing liquidity during these uncertain times.
I will now hand the call back to Mary."

Rather than getting into specifics about the quarter, I want to use this call today as an opportunity to get something off my chest. I am beyond frustrated with where the -- where the stock market has been pricing Loews and CNA, and I can't believe how undervalued the stocks are. Loews' market capitalization as of this morning is about $9.8 billion, and our stake in CNA plus net cash alone account for more than $9.4 billion of that number. That leaves the market's valuation of our non publicly traded subsidiaries, Boardwalk, Loews hotels and Altium at less than $500 million, which, to my mind, is patently absurd. I also think CNA's value is patently observed, but more on that later. Let's look at each of Loews' privately held subsidiaries to see if I can demonstrate to you that collectively, they are worth dramatically more than $500 million. First, let's look at Boardwalk pipeline. In July of 2018, Loews purchased the outstanding common units of Boardwalk that we didn't already own for $1.5 billion, putting the total equity value of Loews' ownership stake in Boardwalk at $3 billion. Keep in mind that Loews is in litigation over Boardwalk with a trial date set for January of 2021. So we can't get into too much detail. However, since the time of our purchase of Boardwalk's remaining public float, nothing has occurred with the performance of the company that would lead us to reconsider that purchase. 
Boardwalk has successfully made it through the challenge of recontracting, and since going private has reinvested a majority of its distributable cash flow in order to reduce the risk and volatility of future earnings. And since July of 2018, EBITDA for the business is essentially flat despite the significant recontracting headwinds the company has experienced. While future growth projects have become more difficult to complete in the current regulatory environment, boardwalk benefits from its base of 14,000 miles of pipe in the ground. Boardwalk also benefits from stable fixed fee contracts. The company has over $9 billion of contractual backlog or 7x Boardwalk's annual revenues. 
Essentially, I'm comfortable with the guidance I gave last quarter for Boardwalk. The company is currently tracking slightly better than forecast for the first half of the year. Its flow volumes are up. Up, the pipes are doing well and storage revenues are strong. At the end of 2020, Boardwalk should continue to have a debt-to-EBITDA ratio below 5x. For all the reasons I've just outlined, I'm very disappointed by the market's implied value of Boardwalk. Clearly, the company is worth much more than the market gives us credit for. 
Next, let's take a look at Loews Hotels. At the risk of stating the obvious, this year will be a washout for the entire hotel and travel industry, and Loews hotels is no exception to the rule. During my first quarter remarks, I made note of the fact that there were only 4 Loews hotels open at the time. Today, many more of our hotels are operational, but occupancy rates remain abysmally low, especially for our properties located in city centers. Our resort hotels are doing a bit better but since many of them are located in COVID hotspots, there's plenty of room for improvement. I believe that over time, whether through a vaccine or other mitigants, the travel industry will recover, and Loews hotels will once again be a growth engine for Loews. 
One last thought on hotels. As I mentioned, the market currently values our privately held subsidiaries at about $500 million. We make available on the parent company website, Loews Hotels' adjusted EBITDA and adjusted mortgage debt. When looking at these numbers, however, keep in mind that the hotel company has invested equity in projects that have recently opened or have yet to open. And the true earning power of these hotels has never been reflected in Loews Hotels historical EBITDA. It's clear that even if you did a back of the envelope valuation for Loews hotels, you would see that in any sort of hotel industry recovery, the equity we have in Loews Hotels would be measured in the billions of dollars. Before getting to CNA, let me address our privately held subsidiary, Altium. Altium became a low subsidiary in 2017. At the time, Loews paid $1.2 billion for Altium. Consisting of $600 million in equity and $600 million in subsidiary debt. When we acquired the company, Altium's net sales were about $800 million. Now Altium's net sales have grown to about $1 billion, driven mostly by 6 accretive acquisitions funded with internally generated cash flow and additional debt at the subsidiary level. With everything we are seeing, we think this will be a good year for Altium as year-to-date organic EBITDA has grown by about 13% and total EBITDA has grown about 35%, judging from the increase in sales and improved earnings it's clear that our equity value in Altium is worth more than what we paid for it a few years ago. After this of our privately held subsidiaries and the description of how we think about each of them, hopefully, you will understand why I feel the market is asleep at the switch when it comes to Loews stock. 
Last, but certainly not least, I want to talk about our publicly held subsidiary, CNA. So far, I have focused my remarks on how long the market has been in valuing our privately held subsidiaries. But that doesn't mean the market has gotten CNA's valuation right. CNA trades at a substantial discount to its peers despite its stellar underwriting performance and while CNA trades at a discount, I believe the commercial property and casualty insurance industry itself is undervalued by the market. While the S&P trades at around 20x next year's earnings, the commercial P&C industry trades in the high single to low double digits. And a show of support for CNA and its management team, and to signal our disclosure with the market's valuation of the company, Loews bought about 0.5 million shares of CNA in the second quarter. And speaking of the second quarter, I want to take a moment to commend CNA's management team on delivering strong underlying results, especially considering the challenging economic environment. When you strip out all the noise in the quarter, the company's underlying combined ratio was 93.4%. CNA continues to benefit from a strong premium rate environment. Rates increased by 3 percentage points from the first quarter of 2020 to about 11% in the second quarter, and the company is actively managing its long-term care business taking actions to reduce risk now and into the future. 
CNA's portfolio -- investment portfolio also had a good quarter, reflecting the market's rebound. The CNA investment portfolio had $4.4 billion in unrealized gains. At the end of the second quarter, the portfolio had bounced back nicely. And its unrealized gain was near its prior high. The downside of such large unrealized gains is that the market yields are low. The yield on 10-year treasury notes is currently below 60 basis points for entities like insurance companies that make money on float, such low rates can become a drag on earnings. All else being equal, a 100 basis point increase in market yields would reduce CNA's unrealized gains by about $2.7 billion. However, investment income would go up dramatically. In short, C&A would have lower unrealized gains or would have higher earnings in the intermediate to long term. 
Finally, I want to talk about capital allocation at Loews. Over the last quarter, we bought a little under 1 million shares of Loews stock. And as I mentioned, about 0.5 million shares of CNA. We bought the CNA shares because we wanted to send a signal to the market that we think the company is trading at too steep the discount. With over $3.6 billion in cash and investments on our balance sheet, we are willing to continue to highlight how egregiously our shares and CNA shares are being priced. That means that share repurchases are certainly not off the table. But we won't be buying in shares at the pace set over the last 2 years. Right now, as we experience so much uncertainty in the world and the financial markets, our focus is on maintaining a substantial cash position as our rainy day fund. At Loews, we are constantly reevaluating our capital allocation strategy and making adjustments accordingly. And 2020 is no different. And now I'd like to hand the call over to our CFO, David Edelson."

For the second quarter, those reported a net loss of $835 million or $2.96 per share compared to net income of $249 million or $0.82 per share in last year's second quarter. This year's second quarter included a net investment loss related to the deconsolidation of Diamond offshore, caused by its bankruptcy filing in late April. This loss totaled $957 million after tax. 2 other items further, the year-over-year decline. Catastrophe losses at CNA and losses at Loews hotels stemming from the severe impact of the pandemic on travel. On a positive note, CNA's underlying underwriting results were excellent, investment results were favorable at both CNA and the parent company and operations at both Boardwalk Pipelines and Altium packaging were strong. 
Before I jump into the quarter and the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, let me remind you what gave rise to the diamond related net investment loss. Up to the bankruptcy filing date of April 26, we accounted for Diamond on a consolidated basis, just as we have historically. These results are shown on Page 4 of our earnings release on the diamond offshore line. Once diamond filed for bankruptcy, Loews no longer control diamond for GAAP purposes. As such, we ceased consolidating diamond and began accounting for diamond at fair value. 
Our net GAAP carrying value of Diamond was $988 million as of the bankruptcy date. At quarter end, the carrying value of our stake was $31 million based on the fair value of our shares and a related deferred tax asset. The difference between these 2 values are $957 million is included in the corporate segment as a net investment loss. Now let me turn to the performance of CNA, Boardwalk, Loews Hotels and Altium packaging. CNA's contribution to our net income declined 46% year-over-year to $135 million. The P&C business performed well. Posting an underlying combined ratio of 93.4% and an average rate increase of almost 11%. As a reminder, CNA's underlying combined ratio for full year 2019 was 1.4 points higher at 94.8%. However, as preannounced on July 15, CNA booked $300 million of pretax $301 million of pretax catastrophe losses in Q2, up from $38 million in last year's second quarter. 60% of these losses related to the COVID-19 pandemic with civil unrest and weather-related events, accounting for about 20% each. 
CNA's $182 million of Q2 COVID-related cat losses combined with the $13 million booked in Q1, represent the company's current best estimate of its ultimate insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses, including defense costs, resulting from the pandemic and the consequent economic crisis. Second quarter cat losses in total added 17.5 points to CNA's loss ratio and reduced our net income by $212 million. 
Last quarter, we discussed how COVID-induced volatility in the financial markets, reduced CNA's net investment income, caused significant net investment losses and materially shrunk the unrealized gain in the company's investment portfolio. In Q2, net investment income benefited from a strong quarter for equities and alternatives, and net investment gains were significant. Largely thanks to the market appreciation on CNA's holdings of nonredeemable preferred stock. Moreover, as Jim described, CNA's net unrealized gain increased more than 100% from March 31 to $4.4 billion, surpassing the year-end level of $4.1 billion. 
Moving on to Boardwalk. The company contributed $34 million to our net income in Q2, down from $53 million last year. Last year's second quarter included a $19 million net benefit from a customer bankruptcy and related contract cancellation. Excluding this nonrecurring item, Boardwalk's net income contribution was flat year-over-year. As we have discussed previously, Boardwalk has experienced contract expirations and restructurings over the past few years related to pipelines placed into service between 2008 and 2010. The net effect has been for contracts to be renewed or replaced at lower rates. This recontracting activity essentially concluded by year-end 2019. This year's second quarter results fully reflect the recontracting activity. 
Net operating revenues in Q2, excluding last year's nonrecurring item, was down less than 2% year-over-year with pipeline growth projects, parking loan and storage and other items, almost fully offsetting the revenue loss from contract expirations and restructurings. Natural gas throughput and liquid volumes increased more than 7% year-to-date in 2020 versus 2019. Boardwalk management is actively monitoring the credit quality of its customers, given the declines in crude oil and natural gas prices. Thus far, the impact has been de minimis. Boardwalk will have spent approximately $2 billion on growth projects during the 2016 to 2020 period. These investments have helped the company compensate for the recontracting pressures faced over the last few years. These investments have also allowed the company to execute on its strategy to diversify its revenue stream by increasing the percent of revenues coming from end-user demand pull customers. 
Now turning to Loews Hotels. The second quarter was tough for Loews hotels as almost all its rooms were out of service for most of the quarter. Operations were not suspended at only 4 properties. The company posted a net loss of $72 million in Q2 as compared to net income of $12 million last year. GAAP operating revenue was just $9 million. Down 94% from last year's second quarter. Revenue at the company's JV properties, which is not included in GAAP consolidated operating revenue declined a similar percentage. Adjusted EBITDA, which is defined in our earnings supplement and excludes nonrecurring items, decreased $122 million year-over-year to a loss of $54 million. 13 properties resumed operations in Q2, spread out from May 29 through June 26 and the Loews, Kansas City opened on June 1 after its grand opening was delayed by COVID. 5 more properties resumed operations during July. As of today, 4 properties plus the yet to be opened endless summer property in Orlando are not operational. We stated last quarter that during each month of suspended operation of fully suspended operations the hotel company was expected to generate negative cash flow of about $25 million. We explained that this amount should decline as properties resume operations since Loews Hotels management intended to restart operations at properties only when doing so, improve cash flow. This has thus far proven to be the case as the hotel company is effectively and aggressively managing property level and management company expenses. 
Turning to Altium Packaging. Altium continued to experience strong revenue and EBITDA growth as it benefited from its recent acquisitions namely its pharmaceutical packaging business as well as increased demand for such core products as household chemicals, water and beverages. Conversely, demand weakened somewhat in segments, including automotive, commercial foodservice and institutional dairy. Altium contributed a slight net loss despite its robust EBITDA increase. Depreciation and amortization were up from the prior year, driven by the recent acquisitions and by the accelerated amortization of the CCC trade name. All in all, Altium is performing above plan and has been very successful in winning new business by demonstrating reliability and customer focus. Across the board, we remain focused on ensuring that our subsidiaries implement effective policies and procedures to protect the safety and health of their employees. Loews' long-term success rests on the success of our subsidiaries, so the well-being of their employees is our foremost concern. 
Finally, a few words about the parent company. As always, we are focused on maintaining a strong and highly liquid balance sheet. At quarter end, the parent company portfolio of cash and investments totaled $3.6 billion, with about 80% in cash and equivalents and the remainder mainly in marketable equity securities and a small portfolio of limited partnership investments. The parent company investment portfolio generated pretax income of $110 million in Q2, up from $33 million in Q2 2019 and well ahead of the 166 million loss in Q1. Equities drove the parent company investment results. We received $90 million in dividends from CNA during the second quarter. As a reminder, Boardwalk has adopted an annual dividend policy, and we -- and we expect to receive a dividend in the fourth quarter, approximating last year's $100 million. 
I will now hand the call back to Mary."

The public -- my sense is that the public market today doesn't make much sense and is certainly not an accurate reflection of the value of CNA. Also, all P&C companies, as I said in my remarks, are undervalued. Of course, there are lots of good reasons for keeping CNA as a public company. And those outweigh what I consider to be the short-term problem of the undervaluation. Number one, it's important to regulators and credit rating agencies. It's important for attracting talent to be able to give them long-term incentive that is based on the stock. And it's also important just for transparency. And as for the added expense of keeping CNA public in the context of the size of Loews and of CNA, there really aren't any significant expenses that could be saved."

Can you talk a little bit about what recovering the whole in the hotel industry looks like? Washout, it certainly is. First, let me start by saying something that was told to me when I was in college. It's an old expression, he who lives by the crystal ball, let's learn to eat ground glass. And with that as a caveat, let me add that I think 2020 will be the bottom of the hotel industry in terms of the effects of the pandemic. And I believe that 2021 will be dramatically better than 2020. And if I'm going to forecast longer than that, I think that '22 will even be better than '21. 
Currently, we're seeing more of a pickup in driving leisure type travel at our resorts, destinations. The business travel and hotels and city centers are lagging the resorts at this point in time. My guess is that this will persist for some time as companies weigh employee safety and security as well as reassess their travel budgets. But I believe that in the fullness of time, those that travel and those budgets will be -- come back at similar levels to where they were before this all began. Keep in mind that we're seeing a pickup in occupancy from a few months ago, but occupancy is still very, very low, measured at 10, 20, 30 or 40% most of the time. We opened the hotels because we found that we lose less cash by keeping those hotels open rather than keeping them closed. But we are still losing money in those hotels okay."

We keep -- as you all know, we keep our level of cash and investments above our debt levels because it's important for the company to maintain its bond ratings and the rating agencies like to see us have more cash and investments than debt. The Loews rating provides an uplift to some of our subsidiary ratings, giving them, among other things, access to cheaper debt. So under exceptional circumstances, we would certainly consider allowing our cash and our investment balances to go below our debt levels, but buying in low shares at an exceptional price isn't yet included in my definition of an exceptional circumstance. Currently, given the ongoing uncertainty in the world, we think it maintains -- it makes a lot of sense to be cautious and maintain ample liquidity. But as low shares [Technical Difficulty] continued to be remarkably undervalued, my calculus on this is very possible to change. 
Okay. And the last question we have is, we just received this question, even though you answered this topic earlier in the call, we wanted to ask it again.

And as I said previously, nothing has occurred in the performance of the company that would lead us to reconsider that purchase at all. Prior to the COVID pandemic evaluation of our hotel business was measured in the billions of dollars, and I still feel comfortable that in the recovery from the pandemic, which I see coming certainly in the next year or so, we will see that valuation again. And finally, our equity check for Altium was $600 million, as I said in my remarks. And due to the good results and the good investments at Altium, I believe the valuation should be higher now. So when you add all that up, in my mind, the market valuation of $500 million for all of our non publicly traded subsidiaries is to me ludicrous when they are clearly worth dramatically more than that."

Rather than getting into specifics about the quarter, I want to use this call today as an opportunity to get something off my chest. I am beyond frustrated with where the -- where the stock market has been pricing Loews and CNA, and I can't believe how undervalued the stocks are. 
Loews' market capitalization as of this morning is about $9.8 billion, and our stake in CNA plus net cash alone account for more than $9.4 billion of that number. That leaves the market's valuation of our nonpublicly-traded subsidiaries, Boardwalk, Loews Hotels and Altium at less than $500 million, which, to my mind, is patently absurd. I also think CNA's value is patently absurd, but more on that later. 
Let's look at each of Loews' privately held subsidiaries to see if I can demonstrate to you that collectively, they are worth dramatically more than $500 million. First, let's look at Boardwalk pipeline. In July of 2018, Loews purchased the outstanding common units of Boardwalk that we didn't already own for $1.5 billion, putting the total equity value of Loews' ownership stake in Boardwalk at $3 billion. Keep in mind that Loews is in litigation over Boardwalk with a trial date set for January of 2021. So we can't get into too much detail. However, since the time of our purchase of Boardwalk's remaining public float, nothing has occurred with the performance of the company that would lead us to reconsider that purchase. 
Boardwalk has successfully made it through the challenge of recontracting, and since going private, has reinvested a majority of its distributable cash flow in order to reduce the risk and volatility of future earnings. And since July of 2018, EBITDA for the business is essentially flat despite the significant recontracting headwinds the company has experienced. While future growth projects have become more difficult to complete in the current regulatory environment, Boardwalk benefits from its base of 14,000 miles of pipe in the ground. Boardwalk also benefits from stable fixed fee contracts. The company has over $9 billion of contractual backlog or 7x Boardwalk's annual revenues. Essentially, I'm comfortable with the guidance I gave last quarter for Boardwalk. The company is currently tracking slightly better than forecast for the first half of the year. Its flow volumes are up, the pipes are doing well and storage revenues are strong. At the end of 2020, Boardwalk should continue to have a debt-to-EBITDA ratio below 5x. 
For all the reasons I've just outlined, I'm very disappointed by the market's implied value of Boardwalk. Clearly, the company is worth much more than the market gives us credit for.
Next, let's take a look at Loews Hotels. At the risk of stating the obvious, this year will be a washout for the entire hotel and travel industry, and Loews Hotels is no exception to the rule. During my first quarter remarks, I made note of the fact that there were only 4 Loews Hotels open at the time. Today, many more of our hotels are operational, but occupancy rates remain abysmally low, especially for our properties located in city centers. Our resort hotels are doing a bit better. But since many of them are located in COVID hotspots, there's plenty of room for improvement. I believe that over time, whether through a vaccine or other mitigants, the travel industry will recover, and Loews Hotels will once again be a growth engine for Loews.
One last thought on hotels. As I mentioned, the market currently values our privately held subsidiaries at about $500 million. We make available on the parent company website, Loews Hotels' adjusted EBITDA and adjusted mortgage debt. When looking at these numbers, however, keep in mind that the hotel company has invested equity in projects that have recently opened or have yet to open. And the true earning power of these hotels has never been reflected in Loews Hotels' historical EBITDA. It's clear that even if you did a back of the envelope valuation for Loews Hotels, you would see that in any sort of hotel industry recovery, the equity we have in Loews Hotels would be measured in the billions of dollars. 
Before getting to CNA, let me address our privately held subsidiary, Altium. Altium became a Loews' subsidiary in 2017. At the time, Loews paid $1.2 billion for Altium, consisting of $600 million in equity and $600 million in subsidiary debt. When we acquired the company, Altium's net sales were about $800 million. Now Altium's net sales have grown to about $1 billion, driven mostly by 6 accretive acquisitions funded with internally generated cash flow and additional debt at the subsidiary level. With everything we are seeing, we think this will be a good year for Altium as year-to-date organic EBITDA has grown by about 13% and total EBITDA has grown about 35%. Judging from the increase in sales and improved earnings, it's clear that our equity value in Altium is worth more than what we paid for it a few years ago.
After the survey of our privately held subsidiaries and the description of how we think about each of them, hopefully, you will understand why I feel the market is asleep at the switch when it comes to Loews' stock.
Last, but certainly not least, I want to talk about our publicly held subsidiary, CNA. So far, I have focused my remarks on how long the market has been in valuing our privately held subsidiaries. But that doesn't mean the market has gotten CNA's valuation right. CNA trades at a substantial discount to its peers despite its stellar underwriting performance and while CNA trades at a discount, I believe the commercial property and casualty insurance industry itself is undervalued by the market. While the S&P trades at around 20x next year's earnings, the commercial P&C industry trades in the high single to low double digits. In a show of support for CNA and its management team, and to signal our displeasure with the market's valuation of the company, Loews bought about 0.5 million shares of CNA in the second quarter. 
And speaking of the second quarter, I want to take a moment to commend CNA's management team on delivering strong underlying results, especially considering the challenging economic environment. When you strip out all the noise in the quarter, the company's underlying combined ratio was 93.4%. CNA continues to benefit from a strong premium rate environment. Rates increased by 3 percentage points from the first quarter of 2020 to about 11% in the second quarter, and the company is actively managing its long-term care business, taking actions to reduce risk now and into the future.
CNA's portfolio -- investment portfolio also had a good quarter, reflecting the market's rebound. The CNA investment portfolio had $4.4 billion in unrealized gains. At the end of the second quarter, the portfolio had bounced back nicely. And its unrealized gain was near its prior high. The downside of such large unrealized gains is that the market yields are low. The yield on 10-year treasury notes is currently below 60 basis points for entities like insurance companies that make money on float, such low rates can become a drag on earnings. All else being equal, a 100 basis point increase in market yields would reduce CNA's unrealized gains by about $2.7 billion. However, investment income would go up dramatically. In short, CNA would have lower unrealized gains but would have higher earnings in the intermediate to long term.
Finally, I want to talk about capital allocation at Loews. Over the last quarter, we bought a little under 1 million shares of Loews' stock, and as I mentioned, about 0.5 million shares of CNA. We bought the CNA shares because we wanted to send a signal to the market that we think the company is trading at too steep a discount. With over $3.6 billion in cash and investments on our balance sheet, we are willing to continue to highlight how egregiously our shares and CNA shares are being priced. That means that share repurchases are certainly not off the table, but we won't be buying in shares at the pace set over the last 2 years. Right now, as we experience so much uncertainty in the world and the financial markets, our focus is on maintaining a substantial cash position as our rainy day fund. At Loews, we are constantly reevaluating our capital allocation strategy and making adjustments accordingly. And 2020 is no different. And now I'd like to hand the call over to our CFO, David Edelson."
285930,677292115,2056825,"Loews Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2020",2020-08-03,"Earnings Calls","Loews Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. For the second quarter, Loews reported a net loss of $835 million or $2.96 per share compared to net income of $249 million or $0.82 per share in last year's second quarter. This year's second quarter included a",1360,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. For the second quarter, Loews reported a net loss of $835 million or $2.96 per share compared to net income of $249 million or $0.82 per share in last year's second quarter. This year's second quarter included a net investment loss related to the deconsolidation of Diamond Offshore, caused by its bankruptcy filing in late April. This loss totaled $957 million after tax. Two other items furthered the year-over-year decline, catastrophe losses at CNA and losses at Loews hotels stemming from the severe impact of the pandemic on travel. On a positive note, CNA's underlying underwriting results were excellent, investment results were favorable at both CNA and the parent company and operations at both Boardwalk Pipelines and Altium Packaging were strong.
Before I jump into the quarter and the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, let me remind you what gave rise to the Diamond-related net investment loss. Up to the bankruptcy filing date of April 26, we accounted for Diamond on a consolidated basis, just as we have historically. These results are shown on Page 4 of our earnings release on the Diamond Offshore line. Once Diamond filed for bankruptcy, Loews no longer control Diamond for GAAP purposes. As such, we ceased consolidating Diamond and began accounting for Diamond at fair value. Our net GAAP accounting value of Diamond was $988 million as of the bankruptcy date. At quarter end, the carrying value of our stake was $31 million based on the fair value of our shares and a related deferred tax asset. The difference between these 2 values or $957 million is included in the corporate segment as a net investment loss. 
Now let me turn to the performance of CNA, Boardwalk, Loews Hotels and Altium Packaging. CNA's contribution to our net income declined 46% year-over-year to $135 million. The P&C business performed well, posting an underlying combined ratio of 93.4% and an average rate increase of almost 11%. As a reminder, CNA's underlying combined ratio for full year 2019 was 1.4 points higher at 94.8%. However, as preannounced on July 15, CNA booked $300 million of pretax -- $301 million of pretax catastrophe losses in Q2, up from $38 million in last year's second quarter. 60% of these cat loss is related to the COVID-19 pandemic with civil unrest and weather-related events, accounting for about 20% each. CNA's $182 million of Q2 COVID-related cat losses combined with the $13 million booked in Q1, represent the company's current best estimate of its ultimate insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses, including defense costs, resulting from the pandemic and the consequent economic crisis. Second quarter cat losses in total added 17.5 points to CNA's loss ratio and reduced our net income by $212 million.
Last quarter, we discussed how COVID-induced volatility in the financial markets reduced CNA's net investment income, caused significant net investment losses and materially shrunk the unrealized gain in the company's investment portfolio. In Q2, net investment income benefited from a strong quarter for equities and alternatives, and net investment gains were significant, largely thanks to the market appreciation on CNA's holdings of nonredeemable preferred stock. Moreover, as Jim described, CNA's net unrealized gain increased more than 100% from March 31 to $4.4 billion, surpassing the year-end level of $4.1 billion.
Moving on to Boardwalk. The company contributed $34 million to our net income in Q2, down from $53 million last year. Last year's second quarter included a $19 million net benefit from a customer bankruptcy and related contract cancellation. Excluding this nonrecurring item, Boardwalk's net income contribution was flat year-over-year. As we have discussed previously, Boardwalk has experienced contract expirations and restructurings over the past few years related to pipelines placed into service between 2008 and 2010. The net effect has been for contracts to be renewed or replaced at lower rates. This recontracting activity essentially concluded by year-end 2019. This year's second quarter results fully reflect the recontracting activity.
Net operating revenues in Q2, excluding last year's nonrecurring item, was down less than 2% year-over-year with pipeline growth projects, parking loan and storage and other items, almost fully offsetting the revenue loss from contract expirations and restructurings. Natural gas throughput and liquid volumes increased more than 7% year-to-date in 2020 versus 2019. 
Boardwalk management is actively monitoring the credit quality of its customers, given the declines in crude oil and natural gas prices. Thus far, the impact has been de minimis. Boardwalk will have spent approximately $2 billion on growth projects during the 2016 to 2020 period. These investments have helped the company compensate for the recontracting pressures faced over the last few years. These investments have also allowed the company to execute on its strategy to diversify its revenue stream by increasing the percent of revenues coming from end-user demand pull customers.
Now turning to Loews Hotels. The second quarter was tough for Loews Hotels as almost all its rooms were out of service for most of the quarter. Operations were not suspended at only 4 properties. The company posted a net loss of $72 million in Q2 as compared to net income of $12 million last year. GAAP operating revenue was just $9 million, down 94% from last year's second quarter. Revenue at the company's JV properties, which is not included in GAAP consolidated operating revenue, declined a similar percentage. Adjusted EBITDA, which is defined in our earnings supplement and excludes nonrecurring items, decreased $122 million year-over-year to a loss of $54 million. 13 properties resumed operations in Q2, spread out from May 29 through June 26 and the Loews, Kansas City opened on June 1 after its grand opening was delayed by COVID. 5 more properties resumed operations during July. As of today, 4 properties plus the yet to be opened Endless Summer dockside property in Orlando are not operational. 
We stated last quarter that during each month of suspended operation of fully suspended operations, the hotel company was expected to generate negative cash flow of about $25 million. We explained that this amount should decline as properties resume operations since Loews Hotels' management intended to restart operations at properties only when doing so, improve cash flow. This has thus far proven to be the case as the hotel company is effectively and aggressively managing property level and management company expenses.
Turning to Altium Packaging. Altium continued to experience strong revenue and EBITDA growth as it benefited from its recent acquisitions, namely its pharmaceutical packaging business as well as increased demand for such core products as household chemicals, water and beverages. Conversely, demand weakened somewhat in segments, including automotive, commercial food service and institutional dairy. 
Altium contributed a slight net loss despite its robust EBITDA increase. Depreciation and amortization were up from the prior year, driven by the recent acquisitions and by the accelerated amortization of the CCC trade name. All in all, Altium is performing above plan and has been very successful in winning new business by demonstrating reliability and customer focus. 
Across the board, we remain focused on ensuring that our subsidiaries implement effective policies and procedures to protect the safety and health of their employees. Loews' long-term success rests on the success of our subsidiaries, so the well-being of their employees is our foremost concern.
Finally, a few words about the parent company. As always, we are focused on maintaining a strong and highly liquid balance sheet. At quarter end, the parent company portfolio of cash and investments totaled $3.6 billion, with about 80% in cash and equivalents and the remainder mainly in marketable equity securities and a small portfolio of limited partnership investments. The parent company investment portfolio generated pretax income of $110 million in Q2, up from $33 million in Q2 2019 and well ahead of the $166 million loss in Q1. Equities drove the parent company investment results. We received $90 million in dividends from CNA during the second quarter. As a reminder, Boardwalk has adopted an annual dividend policy, and we respect -- and we expect to receive a dividend in the fourth quarter approximating last year's $100 million.
I will now hand the call back to Mary."

The public -- my sense is that the public market today doesn't make much sense and is certainly not an accurate reflection of the value of CNA. Also, all P&C companies, as I said in my remarks, are undervalued. Of course, there are lots of good reasons for keeping CNA as a public company. And those outweigh what I consider to be the short-term problem of the undervaluation. Number one, it's important to regulators and credit rating agencies. It's important for attracting talent to be able to give them long-term incentive that is based on the stock. And it's also important just for transparency. And as for the added expense of keeping CNA public in the context of the size of Loews and of CNA, there really aren't any significant expenses that could be saved."

Currently, we're seeing more of a pickup in driving leisure type travel at our resorts, destinations. The business travel and hotels and city centers are lagging the resorts at this point in time. My guess is that this will persist for some time as companies weigh employee safety and security as well as reassess their travel budgets. But I believe that in the fullness of time, those that travel and those budgets will be -- come back at similar levels to where they were before this all began. 
Keep in mind that we're seeing a pickup in occupancy from a few months ago, but occupancy is still very, very low, measured at 10%, 20%, 30% or 40% most of the time. We've opened the hotels because we found that we lose less cash by keeping those hotels open rather than keeping them closed. But we are still losing money in those hotels."

So under exceptional circumstances, we would certainly consider allowing our cash and our investment balances to go below our debt levels, but buying in Loews shares at an exceptional price isn't yet included in my definition of an exceptional circumstance. Currently, given the ongoing uncertainty in the world, we think it may take -- it makes a lot of sense to be cautious and maintain ample liquidity. But as Loews' shares continue to be remarkably undervalued, my calculus on this is very possible to change."

Prior to the COVID pandemic, evaluation of our hotel business was measured in the billions of dollars, and I still feel comfortable that in the recovery from the pandemic, which I see coming certainly in the next year or so, we will see that valuation again. And finally, our equity check for Altium was $600 million, as I said in my remarks. And due to the good results and the good investments at Altium, I believe the valuation should be higher now. So when you add all that up, in my mind, the market valuation of $500 million for all of our nonpublicly-traded subsidiaries is to me ludicrous when they are clearly worth dramatically more than that."

Rather than getting into specifics about the quarter, I want to use this call today as an opportunity to get something off my chest. I am beyond frustrated with where the -- where the stock market has been pricing Loews and CNA, and I can't believe how undervalued the stocks are. 
Loews' market capitalization as of this morning is about $9.8 billion, and our stake in CNA plus net cash alone account for more than $9.4 billion of that number. That leaves the market's valuation of our nonpublicly-traded subsidiaries, Boardwalk, Loews Hotels and Altium at less than $500 million, which, to my mind, is patently absurd. I also think CNA's value is patently absurd, but more on that later. 
Let's look at each of Loews' privately held subsidiaries to see if I can demonstrate to you that collectively, they are worth dramatically more than $500 million. First, let's look at Boardwalk pipeline. In July of 2018, Loews purchased the outstanding common units of Boardwalk that we didn't already own for $1.5 billion, putting the total equity value of Loews' ownership stake in Boardwalk at $3 billion. Keep in mind that Loews is in litigation over Boardwalk with a trial date set for January of 2021. So we can't get into too much detail. However, since the time of our purchase of Boardwalk's remaining public float, nothing has occurred with the performance of the company that would lead us to reconsider that purchase. 
Boardwalk has successfully made it through the challenge of recontracting, and since going private, has reinvested a majority of its distributable cash flow in order to reduce the risk and volatility of future earnings. And since July of 2018, EBITDA for the business is essentially flat despite the significant recontracting headwinds the company has experienced. While future growth projects have become more difficult to complete in the current regulatory environment, Boardwalk benefits from its base of 14,000 miles of pipe in the ground. Boardwalk also benefits from stable fixed fee contracts. The company has over $9 billion of contractual backlog or 7x Boardwalk's annual revenues. Essentially, I'm comfortable with the guidance I gave last quarter for Boardwalk. The company is currently tracking slightly better than forecast for the first half of the year. Its flow volumes are up, the pipes are doing well and storage revenues are strong. At the end of 2020, Boardwalk should continue to have a debt-to-EBITDA ratio below 5x. 
For all the reasons I've just outlined, I'm very disappointed by the market's implied value of Boardwalk. Clearly, the company is worth much more than the market gives us credit for.
Next, let's take a look at Loews Hotels. At the risk of stating the obvious, this year will be a washout for the entire hotel and travel industry, and Loews Hotels is no exception to the rule. During my first quarter remarks, I made note of the fact that there were only 4 Loews Hotels open at the time. Today, many more of our hotels are operational, but occupancy rates remain abysmally low, especially for our properties located in city centers. Our resort hotels are doing a bit better. But since many of them are located in COVID hotspots, there's plenty of room for improvement. I believe that over time, whether through a vaccine or other mitigants, the travel industry will recover, and Loews Hotels will once again be a growth engine for Loews.
One last thought on hotels. As I mentioned, the market currently values our privately held subsidiaries at about $500 million. We make available on the parent company website, Loews Hotels' adjusted EBITDA and adjusted mortgage debt. When looking at these numbers, however, keep in mind that the hotel company has invested equity in projects that have recently opened or have yet to open. And the true earning power of these hotels has never been reflected in Loews Hotels' historical EBITDA. It's clear that even if you did a back of the envelope valuation for Loews Hotels, you would see that in any sort of hotel industry recovery, the equity we have in Loews Hotels would be measured in the billions of dollars. 
Before getting to CNA, let me address our privately held subsidiary, Altium. Altium became a Loews' subsidiary in 2017. At the time, Loews paid $1.2 billion for Altium, consisting of $600 million in equity and $600 million in subsidiary debt. When we acquired the company, Altium's net sales were about $800 million. Now Altium's net sales have grown to about $1 billion, driven mostly by 6 accretive acquisitions funded with internally generated cash flow and additional debt at the subsidiary level. With everything we are seeing, we think this will be a good year for Altium as year-to-date organic EBITDA has grown by about 13% and total EBITDA has grown about 35%. Judging from the increase in sales and improved earnings, it's clear that our equity value in Altium is worth more than what we paid for it a few years ago.
After the survey of our privately held subsidiaries and the description of how we think about each of them, hopefully, you will understand why I feel the market is asleep at the switch when it comes to Loews' stock.
Last, but certainly not least, I want to talk about our publicly held subsidiary, CNA. So far, I have focused my remarks on how wrong the market has been in valuing our privately held subsidiaries. But that doesn't mean the market has gotten CNA's valuation right. CNA trades at a substantial discount to its peers despite its stellar underwriting performance and while CNA trades at a discount, I believe the commercial property and casualty insurance industry itself is undervalued by the market. While the S&P trades at around 20x next year's earnings, the commercial P&C industry trades in the high single to low double digits. In a show of support for CNA and its management team, and to signal our displeasure with the market's valuation of the company, Loews bought about 0.5 million shares of CNA in the second quarter. 
And speaking of the second quarter, I want to take a moment to commend CNA's management team on delivering strong underlying results, especially considering the challenging economic environment. When you strip out all the noise in the quarter, the company's underlying combined ratio was 93.4%. CNA continues to benefit from a strong premium rate environment. Rates increased by 3 percentage points from the first quarter of 2020 to about 11% in the second quarter, and the company is actively managing its long-term care business, taking actions to reduce risk now and into the future.
CNA's portfolio -- investment portfolio also had a good quarter, reflecting the market's rebound. The CNA investment portfolio had $4.4 billion in unrealized gains. At the end of the second quarter, the portfolio had bounced back nicely. And its unrealized gain was near its prior high. The downside of such large unrealized gains is that the market yields are low. The yield on 10-year treasury notes is currently below 60 basis points for entities like insurance companies that make money on float, such low rates can become a drag on earnings. All else being equal, a 100 basis point increase in market yields would reduce CNA's unrealized gains by about $2.7 billion. However, investment income would go up dramatically. In short, CNA would have lower unrealized gains but would have higher earnings in the intermediate to long term.
Finally, I want to talk about capital allocation at Loews. Over the last quarter, we bought a little under 1 million shares of Loews' stock, and as I mentioned, about 0.5 million shares of CNA. We bought the CNA shares because we wanted to send a signal to the market that we think the company is trading at too steep a discount. With over $3.6 billion in cash and investments on our balance sheet, we are willing to continue to highlight how egregiously our shares and CNA shares are being priced. That means that share repurchases are certainly not off the table, but we won't be buying in shares at the pace set over the last 2 years. Right now, as we experience so much uncertainty in the world and the financial markets, our focus is on maintaining a substantial cash position as our rainy day fund. At Loews, we are constantly reevaluating our capital allocation strategy and making adjustments accordingly. And 2020 is no different. And now I'd like to hand the call over to our CFO, David Edelson."
285930,677292115,2067519,"Loews Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2020",2020-08-03,"Earnings Calls","Loews Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. For the second quarter, Loews reported a net loss of $835 million or $2.96 per share compared to net income of $249 million or $0.82 per share in last year's second quarter. This year's second quarter included a",1360,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. For the second quarter, Loews reported a net loss of $835 million or $2.96 per share compared to net income of $249 million or $0.82 per share in last year's second quarter. This year's second quarter included a net investment loss related to the deconsolidation of Diamond Offshore, caused by its bankruptcy filing in late April. This loss totaled $957 million after tax. Two other items furthered the year-over-year decline: catastrophe losses at CNA and losses at Loews hotels stemming from the severe impact of the pandemic on travel. On a positive note, CNA's underlying underwriting results were excellent, investment results were favorable at both CNA and the parent company and operations at both Boardwalk Pipelines and Altium Packaging were strong.
Before I jump into the quarter and the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, let me remind you what gave rise to the Diamond-related net investment loss. Up to the bankruptcy filing date of April 26, we accounted for Diamond on a consolidated basis, just as we have historically. These results are shown on Page 4 of our earnings release on the Diamond Offshore line. Once Diamond filed for bankruptcy, Loews no longer controlled Diamond for GAAP purposes. As such, we ceased consolidating Diamond and began accounting for Diamond at fair value. Our net GAAP carrying value of Diamond was $988 million as of the bankruptcy date. At quarter end, the carrying value of our stake was $31 million based on the fair value of our shares and a related deferred tax asset. The difference between these 2 values or $957 million is included in the corporate segment as a net investment loss. 
Now let me turn to the performance of CNA, Boardwalk, Loews Hotels and Altium Packaging. CNA's contribution to our net income declined 46% year-over-year to $135 million. The P&C business performed well, posting an underlying combined ratio of 93.4% and an average rate increase of almost 11%. As a reminder, CNA's underlying combined ratio for full year 2019 was 1.4 points higher at 94.8%. However, as preannounced on July 15, CNA booked $300 million of pretax -- $301 million of pretax catastrophe losses in Q2, up from $38 million in last year's second quarter. 60% of these cat losses related to the COVID-19 pandemic with civil unrest and weather-related events, accounting for about 20% each. CNA's $182 million of Q2 COVID-related cat losses combined with the $13 million booked in Q1, represent the company's current best estimate of its ultimate insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses, including defense costs, resulting from the pandemic and the consequent economic crisis. Second quarter cat losses in total added 17.5 points to CNA's loss ratio and reduced our net income by $212 million.
Last quarter, we discussed how COVID-induced volatility in the financial markets reduced CNA's net investment income, caused significant net investment losses and materially shrunk the unrealized gain in the company's investment portfolio. In Q2, net investment income benefited from a strong quarter for equities and alternatives, and net investment gains were significant, largely thanks to the market appreciation on CNA's holdings of nonredeemable preferred stock. Moreover, as Jim described, CNA's net unrealized gain increased more than 100% from March 31 to $4.4 billion, surpassing the year-end level of $4.1 billion.
Moving on to Boardwalk. The company contributed $34 million to our net income in Q2, down from $53 million last year. Last year's second quarter included a $19 million net benefit from a customer bankruptcy and related contract cancellation. Excluding this nonrecurring item, Boardwalk's net income contribution was flat year-over-year. As we have discussed previously, Boardwalk has experienced contract expirations and restructurings over the past few years related to pipelines placed into service between 2008 and 2010. The net effect has been for contracts to be renewed or replaced at lower rates. This recontracting activity essentially concluded by year-end 2019. This year's second quarter results fully reflect the recontracting activity.
Net operating revenues in Q2, excluding last year's nonrecurring item, was down less than 2% year-over-year with pipeline growth projects, parking loan and storage and other items, almost fully offsetting the revenue loss from contract expirations and restructurings. Natural gas throughput and liquid volumes increased more than 7% year-to-date in 2020 versus 2019. 
Boardwalk management is actively monitoring the credit quality of its customers, given the declines in crude oil and natural gas prices. Thus far, the impact has been de minimis. Boardwalk will have spent approximately $2 billion on growth projects during the 2016 to 2020 period. These investments have helped the company compensate for the recontracting pressures faced over the last few years. These investments have also allowed the company to execute on its strategy to diversify its revenue stream by increasing the percent of revenues coming from end-user demand pull customers.
Now turning to Loews Hotels. The second quarter was tough for Loews Hotels as almost all its rooms were out of service for most of the quarter. Operations were not suspended at only 4 properties. The company posted a net loss of $72 million in Q2 as compared to net income of $12 million last year. GAAP operating revenue was just $9 million, down 94% from last year's second quarter. Revenue at the company's JV properties, which is not included in GAAP consolidated operating revenue, declined a similar percentage. Adjusted EBITDA, which is defined in our earnings supplement and excludes nonrecurring items, decreased $122 million year-over-year to a loss of $54 million. 13 properties resumed operations in Q2, spread out from May 29 through June 26 and the Loews, Kansas City opened on June 1 after its grand opening was delayed by COVID. 5 more properties resumed operations during July. As of today, 4 properties plus the yet to be opened Endless Summer dockside property in Orlando are not operational. 
We stated last quarter that during each month of suspended operation -- of fully suspended operations, the hotel company was expected to generate negative cash flow of about $25 million. We explained that this amount should decline as properties resume operations since Loews Hotels' management intended to restart operations at properties only when doing so improve cash flow. This has thus far proven to be the case as the hotel company is effectively and aggressively managing property level and management company expenses.
Turning to Altium Packaging. Altium continued to experience strong revenue and EBITDA growth as it benefited from its recent acquisitions, namely its pharmaceutical packaging business as well as increased demand for such core products as household chemicals, water and beverages. Conversely, demand weakened somewhat in segments, including automotive, commercial food service and institutional dairy. 
Altium contributed a slight net loss despite its robust EBITDA increase. Depreciation and amortization were up from the prior year, driven by the recent acquisitions and by the accelerated amortization of the CCC trade name. All in all, Altium is performing above plan and has been very successful in winning new business by demonstrating reliability and customer focus. 
Across the board, we remain focused on ensuring that our subsidiaries implement effective policies and procedures to protect the safety and health of their employees. Loews' long-term success rests on the success of our subsidiaries, so the well-being of their employees is our foremost concern.
Finally, a few words about the parent company. As always, we are focused on maintaining a strong and highly liquid balance sheet. At quarter end, the parent company portfolio of cash and investments totaled $3.6 billion, with about 80% in cash and equivalents and the remainder mainly in marketable equity securities and a small portfolio of limited partnership investments. The parent company investment portfolio generated pretax income of $110 million in Q2, up from $33 million in Q2 2019 and well ahead of the $166 million loss in Q1. Equities drove the parent company investment results. We received $90 million in dividends from CNA during the second quarter. As a reminder, Boardwalk has adopted an annual dividend policy, and we respect -- and we expect to receive a dividend in the fourth quarter approximating last year's $100 million.
I will now hand the call back to Mary."

Also, all P&C companies, as I said in my remarks, are undervalued. Of course, there are lots of good reasons for keeping CNA as a public company. And those outweigh what I consider to be the short-term problem of the undervaluation. Number one, it's important to regulators and credit rating agencies. It's important for attracting talent to be able to give them long-term incentive that is based on the stock. And it's also important just for transparency. And as for the added expense of keeping CNA public in the context of the size of Loews and of CNA, there really aren't any significant expenses that could be saved."

Currently, we're seeing more of a pickup in driving leisure type travel at our resorts, destinations. The business travel and hotels and city centers are lagging the resorts at this point in time. My guess is that this will persist for some time as companies weigh employee safety and security as well as reassess their travel budgets. But I believe that in the fullness of time, those -- that travel and those budgets will be -- come back at similar levels to where they were before this all began. 
Keep in mind that we're seeing a pickup in occupancy from a few months ago, but occupancy is still very, very low, measured at 10%, 20%, 30% or 40% most of the time. We've opened the hotels because we found that we lose less cash by keeping those hotels open rather than keeping them closed. But we are still losing money in those hotels."

So under exceptional circumstances, we would certainly consider allowing our cash and our investment balances to go below our debt levels, but buying in Loews shares at an exceptional price isn't yet included in my definition of an exceptional circumstance. Currently, given the ongoing uncertainty in the world, we think it may take -- it makes a lot of sense to be cautious and maintain ample liquidity. But as Loews' shares continue to be remarkably undervalued, my calculus on this is very possible to change."

Prior to the COVID pandemic, evaluation of our hotel business was measured in the billions of dollars, and I still feel comfortable that in the recovery from the pandemic, which I see coming certainly in the next year or so, we will see that valuation again. And finally, our equity check for Altium was $600 million, as I said in my remarks. And due to the good results and the good investments at Altium, I believe the valuation should be higher now. So when you add all that up, in my mind, the market valuation of $500 million for all of our nonpublicly-traded subsidiaries is to me ludicrous when they are clearly worth dramatically more than that."

Rather than getting into specifics about the quarter, I want to use this call today as an opportunity to get something off my chest. I am beyond frustrated with where the -- where the stock market has been pricing Loews and CNA, and I can't believe how undervalued the stocks are. 
Loews' market capitalization as of this morning is about $9.8 billion, and our stake in CNA plus net cash alone account for more than $9.4 billion of that number. That leaves the market's valuation of our nonpublicly-traded subsidiaries, Boardwalk, Loews Hotels and Altium at less than $500 million, which, to my mind, is patently absurd. I also think CNA's value is patently absurd, but more on that later. 
Let's look at each of Loews' privately held subsidiaries to see if I can demonstrate to you that collectively, they are worth dramatically more than $500 million. First, let's look at Boardwalk pipeline. In July of 2018, Loews purchased the outstanding common units of Boardwalk that we didn't already own for $1.5 billion, putting the total equity value of Loews' ownership stake in Boardwalk at $3 billion. Keep in mind that Loews is in litigation over Boardwalk with a trial date set for January of 2021. So we can't get into too much detail. However, since the time of our purchase of Boardwalk's remaining public float, nothing has occurred with the performance of the company that would lead us to reconsider that purchase. 
Boardwalk has successfully made it through the challenge of recontracting, and since going private, has reinvested a majority of its distributable cash flow in order to reduce the risk and volatility of future earnings. And since July of 2018, EBITDA for the business is essentially flat despite the significant recontracting headwinds the company has experienced. While future growth projects have become more difficult to complete in the current regulatory environment, Boardwalk benefits from its base of 14,000 miles of pipe in the ground. Boardwalk also benefits from stable fixed fee contracts. The company has over $9 billion of contractual backlog or 7x Boardwalk's annual revenues. Essentially, I'm comfortable with the guidance I gave last quarter for Boardwalk. The company is currently tracking slightly better than forecast for the first half of the year. Its flow volumes are up, the pipes are doing well and storage revenues are strong. At the end of 2020, Boardwalk should continue to have a debt-to-EBITDA ratio below 5x. 
For all the reasons I've just outlined, I'm very disappointed by the market's implied value of Boardwalk. Clearly, the company is worth much more than the market gives us credit for.
Next, let's take a look at Loews Hotels. At the risk of stating the obvious, this year will be a washout for the entire hotel and travel industry, and Loews Hotels is no exception to the rule. During my first quarter remarks, I made note of the fact that there were only 4 Loews Hotels open at the time. Today, many more of our hotels are operational, but occupancy rates remain abysmally low, especially for our properties located in city centers. Our resort hotels are doing a bit better. But since many of them are located in COVID hotspots, there's plenty of room for improvement. I believe that over time, whether through a vaccine or other mitigants, the travel industry will recover, and Loews Hotels will once again be a growth engine for Loews.
One last thought on hotels. As I mentioned, the market currently values our privately held subsidiaries at about $500 million. We make available on the parent company website, Loews Hotels' adjusted EBITDA and adjusted mortgage debt. When looking at these numbers, however, keep in mind that the hotel company has invested equity in projects that have recently opened or have yet to open. And the true earning power of these hotels has never been reflected in Loews Hotels' historical EBITDA. It's clear that even if you did a back of the envelope valuation for Loews Hotels, you would see that in any sort of hotel industry recovery, the equity we have in Loews Hotels would be measured in the billions of dollars. 
Before getting to CNA, let me address our privately held subsidiary, Altium. Altium became a Loews' subsidiary in 2017. At the time, Loews paid $1.2 billion for Altium, consisting of $600 million in equity and $600 million in subsidiary debt. When we acquired the company, Altium's net sales were about $800 million. Now Altium's net sales have grown to about $1 billion, driven mostly by 6 accretive acquisitions funded with internally generated cash flow and additional debt at the subsidiary level. With everything we are seeing, we think this will be a good year for Altium as year-to-date organic EBITDA has grown by about 13% and total EBITDA has grown about 35%. Judging from the increase in sales and improved earnings, it's clear that our equity value in Altium is worth more than what we paid for it a few years ago.
After the survey of our privately held subsidiaries and the description of how we think about each of them, hopefully, you will understand why I feel the market is asleep at the switch when it comes to Loews' stock.
Last, but certainly not least, I want to talk about our publicly held subsidiary, CNA. So far, I have focused my remarks on how wrong the market has been in valuing our privately held subsidiaries. But that doesn't mean the market has gotten CNA's valuation right. CNA trades at a substantial discount to its peers despite its stellar underwriting performance and while CNA trades at a discount, I believe the commercial property and casualty insurance industry itself is undervalued by the market. While the S&P trades at around 20x next year's earnings, the commercial P&C industry trades in the high single to low double digits. In a show of support for CNA and its management team, and to signal our displeasure with the market's valuation of the company, Loews bought about 0.5 million shares of CNA in the second quarter. 
And speaking of the second quarter, I want to take a moment to commend CNA's management team on delivering strong underlying results, especially considering the challenging economic environment. When you strip out all the noise in the quarter, the company's underlying combined ratio was 93.4%. CNA continues to benefit from a strong premium rate environment. Rates increased by 3 percentage points from the first quarter of 2020 to about 11% in the second quarter, and the company is actively managing its long-term care business, taking actions to reduce risk now and into the future.
CNA's portfolio -- investment portfolio also had a good quarter, reflecting the market's rebound. The CNA investment portfolio had $4.4 billion in unrealized gains. At the end of the second quarter, the portfolio had bounced back nicely. And its unrealized gain was near its prior high. The downside of such large unrealized gains is that the market yields are low. The yield on 10-year treasury notes is currently below 60 basis points for entities like insurance companies that make money on float, such low rates can become a drag on earnings. All else being equal, a 100 basis point increase in market yields would reduce CNA's unrealized gains by about $2.7 billion. However, investment income would go up dramatically. In short, CNA would have lower unrealized gains but would have higher earnings in the intermediate to long term.
Finally, I want to talk about capital allocation at Loews. Over the last quarter, we bought a little under 1 million shares of Loews' stock, and as I mentioned, about 0.5 million shares of CNA. We bought the CNA shares because we wanted to send a signal to the market that we think the company is trading at too steep a discount. With over $3.6 billion in cash and investments on our balance sheet, we are willing to continue to highlight how egregiously our shares and CNA shares are being priced. That means that share repurchases are certainly not off the table, but we won't be buying in shares at the pace set over the last 2 years. Right now, as we experience so much uncertainty in the world and the financial markets, our focus is on maintaining a substantial cash position as our rainy day fund. At Loews, we are constantly reevaluating our capital allocation strategy and making adjustments accordingly. And 2020 is no different. And now I'd like to hand the call over to our CFO, David Edelson."
285930,677292115,2067520,"Loews Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2020",2020-08-03,"Earnings Calls","Loews Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. For the second quarter, Loews reported a net loss of $835 million or $2.96 per share compared to net income of $249 million or $0.82 per share in last year's second quarter. This year's second quarter included a",1360,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. For the second quarter, Loews reported a net loss of $835 million or $2.96 per share compared to net income of $249 million or $0.82 per share in last year's second quarter. This year's second quarter included a net investment loss related to the deconsolidation of Diamond Offshore, caused by its bankruptcy filing in late April. This loss totaled $957 million after tax. Two other items furthered the year-over-year decline: catastrophe losses at CNA and losses at Loews hotels stemming from the severe impact of the pandemic on travel. On a positive note, CNA's underlying underwriting results were excellent, investment results were favorable at both CNA and the parent company and operations at both Boardwalk Pipelines and Altium Packaging were strong.
Before I jump into the quarter and the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, let me remind you what gave rise to the Diamond-related net investment loss. Up to the bankruptcy filing date of April 26, we accounted for Diamond on a consolidated basis, just as we have historically. These results are shown on Page 4 of our earnings release on the Diamond Offshore line. Once Diamond filed for bankruptcy, Loews no longer controlled Diamond for GAAP purposes. As such, we ceased consolidating Diamond and began accounting for Diamond at fair value. Our net GAAP carrying value of Diamond was $988 million as of the bankruptcy date. At quarter end, the carrying value of our stake was $31 million based on the fair value of our shares and a related deferred tax asset. The difference between these 2 values or $957 million is included in the corporate segment as a net investment loss. 
Now let me turn to the performance of CNA, Boardwalk, Loews Hotels and Altium Packaging. CNA's contribution to our net income declined 46% year-over-year to $135 million. The P&C business performed well, posting an underlying combined ratio of 93.4% and an average rate increase of almost 11%. As a reminder, CNA's underlying combined ratio for full year 2019 was 1.4 points higher at 94.8%. However, as preannounced on July 15, CNA booked $300 million of pretax -- $301 million of pretax catastrophe losses in Q2, up from $38 million in last year's second quarter. 60% of these cat losses related to the COVID-19 pandemic with civil unrest and weather-related events, accounting for about 20% each. CNA's $182 million of Q2 COVID-related cat losses combined with the $13 million booked in Q1, represent the company's current best estimate of its ultimate insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses, including defense costs, resulting from the pandemic and the consequent economic crisis. Second quarter cat losses in total added 17.5 points to CNA's loss ratio and reduced our net income by $212 million.
Last quarter, we discussed how COVID-induced volatility in the financial markets reduced CNA's net investment income, caused significant net investment losses and materially shrunk the unrealized gain in the company's investment portfolio. In Q2, net investment income benefited from a strong quarter for equities and alternatives, and net investment gains were significant, largely thanks to the market appreciation on CNA's holdings of nonredeemable preferred stock. Moreover, as Jim described, CNA's net unrealized gain increased more than 100% from March 31 to $4.4 billion, surpassing the year-end level of $4.1 billion.
Moving on to Boardwalk. The company contributed $34 million to our net income in Q2, down from $53 million last year. Last year's second quarter included a $19 million net benefit from a customer bankruptcy and related contract cancellation. Excluding this nonrecurring item, Boardwalk's net income contribution was flat year-over-year. As we have discussed previously, Boardwalk has experienced contract expirations and restructurings over the past few years related to pipelines placed into service between 2008 and 2010. The net effect has been for contracts to be renewed or replaced at lower rates. This recontracting activity essentially concluded by year-end 2019. This year's second quarter results fully reflect the recontracting activity.
Net operating revenues in Q2, excluding last year's nonrecurring item, was down less than 2% year-over-year with pipeline growth projects, parking loan and storage and other items, almost fully offsetting the revenue loss from contract expirations and restructurings. Natural gas throughput and liquid volumes increased more than 7% year-to-date in 2020 versus 2019. 
Boardwalk management is actively monitoring the credit quality of its customers, given the declines in crude oil and natural gas prices. Thus far, the impact has been de minimis. Boardwalk will have spent approximately $2 billion on growth projects during the 2016 to 2020 period. These investments have helped the company compensate for the recontracting pressures faced over the last few years. These investments have also allowed the company to execute on its strategy to diversify its revenue stream by increasing the percent of revenues coming from end-user demand pull customers.
Now turning to Loews Hotels. The second quarter was tough for Loews Hotels as almost all its rooms were out of service for most of the quarter. Operations were not suspended at only 4 properties. The company posted a net loss of $72 million in Q2 as compared to net income of $12 million last year. GAAP operating revenue was just $9 million, down 94% from last year's second quarter. Revenue at the company's JV properties, which is not included in GAAP consolidated operating revenue, declined a similar percentage. Adjusted EBITDA, which is defined in our earnings supplement and excludes nonrecurring items, decreased $122 million year-over-year to a loss of $54 million. 13 properties resumed operations in Q2, spread out from May 29 through June 26 and the Loews, Kansas City opened on June 1 after its grand opening was delayed by COVID. 5 more properties resumed operations during July. As of today, 4 properties plus the yet to be opened Endless Summer dockside property in Orlando are not operational. 
We stated last quarter that during each month of suspended operation -- of fully suspended operations, the hotel company was expected to generate negative cash flow of about $25 million. We explained that this amount should decline as properties resume operations since Loews Hotels' management intended to restart operations at properties only when doing so improve cash flow. This has thus far proven to be the case as the hotel company is effectively and aggressively managing property level and management company expenses.
Turning to Altium Packaging. Altium continued to experience strong revenue and EBITDA growth as it benefited from its recent acquisitions, namely its pharmaceutical packaging business as well as increased demand for such core products as household chemicals, water and beverages. Conversely, demand weakened somewhat in segments, including automotive, commercial food service and institutional dairy. 
Altium contributed a slight net loss despite its robust EBITDA increase. Depreciation and amortization were up from the prior year, driven by the recent acquisitions and by the accelerated amortization of the CCC trade name. All in all, Altium is performing above plan and has been very successful in winning new business by demonstrating reliability and customer focus. 
Across the board, we remain focused on ensuring that our subsidiaries implement effective policies and procedures to protect the safety and health of their employees. Loews' long-term success rests on the success of our subsidiaries, so the well-being of their employees is our foremost concern.
Finally, a few words about the parent company. As always, we are focused on maintaining a strong and highly liquid balance sheet. At quarter end, the parent company portfolio of cash and investments totaled $3.6 billion, with about 80% in cash and equivalents and the remainder mainly in marketable equity securities and a small portfolio of limited partnership investments. The parent company investment portfolio generated pretax income of $110 million in Q2, up from $33 million in Q2 2019 and well ahead of the $166 million loss in Q1. Equities drove the parent company investment results. We received $90 million in dividends from CNA during the second quarter. As a reminder, Boardwalk has adopted an annual dividend policy, and we respect -- and we expect to receive a dividend in the fourth quarter approximating last year's $100 million.
I will now hand the call back to Mary."

And those outweigh what I consider to be the short-term problem of the undervaluation. Number one, it's important to regulators and credit rating agencies. It's important for attracting talent to be able to give them long-term incentive that is based on the stock. And it's also important just for transparency. And as for the added expense of keeping CNA public in the context of the size of Loews and of CNA, there really aren't any significant expenses that could be saved."

Currently, we're seeing more of a pickup in driving leisure type travel at our resorts, destinations. The business travel and hotels and city centers are lagging the resorts at this point in time. My guess is that this will persist for some time as companies weigh employee safety and security as well as reassess their travel budgets. But I believe that in the fullness of time, those -- that travel and those budgets will be -- come back at similar levels to where they were before this all began. 
Keep in mind that we're seeing a pickup in occupancy from a few months ago, but occupancy is still very, very low, measured at 10%, 20%, 30% or 40% most of the time. We've opened the hotels because we found that we lose less cash by keeping those hotels open rather than keeping them closed. But we are still losing money in those hotels."

The Loews rating provides an uplift to some of our subsidiary ratings, giving them, among other things, access to cheaper debt. So under exceptional circumstances, we would certainly consider allowing our cash and our investment balances to go below our debt levels, but buying in Loews shares at an exceptional price isn't yet included in my definition of an exceptional circumstance. Currently, given the ongoing uncertainty in the world, we think it may take -- it makes a lot of sense to be cautious and maintain ample liquidity. But as Loews' shares continue to be remarkably undervalued, my calculus on this is very possible to change."

And as I said previously, nothing has occurred in the performance of the company that would lead us to reconsider that purchase at all. Prior to the COVID pandemic, evaluation of our hotel business was measured in the billions of dollars, and I still feel comfortable that in the recovery from the pandemic, which I see coming certainly in the next year or so, we will see that valuation again. And finally, our equity check for Altium was $600 million, as I said in my remarks. And due to the good results and the good investments at Altium, I believe the valuation should be higher now. So when you add all that up, in my mind, the market valuation of $500 million for all of our nonpublicly-traded subsidiaries is to me ludicrous when they are clearly worth dramatically more than that."

Rather than getting into specifics about the quarter, I want to use this call today as an opportunity to get something off my chest. I am beyond frustrated with where the -- where the stock market has been pricing Loews and CNA, and I can't believe how undervalued the stocks are. 
Loews' market capitalization as of this morning is about $9.8 billion, and our stake in CNA plus net cash alone account for more than $9.4 billion of that number. That leaves the market's valuation of our nonpublicly traded subsidiaries, Boardwalk, Loews Hotels and Altium at less than $500 million, which, to my mind, is patently absurd. I also think CNA's value is patently absurd, but more on that later. 
Let's look at each of Loews' privately held subsidiaries to see if I can demonstrate to you that collectively, they are worth dramatically more than $500 million. First, let's look at Boardwalk pipeline. In July of 2018, Loews purchased the outstanding common units of Boardwalk that we didn't already own for $1.5 billion, putting the total equity value of Loews' ownership stake in Boardwalk at $3 billion. Keep in mind that Loews is in litigation over Boardwalk with a trial date set for January of 2021. So we can't get into too much detail. However, since the time of our purchase of Boardwalk's remaining public float, nothing has occurred with the performance of the company that would lead us to reconsider that purchase. 
Boardwalk has successfully made it through the challenge of recontracting, and since going private, has reinvested a majority of its distributable cash flow in order to reduce the risk and volatility of future earnings. And since July of 2018, EBITDA for the business is essentially flat despite the significant recontracting headwinds the company has experienced. While future growth projects have become more difficult to complete in the current regulatory environment, Boardwalk benefits from its base of 14,000 miles of pipe in the ground. Boardwalk also benefits from stable fixed-fee contracts. The company has over $9 billion of contractual backlog or 7x Boardwalk's annual revenues. Essentially, I'm comfortable with the guidance I gave last quarter for Boardwalk. The company is currently tracking slightly better than forecast for the first half of the year. Its flow volumes are up, the pipes are doing well and storage revenues are strong. At the end of 2020, Boardwalk should continue to have a debt-to-EBITDA ratio below 5x. 
For all the reasons I've just outlined, I'm very disappointed by the market's implied value of Boardwalk. Clearly, the company is worth much more than the market gives us credit for.
Next, let's take a look at Loews Hotels. At the risk of stating the obvious, this year will be a washout for the entire hotel and travel industry, and Loews Hotels is no exception to the rule. During my first quarter remarks, I made note of the fact that there were only 4 Loews Hotels open at the time. Today, many more of our hotels are operational, but occupancy rates remain abysmally low, especially for our properties located in city centers. Our resort hotels are doing a bit better. But since many of them are located in COVID hotspots, there's plenty of room for improvement. I believe that over time, whether through a vaccine or other mitigants, the travel industry will recover, and Loews Hotels will once again be a growth engine for Loews.
One last thought on hotels. As I mentioned, the market currently values our privately held subsidiaries at about $500 million. We make available on the parent company website, Loews Hotels' adjusted EBITDA and adjusted mortgage debt. When looking at these numbers, however, keep in mind that the hotel company has invested equity in projects that have recently opened or have yet to open. And the true earning power of these hotels has never been reflected in Loews Hotels' historical EBITDA. It's clear that even if you did a back of the envelope valuation for Loews Hotels, you would see that in any sort of hotel industry recovery, the equity we have in Loews Hotels would be measured in the billions of dollars. 
Before getting to CNA, let me address our privately held subsidiary, Altium. Altium became a Loews' subsidiary in 2017. At the time, Loews paid $1.2 billion for Altium, consisting of $600 million in equity and $600 million in subsidiary debt. When we acquired the company, Altium's net sales were about $800 million. Now Altium's net sales have grown to about $1 billion, driven mostly by 6 accretive acquisitions funded with internally generated cash flow and additional debt at the subsidiary level. With everything we are seeing, we think this will be a good year for Altium as year-to-date organic EBITDA has grown by about 13% and total EBITDA has grown about 35%. Judging from the increase in sales and improved earnings, it's clear that our equity value in Altium is worth more than what we paid for it a few years ago.
After the survey of our privately held subsidiaries and the description of how we think about each of them, hopefully, you will understand why I feel the market is asleep at the switch when it comes to Loews' stock.
Last, but certainly not least, I want to talk about our publicly held subsidiary, CNA. So far, I have focused my remarks on how wrong the market has been in valuing our privately held subsidiaries. But that doesn't mean the market has gotten CNA's valuation right. CNA trades at a substantial discount to its peers despite its stellar underwriting performance and while CNA trades at a discount, I believe the commercial property and casualty insurance industry itself is undervalued by the market. While the S&P trades at around 20x next year's earnings, the commercial P&C industry trades in the high single to low double digits. In a show of support for CNA and its management team, and to signal our displeasure with the market's valuation of the company, Loews bought about 0.5 million shares of CNA in the second quarter. 
And speaking of the second quarter, I want to take a moment to commend CNA's management team on delivering strong underlying results, especially considering the challenging economic environment. When you strip out all the noise in the quarter, the company's underlying combined ratio was 93.4%. CNA continues to benefit from a strong premium rate environment. Rates increased by 3 percentage points from the first quarter of 2020 to about 11% in the second quarter, and the company is actively managing its long-term care business, taking actions to reduce risk now and into the future.
CNA's portfolio -- investment portfolio also had a good quarter, reflecting the market's rebound. The CNA investment portfolio had $4.4 billion in unrealized gains. At the end of the second quarter, the portfolio had bounced back nicely. And its unrealized gain was near its prior high. The downside of such large unrealized gains is that the market yields are low. The yield on 10-year treasury notes is currently below 60 basis points for entities like insurance companies that make money on float, such low rates can become a drag on earnings. All else being equal, a 100 basis point increase in market yields would reduce CNA's unrealized gains by about $2.7 billion. However, investment income would go up dramatically. In short, CNA would have lower unrealized gains but would have higher earnings in the intermediate to long term.
Finally, I want to talk about capital allocation at Loews. Over the last quarter, we bought a little under 1 million shares of Loews' stock, and as I mentioned, about 0.5 million shares of CNA. We bought the CNA shares because we wanted to send a signal to the market that we think the company is trading at too steep a discount. With over $3.6 billion in cash and investments on our balance sheet, we are willing to continue to highlight how egregiously our shares and CNA shares are being priced. That means that share repurchases are certainly not off the table, but we won't be buying in shares at the pace set over the last 2 years. Right now, as we experience so much uncertainty in the world and the financial markets, our focus is on maintaining a substantial cash position as our rainy day fund. At Loews, we are constantly reevaluating our capital allocation strategy and making adjustments accordingly. And 2020 is no different. And now I'd like to hand the call over to our CFO, David Edelson."
285930,677292115,2071221,"Loews Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2020",2020-08-03,"Earnings Calls","Loews Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. For the second quarter, Loews reported a net loss of $835 million or $2.96 per share compared to net income of $249 million or $0.82 per share in last year's second quarter. This year's second quarter included a",1358,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. For the second quarter, Loews reported a net loss of $835 million or $2.96 per share compared to net income of $249 million or $0.82 per share in last year's second quarter. This year's second quarter included a net investment loss related to the deconsolidation of Diamond Offshore, caused by its bankruptcy filing in late April. This loss totaled $957 million after tax. Two other items furthered the year-over-year decline: catastrophe losses at CNA and losses at Loews hotels stemming from the severe impact of the pandemic on travel. On a positive note, CNA's underlying underwriting results were excellent, investment results were favorable at both CNA and the parent company and operations at both Boardwalk Pipelines and Altium Packaging were strong.
Before I jump into the quarter and the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, let me remind you what gave rise to the Diamond-related net investment loss. Up to the bankruptcy filing date of April 26, we accounted for Diamond on a consolidated basis, just as we have historically. These results are shown on Page 4 of our earnings release on the Diamond Offshore line. Once Diamond filed for bankruptcy, Loews no longer controlled Diamond for GAAP purposes. As such, we ceased consolidating Diamond and began accounting for Diamond at fair value. Our net GAAP carrying value of Diamond was $988 million as of the bankruptcy date. At quarter end, the carrying value of our stake was $31 million based on the fair value of our shares and a related deferred tax asset. The difference between these 2 values or $957 million is included in the corporate segment as a net investment loss. 
Now let me turn to the performance of CNA, Boardwalk, Loews Hotels and Altium Packaging. CNA's contribution to our net income declined 46% year-over-year to $135 million. The P&C business performed well, posting an underlying combined ratio of 93.4% and an average rate increase of almost 11%. As a reminder, CNA's underlying combined ratio for full year 2019 was 1.4 points higher at 94.8%. However, as preannounced on July 15, CNA booked $300 million of pretax -- $301 million of pretax catastrophe losses in Q2, up from $38 million in last year's second quarter. 60% of these cat losses related to the COVID-19 pandemic with civil unrest and weather-related events, accounting for about 20% each. CNA's $182 million of Q2 COVID-related cat losses combined with the $13 million booked in Q1, represent the company's current best estimate of its ultimate insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses, including defense costs, resulting from the pandemic and the consequent economic crisis. Second quarter cat losses in total added 17.5 points to CNA's loss ratio and reduced our net income by $212 million.
Last quarter, we discussed how COVID-induced volatility in the financial markets reduced CNA's net investment income, caused significant net investment losses and materially shrunk the unrealized gain in the company's investment portfolio. In Q2, net investment income benefited from a strong quarter for equities and alternatives, and net investment gains were significant, largely thanks to the market appreciation on CNA's holdings of nonredeemable preferred stock. Moreover, as Jim described, CNA's net unrealized gain increased more than 100% from March 31 to $4.4 billion, surpassing the year-end level of $4.1 billion.
Moving on to Boardwalk. The company contributed $34 million to our net income in Q2, down from $53 million last year. Last year's second quarter included a $19 million net benefit from a customer bankruptcy and related contract cancellation. Excluding this nonrecurring item, Boardwalk's net income contribution was flat year-over-year. As we have discussed previously, Boardwalk has experienced contract expirations and restructurings over the past few years related to pipelines placed into service between 2008 and 2010. The net effect has been for contracts to be renewed or replaced at lower rates. This recontracting activity essentially concluded by year-end 2019. This year's second quarter results fully reflect the recontracting activity.
Net operating revenues in Q2, excluding last year's nonrecurring item, was down less than 2% year-over-year with pipeline growth projects, parking loan and storage and other items, almost fully offsetting the revenue loss from contract expirations and restructurings. Natural gas throughput and liquid volumes increased more than 7% year-to-date in 2020 versus 2019. 
Boardwalk management is actively monitoring the credit quality of its customers, given the declines in crude oil and natural gas prices. Thus far, the impact has been de minimis. Boardwalk will have spent approximately $2 billion on growth projects during the 2016 to 2020 period. These investments have helped the company compensate for the recontracting pressures faced over the last few years. These investments have also allowed the company to execute on its strategy to diversify its revenue stream by increasing the percent of revenues coming from end-user demand-pull customers.
Now turning to Loews Hotels. The second quarter was tough for Loews Hotels as almost all its rooms were out of service for most of the quarter. Operations were not suspended at only 4 properties. The company posted a net loss of $72 million in Q2 as compared to net income of $12 million last year. GAAP operating revenue was just $9 million, down 94% from last year's second quarter. Revenue at the company's JV properties, which is not included in GAAP consolidated operating revenue, declined a similar percentage. Adjusted EBITDA, which is defined in our earnings supplement and excludes nonrecurring items, decreased $122 million year-over-year to a loss of $54 million. 13 properties resumed operations in Q2, spread out from May 29 through June 26 and the Loews, Kansas City opened on June 1 after its grand opening was delayed by COVID. 5 more properties resumed operations during July. As of today, 4 properties plus the yet to be opened Endless Summer dockside property in Orlando are not operational. 
We stated last quarter that during each month of suspended operation -- of fully suspended operations, the hotel company was expected to generate negative cash flow of about $25 million. We explained that this amount should decline as properties resume operations since Loews Hotels' management intended to restart operations at properties only when doing so improve cash flow. This has thus far proven to be the case as the hotel company is effectively and aggressively managing property level and management company expenses.
Turning to Altium Packaging. Altium continued to experience strong revenue and EBITDA growth as it benefited from its recent acquisitions, namely its pharmaceutical packaging business as well as increased demand for such core products as household chemicals, water and beverages. Conversely, demand weakened somewhat in segments, including automotive, commercial foodservice and institutional dairy. 
Altium contributed a slight net loss despite its robust EBITDA increase. Depreciation and amortization were up from the prior year, driven by the recent acquisitions and by the accelerated amortization of the CCC trade name. All in all, Altium is performing above plan and has been very successful in winning new business by demonstrating reliability and customer focus. 
Across the board, we remain focused on ensuring that our subsidiaries implement effective policies and procedures to protect the safety and health of their employees. Loews' long-term success rests on the success of our subsidiaries, so the well-being of their employees is our foremost concern.
Finally, a few words about the parent company. As always, we are focused on maintaining a strong and highly liquid balance sheet. At quarter end, the parent company portfolio of cash and investments totaled $3.6 billion, with about 80% in cash and equivalents and the remainder mainly in marketable equity securities and a small portfolio of limited partnership investments. The parent company investment portfolio generated pretax income of $110 million in Q2, up from $33 million in Q2 2019 and well ahead of the $166 million loss in Q1. Equities drove the parent company investment results. We received $90 million in dividends from CNA during the second quarter. As a reminder, Boardwalk has adopted an annual dividend policy, and we respect -- and we expect to receive a dividend in the fourth quarter approximating last year's $100 million.
I will now hand the call back to Mary."

And I dare say that if CNA wasn't public, they would be clamoring for us to take it public. However, it's really rare for CNA to be trading as drastically undervalued as it is now. The public -- my sense is that the public market today doesn't make much sense and is certainly not an accurate reflection of the value of CNA. Also, all P&C companies, as I said in my remarks, are undervalued. Of course, there are lots of good reasons for keeping CNA as a public company. And those outweigh what I consider to be the short-term problem of the undervaluation. Number one, it's important to regulators and credit rating agencies. It's important for attracting talent to be able to give them long-term incentive that is based on the stock. And it's also important just for transparency. And as for the added expense of keeping CNA public in the context of the size of Loews and of CNA, there really aren't any significant expenses that could be saved."

Currently, we're seeing more of a pickup in driving leisure type travel at our resorts, destinations. The business travel and hotels and city centers are lagging the resorts at this point in time. My guess is that this will persist for some time as companies weigh employee safety and security as well as reassess their travel budgets. But I believe that in the fullness of time, those -- that travel and those budgets will be -- come back at similar levels to where they were before this all began. 
Keep in mind that we're seeing a pickup in occupancy from a few months ago, but occupancy is still very, very low, measured at 10%, 20%, 30% or 40% most of the time. We've opened the hotels because we found that we lose less cash by keeping those hotels open rather than keeping them closed. But we are still losing money in those hotels."

So under exceptional circumstances, we would certainly consider allowing our cash and our investment balances to go below our debt levels, but buying in Loews shares at an exceptional price isn't yet included in my definition of an exceptional circumstance. Currently, given the ongoing uncertainty in the world, we think it may take -- it makes a lot of sense to be cautious and maintain ample liquidity.

And as I said previously, nothing has occurred in the performance of the company that would lead us to reconsider that purchase at all. Prior to the COVID pandemic, evaluation of our hotel business was measured in the billions of dollars, and I still feel comfortable that in the recovery from the pandemic, which I see coming certainly in the next year or so, we will see that valuation again. And finally, our equity check for Altium was $600 million, as I said in my remarks. And due to the good results and the good investments at Altium, I believe the valuation should be higher now. So when you add all that up, in my mind, the market valuation of $500 million for all of our nonpublicly traded subsidiaries is to me ludicrous when they are clearly worth dramatically more than that."

285930,692464340,2125893,"Loews Corporation, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2020",2020-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Loews Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Mary, and good morning. Let me start by focusing on capital allocation, specifically, share buybacks. During our second quarter conference call, I emphatically stated my strong belief that the market was significantly undervaluing Loews' shares",893,"Thank you, Mary, and good morning. Let me start by focusing on capital allocation, specifically, share buybacks. During our second quarter conference call, I emphatically stated my strong belief that the market was significantly undervaluing Loews' shares. I also stated that while Loews plans to maintain a substantial liquidity position as our rainy day fund, we also would take advantage of the market's discount and continue to buy back our stock. 
During the third quarter, we did just that, purchasing over 5.4 million shares of Loews for about $195 million while preserving ample liquidity and ending the quarter with about $3.5 billion in cash and investments. Maintaining high levels of liquidity is fundamental to our business model because it lets us both capture opportunity and withstand uncertainty. And like any portfolio manager, we have to balance retaining our liquidity with taking advantage of investment opportunities as they arise. 
Buying back shares is 1 of Loews' 3 capital allocation tools, with the other 2 being investing in our subsidiaries and buying another business. With our stock trading considerably below our view of its intrinsic value, share repurchases have recently been our most attractive capital allocation option. 
That being said, our decision to buy back stock has not come at the expense of any of our subsidiaries. For example, we have provided capital to Loews Hotels to help it ride out the effects of COVID on the hospitality industry. Our 3 other subsidiaries, CNA, Boardwalk and Altium Packaging, have not recently required parent company capital. Instead, Boardwalk and Altium have largely used their free cash flow to finance growth opportunities and CNA has chosen to pay dividends since it hasn't had a need for additional capital. As Mary mentioned, during the Q&A, we will be discussing topics submitted by our shareholders. However, I did want to highlight 2 key items upfront: CNA's long-term care business and the situation at Loews Hotels. 
Starting with CNA. Before we got into long-term care, let me emphasize that CNA's underlying property casualty underwriting performance for the quarter was stellar. The company had an underlying combined ratio of 92.6 compared with 94.6 in last year's third quarter due to improved loss and expense ratios. Property and casualty pricing momentum continues, with rates increasing over 12% in the third quarter compared to an increase of just under 6% for the same period last year. 
With respect to long-term care, [ my guess is ] that CNA's long-term care exposure is a significant reason why CNA's valuation lags its peers. We at Loews are comfortable with the reserves that CNA has set up for long-term care. The company has been proactive in managing their long-term care book of business and prudent in their approach to setting LTC reserves. 
In the third quarter, CNA took an LTC net reserve charge of $37 million before tax, comprising a $74 million active life reserve deficiency, offset by a $37 million claim reserve release. The active life reserve deficiency resulted from the continued low interest rate environment and its impact on future assumed reinvestment rates. In my opinion, CNA is taking a conservative view on future interest rates, which hopefully means that they will not have to adjust for lower interest rates again going forward. 
Since the end of 2015, CNA's overall exposure to long-term care has been reduced by 31% with a number of active policies declining from 419,000 to 288,000. 
So why are we so confident in CNA's management of long-term care, even in the face of the market skepticism? Because we know that over the past 7 years, CNA has been laser-focused and immersed in their long-term care book of business. For the 6 years prior to becoming CNA's Chief Financial Officer, [ Al Morales ] was Head of long-term care at the company. Al did an outstanding job mitigating the LTC risk for CNA, and the team in place today continues to do so. CNA has managed more than 100,000 long-term care claims to date, providing CNA with reliable claims experience across all policy types and age cohorts. 
CNA reviews its long-term care reserves in the third quarter of every year, and they post significant information regarding their review on the CNA website. If you have not already done so, please take a look at the information that they make available. 
Now for the second topic I want to cover: Loews Hotels. The fallout from the COVID pandemic continues to negatively affect the travel and tourism industry, and Loews Hotels is no exception. 
We believe and hope that the second quarter was the bottom for the hotel industry, and we have seen business pick up at Loews Hotels since then. While occupancy rates are still low by any historical standard, 21 of Loews Hotels 27 properties had resumed operations by the end of the third quarter. The resumption of operations, combined with significant expense controls enacted by Loews Hotels management, have improved the company's cash flow situation. When the pandemic struck and Loews Hotels substantially suspended operations, we estimated that the company would generate negative cash flow of approximately $25 million per month. While still negative, Loews Hotels' cash flow is much improved. Going forward, we do not expect Loews Hotels' cash needs to be material to Loews corporation's balance sheet. 
And with that, let me turn the call over to David."
285930,692464340,2125893,"Loews Corporation, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2020",2020-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Loews Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. For the third quarter, Loews reported net income of $139 million or $0.50 per share up from $72 million or $0.24 per share in last year's third quarter. The quarterly increase was driven by CNA, whose net income",1116,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. For the third quarter, Loews reported net income of $139 million or $0.50 per share up from $72 million or $0.24 per share in last year's third quarter. The quarterly increase was driven by CNA, whose net income contribution doubled to $192 million. 
Let me provide some brief highlights on CNA's quarter. For more details, we encourage you to review the transcript from the company's investor call earlier this morning. The year-over-year earnings increase at CNA was driven by 2 main factors: one, lower net reserve charges in CNA's life and group business associated with the long-term care and structured settlement businesses; and two, higher net investment income and net investment gains. 
As Jim mentioned, CNA's core property casualty business posted robust premium growth and strong underlying profitability in the quarter. However, total P&C underwriting results declined from Q3 2019 because of higher weather-related catastrophe losses. Catastrophe losses for the entire U.S. property casualty industry were elevated during the quarter, led by 3 hurricanes [ and ] the Midwest Derecho. The western wildfires were also an industry event but had little impact on CNA. 
Before leaving CNA, I would draw your attention to the company's rock-solid investment portfolio, which at quarter end had a market value of $49 billion, an average credit rating of single A and a net unrealized gain of $5 billion. About 94% of CNA's fixed maturity investment portfolio is investment grade. Again, please see CNA's transcript and shareholder materials for more details. Even though Diamond Offshore ceased being a consolidated subsidiary of Loews in this year's second quarter, that helped drive our third quarter year-over-year earnings increase. 
During last year's third quarter, Diamond contributed a net loss of $48 million. While this year, Diamond's results were no longer included in our consolidated net income. 
Let me now turn to our wholly owned subsidiaries, Boardwalk, Loews Hotels and Altium Packaging. Boardwalk's net income contribution declined from $29 million in the prior year to $20 million. The company generated quarterly EBITDA of $167 million versus $175 million last year. Net operating revenues were down slightly. Expiring natural gas transportation contracts were recontracted at lower rates, which was expected and planned for. 
Revenues from growth projects recently placed in service, together with storage and parking and lending revenues, offset much, but not all of the decline. As a reminder, Boardwalk has experienced contract expirations and restructurings over the past few years related to pipelines placed into service 10 to 12 years ago. This recontracting activity essentially concluded by year-end 2019. 
Boardwalk's increased asset base from its growth projects led to an increase in expenses, especially higher depreciation and property taxes. Additionally, the expiration of property tax abatements contributed to the year-over-year increase in expenses. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic and significant hurricane activity along the Gulf Coast, Boardwalk's operations were minimally disrupted during the quarter, and the overall financial impact was negligible. The hurricanes and resulting power disruptions did impact certain customers, but the revenue impact of these disruptions on Boardwalk was immaterial. 
Let me highlight that both CNA and Boardwalk took advantage of the robust fixed income market in Q3 to raise money at attractive rates. Both companies issued $500 million of 10-year notes with CNA's yielding 2.08% and Boardwalk's 3.41%. Both deals were vastly oversubscribed and reflected investors' confidence in their respective credits. 
Jim already spoke about Loews Hotel, so I will be brief. The business reported a net loss of $47 million in the quarter. Excluding unusual items, the net loss was $55 million. Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes unusual items and includes Loews Hotels pro rata share of EBITDA in JV properties, was a loss of $38 million. Loews Hotels management is focused on 2 interrelated objectives: one, reducing the cash flow drag; and two, resuming operations judiciously and effectively. 
The company has aggressively reduced expenses, rightsized its capital spend and worked with lenders to defer interest and principal paydowns. It is reopening properties when management projects that doing so will improve cash flow. As Jim mentioned, we believe that Loews Hotels turned the corner in Q2 and is on an upward trajectory. The average monthly cash flow drag is well below the $25 million we estimated during our Q1 earnings call. The exact timing of a return to profitability and positive operating cash flow, however, depends on the overall travel environment. But we believe Loews Hotels properties, such as those in Orlando, Arlington, Texas and Miami Beach, are especially well positioned to participate in the travel upswing that has already begun. 
Altium packaging, which is included in Corporate and other, had another good quarter. Demand for the company's products continue to be strong overall, higher on COVID-19-related product segments, such as household chemicals, beverages and personal care and somewhat weaker in segments such as automotive, commercial foodservice and school dairy. 
Moreover, Envision, which is the company's recycling business has been experiencing its best performance since it was acquired by Altium in 2014. Driving this performance has been stronger demand for recycled plastic, also known as post-consumer resin. Altium contributed a slight net loss despite its robust EBITDA. I would highlight 3 factors depressing net income: one, significant depreciation and amortization expense attributable to the company's recent acquisitions; two, accelerated amortization of the consolidated container trade name, which will be fully amortized by the end of the year; and three, the effect of rising resin prices in Q3. 
Since there is a contractual lag in Altium's ability to pass-through these costs to customers, the company absorbed the cost in the quarter without recognizing the offsetting revenue. This lag is temporary and will reverse as the costs are passed through to customers. 
Altium's focus on new business is bearing fruit and should benefit results in future periods. The company has been very successful over the past months in gaining new accounts by demonstrating reliability, continued innovation and customer focus during this difficult COVID period. 
Turning to the parent company. Pretax net investment income was $23 million, down from $36 million last year and $110 million last quarter. The year-over-year and linked quarter declines were driven by returns on equities and LP investments. During Q3 2020, we received $90 million in dividends from CNA. We expect to receive dividends from both CNA and Boardwalk during the fourth quarter. We repurchased 5.4 million shares of Loews common stock during the quarter at an aggregate cost of $195 million. We purchased an additional 667,000 shares since quarter end. 
Loews ended the quarter with $3.5 billion in parent company cash investments with cash and equivalents accounting for over 80% of the portfolio. 
Let me now turn the call back to Mary."

On a very rough basis, CNA comprises about half of the value of Loews, with the other half being our net cash, the -- our assessment of the value of Boardwalk, of LTM and our hotel business. But even beyond just being a marker, there are other reasons to keep CNA as a public company. First, being public is important to attracting top talent. The top executives want -- and top executives in any company want at least a portion of their compensation to be based on the performance of the shares of their company. And by being public, CNA [ enable ] is to provide that incentive to its top talent. Secondly, and we think this is very important, the transparency that comes from being public is important to CNA's regulators as well as to rating agencies. As everybody knows, I think that CNA trades at a ridiculously low valuation and that the P&C industry stocks likewise traded a crazy valuation. And finally, our share repurchases in our low stock allows us to take advantage of the discount valuation that CNA is trading as well as the discount in lose shares for it's non-CNA assets. That all adds up to what we like to call a very significant double discount in our year repurchases."

This has certainly been a banner year for cats and cat losses, not only for CNA, but for the industry overall. There have been only 4 quarters over the past 40 quarters where CNA has experienced net cuts coming in at or",389,"Well, Mary, you're certainly right. This has certainly been a banner year for cats and cat losses, not only for CNA, but for the industry overall. There have been only 4 quarters over the past 40 quarters where CNA has experienced net cuts coming in at or above $160 million. And 2 of those 4 quarters over the past 10 years occurred in 2020. 
At CNA, through the third quarter, our pretax cat losses were more than $530 million compared to just $128 million last year. Even if you exclude the losses for COVID and from civil unrest, which were roughly about, say, $250 million, CNA's year-to-date cat losses would still be running at more than twice last year's level and, of course, well ahead of their plan. But despite these really exceptional events and catastrophes, I'm impressed by how the P&C industry and also CNA are managing through it all. If someone had told me in January that 2020 would be filled with storms, fires, civil unrest and the pandemic, I would have told you that CNA would have a miserable year as a result. 
However, despite this litany of events, CNA is still quite profitable with $400 million of core income and $300 million of net income through the third quarter. And it continues to find profitable avenues for growth. All the more so, thanks to the hard rate market that the insurance industry is currently experiencing. Cat losses come with a territory in the property and casualty industry. And we believe that CNA is effectively managing its cat exposure while also getting strong rate increases on cat-exposed businesses. 
So let me end this by adding 1 stray thought. The insurance industry hasn't always been financially prudent. And this is the advantage of being associated with a particular industry for over 40 years. I have a little historical perspective here. There were years back in the '70s, '80s and '90s when the industry did not have true capital discipline, and they would write business at just about any price. Today, the industry is reacting to catastrophic events and low interest rates by getting rate increases where they are justified. In my view, this change is a result of an increased demand from equity investors for profitability which has led to insurance management's increased focus on capital efficiency."

As I said in my prepared remarks, CNA's long-term care exposure is likely the biggest reason why CNA's valuation lags its peers. And as I also said, for the past 7 years, CNA has been actively managing its long-term care book of business in order to reduce risk and also in order to optimize results. Since 2015, CNA's exposure to long-term care has been materially reduced with a number of active policies, declining by over 30%. And additionally, over the past few years, CNA has been able to further reduce its risk profile of its long-term care block of business by achieving meaningful premium rate increases and also offering policyholders attractive options to reduce benefits in return for reduced future premiums. 
[indiscernible] Robusto and Al Morales on their call today, focused on long-term care. And I suggest that everyone reviewed their remarks and look at the significant information on long-term care that's posted on CNA's website. Let me make 2 additional comments on the net reserve charge that CNA took in the third quarter. First, and really very significantly, a $37 million net charge on a block this size is actually quite modest. And secondly, the charge was attributable to the historically low level of [indiscernible] interest rates that we're currently experiencing. With these latest estimated changes going forward, CNA is assuming that a 10-year treasury note will trade at slightly over 1% 3 years from now. And likewise, in 2030, CNA is assuming that the 10-year note will yield, what historically is a [ poultry ], 2% and 3.75%. In my opinion, CNA is taking a very, very conservative view on future interest rates, which hopefully means that they won't have to adjust for lower interest rates again going forward."

Over the past several years, Boardwalk has focused on diversifying its customer base to include more end users, such as power plants, industrial customers and LNG off-takers, a strategy that proved beneficial this year. By diversifying in this way, Boardwalk has been able to strengthen the overall credit profile of its customer base. More than 70% of Boardwalk's revenue backlog is derived from investment-grade companies. And Boardwalk has letters of credit or other types of collateral from some of its customers that are not investment-grade or are unrated, which provide an additional measure of security. 
In 2020, in this year, 1 of Boardwalk's customers declared bankruptcy and another seems to be on the verge. Because of the credit protections in place for these customers, and importantly, the ability to remarket any return capacity, these bankruptcies will not have a material financial impact on the company. 
Stepping back, since the pandemic hit in mid-March, Boardwalk has maintained uninterrupted service to its customers while simultaneously taking measures to ensure the safety of its employees and its operations. 
At the end of the third quarter, Boardwalk had well over $9 billion in contracted revenues, with over $600 million of net new contracts added to backlog during 2020."

And Jim already commented on it, but let me just provide a little more detail. When Loews Hotels suspended operations at almost all its properties in the early spring, we estimated that negative cash flow would average around $25 million per month. We went on to say that management would reopen a property if doing so was expected to improve that property cash flow. Loews Hotels has responded to the pandemic-induced sudden downturn by transforming its operating model, including dramatically reducing property level and management company expenses. As we all know, properties began coming back online during the second quarter. 13 properties resumed operations during Q2, another 6 during Q3 and 1 more hotel last week. 
As anticipated, Loews Hotels cash flow has improved as properties have resumed operations. Expenses have been managed aggressively and capital spending has been rightsized for the current environment. While the company continues to generate negative cash flow, it is significantly less than the $25 million per month cited in April. I'd be remiss in not mentioning how difficult the past 8 months have been for Loews Hotels team members. Thousands of employees were furloughed when the pandemic truck and less than half of the furlough team members have returned to active duty. 
Early on, Loews Hotels put programs in place to assist its affected team members, including a multimillion-dollar relief fund as well as as well as continuing to provide medical insurance for furloughed employees for several months. 
Additionally, Loews Hotels has instituted enhanced safety and wellbeing standards and protocols for team members and guests. 
And as a reminder, in solidarity with all those hotels team members being financially impacted by this crisis, all 3 members of our office of the President, Jim, John and Andrew Tisch, reduced their salaries by 50% as of April 1 and their bonuses by 50% for the entire year. Back to you, Mary."

And secondly, the company is focused on developing and operating hotels for the group business. While the hotel recovery is currently powered by leisure travel, we really do believe that the corporate travel, along with meetings and events will come back as a pandemic wave. But before the pandemic hit, Loews Hotels have begun to evaluate their portfolio and to sell a few hotels that didn't align with the current growth strategy, and they continue to do so opportunistically, including 1 hotel that was sold earlier this year in Canada. At the start of this year, Loews Hotels had 3 projects under development and scheduled for opening this week -- this year. 2 of those hotels, the Live by Loews in St. Louis and the Lowe's Kansas City hotel have already opened, and the hotels are doing just fine in light of the current environment for hotels. The third hotel under development is the Thousand Room Endless Summer Dockside Inn and Suites, which is located in Universal's Orlando Theme Park. This property is in the final stage of development, and its opening date will be announced very soon. The hotel will be our eighth hotel on the Universal campus and will bring our Universal room count to nearly 9,000 rooms or just about half of the total rooms in the Loews Hotel system.

While there's been a steady increase in demand, occupancy rates still remain considerably below historic norms. That's really important. Occupancy rates are still below historic norms. The recovery is currently being led by leisure business and more than half of Loews Hotels assets fit well into that category, such as our properties on the universal Orlando campus.

I mentioned this in my remarks, but let me go over it again. Demand for the company's products has been strong overall. There are certain products that benefited from COVID actually, product segments such as household chemicals, beverages and personal care. And there are others that we're somewhat weakened by COVID. Those would include automotive, commercial, foodservice and school dairy, although I would point out that the weaker segments began to rebound in the third quarter. 2 bright spots this year for Altium are envisioned the company's recycling business and Altium health care, a business created from recent acquisitions that diversifies Altium into a growing pharmaceutical packaging market. And as I mentioned earlier, Envision has been experiencing its best performance since 2014. And as for Altium Healthcare, it's exceeding expectations due to strong synergies as well as continued progress on operational efficiencies and other savings initiatives. As a result, LTM Healthcare is ahead of plan for the year despite COVID-19. So I would say net-net, the company's overall results are running modestly above plan, a plan that was finalized pre pandemic. And I would go on to say commercially, Altium's new business efforts have been very successful over the past few months. I think the company is winning new accounts by differentiating itself by demonstrating reliability, continued innovation and customer focus during this difficult COVID period. So we hope that this focus on new business and the new business wins should benefit financial results in future periods. Back to you, Mary."

285930,692464340,2125974,"Loews Corporation, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2020",2020-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Loews Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Mary, and good morning. Let me start by focusing on capital allocation, specifically, share buybacks. During our second quarter conference call, I emphatically stated my strong belief that the market was significantly undervaluing Loews' shares",889,"Thank you, Mary, and good morning. Let me start by focusing on capital allocation, specifically, share buybacks. During our second quarter conference call, I emphatically stated my strong belief that the market was significantly undervaluing Loews' shares. I also stated that while Loews plans to maintain a substantial liquidity position as our rainy day fund, we also would take advantage of the market's discount and continue to buy back our stock. 
During the third quarter, we did just that, purchasing over 5.4 million shares of Loews for about $195 million while preserving ample liquidity and ending the quarter with about $3.5 billion in cash and investments. Maintaining high levels of liquidity is fundamental to our business model because it lets us both capture opportunity and withstand uncertainty. And like any portfolio manager, we have to balance retaining our liquidity with taking advantage of investment opportunities as they arise.
Buying back shares is one of Loews' 3 capital allocation tools, with the other 2 being investing in our subsidiaries and buying another business. With our stock trading considerably below our view of its intrinsic value, share repurchases have recently been our most attractive capital allocation option.
That being said, our decision to buy back stock has not come at the expense of any of our subsidiaries. For example, we have provided capital to Loews Hotels to help it ride out the effects of COVID on the hospitality industry. Our 3 other subsidiaries, CNA, Boardwalk and Altium Packaging, have not recently required parent company capital. Instead, Boardwalk and Altium have largely used their free cash flow to finance growth opportunities and CNA has chosen to pay dividends since it hasn't had a need for additional capital. 
As Mary mentioned, during the Q&A, we will be discussing topics submitted by our shareholders. However, I did want to highlight 2 key items upfront: CNA's long-term care business and the situation at Loews Hotels.
Starting with CNA. Before we got into long-term care, let me emphasize that CNA's underlying property casualty underwriting performance for the quarter was stellar. The company had an underlying combined ratio of 92.6 compared with 94.6 in last year's third quarter due to improved loss and expense ratios. Property and casualty pricing momentum continues, with rates increasing over 12% in the third quarter compared to an increase of just under 6% for the same period last year.
With respect to long-term care, my guess is that CNA's long-term care exposure is a significant reason why CNA's valuation lags its peers. We at Loews are comfortable with the reserves that CNA has set up for long-term care. The company has been proactive in managing their long-term care book of business and prudent in their approach to setting LTC reserves.
In the third quarter, CNA took an LTC net reserve charge of $37 million before tax, comprising a $74 million active life reserve deficiency, offset by a $37 million claim reserve release. The active life reserve deficiency resulted from the continued low interest rate environment and its impact on future assumed reinvestment rates. In my opinion, CNA is taking a conservative view on future interest rates, which hopefully means that they will not have to adjust for lower interest rates again going forward. Since the end of 2015, CNA's overall exposure to long-term care has been reduced by 31% with the number of active policies declining from 419,000 to 288,000.
So why are we so confident in CNA's management of long-term care, even in the face of the market skepticism? Because we know that over the past 7 years, CNA has been laser-focused and immersed in their long-term care book of business. For the 6 years prior to becoming CNA's Chief Financial Officer, Al Miralles was Head of Long-Term Care at the company. Al did an outstanding job mitigating the LTC risk for CNA, and the team in place today continues to do so. CNA has managed more than 100,000 long-term care claims to date, providing CNA with reliable claims experience across all policy types and age cohorts.
CNA reviews its long-term care reserves in the third quarter of every year, and they post significant information regarding their review on the CNA website. If you have not already done so, please take a look at the information that they make available.
Now for the second topic I want to cover: Loews Hotels. The fallout from the COVID pandemic continues to negatively affect the travel and tourism industry, and Loews Hotels is no exception. We believe and hope that the second quarter was the bottom for the hotel industry, and we have seen business pick up at Loews Hotels since then.
While occupancy rates are still low by any historical standard, 21 of Loews Hotels' 27 properties had resumed operations by the end of the third quarter. The resumption of operations, combined with significant expense controls enacted by Loews Hotels' management, have improved the company's cash flow situation. 
When the pandemic struck and Loews Hotels substantially suspended operations, we estimated that the company would generate negative cash flow of approximately $25 million per month. While still negative, Loews Hotels' cash flow is much improved. Going forward, we do not expect Loews Hotels' cash needs to be material to Loews Corporation's balance sheet.
And with that, let me turn the call over to David."
285930,692464340,2125974,"Loews Corporation, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2020",2020-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Loews Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. For the third quarter, Loews reported net income of $139 million or $0.50 per share up from $72 million or $0.24 per share in last year's third quarter. The quarterly increase was driven by CNA, whose net income",1117,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. For the third quarter, Loews reported net income of $139 million or $0.50 per share up from $72 million or $0.24 per share in last year's third quarter. The quarterly increase was driven by CNA, whose net income contribution doubled to $192 million.
Let me provide some brief highlights on CNA's quarter. For more details, we encourage you to review the transcript from the company's investor call earlier this morning. The year-over-year earnings increase at CNA was driven by 2 main factors: one, lower net reserve charges in CNA's Life & Group business associated with the long-term care and structured settlement businesses; and two, higher net investment income and net investment gains.
As Jim mentioned, CNA's core property and casualty business posted robust premium growth and strong underlying profitability in the quarter. However, total P&C underwriting results declined from Q3 2019 because of higher weather-related catastrophe losses. Catastrophe losses for the entire U.S. property and casualty industry were elevated during the quarter, led by 3 hurricanes and the Midwest derecho. The western wildfires were also an industry event but had little impact on CNA. 
Before leaving CNA, I would draw your attention to the company's rock-solid investment portfolio, which at quarter end had a market value of $49 billion, an average credit rating of A and a net unrealized gain of $5 billion. About 94% of CNA's fixed maturity investment portfolio is investment grade.
Again, please see CNA's transcript and shareholder materials for more details. Even though Diamond Offshore ceased being a consolidated subsidiary of Loews in this year's second quarter, it helped drive our third quarter year-over-year earnings increase. During last year's third quarter, Diamond contributed a net loss of $48 million, while this year, Diamond's results were no longer included in our consolidated net income.
Let me now turn to our wholly owned subsidiaries: Boardwalk, Loews Hotels and Altium Packaging. Boardwalk's net income contribution declined from $29 million in the prior year to $20 million. The company generated quarterly EBITDA of $167 million versus $175 million last year. Net operating revenues were down slightly. Expiring natural gas transportation contracts were recontracted at lower rates, which was expected and planned for.
Revenues from growth projects recently placed in service, together with storage and parking and lending revenues, offset much but not all of the decline. As a reminder, Boardwalk has experienced contract expirations and restructurings over the past few years related to pipelines placed into service 10 to 12 years ago. This recontracting activity essentially concluded by year-end 2019.
Boardwalk's increased asset base from its growth projects led to an increase in expenses, especially higher depreciation and property taxes. Additionally, the expiration of property tax abatements contributed to the year-over-year increase in expenses. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic and significant hurricane activity along the Gulf Coast, Boardwalk's operations were minimally disrupted during the quarter, and the overall financial impact was negligible. The hurricanes and resulting power disruptions did impact certain customers, but the revenue impact of these disruptions on Boardwalk was immaterial.
Let me highlight that both CNA and Boardwalk took advantage of the robust fixed income market in Q3 to raise money at attractive rates. Both companies issued $500 million of 10-year notes with CNA's yielding 2.08% and Boardwalk's 3.41%. Both deals were vastly oversubscribed and reflected investors' confidence in their respective credits.
Jim already spoke about Loews Hotels, so I will be brief. The business reported a net loss of $47 million in the quarter. Excluding unusual items, the net loss was $55 million. Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes unusual items and includes Loews Hotels' pro rata share of EBITDA in JV properties, was a loss of $38 million.
Loews Hotels' management is focused on 2 interrelated objectives: one, reducing the cash flow drag; and two, resuming operations judiciously and effectively. The company has aggressively reduced expenses, rightsized its capital spend and worked with lenders to defer interest and principal paydowns. It is reopening properties when management projects that doing so will improve cash flow.
As Jim mentioned, we believe that Loews Hotels turned the corner in Q2 and is on an upward trajectory. The average monthly cash flow drag is well below the $25 million we estimated during our Q1 earnings call. The exact timing of a return to profitability and positive operating cash flow, however, depends on the overall travel environment. But we believe Loews Hotels properties, such as those in Orlando, Arlington, Texas and Miami Beach, are especially well positioned to participate in the travel upswing that has already begun.
Altium Packaging, which is included in Corporate and other, had another good quarter. Demand for the company's products continue to be strong overall, higher on COVID-19-related product segments, such as household chemicals, beverages and personal care and somewhat weaker in segments such as automotive, commercial food service and school dairy.
Moreover, Envision, which is the company's recycling business, has been experiencing its best performance since it was acquired by Altium in 2014. Driving this performance has been stronger demand for recycled plastic, also known as post-consumer resin. Altium contributed a slight net loss despite its robust EBITDA. I would highlight 3 factors depressing net income: one, significant depreciation and amortization expense attributable to the company's recent acquisitions; two, accelerated amortization of the Consolidated Container trade name, which will be fully amortized by the end of the year; and three, the effect of rising resin prices in Q3.
Since there is a contractual lag in Altium's ability to pass through these costs to customers, the company absorbed the cost in the quarter without recognizing the offsetting revenue. This lag is temporary and will reverse as the costs are passed through to customers.
Altium's focus on new business is bearing fruit and should benefit results in future periods. The company has been very successful over the past months in gaining new accounts by demonstrating reliability, continued innovation and customer focus during this difficult COVID period.
Turning to the parent company. Pretax net investment income was $23 million, down from $36 million last year and $110 million last quarter. The year-over-year and linked quarter declines were driven by returns on equities and LP investments.
During Q3 2020, we received $90 million in dividends from CNA. We expect to receive dividends from both CNA and Boardwalk during the fourth quarter. We repurchased 5.4 million shares of Loews common stock during the quarter at an aggregate cost of $195 million. We purchased an additional 667,000 shares since quarter end.
Loews ended the quarter with $3.5 billion in parent company cash investments with cash and equivalents accounting for over 80% of the portfolio.
Let me now turn the call back to Mary."

On a very rough basis, CNA comprises about half of the value of Loews, with the other half being our net cash, the -- our assessment of the value of Boardwalk, of Altium and our hotel business. But even beyond just being a marker, there are other reasons to keep CNA as a public company. First, being public is important to attracting top talent.
The top executives want in -- top executives in any company want at least a portion of their compensation to be based on the performance of the shares of their company. And by being public, CNA is to provide that incentive to its top talent. 
Secondly, and we think this is very important, the transparency that comes from being public is important to CNA's regulators as well as to rating agencies. As everybody knows, I think that CNA trades at a ridiculously low valuation and that the P&C industry stocks, likewise, traded a crazy valuation.
And finally, our share repurchases of Loews stock allows us to take advantage of the discount valuation that CNA is trading at as well as the discount in Loews' shares for its non-CNA assets. That all adds up to what we like to call a very significant double discount in our year repurchases."

This has certainly been a banner year for cats and cat losses, and not only for CNA, but for the industry overall.

This has certainly been a banner year for cats and cat losses, and not only for CNA, but for the industry overall. There have been only 4 quarters over the past 40 quarters where CNA has experienced net cuts coming in at or above $160 million. And 2 of those 4 quarters over the past 10 years occurred in 2020.
At CNA, through the third quarter, our pretax cat losses were more than $530 million compared to just $128 million last year. Even if you exclude the losses from COVID and from civil unrest, which were roughly about, say, $250 million, CNA's year-to-date cat losses would still be running at more than twice last year's level and, of course, well ahead of their plan.
But despite these really exceptional events and catastrophes, I'm impressed by how the P&C industry and also CNA are managing through it all. If someone had told me in January that 2020 would be filled with storms, fires, civil unrest and the pandemic, I would have told you that CNA would have a miserable year as a result. However, despite this litany of events, CNA is still quite profitable with $400 million of core income and $300 million of net income through the third quarter.
And it continues to find profitable avenues for growth. All the more so, thanks to the hard rate market that the insurance industry is currently experiencing. Cat losses come with a territory in the property and casualty industry. And we believe that CNA is effectively managing its cat exposure while also getting strong rate increases on cat-exposed businesses. 
So let me end this by adding one stray thought. The insurance industry hasn't always been financially prudent. And this is the advantage of being associated with a particular industry for over 40 years. I have a little historical perspective here. There were years back in the '70s, '80s and '90s when the industry did not have true capital discipline, and they would write business at just about any price.
Today, the industry is reacting to catastrophic events and low interest rates by getting rate increases where they are justified. In my view, this change is a result of an increased demand from equity investors for profitability which has led to insurance management's increased focus on capital efficiency."

As I said in my prepared remarks, CNA's long-term care exposure is likely the biggest reason why CNA's valuation lags its peers. And as I also said, for the past 7 years, CNA has been actively managing its long-term care book of business in order to reduce risk and also in order to optimize results.
Since 2015, CNA's exposure to long-term care has been materially reduced with a number of active policies, declining by over 30%. And additionally, over the past few years, CNA has been able to further reduce its risk profile of its long-term care block of business by achieving meaningful premium rate increases and also offering policyholders attractive options to reduce benefits in return for reduced future premiums. 
Dino Robusto and Al Miralles, on their call today, focused on long-term care. And I suggest that everyone review their remarks and look at the significant information on long-term care that's posted on CNA's website. 
Let me make 2 additional comments on the net reserve charge that CNA took in the third quarter. First, and really very significantly, a $37 million net charge on a block this size is actually quite modest.
And secondly, the charge was attributable to the historically low level of interest rates that we're currently experiencing. With these latest estimated changes going forward, CNA is assuming that a 10-year treasury note will trade at slightly over 1% 3 years from now.
And likewise, in 2030, CNA is assuming that the 10-year note will yield, what historically is a paltry 2.75%. In my opinion, CNA is taking a very, very conservative view on future interest rates, which hopefully means that they won't have to adjust for lower interest rates again going forward."

Over the past several years, Boardwalk has focused on diversifying its customer base to include more end users, such as power plants, industrial customers and LNG off-takers, a strategy that proved beneficial this year. By diversifying in this way, Boardwalk has been able to strengthen the overall credit profile of its customer base. More than 70% of Boardwalk's revenue backlog is derived from investment-grade companies. And Boardwalk has letters of credit or other types of collateral from some of its customers that are not investment-grade or are unrated, which provide an additional measure of security. 
In 2020, in this year, one of Boardwalk's customers declared bankruptcy and another seems to be on the verge. Because of the credit protections in place for these customers, and importantly, the ability to remarket any return capacity, these bankruptcies will not have a material financial impact on the company. 
Stepping back, since the pandemic hit in mid-March, Boardwalk has maintained uninterrupted service to its customers while simultaneously taking measures to ensure the safety of its employees and its operations. At the end of the third quarter, Boardwalk had well over $9 billion in contracted revenues, with over $600 million of net new contracts added to backlog during 2020."

And Jim already commented on it, but let me just provide a little more detail. When Loews Hotels suspended operations at almost all its properties in the early spring, we estimated that negative cash flow would average around $25 million per month. We went on to say that management would reopen a property if doing so was expected to improve that property's cash flow.
Loews Hotels has responded to the pandemic-induced sudden downturn by transforming its operating model, including dramatically reducing property level and management company expenses. As we all know, properties began coming back online during the second quarter. 13 properties resumed operations during Q2, another 6 during Q3 and 1 more hotel last week. 
As anticipated, Loews Hotels' cash flow has improved as properties have resumed operations. Expenses have been managed aggressively and capital spending has been rightsized for the current environment. While the company continues to generate negative cash flow, it is significantly less than the $25 million per month cited in April. I'd be remiss in not mentioning how difficult the past 8 months have been for Loews Hotels' team members. Thousands of employees were furloughed when the pandemic struck and less than half of the furlough team members have returned to active duty.
Early on, Loews Hotels put programs in place to assist its affected team members, including a multimillion-dollar relief fund as well as continuing to provide medical insurance for furloughed employees for several months. Additionally, Loews Hotels has instituted enhanced safety and wellbeing standards and protocols for team members and guests. 
And as a reminder, in solidarity with all Loews Hotels' team members being financially impacted by this crisis, all 3 members of our office of the President, Jim, John and Andrew Tisch, reduced their salaries by 50% as of April 1 and their bonuses by 50% for the entire year. Back to you, Mary."

And secondly, the company is focused on developing and operating hotels for the group business. 
While the hotel recovery is currently powered by leisure travel, we really do believe that the corporate travel along with meetings and events will come back as the pandemic wanes. But before the pandemic hit, Loews Hotels had begun to evaluate their portfolio and to sell a few hotels that didn't align with the current growth strategy, and they continue to do so opportunistically, including one hotel that was sold earlier this year in Canada.
At the start of this year, Loews Hotels had 3 projects under development and scheduled for opening this week -- this year. Two of those hotels, the Live by Loews in St. Louis and the Loews Kansas City Hotel have already opened, and the hotels are doing just fine in light of the current environment for hotels. 
The third hotel under development is the 1,000-room Endless Summer Dockside Inn and Suites, which is located in Universal's Orlando Theme Park. This property is in the final stage of development, and its opening date will be announced very soon. The hotel will be our eighth hotel on the Universal campus and will bring our Universal room count to nearly 9,000 rooms or just about half of the total rooms in the Loews Hotels system.

While there's been a steady increase in demand, occupancy rates still remain considerably below historic norms. That's really important. Occupancy rates are still below historic norms. The recovery is currently being led by leisure business and more than half of Loews Hotels assets fit well into that category, such as our properties on the Universal Orlando campus.
As well as other assets like the Loews Miami Beach Hotel and the Live by Loews in Arlington, Texas, which just hosted the world series, we're seeing, in fact, a lot more driving business than we've really ever seen before.

Those would include automotive, commercial, food service and school dairy, although I would point out that the weaker segments began to rebound in the third quarter.
Two bright spots this year for Altium are Envision, the company's recycling business, and Altium Healthcare, a business created from recent acquisitions that diversifies Altium into the growing pharmaceutical packaging market.
And as I mentioned earlier, Envision has been experiencing its best performance since 2014. And as for Altium Healthcare, it's exceeding expectations due to strong synergies as well as continued progress on operational efficiencies and other savings initiatives. As a result, Altium Healthcare is ahead of plan for the year despite COVID-19.
So I would say net-net, the company's overall results are running modestly above plan, a plan that was finalized prepandemic. And I would go on to say that commercially, Altium's new business efforts have been very successful over the past few months. 
I think the company is winning new accounts by differentiating itself by demonstrating reliability, continued innovation and customer focus during this difficult COVID period.

285930,692464340,2142656,"Loews Corporation, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2020",2020-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Loews Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Mary, and good morning. Let me start by focusing on capital allocation, specifically, share buybacks. During our second quarter conference call, I emphatically stated my strong belief that the market was significantly undervaluing Loews' shares",889,"Thank you, Mary, and good morning. Let me start by focusing on capital allocation, specifically, share buybacks. During our second quarter conference call, I emphatically stated my strong belief that the market was significantly undervaluing Loews' shares. I also stated that while Loews plans to maintain a substantial liquidity position as our rainy day fund, we also would take advantage of the market's discount and continue to buy back our stock. 
During the third quarter, we did just that, purchasing over 5.4 million shares of Loews for about $195 million while preserving ample liquidity and ending the quarter with about $3.5 billion in cash and investments. Maintaining high levels of liquidity is fundamental to our business model because it lets us both capture opportunity and withstand uncertainty. And like any portfolio manager, we have to balance retaining our liquidity with taking advantage of investment opportunities as they arise.
Buying back shares is one of Loews' 3 capital allocation tools, with the other 2 being investing in our subsidiaries and buying another business. With our stock trading considerably below our view of its intrinsic value, share repurchases have recently been our most attractive capital allocation option.
That being said, our decision to buy back stock has not come at the expense of any of our subsidiaries. For example, we have provided capital to Loews Hotels to help it ride out the effects of COVID on the hospitality industry. Our 3 other subsidiaries, CNA, Boardwalk and Altium Packaging, have not recently required parent company capital. Instead, Boardwalk and Altium have largely used their free cash flow to finance growth opportunities and CNA has chosen to pay dividends since it hasn't had a need for additional capital. 
As Mary mentioned, during the Q&A, we will be discussing topics submitted by our shareholders. However, I did want to highlight 2 key items upfront: CNA's long-term care business and the situation at Loews Hotels.
Starting with CNA. Before we got into long-term care, let me emphasize that CNA's underlying property casualty underwriting performance for the quarter was stellar. The company had an underlying combined ratio of 92.6 compared with 94.6 in last year's third quarter due to improved loss and expense ratios. Property and casualty pricing momentum continues, with rates increasing over 12% in the third quarter compared to an increase of just under 6% for the same period last year.
With respect to long-term care, my guess is that CNA's long-term care exposure is a significant reason why CNA's valuation lags its peers. We at Loews are comfortable with the reserves that CNA has set up for long-term care. The company has been proactive in managing their long-term care book of business and prudent in their approach to setting LTC reserves.
In the third quarter, CNA took an LTC net reserve charge of $37 million before tax, comprising a $74 million active life reserve deficiency, offset by a $37 million claim reserve release. The active life reserve deficiency resulted from the continued low interest rate environment and its impact on future assumed reinvestment rates. In my opinion, CNA is taking a conservative view on future interest rates, which hopefully means that they will not have to adjust for lower interest rates again going forward. Since the end of 2015, CNA's overall exposure to long-term care has been reduced by 31% with the number of active policies declining from 419,000 to 288,000.
So why are we so confident in CNA's management of long-term care, even in the face of the market skepticism? Because we know that over the past 7 years, CNA has been laser-focused and immersed in their long-term care book of business. For the 6 years prior to becoming CNA's Chief Financial Officer, Al Miralles was Head of Long-Term Care at the company. Al did an outstanding job mitigating the LTC risk for CNA, and the team in place today continues to do so. CNA has managed more than 100,000 long-term care claims to date, providing CNA with reliable claims experience across all policy types and age cohorts.
CNA reviews its long-term care reserves in the third quarter of every year, and they post significant information regarding their review on the CNA website. If you have not already done so, please take a look at the information that they make available.
Now for the second topic I want to cover: Loews Hotels. The fallout from the COVID pandemic continues to negatively affect the travel and tourism industry, and Loews Hotels is no exception. We believe and hope that the second quarter was the bottom for the hotel industry, and we have seen business pick up at Loews Hotels since then.
While occupancy rates are still low by any historical standard, 21 of Loews Hotels' 27 properties had resumed operations by the end of the third quarter. The resumption of operations, combined with significant expense controls enacted by Loews Hotels' management, have improved the company's cash flow situation. 
When the pandemic struck and Loews Hotels substantially suspended operations, we estimated that the company would generate negative cash flow of approximately $25 million per month. While still negative, Loews Hotels' cash flow is much improved. Going forward, we do not expect Loews Hotels' cash needs to be material to Loews Corporation's balance sheet.
And with that, let me turn the call over to David."
285930,692464340,2142656,"Loews Corporation, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2020",2020-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Loews Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. For the third quarter, Loews reported net income of $139 million or $0.50 per share up from $72 million or $0.24 per share in last year's third quarter. The quarterly increase was driven by CNA, whose net income",1117,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. For the third quarter, Loews reported net income of $139 million or $0.50 per share up from $72 million or $0.24 per share in last year's third quarter. The quarterly increase was driven by CNA, whose net income contribution doubled to $192 million.
Let me provide some brief highlights on CNA's quarter. For more details, we encourage you to review the transcript from the company's investor call earlier this morning. The year-over-year earnings increase at CNA was driven by 2 main factors: one, lower net reserve charges in CNA's Life & Group business associated with the long-term care and structured settlement businesses; and two, higher net investment income and net investment gains.
As Jim mentioned, CNA's core property and casualty business posted robust premium growth and strong underlying profitability in the quarter. However, total P&C underwriting results declined from Q3 2019 because of higher weather-related catastrophe losses. Catastrophe losses for the entire U.S. property and casualty industry were elevated during the quarter, led by 3 hurricanes and the Midwest derecho. The western wildfires were also an industry event but had little impact on CNA. 
Before leaving CNA, I would draw your attention to the company's rock-solid investment portfolio, which at quarter end had a market value of $49 billion, an average credit rating of A and a net unrealized gain of $5 billion. About 94% of CNA's fixed maturity investment portfolio is investment grade.
Again, please see CNA's transcript and shareholder materials for more details. Even though Diamond Offshore ceased being a consolidated subsidiary of Loews in this year's second quarter, it helped drive our third quarter year-over-year earnings increase. During last year's third quarter, Diamond contributed a net loss of $48 million, while this year, Diamond's results were no longer included in our consolidated net income.
Let me now turn to our wholly owned subsidiaries: Boardwalk, Loews Hotels and Altium Packaging. Boardwalk's net income contribution declined from $29 million in the prior year to $20 million. The company generated quarterly EBITDA of $167 million versus $175 million last year. Net operating revenues were down slightly. Expiring natural gas transportation contracts were recontracted at lower rates, which was expected and planned for.
Revenues from growth projects recently placed in service, together with storage and parking and lending revenues, offset much but not all of the decline. As a reminder, Boardwalk has experienced contract expirations and restructurings over the past few years related to pipelines placed into service 10 to 12 years ago. This recontracting activity essentially concluded by year-end 2019.
Boardwalk's increased asset base from its growth projects led to an increase in expenses, especially higher depreciation and property taxes. Additionally, the expiration of property tax abatements contributed to the year-over-year increase in expenses. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic and significant hurricane activity along the Gulf Coast, Boardwalk's operations were minimally disrupted during the quarter, and the overall financial impact was negligible. The hurricanes and resulting power disruptions did impact certain customers, but the revenue impact of these disruptions on Boardwalk was immaterial.
Let me highlight that both CNA and Boardwalk took advantage of the robust fixed income market in Q3 to raise money at attractive rates. Both companies issued $500 million of 10-year notes with CNA's yielding 2.08% and Boardwalk's 3.41%. Both deals were vastly oversubscribed and reflected investors' confidence in their respective credits.
Jim already spoke about Loews Hotels, so I will be brief. The business reported a net loss of $47 million in the quarter. Excluding unusual items, the net loss was $55 million. Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes unusual items and includes Loews Hotels' pro rata share of EBITDA in JV properties, was a loss of $38 million.
Loews Hotels' management is focused on 2 interrelated objectives: one, reducing the cash flow drag; and two, resuming operations judiciously and effectively. The company has aggressively reduced expenses, rightsized its capital spend and worked with lenders to defer interest and principal paydowns. It is reopening properties when management projects that doing so will improve cash flow.
As Jim mentioned, we believe that Loews Hotels turned the corner in Q2 and is on an upward trajectory. The average monthly cash flow drag is well below the $25 million we estimated during our Q1 earnings call. The exact timing of a return to profitability and positive operating cash flow, however, depends on the overall travel environment. But we believe Loews Hotels properties, such as those in Orlando, Arlington, Texas and Miami Beach, are especially well positioned to participate in the travel upswing that has already begun.
Altium Packaging, which is included in Corporate and other, had another good quarter. Demand for the company's products continue to be strong overall, higher on COVID-19-related product segments, such as household chemicals, beverages and personal care and somewhat weaker in segments such as automotive, commercial food service and school dairy.
Moreover, Envision, which is the company's recycling business, has been experiencing its best performance since it was acquired by Altium in 2014. Driving this performance has been stronger demand for recycled plastic, also known as post-consumer resin. Altium contributed a slight net loss despite its robust EBITDA. I would highlight 3 factors depressing net income: one, significant depreciation and amortization expense attributable to the company's recent acquisitions; two, accelerated amortization of the Consolidated Container trade name, which will be fully amortized by the end of the year; and three, the effect of rising resin prices in Q3.
Since there is a contractual lag in Altium's ability to pass through these costs to customers, the company absorbed the cost in the quarter without recognizing the offsetting revenue. This lag is temporary and will reverse as the costs are passed through to customers.
Altium's focus on new business is bearing fruit and should benefit results in future periods. The company has been very successful over the past months in gaining new accounts by demonstrating reliability, continued innovation and customer focus during this difficult COVID period.
Turning to the parent company. Pretax net investment income was $23 million, down from $36 million last year and $110 million last quarter. The year-over-year and linked quarter declines were driven by returns on equities and LP investments.
During Q3 2020, we received $90 million in dividends from CNA. We expect to receive dividends from both CNA and Boardwalk during the fourth quarter. We repurchased 5.4 million shares of Loews common stock during the quarter at an aggregate cost of $195 million. We purchased an additional 667,000 shares since quarter end.
Loews ended the quarter with $3.5 billion in parent company cash investments with cash and equivalents accounting for over 80% of the portfolio.
Let me now turn the call back to Mary."

On a very rough basis, CNA comprises about half of the value of Loews, with the other half being our net cash, the -- our assessment of the value of Boardwalk, of Altium and our hotel business. But even beyond just being a marker, there are other reasons to keep CNA as a public company. First, being public is important to attracting top talent.
The top executives want in -- top executives in any company want at least a portion of their compensation to be based on the performance of the shares of their company. And by being public, CNA is to provide that incentive to its top talent. 
Secondly, and we think this is very important, the transparency that comes from being public is important to CNA's regulators as well as to rating agencies. As everybody knows, I think that CNA trades at a ridiculously low valuation and that the P&C industry stocks, likewise, traded a crazy valuation.
And finally, our share repurchases of Loews stock allows us to take advantage of the discount valuation that CNA is trading at as well as the discount in Loews' shares for its non-CNA assets. That all adds up to what we like to call a very significant double discount in our share repurchases."

This has certainly been a banner year for cats and cat losses, and not only for CNA, but for the industry overall. There have been only 4 quarters over the past 40 quarters where CNA has experienced net cats coming in at or above $160 million. And 2 of those 4 quarters over the past 10 years occurred in 2020.
At CNA, through the third quarter, our pretax cat losses were more than $530 million compared to just $128 million last year. Even if you exclude the losses from COVID and from civil unrest, which were roughly about, say, $250 million, CNA's year-to-date cat losses would still be running at more than twice last year's level and, of course, well ahead of their plan.
But despite these really exceptional events and catastrophes, I'm impressed by how the P&C industry and also CNA are managing through it all. If someone had told me in January that 2020 would be filled with storms, fires, civil unrest and the pandemic, I would have told you that CNA would have a miserable year as a result. However, despite this litany of events, CNA is still quite profitable with $400 million of core income and $300 million of net income through the third quarter.
And it continues to find profitable avenues for growth. All the more so, thanks to the hard rate market that the insurance industry is currently experiencing. Cat losses come with a territory in the property and casualty industry. And we believe that CNA is effectively managing its cat exposure while also getting strong rate increases on cat-exposed businesses. 
So let me end this by adding one stray thought. The insurance industry hasn't always been financially prudent. And this is the advantage of being associated with a particular industry for over 40 years. I have a little historical perspective here. There were years back in the '70s, '80s and '90s when the industry did not have true capital discipline, and they would write business at just about any price.
Today, the industry is reacting to catastrophic events and low interest rates by getting rate increases where they are justified. In my view, this change is a result of an increased demand from equity investors for profitability which has led to insurance management's increased focus on capital efficiency."

And as I also said, for the past 7 years, CNA has been actively managing its long-term care book of business in order to reduce risk and also in order to optimize results.
Since 2015, CNA's exposure to long-term care has been materially reduced with a number of active policies, declining by over 30%. And additionally, over the past few years, CNA has been able to further reduce its risk profile of its long-term care block of business by achieving meaningful premium rate increases and also offering policyholders attractive options to reduce benefits in return for reduced future premiums. 
Dino Robusto and Al Miralles, on their call today, focused on long-term care. And I suggest that everyone review their remarks and look at the significant information on long-term care that's posted on CNA's website. 
Let me make 2 additional comments on the net reserve charge that CNA took in the third quarter. First, and really very significantly, a $37 million net charge on a block this size is actually quite modest.
And secondly, the charge was attributable to the historically low level of interest rates that we're currently experiencing. With these latest estimated changes going forward, CNA is assuming that a 10-year treasury note will trade at slightly over 1% 3 years from now.
And likewise, in 2030, CNA is assuming that the 10-year note will yield, what historically is a paltry 2.75%. In my opinion, CNA is taking a very, very conservative view on future interest rates, which hopefully means that they won't have to adjust for lower interest rates again going forward."

By diversifying in this way, Boardwalk has been able to strengthen the overall credit profile of its customer base. More than 70% of Boardwalk's revenue backlog is derived from investment-grade companies. And Boardwalk has letters of credit or other types of collateral from some of its customers that are not investment-grade or are unrated, which provide an additional measure of security. 
In 2020, in this year, one of Boardwalk's customers declared bankruptcy and another seems to be on the verge.

And Jim already commented on it, but let me just provide a little more detail. When Loews Hotels suspended operations at almost all its properties in the early spring, we estimated that negative cash flow would average around $25 million per month. We went on to say that management would reopen a property if doing so was expected to improve that property's cash flow.
Loews Hotels has responded to the pandemic-induced sudden downturn by transforming its operating model, including dramatically reducing property level and management company expenses. As we all know, properties began coming back online during the second quarter. 13 properties resumed operations during Q2, another 6 during Q3 and 1 more hotel last week. 
As anticipated, Loews Hotels' cash flow has improved as properties have resumed operations. Expenses have been managed aggressively and capital spending has been rightsized for the current environment. While the company continues to generate negative cash flow, it is significantly less than the $25 million per month cited in April. I'd be remiss in not mentioning how difficult the past 8 months have been for Loews Hotels' team members. Thousands of employees were furloughed when the pandemic struck and less than half of the furlough team members have returned to active duty.
Early on, Loews Hotels put programs in place to assist its affected team members, including a multimillion-dollar relief fund as well as continuing to provide medical insurance for furloughed employees for several months. Additionally, Loews Hotels has instituted enhanced safety and wellbeing standards and protocols for team members and guests.

While the hotel recovery is currently powered by leisure travel, we really do believe that the corporate travel along with meetings and events will come back as the pandemic wanes. But before the pandemic hit, Loews Hotels had begun to evaluate their portfolio and to sell a few hotels that didn't align with the current growth strategy, and they continue to do so opportunistically, including one hotel that was sold earlier this year in Canada.
At the start of this year, Loews Hotels had 3 projects under development and scheduled for opening this week -- this year. Two of those hotels, the Live by Loews in St. Louis and the Loews Kansas City Hotel have already opened, and the hotels are doing just fine in light of the current environment for hotels. 
The third hotel under development is the 1,000-room Endless Summer Dockside Inn and Suites, which is located in Universal's Orlando Theme Park. This property is in the final stage of development, and its opening date will be announced very soon.

Industry analysts believe that a full recovery is anywhere from 2 to 5 years in the future. But the truth is a recovery in hospitality is highly dependent upon how and when the pandemic is contained. At the end of the third quarter, as we said before, Loews Hotels had 21 hotels that had already resumed operations.
While there's been a steady increase in demand, occupancy rates still remain considerably below historic norms. That's really important. Occupancy rates are still below historic norms. The recovery is currently being led by leisure business and more than half of Loews Hotels assets fit well into that category, such as our properties on the Universal Orlando campus.
As well as other assets like the Loews Miami Beach Hotel and the Live by Loews in Arlington, Texas, which just hosted the world series, we're seeing, in fact, a lot more driving business than we've really ever seen before. Urban center properties are still lagging due to a reduction in corporate travel, but we believe that Loews Hotels properties with unique demand generators will recover more quickly than our urban properties."

I mentioned this in my remarks, but let me go over it again. Demand for the company's products has been strong overall. There are certain products that benefited from COVID actually, product segments such as household chemicals, beverages and personal care. And there are others that were somewhat weakened by COVID. Those would include automotive, commercial, food service and school dairy, although I would point out that the weaker segments began to rebound in the third quarter.
Two bright spots this year for Altium are Envision, the company's recycling business, and Altium Healthcare, a business created from recent acquisitions that diversifies Altium into the growing pharmaceutical packaging market.
And as I mentioned earlier, Envision has been experiencing its best performance since 2014. And as for Altium Healthcare, it's exceeding expectations due to strong synergies as well as continued progress on operational efficiencies and other savings initiatives. As a result, Altium Healthcare is ahead of plan for the year despite COVID-19.
So I would say net-net, the company's overall results are running modestly above plan, a plan that was finalized prepandemic. And I would go on to say that commercially, Altium's new business efforts have been very successful over the past few months. 
I think the company is winning new accounts by differentiating itself by demonstrating reliability, continued innovation and customer focus during this difficult COVID period. So we hope that this focus on new business and the new business wins should benefit financial results in future periods. Back to you, Mary."

285930,692464340,2155570,"Loews Corporation, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2020",2020-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Loews Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Mary, and good morning. Let me start by focusing on capital allocation, specifically, share buybacks. During our second quarter conference call, I emphatically stated my strong belief that the market was significantly undervaluing Loews' shares",889,"Thank you, Mary, and good morning. Let me start by focusing on capital allocation, specifically, share buybacks. During our second quarter conference call, I emphatically stated my strong belief that the market was significantly undervaluing Loews' shares. I also stated that while Loews plans to maintain a substantial liquidity position as our rainy day fund, we also would take advantage of the market's discount and continue to buy back our stock. 
During the third quarter, we did just that, purchasing over 5.4 million shares of Loews for about $195 million while preserving ample liquidity and ending the quarter with about $3.5 billion in cash and investments. Maintaining high levels of liquidity is fundamental to our business model because it lets us both capture opportunity and withstand uncertainty. And like any portfolio manager, we have to balance retaining our liquidity with taking advantage of investment opportunities as they arise.
Buying back shares is one of Loews' 3 capital allocation tools, with the other 2 being investing in our subsidiaries and buying another business. With our stock trading considerably below our view of its intrinsic value, share repurchases have recently been our most attractive capital allocation option.
That being said, our decision to buy back stock has not come at the expense of any of our subsidiaries. For example, we have provided capital to Loews Hotels to help it ride out the effects of COVID on the hospitality industry. Our 3 other subsidiaries, CNA, Boardwalk and Altium Packaging, have not recently required parent company capital. Instead, Boardwalk and Altium have largely used their free cash flow to finance growth opportunities and CNA has chosen to pay dividends since it hasn't had a need for additional capital. 
As Mary mentioned, during the Q&A, we will be discussing topics submitted by our shareholders. However, I did want to highlight 2 key items upfront: CNA's long-term care business and the situation at Loews Hotels.
Starting with CNA. Before we got into long-term care, let me emphasize that CNA's underlying property casualty underwriting performance for the quarter was stellar. The company had an underlying combined ratio of 92.6 compared with 94.6 in last year's third quarter due to improved loss and expense ratios. Property and casualty pricing momentum continues, with rates increasing over 12% in the third quarter compared to an increase of just under 6% for the same period last year.
With respect to long-term care, my guess is that CNA's long-term care exposure is a significant reason why CNA's valuation lags its peers. We at Loews are comfortable with the reserves that CNA has set up for long-term care. The company has been proactive in managing their long-term care book of business and prudent in their approach to setting LTC reserves.
In the third quarter, CNA took an LTC net reserve charge of $37 million before tax, comprising a $74 million active life reserve deficiency, offset by a $37 million claim reserve release. The active life reserve deficiency resulted from the continued low interest rate environment and its impact on future assumed reinvestment rates. In my opinion, CNA is taking a conservative view on future interest rates, which hopefully means that they will not have to adjust for lower interest rates again going forward. Since the end of 2015, CNA's overall exposure to long-term care has been reduced by 31% with the number of active policies declining from 419,000 to 288,000.
So why are we so confident in CNA's management of long-term care, even in the face of the market skepticism? Because we know that over the past 7 years, CNA has been laser-focused and immersed in their long-term care book of business. For the 6 years prior to becoming CNA's Chief Financial Officer, Al Miralles was Head of Long-Term Care at the company. Al did an outstanding job mitigating the LTC risk for CNA, and the team in place today continues to do so. CNA has managed more than 100,000 long-term care claims to date, providing CNA with reliable claims experience across all policy types and age cohorts.
CNA reviews its long-term care reserves in the third quarter of every year, and they post significant information regarding their review on the CNA website. If you have not already done so, please take a look at the information that they make available.
Now for the second topic I want to cover: Loews Hotels. The fallout from the COVID pandemic continues to negatively affect the travel and tourism industry, and Loews Hotels is no exception. We believe and hope that the second quarter was the bottom for the hotel industry, and we have seen business pick up at Loews Hotels since then.
While occupancy rates are still low by any historical standard, 21 of Loews Hotels' 27 properties had resumed operations by the end of the third quarter. The resumption of operations, combined with significant expense controls enacted by Loews Hotels' management, have improved the company's cash flow situation. 
When the pandemic struck and Loews Hotels substantially suspended operations, we estimated that the company would generate negative cash flow of approximately $25 million per month. While still negative, Loews Hotels' cash flow is much improved. Going forward, we do not expect Loews Hotels' cash needs to be material to Loews Corporation's balance sheet.
And with that, let me turn the call over to David."
285930,692464340,2155570,"Loews Corporation, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2020",2020-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Loews Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. For the third quarter, Loews reported net income of $139 million or $0.50 per share up from $72 million or $0.24 per share in last year's third quarter. The quarterly increase was driven by CNA, whose net income",1117,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. For the third quarter, Loews reported net income of $139 million or $0.50 per share up from $72 million or $0.24 per share in last year's third quarter. The quarterly increase was driven by CNA, whose net income contribution doubled to $192 million.
Let me provide some brief highlights on CNA's quarter. For more details, we encourage you to review the transcript from the company's investor call earlier this morning. The year-over-year earnings increase at CNA was driven by 2 main factors: one, lower net reserve charges in CNA's Life & Group business associated with the long-term care and structured settlement businesses; and two, higher net investment income and net investment gains.
As Jim mentioned, CNA's core property and casualty business posted robust premium growth and strong underlying profitability in the quarter. However, total P&C underwriting results declined from Q3 2019 because of higher weather-related catastrophe losses. Catastrophe losses for the entire U.S. property and casualty industry were elevated during the quarter, led by 3 hurricanes and the Midwest derecho. The western wildfires were also an industry event but had little impact on CNA. 
Before leaving CNA, I would draw your attention to the company's rock-solid investment portfolio, which at quarter end had a market value of $49 billion, an average credit rating of A and a net unrealized gain of $5 billion. About 94% of CNA's fixed maturity investment portfolio is investment grade.
Again, please see CNA's transcript and shareholder materials for more details. Even though Diamond Offshore ceased being a consolidated subsidiary of Loews in this year's second quarter, it helped drive our third quarter year-over-year earnings increase. During last year's third quarter, Diamond contributed a net loss of $48 million, while this year, Diamond's results were no longer included in our consolidated net income.
Let me now turn to our wholly owned subsidiaries: Boardwalk, Loews Hotels and Altium Packaging. Boardwalk's net income contribution declined from $29 million in the prior year to $20 million. The company generated quarterly EBITDA of $167 million versus $175 million last year. Net operating revenues were down slightly. Expiring natural gas transportation contracts were recontracted at lower rates, which was expected and planned for.
Revenues from growth projects recently placed in service, together with storage and parking and lending revenues, offset much but not all of the decline. As a reminder, Boardwalk has experienced contract expirations and restructurings over the past few years related to pipelines placed into service 10 to 12 years ago. This recontracting activity essentially concluded by year-end 2019.
Boardwalk's increased asset base from its growth projects led to an increase in expenses, especially higher depreciation and property taxes. Additionally, the expiration of property tax abatements contributed to the year-over-year increase in expenses. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic and significant hurricane activity along the Gulf Coast, Boardwalk's operations were minimally disrupted during the quarter, and the overall financial impact was negligible. The hurricanes and resulting power disruptions did impact certain customers, but the revenue impact of these disruptions on Boardwalk was immaterial.
Let me highlight that both CNA and Boardwalk took advantage of the robust fixed income market in Q3 to raise money at attractive rates. Both companies issued $500 million of 10-year notes with CNA's yielding 2.08% and Boardwalk's 3.41%. Both deals were vastly oversubscribed and reflected investors' confidence in their respective credits.
Jim already spoke about Loews Hotels, so I will be brief. The business reported a net loss of $47 million in the quarter. Excluding unusual items, the net loss was $55 million. Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes unusual items and includes Loews Hotels' pro rata share of EBITDA in JV properties, was a loss of $38 million.
Loews Hotels' management is focused on 2 interrelated objectives: one, reducing the cash flow drag; and two, resuming operations judiciously and effectively. The company has aggressively reduced expenses, rightsized its capital spend and worked with lenders to defer interest and principal paydowns. It is reopening properties when management projects that doing so will improve cash flow.
As Jim mentioned, we believe that Loews Hotels turned the corner in Q2 and is on an upward trajectory. The average monthly cash flow drag is well below the $25 million we estimated during our Q1 earnings call. The exact timing of a return to profitability and positive operating cash flow, however, depends on the overall travel environment. But we believe Loews Hotels properties, such as those in Orlando, Arlington, Texas and Miami Beach, are especially well positioned to participate in the travel upswing that has already begun.
Altium Packaging, which is included in Corporate and other, had another good quarter. Demand for the company's products continue to be strong overall, higher on COVID-19-related product segments, such as household chemicals, beverages and personal care and somewhat weaker in segments such as automotive, commercial food service and school dairy.
Moreover, Envision, which is the company's recycling business, has been experiencing its best performance since it was acquired by Altium in 2014. Driving this performance has been stronger demand for recycled plastic, also known as post-consumer resin. Altium contributed a slight net loss despite its robust EBITDA. I would highlight 3 factors depressing net income: one, significant depreciation and amortization expense attributable to the company's recent acquisitions; two, accelerated amortization of the Consolidated Container trade name, which will be fully amortized by the end of the year; and three, the effect of rising resin prices in Q3.
Since there is a contractual lag in Altium's ability to pass through these costs to customers, the company absorbed the cost in the quarter without recognizing the offsetting revenue. This lag is temporary and will reverse as the costs are passed through to customers.
Altium's focus on new business is bearing fruit and should benefit results in future periods. The company has been very successful over the past months in gaining new accounts by demonstrating reliability, continued innovation and customer focus during this difficult COVID period.
Turning to the parent company. Pretax net investment income was $23 million, down from $36 million last year and $110 million last quarter. The year-over-year and linked quarter declines were driven by returns on equities and LP investments.
During Q3 2020, we received $90 million in dividends from CNA. We expect to receive dividends from both CNA and Boardwalk during the fourth quarter. We repurchased 5.4 million shares of Loews common stock during the quarter at an aggregate cost of $195 million. We purchased an additional 667,000 shares since quarter end.
Loews ended the quarter with $3.5 billion in parent company cash investments with cash and equivalents accounting for over 80% of the portfolio.
Let me now turn the call back to Mary."

On a very rough basis, CNA comprises about half of the value of Loews, with the other half being our net cash, the -- our assessment of the value of Boardwalk, of Altium and our hotel business. But even beyond just being a marker, there are other reasons to keep CNA as a public company. First, being public is important to attracting top talent.
The top executives want in -- top executives in any company want at least a portion of their compensation to be based on the performance of the shares of their company. And by being public, CNA is to provide that incentive to its top talent. 
Secondly, and we think this is very important, the transparency that comes from being public is important to CNA's regulators as well as to rating agencies. As everybody knows, I think that CNA trades at a ridiculously low valuation and that the P&C industry stocks, likewise, traded a crazy valuation.
And finally, our share repurchases of Loews stock allows us to take advantage of the discount valuation that CNA is trading at as well as the discount in Loews' shares for its non-CNA assets. That all adds up to what we like to call a very significant double discount in our share repurchases."

This has certainly been a banner year for cats and cat losses, and not only for CNA, but for the industry overall.

This has certainly been a banner year for cats and cat losses, and not only for CNA, but for the industry overall. There have been only 4 quarters over the past 40 quarters where CNA has experienced net cats coming in at or above $160 million. And 2 of those 4 quarters over the past 10 years occurred in 2020.
At CNA, through the third quarter, our pretax cat losses were more than $530 million compared to just $128 million last year. Even if you exclude the losses from COVID and from civil unrest, which were roughly about, say, $250 million, CNA's year-to-date cat losses would still be running at more than twice last year's level and, of course, well ahead of their plan.
But despite these really exceptional events and catastrophes, I'm impressed by how the P&C industry and also CNA are managing through it all. If someone had told me in January that 2020 would be filled with storms, fires, civil unrest and the pandemic, I would have told you that CNA would have a miserable year as a result. However, despite this litany of events, CNA is still quite profitable with $400 million of core income and $300 million of net income through the third quarter.
And it continues to find profitable avenues for growth. All the more so, thanks to the hard rate market that the insurance industry is currently experiencing. Cat losses come with a territory in the property and casualty industry. And we believe that CNA is effectively managing its cat exposure while also getting strong rate increases on cat-exposed businesses. 
So let me end this by adding one stray thought. The insurance industry hasn't always been financially prudent. And this is the advantage of being associated with a particular industry for over 40 years. I have a little historical perspective here. There were years back in the '70s, '80s and '90s when the industry did not have true capital discipline, and they would write business at just about any price.
Today, the industry is reacting to catastrophic events and low interest rates by getting rate increases where they are justified. In my view, this change is a result of an increased demand from equity investors for profitability which has led to insurance management's increased focus on capital efficiency."

And as I also said, for the past 7 years, CNA has been actively managing its long-term care book of business in order to reduce risk and also in order to optimize results.
Since 2015, CNA's exposure to long-term care has been materially reduced with a number of active policies, declining by over 30%. And additionally, over the past few years, CNA has been able to further reduce its risk profile of its long-term care block of business by achieving meaningful premium rate increases and also offering policyholders attractive options to reduce benefits in return for reduced future premiums. 
Dino Robusto and Al Miralles, on their call today, focused on long-term care. And I suggest that everyone review their remarks and look at the significant information on long-term care that's posted on CNA's website. 
Let me make 2 additional comments on the net reserve charge that CNA took in the third quarter. First, and really very significantly, a $37 million net charge on a block this size is actually quite modest.
And secondly, the charge was attributable to the historically low level of interest rates that we're currently experiencing. With these latest estimated changes going forward, CNA is assuming that a 10-year treasury note will trade at slightly over 1% 3 years from now.
And likewise, in 2030, CNA is assuming that the 10-year note will yield, what historically is a paltry 2.75%. In my opinion, CNA is taking a very, very conservative view on future interest rates, which hopefully means that they won't have to adjust for lower interest rates again going forward."

Over the past several years, Boardwalk has focused on diversifying its customer base to include more end users, such as power plants, industrial customers and LNG off-takers, a strategy that proved beneficial this year. By diversifying in this way, Boardwalk has been able to strengthen the overall credit profile of its customer base. More than 70% of Boardwalk's revenue backlog is derived from investment-grade companies. And Boardwalk has letters of credit or other types of collateral from some of its customers that are not investment-grade or are unrated, which provide an additional measure of security. 
In 2020, in this year, one of Boardwalk's customers declared bankruptcy and another seems to be on the verge. Because of the credit protections in place for these customers, and importantly, the ability to remarket any return capacity, these bankruptcies will not have a material financial impact on the company. 
Stepping back, since the pandemic hit in mid-March, Boardwalk has maintained uninterrupted service to its customers while simultaneously taking measures to ensure the safety of its employees and its operations. At the end of the third quarter, Boardwalk had well over $9 billion in contracted revenues, with over $600 million of net new contracts added to backlog during 2020."

And Jim already commented on it, but let me just provide a little more detail. When Loews Hotels suspended operations at almost all its properties in the early spring, we estimated that negative cash flow would average around $25 million per month. We went on to say that management would reopen a property if doing so was expected to improve that property's cash flow.
Loews Hotels has responded to the pandemic-induced sudden downturn by transforming its operating model, including dramatically reducing property level and management company expenses. As we all know, properties began coming back online during the second quarter. 13 properties resumed operations during Q2, another 6 during Q3 and 1 more hotel last week. 
As anticipated, Loews Hotels' cash flow has improved as properties have resumed operations. Expenses have been managed aggressively and capital spending has been rightsized for the current environment. While the company continues to generate negative cash flow, it is significantly less than the $25 million per month cited in April. I'd be remiss in not mentioning how difficult the past 8 months have been for Loews Hotels' team members. Thousands of employees were furloughed when the pandemic struck and less than half of the furlough team members have returned to active duty.
Early on, Loews Hotels put programs in place to assist its affected team members, including a multimillion-dollar relief fund as well as continuing to provide medical insurance for furloughed employees for several months. Additionally, Loews Hotels has instituted enhanced safety and wellbeing standards and protocols for team members and guests. 
And as a reminder, in solidarity with all Loews Hotels' team members being financially impacted by this crisis, all 3 members of our office of the President, Jim, John and Andrew Tisch, reduced their salaries by 50% as of April 1 and their bonuses by 50% for the entire year. Back to you, Mary."

And secondly, the company is focused on developing and operating hotels for the group business. 
While the hotel recovery is currently powered by leisure travel, we really do believe that the corporate travel along with meetings and events will come back as the pandemic wanes. But before the pandemic hit, Loews Hotels had begun to evaluate their portfolio and to sell a few hotels that didn't align with the current growth strategy, and they continue to do so opportunistically, including one hotel that was sold earlier this year in Canada.
At the start of this year, Loews Hotels had 3 projects under development and scheduled for opening this week -- this year. Two of those hotels, the Live by Loews in St. Louis and the Loews Kansas City Hotel have already opened, and the hotels are doing just fine in light of the current environment for hotels. 
The third hotel under development is the 1,000-room Endless Summer Dockside Inn and Suites, which is located in Universal's Orlando Theme Park. This property is in the final stage of development, and its opening date will be announced very soon. The hotel will be our eighth hotel on the Universal campus and will bring our Universal room count to nearly 9,000 rooms or just about half of the total rooms in the Loews Hotels system.
Loews Hotels, they continue to remain focused on its strategy of developing hotels in markets that have unique built-in demand generators and potential for group business."

While there's been a steady increase in demand, occupancy rates still remain considerably below historic norms. That's really important. Occupancy rates are still below historic norms. The recovery is currently being led by leisure business and more than half of Loews Hotels assets fit well into that category, such as our properties on the Universal Orlando campus.
As well as other assets like the Loews Miami Beach Hotel and the Live by Loews in Arlington, Texas, which just hosted the world series, we're seeing, in fact, a lot more driving business than we've really ever seen before. Urban center properties are still lagging due to a reduction in corporate travel, but we believe that Loews Hotels properties with unique demand generators will recover more quickly than our urban properties."

I mentioned this in my remarks, but let me go over it again. Demand for the company's products has been strong overall. There are certain products that benefited from COVID actually, product segments such as household chemicals, beverages and personal care. And there are others that were somewhat weakened by COVID. Those would include automotive, commercial, food service and school dairy, although I would point out that the weaker segments began to rebound in the third quarter.
Two bright spots this year for Altium are Envision, the company's recycling business, and Altium Healthcare, a business created from recent acquisitions that diversifies Altium into the growing pharmaceutical packaging market.
And as I mentioned earlier, Envision has been experiencing its best performance since 2014. And as for Altium Healthcare, it's exceeding expectations due to strong synergies as well as continued progress on operational efficiencies and other savings initiatives. As a result, Altium Healthcare is ahead of plan for the year despite COVID-19.
So I would say net-net, the company's overall results are running modestly above plan, a plan that was finalized prepandemic. And I would go on to say that commercially, Altium's new business efforts have been very successful over the past few months. 
I think the company is winning new accounts by differentiating itself by demonstrating reliability, continued innovation and customer focus during this difficult COVID period. So we hope that this focus on new business and the new business wins should benefit financial results in future periods. Back to you, Mary."

285930,692464340,2155574,"Loews Corporation, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2020",2020-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Loews Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Mary, and good morning. Let me start by focusing on capital allocation, specifically, share buybacks. During our second quarter conference call, I emphatically stated my strong belief that the market was significantly undervaluing Loews' shares",889,"Thank you, Mary, and good morning. Let me start by focusing on capital allocation, specifically, share buybacks. During our second quarter conference call, I emphatically stated my strong belief that the market was significantly undervaluing Loews' shares. I also stated that while Loews plans to maintain a substantial liquidity position as our rainy day fund, we also would take advantage of the market's discount and continue to buy back our stock. 
During the third quarter, we did just that, purchasing over 5.4 million shares of Loews for about $195 million while preserving ample liquidity and ending the quarter with about $3.5 billion in cash and investments. Maintaining high levels of liquidity is fundamental to our business model because it lets us both capture opportunity and withstand uncertainty. And like any portfolio manager, we have to balance retaining our liquidity with taking advantage of investment opportunities as they arise.
Buying back shares is one of Loews' 3 capital allocation tools, with the other 2 being investing in our subsidiaries and buying another business. With our stock trading considerably below our view of its intrinsic value, share repurchases have recently been our most attractive capital allocation option.
That being said, our decision to buy back stock has not come at the expense of any of our subsidiaries. For example, we have provided capital to Loews Hotels to help it ride out the effects of COVID on the hospitality industry. Our 3 other subsidiaries, CNA, Boardwalk and Altium Packaging, have not recently required parent company capital. Instead, Boardwalk and Altium have largely used their free cash flow to finance growth opportunities and CNA has chosen to pay dividends since it hasn't had a need for additional capital. 
As Mary mentioned, during the Q&A, we will be discussing topics submitted by our shareholders. However, I did want to highlight 2 key items upfront: CNA's long-term care business and the situation at Loews Hotels.
Starting with CNA. Before we got into long-term care, let me emphasize that CNA's underlying property casualty underwriting performance for the quarter was stellar. The company had an underlying combined ratio of 92.6 compared with 94.6 in last year's third quarter due to improved loss and expense ratios. Property and casualty pricing momentum continues, with rates increasing over 12% in the third quarter compared to an increase of just under 6% for the same period last year.
With respect to long-term care, my guess is that CNA's long-term care exposure is a significant reason why CNA's valuation lags its peers. We at Loews are comfortable with the reserves that CNA has set up for long-term care. The company has been proactive in managing their long-term care book of business and prudent in their approach to setting LTC reserves.
In the third quarter, CNA took an LTC net reserve charge of $37 million before tax, comprising a $74 million active life reserve deficiency, offset by a $37 million claim reserve release. The active life reserve deficiency resulted from the continued low interest rate environment and its impact on future assumed reinvestment rates. In my opinion, CNA is taking a conservative view on future interest rates, which hopefully means that they will not have to adjust for lower interest rates again going forward. Since the end of 2015, CNA's overall exposure to long-term care has been reduced by 31% with the number of active policies declining from 419,000 to 288,000.
So why are we so confident in CNA's management of long-term care, even in the face of the market skepticism? Because we know that over the past 7 years, CNA has been laser-focused and immersed in their long-term care book of business. For the 6 years prior to becoming CNA's Chief Financial Officer, Al Miralles was Head of Long-Term Care at the company. Al did an outstanding job mitigating the LTC risk for CNA, and the team in place today continues to do so. CNA has managed more than 100,000 long-term care claims to date, providing CNA with reliable claims experience across all policy types and age cohorts.
CNA reviews its long-term care reserves in the third quarter of every year, and they post significant information regarding their review on the CNA website. If you have not already done so, please take a look at the information that they make available.
Now for the second topic I want to cover: Loews Hotels. The fallout from the COVID pandemic continues to negatively affect the travel and tourism industry, and Loews Hotels is no exception. We believe and hope that the second quarter was the bottom for the hotel industry, and we have seen business pick up at Loews Hotels since then.
While occupancy rates are still low by any historical standard, 21 of Loews Hotels' 27 properties had resumed operations by the end of the third quarter. The resumption of operations, combined with significant expense controls enacted by Loews Hotels' management, have improved the company's cash flow situation. 
When the pandemic struck and Loews Hotels substantially suspended operations, we estimated that the company would generate negative cash flow of approximately $25 million per month. While still negative, Loews Hotels' cash flow is much improved. Going forward, we do not expect Loews Hotels' cash needs to be material to Loews Corporation's balance sheet.
And with that, let me turn the call over to David."
285930,692464340,2155574,"Loews Corporation, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2020",2020-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Loews Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. For the third quarter, Loews reported net income of $139 million or $0.50 per share up from $72 million or $0.24 per share in last year's third quarter. The quarterly increase was driven by CNA, whose net income",1117,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. For the third quarter, Loews reported net income of $139 million or $0.50 per share up from $72 million or $0.24 per share in last year's third quarter. The quarterly increase was driven by CNA, whose net income contribution doubled to $192 million.
Let me provide some brief highlights on CNA's quarter. For more details, we encourage you to review the transcript from the company's investor call earlier this morning. The year-over-year earnings increase at CNA was driven by 2 main factors: one, lower net reserve charges in CNA's Life & Group business associated with the long-term care and structured settlement businesses; and two, higher net investment income and net investment gains.
As Jim mentioned, CNA's core property and casualty business posted robust premium growth and strong underlying profitability in the quarter. However, total P&C underwriting results declined from Q3 2019 because of higher weather-related catastrophe losses. Catastrophe losses for the entire U.S. property and casualty industry were elevated during the quarter, led by 3 hurricanes and the Midwest derecho. The western wildfires were also an industry event but had little impact on CNA. 
Before leaving CNA, I would draw your attention to the company's rock-solid investment portfolio, which at quarter end had a market value of $49 billion, an average credit rating of A and a net unrealized gain of $5 billion. About 94% of CNA's fixed maturity investment portfolio is investment grade.
Again, please see CNA's transcript and shareholder materials for more details. Even though Diamond Offshore ceased being a consolidated subsidiary of Loews in this year's second quarter, it helped drive our third quarter year-over-year earnings increase. During last year's third quarter, Diamond contributed a net loss of $48 million, while this year, Diamond's results were no longer included in our consolidated net income.
Let me now turn to our wholly owned subsidiaries: Boardwalk, Loews Hotels and Altium Packaging. Boardwalk's net income contribution declined from $29 million in the prior year to $20 million. The company generated quarterly EBITDA of $167 million versus $175 million last year. Net operating revenues were down slightly. Expiring natural gas transportation contracts were recontracted at lower rates, which was expected and planned for.
Revenues from growth projects recently placed in service, together with storage and parking and lending revenues, offset much but not all of the decline. As a reminder, Boardwalk has experienced contract expirations and restructurings over the past few years related to pipelines placed into service 10 to 12 years ago. This recontracting activity essentially concluded by year-end 2019.
Boardwalk's increased asset base from its growth projects led to an increase in expenses, especially higher depreciation and property taxes. Additionally, the expiration of property tax abatements contributed to the year-over-year increase in expenses. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic and significant hurricane activity along the Gulf Coast, Boardwalk's operations were minimally disrupted during the quarter, and the overall financial impact was negligible. The hurricanes and resulting power disruptions did impact certain customers, but the revenue impact of these disruptions on Boardwalk was immaterial.
Let me highlight that both CNA and Boardwalk took advantage of the robust fixed income market in Q3 to raise money at attractive rates. Both companies issued $500 million of 10-year notes with CNA's yielding 2.08% and Boardwalk's 3.41%. Both deals were vastly oversubscribed and reflected investors' confidence in their respective credits.
Jim already spoke about Loews Hotels, so I will be brief. The business reported a net loss of $47 million in the quarter. Excluding unusual items, the net loss was $55 million. Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes unusual items and includes Loews Hotels' pro rata share of EBITDA in JV properties, was a loss of $38 million.
Loews Hotels' management is focused on 2 interrelated objectives: one, reducing the cash flow drag; and two, resuming operations judiciously and effectively. The company has aggressively reduced expenses, rightsized its capital spend and worked with lenders to defer interest and principal paydowns. It is reopening properties when management projects that doing so will improve cash flow.
As Jim mentioned, we believe that Loews Hotels turned the corner in Q2 and is on an upward trajectory. The average monthly cash flow drag is well below the $25 million we estimated during our Q1 earnings call. The exact timing of a return to profitability and positive operating cash flow, however, depends on the overall travel environment. But we believe Loews Hotels properties, such as those in Orlando, Arlington, Texas and Miami Beach, are especially well positioned to participate in the travel upswing that has already begun.
Altium Packaging, which is included in Corporate and other, had another good quarter. Demand for the company's products continue to be strong overall, higher on COVID-19-related product segments, such as household chemicals, beverages and personal care and somewhat weaker in segments such as automotive, commercial food service and school dairy.
Moreover, Envision, which is the company's recycling business, has been experiencing its best performance since it was acquired by Altium in 2014. Driving this performance has been stronger demand for recycled plastic, also known as post-consumer resin. Altium contributed a slight net loss despite its robust EBITDA. I would highlight 3 factors depressing net income: one, significant depreciation and amortization expense attributable to the company's recent acquisitions; two, accelerated amortization of the Consolidated Container trade name, which will be fully amortized by the end of the year; and three, the effect of rising resin prices in Q3.
Since there is a contractual lag in Altium's ability to pass through these costs to customers, the company absorbed the cost in the quarter without recognizing the offsetting revenue. This lag is temporary and will reverse as the costs are passed through to customers.
Altium's focus on new business is bearing fruit and should benefit results in future periods. The company has been very successful over the past months in gaining new accounts by demonstrating reliability, continued innovation and customer focus during this difficult COVID period.
Turning to the parent company. Pretax net investment income was $23 million, down from $36 million last year and $110 million last quarter. The year-over-year and linked quarter declines were driven by returns on equities and LP investments.
During Q3 2020, we received $90 million in dividends from CNA. We expect to receive dividends from both CNA and Boardwalk during the fourth quarter. We repurchased 5.4 million shares of Loews common stock during the quarter at an aggregate cost of $195 million. We purchased an additional 667,000 shares since quarter end.
Loews ended the quarter with $3.5 billion in parent company cash investments with cash and equivalents accounting for over 80% of the portfolio.
Let me now turn the call back to Mary."

On a very rough basis, CNA comprises about half of the value of Loews, with the other half being our net cash, the -- our assessment of the value of Boardwalk, of Altium and our hotel business. But even beyond just being a marker, there are other reasons to keep CNA as a public company. First, being public is important to attracting top talent.
The top executives want in -- top executives in any company want at least a portion of their compensation to be based on the performance of the shares of their company. And by being public, CNA is to provide that incentive to its top talent. 
Secondly, and we think this is very important, the transparency that comes from being public is important to CNA's regulators as well as to rating agencies. As everybody knows, I think that CNA trades at a ridiculously low valuation and that the P&C industry stocks, likewise, traded a crazy valuation.
And finally, our share repurchases of Loews stock allows us to take advantage of the discount valuation that CNA is trading at as well as the discount in Loews' shares for its non-CNA assets. That all adds up to what we like to call a very significant double discount in our share repurchases."

This has certainly been a banner year for cats and cat losses, and not only for CNA, but for the industry overall. There have been only 4 quarters over the past 40 quarters where CNA has experienced net cats coming in a",390,"Well, Mary, you're certainly right. This has certainly been a banner year for cats and cat losses, and not only for CNA, but for the industry overall. There have been only 4 quarters over the past 40 quarters where CNA has experienced net cats coming in at or above $160 million. And 2 of those 4 quarters over the past 10 years occurred in 2020.
At CNA, through the third quarter, our pretax cat losses were more than $530 million compared to just $128 million last year. Even if you exclude the losses from COVID and from civil unrest, which were roughly about, say, $250 million, CNA's year-to-date cat losses would still be running at more than twice last year's level and, of course, well ahead of their plan.
But despite these really exceptional events and catastrophes, I'm impressed by how the P&C industry and also CNA are managing through it all. If someone had told me in January that 2020 would be filled with storms, fires, civil unrest and the pandemic, I would have told you that CNA would have a miserable year as a result. However, despite this litany of events, CNA is still quite profitable with $400 million of core income and $300 million of net income through the third quarter.
And it continues to find profitable avenues for growth. All the more so, thanks to the hard rate market that the insurance industry is currently experiencing. Cat losses come with a territory in the property and casualty industry. And we believe that CNA is effectively managing its cat exposure while also getting strong rate increases on cat-exposed businesses. 
So let me end this by adding one stray thought. The insurance industry hasn't always been financially prudent. And this is the advantage of being associated with a particular industry for over 40 years. I have a little historical perspective here. There were years back in the '70s, '80s and '90s when the industry did not have true capital discipline, and they would write business at just about any price.
Today, the industry is reacting to catastrophic events and low interest rates by getting rate increases where they are justified. In my view, this change is a result of an increased demand from equity investors for profitability which has led to insurance management's increased focus on capital efficiency."

As I said in my prepared remarks, CNA's long-term care exposure is likely the biggest reason why CNA's valuation lags its peers. And as I also said, for the past 7 years, CNA has been actively managing its long-term care book of business in order to reduce risk and also in order to optimize results.
Since 2015, CNA's exposure to long-term care has been materially reduced with a number of active policies, declining by over 30%. And additionally, over the past few years, CNA has been able to further reduce its risk profile of its long-term care block of business by achieving meaningful premium rate increases and also offering policyholders attractive options to reduce benefits in return for reduced future premiums. 
Dino Robusto and Al Miralles, on their call today, focused on long-term care. And I suggest that everyone review their remarks and look at the significant information on long-term care that's posted on CNA's website. 
Let me make 2 additional comments on the net reserve charge that CNA took in the third quarter. First, and really very significantly, a $37 million net charge on a block this size is actually quite modest.
And secondly, the charge was attributable to the historically low level of interest rates that we're currently experiencing. With these latest estimated changes going forward, CNA is assuming that a 10-year treasury note will trade at slightly over 1% 3 years from now.
And likewise, in 2030, CNA is assuming that the 10-year note will yield, what historically is a paltry 2.75%. In my opinion, CNA is taking a very, very conservative view on future interest rates, which hopefully means that they won't have to adjust for lower interest rates again going forward."

Over the past several years, Boardwalk has focused on diversifying its customer base to include more end users, such as power plants, industrial customers and LNG off-takers, a strategy that proved beneficial this year. By diversifying in this way, Boardwalk has been able to strengthen the overall credit profile of its customer base. More than 70% of Boardwalk's revenue backlog is derived from investment-grade companies. And Boardwalk has letters of credit or other types of collateral from some of its customers that are not investment-grade or are unrated, which provide an additional measure of security. 
In 2020, in this year, one of Boardwalk's customers declared bankruptcy and another seems to be on the verge. Because of the credit protections in place for these customers, and importantly, the ability to remarket any return capacity, these bankruptcies will not have a material financial impact on the company. 
Stepping back, since the pandemic hit in mid-March, Boardwalk has maintained uninterrupted service to its customers while simultaneously taking measures to ensure the safety of its employees and its operations. At the end of the third quarter, Boardwalk had well over $9 billion in contracted revenues, with over $600 million of net new contracts added to backlog during 2020."

And Jim already commented on it, but let me just provide a little more detail. When Loews Hotels suspended operations at almost all its properties in the early spring, we estimated that negative cash flow would average around $25 million per month. We went on to say that management would reopen a property if doing so was expected to improve that property's cash flow.
Loews Hotels has responded to the pandemic-induced sudden downturn by transforming its operating model, including dramatically reducing property level and management company expenses. As we all know, properties began coming back online during the second quarter. 13 properties resumed operations during Q2, another 6 during Q3 and 1 more hotel last week. 
As anticipated, Loews Hotels' cash flow has improved as properties have resumed operations. Expenses have been managed aggressively and capital spending has been rightsized for the current environment. While the company continues to generate negative cash flow, it is significantly less than the $25 million per month cited in April. I'd be remiss in not mentioning how difficult the past 8 months have been for Loews Hotels' team members. Thousands of employees were furloughed when the pandemic struck and less than half of the furlough team members have returned to active duty.
Early on, Loews Hotels put programs in place to assist its affected team members, including a multimillion-dollar relief fund as well as continuing to provide medical insurance for furloughed employees for several months. Additionally, Loews Hotels has instituted enhanced safety and wellbeing standards and protocols for team members and guests. 
And as a reminder, in solidarity with all Loews Hotels' team members being financially impacted by this crisis, all 3 members of our office of the President, Jim, John and Andrew Tisch, reduced their salaries by 50% as of April 1 and their bonuses by 50% for the entire year. Back to you, Mary."

And secondly, the company is focused on developing and operating hotels for the group business. 
While the hotel recovery is currently powered by leisure travel, we really do believe that the corporate travel along with meetings and events will come back as the pandemic wanes. But before the pandemic hit, Loews Hotels had begun to evaluate their portfolio and to sell a few hotels that didn't align with the current growth strategy, and they continue to do so opportunistically, including one hotel that was sold earlier this year in Canada.
At the start of this year, Loews Hotels had 3 projects under development and scheduled for opening this week -- this year. Two of those hotels, the Live by Loews in St. Louis and the Loews Kansas City Hotel have already opened, and the hotels are doing just fine in light of the current environment for hotels. 
The third hotel under development is the 1,000-room Endless Summer Dockside Inn and Suites, which is located in Universal's Orlando Theme Park. This property is in the final stage of development, and its opening date will be announced very soon. The hotel will be our eighth hotel on the Universal campus and will bring our Universal room count to nearly 9,000 rooms or just about half of the total rooms in the Loews Hotels system.
Loews Hotels, they continue to remain focused on its strategy of developing hotels in markets that have unique built-in demand generators and potential for group business."

While there's been a steady increase in demand, occupancy rates still remain considerably below historic norms. That's really important. Occupancy rates are still below historic norms. The recovery is currently being led by leisure business and more than half of Loews Hotels assets fit well into that category, such as our properties on the Universal Orlando campus.
As well as other assets like the Loews Miami Beach Hotel and the Live by Loews in Arlington, Texas, which just hosted the world series, we're seeing, in fact, a lot more driving business than we've really ever seen before.

I mentioned this in my remarks, but let me go over it again. Demand for the company's products has been strong overall. There are certain products that benefited from COVID actually, product segments such as household chemicals, beverages and personal care. And there are others that were somewhat weakened by COVID. Those would include automotive, commercial, food service and school dairy, although I would point out that the weaker segments began to rebound in the third quarter.
Two bright spots this year for Altium are Envision, the company's recycling business, and Altium Healthcare, a business created from recent acquisitions that diversifies Altium into the growing pharmaceutical packaging market.
And as I mentioned earlier, Envision has been experiencing its best performance since 2014. And as for Altium Healthcare, it's exceeding expectations due to strong synergies as well as continued progress on operational efficiencies and other savings initiatives. As a result, Altium Healthcare is ahead of plan for the year despite COVID-19.
So I would say net-net, the company's overall results are running modestly above plan, a plan that was finalized prepandemic. And I would go on to say that commercially, Altium's new business efforts have been very successful over the past few months. 
I think the company is winning new accounts by differentiating itself by demonstrating reliability, continued innovation and customer focus during this difficult COVID period. So we hope that this focus on new business and the new business wins should benefit financial results in future periods. Back to you, Mary."
