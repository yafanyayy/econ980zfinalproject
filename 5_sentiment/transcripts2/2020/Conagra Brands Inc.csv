Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our third quarter fiscal 2020 earnings call. On behalf of Conagra Brands, I want to start by expressing my heartfelt hope that you and your families are staying safe during this unprecedented time. 
Today, I'm going to address 2 main topics: our response to COVID-19 and its impact on our business as well as the underlying trends that we saw in the third quarter, which ended just before the impact of COVID-19 started. Rest assured that we're taking all necessary precautions to protect the health and safety of our employees and our ability to safely and reliably meet consumers' needs. For the most recent status of our efforts to respond to COVID-19, please visit conagrabrands.com. We'll continue to provide updated information on our site as the situation evolves. 
As I'll describe in more detail in a moment, we've taken a number of steps to ensure our supply chain continues to operate well. We're incredibly proud of our teams who have been producing and delivering without disruption. While we all remain focused on executing through this rapidly evolving situation, I don't want to lose sight of the fact that we've made significant progress against the operational objectives we established for fiscal 2020. In many ways, our progress against these objectives is enhancing our ability to navigate this crisis. Recall, at the outset of fiscal 2020, we set out to execute on integration, synergy capture and deleveraging, drive strong consumption growth in frozen and snacks, improved trends in Hunt's Tomatoes and Chef Boyardee and the trend in the Legacy Pinnacle business and drive innovation and growth in Gardein. I'm proud to say that through the third quarter, we remain squarely on track with all of these objectives. 
And from a financial standpoint, the third quarter results are in line with the expectations we provided at CAGNY. As we previously described, industry softness, which started in December in foodservice and pivoted to retail in January, put pressure on consumption trends in several of our key categories, which more than offset share gains. As expected, consumption trends recovered in February prior to COVID-19 impact. It's important to keep in mind that our third quarter ended on February 23. At that time, there were very few reported cases in the U.S. and notably no widespread change in behavior. As we all know, that has changed significantly in recent weeks. From the second week of our fiscal fourth quarter-to-date, we've experienced the unprecedented impact of COVID-19 as consumers have stocked up on food and shift rapidly to eating more at home. Given the quality of our brands and the categories we participate in, Conagra is well positioned to serve consumers during this time of disruption and extraordinary demand. Our team is hard at work in close coordination with our customers to ensure that consumers have access to the food they need to stay safe at home. At this point, the magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 impact is still uncertain. However, I can tell you that we expect to exceed our prior full year guidance for total company sales and profit metrics, assuming the end-to-end supply chain continues to operate effectively. We will provide more detail on the impact of COVID-19 in a moment. But first, we would like to walk you through the highlights of the third quarter. 
During the third quarter, our performance was in line with the updated expectations that we provided at CAGNY. Organic net sales growth decreased 1.7%, while our adjusted operating margin was 15.7%, and our adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations was $0.47 for the quarter. As we noted at CAGNY, we saw category softness in January that was greater than anticipated. At the time, we told you that our more recent data was improving, and we expect it to bounce back, and that's exactly what happened. 
As you can see on Slide 7, Total Conagra retail sales returned to growth in the final 4 weeks of February and sustained a normal rate into the first week of Q4. Clearly, even before the current disruption due to COVID-19, we were well on track and had already seen the expected rebound in consumption trends. 
Not only did we see growth of 0.9% in the 4 weeks ended February 23, but what we saw in the week ended March 1, which is in our fiscal fourth quarter, reaffirmed this return to consumption growth. And during the quarter, we continued to deliver on integration, synergies and deleveraging. On integration, we have been converting Legacy Pinnacle plants over to SAP. And through Q3, this multiyear process has been progressing on plan. We captured $33 million in incremental synergies, increasing our total through the end of Q3 million to $145 million. And we made further progress on reducing our net debt position by paying down $450 million of debt during the quarter. 
Slide 9 demonstrates our continued success in the important frozen category. As both graphics demonstrate, we maintained strong growth during the quarter across our frozen portfolio, both for Total Conagra Brands and Legacy Conagra Brands. As we will discuss later in the presentation, Total Conagra's frozen growth has been driven by both Legacy Conagra and Legacy Pinnacle. 
Slide 10 shows the outsized performance of Conagra's Frozen Meals within the category. Not only did we have yet another quarter of gaining share of shelf and share of sales, but we also did so at an accelerated rate. 
Our snacks segment reported solid growth in the third quarter. Total snacks were up 2.9% during the quarter and 8.7% on a 2-year basis. Our results were led by our meat snacks and seeds businesses, which delivered growth of 8.4% and 5.9%, respectively. 
And as Slide 12 shows, we continue to gain share in many of our snack categories in Q3. 
Another key objective for fiscal 2020 was to improve trends in Hunt's tomatoes and Chef Boyardee. As you can see on Slide 13, that's just what we've done. Over the 5-week period ended February 23, Hunt's tomatoes and Chef Boyardee gained 2.2% and 4.5% in dollar sales growth, respectively. And both brands also grew share of retail sales over that same period, as outlined on Slide 14. It's worth noting that these trends for Hunt's tomatoes and Chef Boyardee continued into the first week of our fiscal fourth quarter prior to the impact of COVID-19. 
Slide 15 shows a milestone for Conagra as we bent the trend on Legacy Pinnacle on both a 1-year and a 2-year basis. Recall that in December 2018, we outlined a number of actions that were needed to get Pinnacle back on track. We also indicated that we did not expect to see the impact of those actions until the second half of fiscal 2020, which, as you can see here, is exactly what has occurred. 
And Slide 16 shows how we've been able to bend the trend in the big 3 legacy Pinnacle brands by implementing the Conagra Way playbook. We started with Wish-Bone, where the missteps came from several executional issues, including a label change, which we quickly addressed to stabilize the brand. As a result, we saw an immediate spike in retail sales before returning to more normal levels. 
Birds Eye, which is our biggest brand, took a little longer as the playbook required us to remove lower-performing SKUs, which negatively impacted sales and distribution. Notably, Birds Eye is now contributing to our growth as the innovation we launched in the first half of fiscal 2020 builds momentum with more innovation to come. 
With respect to Duncan Hines, we've made great progress on reframing the brand as a sweet treat but recognize that there's more work to be done. We're focused on introducing more on-trend innovation as we trim lower-performing SKUs. While it will take time to return this brand to growth, we're confident in the ongoing implementation of the Conagra Way playbook. 
Another Legacy Pinnacle brand that has benefited from the Conagra Way is Gardein, which is accelerating at very strong rates. As a reminder, we've made significant investments to expand Gardein's manufacturing capacity, which came online earlier this fiscal year. As the slide shows, the brand's growth is attributed to more than just meatless burgers and includes meatless options for chicken, seafood and sausages, to name a few. As you can see, it's clear that we remained on track with all our fiscal 2020 operational objectives through the third quarter. 
Now let's turn to the current quarter and the balance of the year. Typically, we would be spending our time on this call reaffirming our guidance and discussing the short list of initiatives underway to close out the year. But this year is unprecedented, and the impact of COVID-19 will be significant. Let me start by saying that our top priorities right now are the health and safety of our employees as well as our ability to safely and responsibly meet customer and consumer needs. With respect to our results, the magnitude of the impact is difficult to predict. What we know to date, the Q4 retail demand surge is significant and spans multiple retail channels, including e-commerce. While our Foodservice segment is facing headwinds, that impact is more than offset by increased demand in our retail segments. Given the depth and breadth of our portfolio, we are well positioned to meet this increased demand for at-home consumption. Having all these brands and capabilities under one roof is enabling us to meet a wide array of customer and consumer demands. 
Importantly, we've been able to address this retail demand surge because of a strong business continuity plan that we were able to activate as soon as the market disruption began. I'm very proud of the extraordinary efforts across our company and the way our teams have supported each other and our business, all in the pursuit of ensuring that consumers are able to access food during this time. We have decided to temporarily delay some Legacy Pinnacle plants SAP implementation to prioritize supplying customers with the food they require now. But our integration plans are otherwise on track. We will continue to consider and prioritize our business needs as the COVID-19 situation unfolds. 
And I'd like to take a minute to talk a bit more about the Conagra team and, in particular, to highlight the exceptional work of our supply chain team. While demand has sharply increased, our order fulfillment rate so far in Q4 has remained above 90%. This is a testament to the systems we have in place and the commitment of our people. This has been remarkable to see, and I'd like to thank our Chief Supply Chain Officer, Dave Biegger, and the entire supply chain team for their incredible efforts. 
Our supplies of ingredients and packaging remain sufficient, and we've experienced minimal disruption so far in the quarter. All of our North America manufacturing facilities are open and running at high levels of utilization, and our distribution network remains fully operational. Our plants and locations have the resources and critical equipment they need to operate in full compliance with current regulations and CDC guidance. And I'm proud of the remarkable level of collaboration among our sales, customer order management and supply chain teams. That collaboration, along with the work we're doing with customers is enabling us to ensure we are able to supply consumers with the food they need. Great job all around. 
Although providing specific Q4 guidance is not possible due to the uncertainty of this situation, we do want to give you a sense of our experience so far. The chart on Slide 20 shows what we've seen in the market to date. You can see that there has been a material increase in demand the past few weeks. While some categories are benefiting more than others, all categories and all temperature states are seeing increases. In addition to a significant uptick in sales, our execution has enabled Conagra to outperform and gain share in the categories in which we compete. The data we're showing in the chart is only measured channel data. It's important to note that demand has surged broadly across retail channels, including e-commerce as well as for pickup and delivery, most of which are not reflected in this data. Similar to our measured channel retail business, our e-commerce business is also up in sales, outpacing the competition and gaining share. 
Overall, we made good progress during the third quarter of the year. Our quarterly results were in line with our updated expectations, and we remained on track with all of our fiscal 2020 operational objectives. Going forward, our teams are prioritizing health and safety, adapting well and operating effectively to ensure consumers are able to access food they need. And while this is clearly an unprecedented time, we will not lose focus on executing the Conagra Way playbook. Our brand-building and innovation processes remain critical pieces to our long-term success. We're updating our full year guidance today to note that we now expect to exceed our prior full year guidance for total company sales and profit metrics. 
Beyond fiscal 2020, it's important to note that we are also working with customers as they reevaluate the timing of promotions and shelf resets as they look to minimize in-store disruption during this time of surging demand. Finally, while the situation is still evolving, we believe the sharp increase in at-home eating occasions is generating trial among new consumers that we did not anticipate accessing. We view this dynamic as a long-term opportunity for our portfolio overall and, in particular, our leading frozen business. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Dave."

Before I get into the details, I want to remind you that Q3 has been the first full quarter following the anniversary of the Pinnacle acquisition. As",2036,"Thanks, Sean, and good morning, everyone. I hope you and your families are all staying healthy and safe. Before I get into the details, I want to remind you that Q3 has been the first full quarter following the anniversary of the Pinnacle acquisition. As a result, Pinnacle's full quarterly results are now reflected in our organic figures. 
I'll start my remarks this morning by calling out a few highlights from our performance for the quarter, which are outlined on Slide 23. As Sean discussed, our Q3 performance was consistent with the expectations we've provided at CAGNY. This included broad-based category softness early in the quarter, and a return to consumption growth in February, prior to the COVID-19 related surge in demand. I'll unpack these results further in the slides to come. But overall, for the third quarter, reported net sales were down 5.6% versus the same period a year ago, with organic net sales down 1.7%. The organic net sales decline was in line with the updated expectations that we provided in February. 
Adjusted gross profit decreased 10.5%, and adjusted operating profit declined 8.9%. We continued to operate efficiently from an SG&A perspective, capturing strong synergies. 
Adjusted EBITDA, which includes equity method investment earnings and pension and postretirement nonservice income, decreased 7.1% in the quarter. And adjusted diluted EPS decreased 7.8% to $0.47 for the quarter. Again, this was in line with our updated expectations. 
Let's jump into net sales a bit more. Slide 24 depicts the 5.6% change versus the same period a year ago. As you can see, the broad-based category softness that we discussed at CAGNY drove our volume down 1.3%. Also, our price/mix was unfavorable 40 basis points as we continue to support many of our brands with incremental promotions. As I mentioned on prior quarterly calls, we expect that our year-over-year change in retailer investments to be much smaller and less material in the second half of fiscal '20 and beyond, now that this type of spending is in our base. As a result, we will no longer be breaking out that bridging item and will return to our historical approach of showing just the impact of price/mix overall. 
Moving to Slide 25, you can find our sales summary by segment. In the quarter, organic net sales for the Grocery & Snacks segment decreased 3.6%. The snacks business continued to perform well. However, this segment was negatively affected by weather with a warmer-than-normal winter this year stacked against an abnormally cold prior year. On a reported net sales basis, divestiture activity subtracted 5.9%. The organic net sales for Refrigerated & Frozen increased 0.3% as the frozen business continued to perform well behind the recent innovation launches. Importantly, as Sean mentioned, we saw Frozen Meals continue to gain share at an accelerated rate in the quarter. The strength in the frozen business continued to be somewhat masked by declines in the refrigerated business. 
Turning to our international segment. Quarterly net sales and organic net sales for the segment decreased 3.2% and 1.9%, respectively. Throughout the quarter, the segment continued to benefit from the growth in the Canadian snacks business and frozen businesses. Recall that earlier this year, we said that the business in India had a transitory headwind that would rebound in the second half, and that is what we saw in Q3. These benefits were more than offset by economic challenges, primarily in Mexico, and certain planned value-over-volume actions. 
Net sales for the Foodservice segment decreased 8% in Q3, while organic net sales decreased 2.2% as divestitures subtracted 5.8%. The organic net sales decrease was driven by volume declines of 4.6% as a result of soft industry traffic trends early in the quarter that were partially offset by a 2.4% improvement in price/mix. 
Turning to Slide 26, you can see the adjusted operating bridge for the quarter versus the prior year. As I mentioned on our second quarter call, input cost inflation did start to increase in Q3. In the quarter, inflation was just over 3%, which translated into a 240 basis point headwind to margin. Importantly, however, our gross margin expansion levers such as realized productivity, pricing, mix and synergies continue to be effective in Q3. The increased promotional support in the quarter partially offset these benefits resulting in a 90 basis point improvement in gross margin. A&P had only a modest impact on margin in the quarter, while reduced SG&A spend benefited our operating margin by 100 basis points during the quarter. 
Slide 27 highlights the significant progress that we've made to date on our overall synergy capture from the Pinnacle acquisition. In Q3, we realized $33 million of incremental synergies, bringing our total synergy capture through the end of Q3 to $145 million. We remain on track to achieve approximately $180 million of synergies by the end of fiscal '20, with $20 million being reinvested into longer-term business opportunities.  We also remain on track to deliver our total synergy target of $305 million, again, with $20 million of that being reinvested into longer-term business opportunities. 
Turning to Slide 28, you will see an outline of our adjusted operating profit and operating margin for the third quarter. Our adjusted operating profit decreased 8.9% in Q3, and our adjusted operating margin came in at 15.7%. Across our segments, realized productivity and cost synergies benefited our operating profit in the quarter. These benefits were more than offset by the impacts of higher input costs, lower organic net sales, inventory write-offs, lost profit from divested businesses. 
Slide 29 outlines the various drivers of our Q3 adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations. In Q3, our adjusted diluted EPS of $0.47 decreased by $0.04 compared to the same period a year ago. The decrease in adjusted operating profit and higher tax rate during the quarter more than offset the benefit from improved pension income and interest. 
Slide 30 summarizes Conagra's net debt and cash flow information. I'm sure that our perspective on the balance sheet and liquidity are top of mind in these uncertain times. I'll start by reminding you that we have made significant progress towards our deleveraging and free cash flow targets in recent quarters. Since the closing of the Pinnacle acquisition through the end of Q3, we have reduced total gross debt by over $1.5 billion, improving our balance sheet and the overall health of our business. With respect to Q3, we reduced debt by $450 million while our net debt balance at quarter end was $9.9 billion, and the net debt leverage ratio was 4.8x. At the end of the third quarter, our average debt maturity was approximately 8.8 years. Our weighted average coupon was approximately 4.7%, and approximately 92% of our total debt was fixed. 
Free cash flow year-to-date is $641 million, marking an improvement of over $100 million against the same period last year. We remain on schedule with our deleveraging targets and are confident we will achieve our fiscal '21 leverage target of 3.6 to 3.5x. 
Overall, we remain confident in the strength of our balance sheet, and we have many options for maintaining liquidity. First, we ended the quarter with $99 million of cash on hand. We expect stronger cash flows in Q4 due to the normal seasonality of our business and because of the increased retail demand we're experiencing in light of COVID-19. Our capital allocation priorities remain constant. We are committed to maintaining our dividend, deleveraging and maintaining a solid investment-grade credit rating. Along these lines, we anticipate deleveraging further in Q4 of fiscal '20. 
In addition to cash flow from operations, we also have a $1.6 billion fully undrawn revolving credit facility. During certain months of the year, we issued commercial paper against this revolver to fund working capital needs. We did not need to access the commercial paper markets during Q3, and we don't anticipate needing access during the rest of Q4. Given our strong cash flow and borrowing capacity, we have many options available to fund upcoming debt maturities in August and October. 
At CAGNY last month, we discussed that we continue to explore smart divestitures that can help sculpt top line performance and generate cash flow to support deleveraging. By smart, we mean ensuring that any potential divestiture will deliver a valuation that exceeds our intrinsic value. In this environment, our brands are growing and play an important role for consumers, and they are generating sales and cash flow in excess of historic levels. While we continue to evaluate portfolio actions, we do not feel pressure to pursue any divestitures that are not value-creating. 
Now recognizing that our new guidance isn't specific, I want to give you some color on what we do know and what we don't know at this point. What we do know is that our retail businesses have seen accelerating shipments. In our domestic retail business, which is about 80% of total company sales, total fourth quarter-to-date shipments have increased approximately 50% versus last year, similar to the most recent consumption data. Internationally, the impact has been a bit mixed, with the Canada retail business seeing increased demand but some softness in global export. All told, quarter to-go retail shipments are difficult to predict, given the wide range of possible outcomes. Just as the retail businesses are seeing a surge in demand, our Foodservice business, which is about 10% of total company sales, is beginning to experience the negative impact of the COVID-19 situation. So far in Q4, Foodservice shipment declines have accelerated, and trends imply a Q4 organic net sales decline that could be in the range of down 50% to 60% versus last year. 
Turning to profit. As you would expect, we believe that the significant demand surge in the retail businesses, which are the vast majority of our sales will positively benefit profit versus our prior guidance. We also expect that the mix of sales and operating leverage of the increased volume will benefit gross margins. Just how much is too speculative to forecast at this time as we are also increasing investment where needed to ensure we support the surge in demand. We are incredibly proud of the investment we are making in the supply chain to meet demand. Not only are we investing as needed to meet customer orders, but we are providing direct financial support and recognition to our people and communities. 
I'd now like to turn to our fiscal '20 guidance on Slide 33. It was just a bit over a month ago that we shared our updated fiscal '20 guidance. And as we told you at CAGNY, we were already seeing improving trends in our categories, giving us confidence in our ability to deliver those updated results. However, as a result of what I just discussed about Q4 to date, we are now unable to forecast Q4 with specificity, but we can say that we expect to exceed the full year guidance on all sales, profit and cash flow metrics. Although this situation remains highly dynamic, we now see upside to the guidance we provided due to the quarter-to-date surge in consumer demand and the related sales and profit impacts. What we don't know is how long the impacts of this pandemic will last. Nor do we know exactly how consumers will continue to adapt to the situation in the immediate term or in the longer term as we move into fiscal '21. As Sean mentioned earlier, our portfolio is well positioned to meet this increased consumer demand, and our team is focused on working with customers to make sure that orders and shipments remain uninterrupted during this time of need. As long as our strong execution continues and there are no other material disruptions to our ability to provide products safely to our customers, we expect to exceed our fiscal '20 guidance across all sales, profit and cash flow metrics. 
Thanks for listening, everyone. That concludes my remarks. Sean and I are happy to take questions. Tom McGough and Darren Serrao are not joining us today as we wanted to minimize the number of speakers since we are managing this Q&A from different locations this morning. 
I'll now pass it back to the operator. Thank you."

Any perspective there would be really helpful. And then I've just got a follow-up."

Let me tackle that. The concept you're raising is that because we've got this crisis situation and people are eating much more at home and not away from home, products like ours are getting levels of trial that were not anticipated, and that could turn into consistent users over time as that trial converts to repeat. 
I would tell you, that makes sense to me, both intuitively and in terms of the very early data we're beginning to see. There's been a massive amount of transformation in our categories in the last 5 years. Frozen, in particular, doesn't even closely resemble the category that it used to be. The quality of the food is in a completely different place. And we've seen consumers so far who have tried that new food respond extremely favorably to it, and large established brands that had long been forgotten are growing strongly again. 
Now because of this crisis situation, people are at home. As you know, everybody can see it. They're stocking up, and they're stocking up with foods of all kinds across all temperature states, including categories like frozen. So just logically, we know we are getting higher levels of trial here during this phenomenon. In terms of data that backs it up, quite frankly, it's just too early to point to a lot of data points. The one place I can tell you that we do look that tends to be a leading indicator is e-commerce. And in the world of e-commerce, what we are seeing is that we are reaching a large number of new triers that we had not reached previously. Now as you think about how that might convert to repeat, you all are probably accustomed to looking at national average repeat rates. Repeat rates will vary depending upon the users. So early adopters, super heavy users will have higher repeat than light users. When you get new triers like this, you tend to be getting lighter users. So it may not be the kind of repeat rates we get from super heavy users. But the point of all of this is it should help categories like frozen. It should help some of our other categories that people may have forgotten about, but it's just too early to quantify the impact of that. 
I would also tell you that we do expect, as this thing gets behind us, that we'll see a return to people eating out. Americans love their restaurants. They love to eat out. And obviously, the foodservice space is is hurting badly right now, and so we're rooting for that side of the business to bounce back as well."

On the other hand, there are some increased costs, as you've talked about, whether it be for employee benefits and things like that and just the simple inefficiencies of maybe running at, whatever, 100% utilization in it. It sounded like you may not know the exact magnitude in the way it all comes together, but the balance of those things, at least what you're seeing so far, are more to the positive than the negative.

The priority right now is producing the maximum amount of food that we could possibly produce. And we are running our plants 7 days, as you might imagine, to do that. We have pared back on some of our SKUs so that we can continue to serve the highest-velocity SKUs. So keeping food and stock that we can feed America is our top priority right now as it is the priority of our retailers. That has caused us to reprioritize in terms of SKUs. And in the case of the innovation resets, I would tell you, the word that comes to mind for me is fluid. We are hearing different things from different customers. Many customers, most customers are just trying to keep products on the shelf right now. Some customers, big ones have said to us that they want to continue with the shelf set timing. Others had said, we're going to push that back a bit just so we can ensure that we don't have any complexity in anything going on at the store shelves that's going to be a distraction from keeping products in stock. So we are trying to respond to all of our customers' requests so we can do whatever they want. 
In terms of our philosophy on innovation overall, it hasn't changed. It is a central part of the Conagra Way that we're going to keep building out our innovation pipeline. So it's industry-leading, and we're very confident we've got that. We're, as you know, from CAGNY, incredibly excited about the innovation slate that lies ahead. How it flows into the marketplace now will probably be a little bit more customer-by-customer than all in a tighter window as we previously expected. But I think it will be good news overall because we'll have the benefit of that innovation and the pipeline fill helping us next year. 
With respect to promotional activity, as you know, we've cut more promotions in the last 5 years and just about any company in food as we pursue value over volume. We have gotten more aggressive in the last year where we've seen Competition Act irrationally and we needed to defend our market shares, but that has not been in a broad-based way. What I would tell you on promotions right now is we're honoring all the contracts we have in place, but the tactical dynamic is that we're in daily discussions with our customers on how to help them meet the needs of their shoppers. And many customers are looking to pull back on promotions as they try to manage the basics of just keeping their shelves stocked. And running promotions can exacerbate out of stocks, which is clearly not their goal right now. So we're seeing some cutback on that, and that will just be more of a timing issue than anything else.

We are -- remain committed to solid investment grade credit rating. Since we've closed on Pinnacle, we paid down over $1.5 billion in gross debt. 
For Q4, we expect to be cash positive at a higher level than we previously anticipated, and that additional cash flow we're going to use to pay down debt. So we don't expect we're going to be net cash flow positive in the fourth quarter at higher-than-expected levels. So as we finish the fiscal year, we'll have our full $1.6 billion revolving credit line, which will be undrawn, and we don't have any debt maturities in Q4 of this year. So as we look to fiscal '21, we have $1.1 billion in debt maturities for the full fiscal year. Our August maturities of $127 million, we expect it to fund that from cash on hand. Our next maturities of $775 million are in October. And we'll have flexibility to fund that from the higher expected free cash flow from the business, and we'll just have to see where we land with that, given the upside that we're seeing right now. We can access our revolver where we can refinance in the form of either term loans or investment grade notes. 
So as we've been doing every day with our advisers, we'll continue to monitor the markets and evaluate the best structure for Conagra and stay in a position of readiness because, I mean, if you look at the market today, as you know, the bank markets are significantly different than they were 2 weeks ago. And I expect that they'll be significantly different a month from now. And so we want to constantly look, see what the markets are saying. But the good news is that we're cash flow positive. We're generating cash. We're going to use that cash to pay down debt, and we have our full revolver, so I think our liquidity is very strong."

But simply put, until we're on the other side of this pandemic, sales growth is likely to remain elevated because you've got most of the food away-from-home volume is moving to food at home. And so we've got obviously lots of experience with how pantries and warehouses get filled by customers and consumers around situations like hurricanes, and you always see big volumes move into warehouses at the customer level and into pantries and freezers and refrigerators at the consumer level. But how long the pull remains, in this particular case, is directly a function of how long does this thing last and how long are people sheltering in place? And I don't think anybody can predict right now when that is going to end. Obviously, the latest thinking here is that we will go until a minimum the end of April with people really spending lots and lots of time at home. And who knows how much further it can extend beyond that. So the way this works is the initial surge of volume is volume that is going to fill warehouses and to fill pantries. But with people not eating out away from home, I think a reasonable person could conclude that they're then in the mode of consuming that volume aggressively. And as they work down those pantry levels and warehouse levels come down to normal levels, then it just becomes kind of a just-in-time replenishment as long as the elevated level of consumption remains. So it's just too early to pins with any accuracy, but that's kind of the mechanics of how this works."

But I would just say that the unenviable task you all have of kind of coming up with consensus is very similar to the unenviable task we have of things like trying to contemplate fiscal '21 annual operating plan. As you might imagine, if it's business as usual, it's kind of one set of assumptions. If this thing were to continue, if it were to come back in the fall, as I read this morning, that's a whole another ball game. So it's an almost impossible thing to predict. Nobody has a crystal ball, but I think what you guys are going to be looking at the scanner data. What we look at is the scanner data to understand takeaway, what we look at or shipment patterns. And of course, we follow any -- all the health news on the national news every single day, multiple times a day. So I think we're in one of these times where we will endeavor to be incredibly transparent with what we're seeing, what we're thinking so that we can provide the best perspective we can provide while fully acknowledging that it's awfully -- it's impossible for us to be precise right now. Dave, do you want to add to that?"

We wanted to tell you what do we know right now and what don't we know? And from there, you could then kind of make some assumptions on sort of different scenarios. Sean said it. Since quarter-to-date on the retail side of the business, domestic retail, which is 80% of our business, shipments and consumption are in line. And so what I would say is consumption could be a good proxy to try to forecast quarter to go in the retail business since they're in line. There's no guarantee there, right, because you do have ebbs and flows with shipments versus consumption in a short amount of time. But that, I think, would be a proxy to be able to at least try to figure out how this is trending as we move forward. But there's no silver bullets here, unfortunately."

And then just quickly, in terms of your shelf-stable products, I feel like even at CAGNY, the focus here going forward, the strategy is more frozen snacks. Shelf-stable can have a place within the portfolio, but my feel at least is that you might look at some of those brands more proactively in terms of divestment potential. Now, I don't know, right? I mean, it seems like you highlighted today on the slides, said Hunt's, Chef Boyardee incrementally better before COVID-19 hit. Now there's a pantry load, my feel would be that those areas would actually now do better maybe than some other areas. 
So in terms of the tax asset that you have and kind of entire thought process around divestments and shelf stable, what have you, might. Is it fair to think that, at least for the time being, given everything that's going on that you kind of step back from that and say, ""well, let's just see how things settle, keep the business as is. We'll reevaluate as we kind of get through this a bit more. But yes, we still realize that we have a tax asset that's expiring at the end of next fiscal year."""

And the point I made today was financial rationale means that the valuation for any potential divested asset must exceed our intrinsic value for the asset. And given the growth we're seeing in our business, given the sales and cash flow at higher levels than they've historically been, that factors into kind of how we view those assets. They're generating a lot of cash for us right now. But my comments were meant to stress that we're going to continue to identify assets for divestiture, but if the potential price doesn't exceed the value to Conagra that we see the brands are worth, then we don't feel pressure to move forward. 
And so we have our capital loss carryforward. It doesn't -- it doesn't expire until the end of fiscal '21. And so as Sean said earlier, it's fluid, but we wanted to make sure that point was clear."

I would call it the staples business, and that's how we talked about it at CAGNY is we've got a decent-sized chunk of our portfolio in what we call staples, and these are products that people rely on. These are our products that drive a lot of foot traffic to our retailers. They're very important to the retailers. They tend to be high gross margin, good cash flow businesses. 
And as I pointed out, at CAGNY, just a small handful of them add up to a big, big chunk of our total staple sales. And so these businesses are very important to us when they're reliably contributing. And most of them have been reliably contributing, and they do a lot of good for our portfolio. On occasion, we've seen competitive activity or other dynamics drive weakness. And our philosophy historically has been, look, if we don't have a line of sight to stabilizing something on the top line and the bottom line, then we've divested it. And we've always been open to that. What Dave is pointing out is these are just different times where everything is moving. So it takes any kind of compulsion to want to move and do that and kind of reduces that because these are contributing a lot to us right now. But in general, the point that I wanted to make is our staples businesses across the board almost are very strong, valuable businesses to us. And we'll continue to monitor them to make sure that they are contributing reliably once we get through this pandemic, and then we'll go from there."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our third quarter fiscal 2020 earnings call. On behalf of Conagra Brands, I want to start by expressing my heartfelt hope that you and your families are staying safe during this unprecedented time. 
Today, I'm going to address 2 main topics: Our response to COVID-19 and its impact on our business as well as the underlying trends that we saw in the third quarter, which ended just before the impact of COVID-19 started. Rest assured that we're taking all necessary precautions to protect the health and safety of our employees and our ability to safely and reliably meet consumers' needs. For the most recent status of our efforts to respond to COVID-19, please visit conagrabrands.com. We'll continue to provide updated information on our site as the situation evolves. 
As I'll describe in more detail in a moment, we've taken a number of steps to ensure our supply chain continues to operate well. We're incredibly proud of our teams who have been producing and delivering without disruption. 
While we all remain focused on executing through this rapidly evolving situation, I don't want to lose sight of the fact that we've made significant progress against the operational objectives we established for fiscal 2020. In many ways, our progress against these objectives is enhancing our ability to navigate this crisis. Recall, at the outset of fiscal 2020, we set out to execute on integration, synergy capture and deleveraging, drive strong consumption growth in frozen and snacks, improved trends in Hunt's Tomatoes and Chef Boyardee and the trend in the Legacy Pinnacle business, and drive innovation and growth in Gardein. I'm proud to say that through the third quarter, we remain squarely on track with all of these objectives. 
And from a financial standpoint, the third quarter results are in line with the expectations we provided at CAGNY. As we previously described, industry softness, which started in December in foodservice and pivoted to retail in January, put pressure on consumption trends in several of our key categories, which more than offset share gains. As expected, consumption trends recovered in February prior to COVID-19 impact. It's important to keep in mind that our third quarter ended on February 23. At that time, there were very few reported cases in the U.S. and, notably, no widespread change in behavior. As we all know, that has changed significantly in recent weeks. From the second week of our fiscal fourth quarter-to-date, we've experienced the unprecedented impact of COVID-19 as consumers have stocked up on food and shift rapidly to eating more at home. Given the quality of our brands and the categories we participate in, Conagra is well positioned to serve consumers during this time of disruption and extraordinary demand. Our team is hard at work in close coordination with our customers to ensure that consumers have access to the food they need to stay safe at home. 
At this point, the magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 impact is still uncertain. However, I can tell you that we expect to exceed our prior full year guidance for total company sales and profit metrics, assuming the end-to-end supply chain continues to operate effectively. We will provide more detail on the impact of COVID-19 in a moment. But first, we would like to walk you through the highlights of the third quarter. 
During the third quarter, our performance was in line with the updated expectations that we provided at CAGNY. Organic net sales growth decreased 1.7%, while our adjusted operating margin was 15.7%, and our adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations was $0.47 for the quarter. As we noted at CAGNY, we saw category softness in January that was greater than anticipated. At the time, we told you that our more recent data was improving, and we expect it to bounce back, and that's exactly what happened. 
As you can see on Slide 7, Total Conagra retail sales returned to growth in the final 4 weeks of February and sustained a normal rate into the first week of Q4. Clearly, even before the current disruption due to COVID-19, we were well on track and had already seen the expected rebound in consumption trends. 
Not only did we see growth of 0.9% in the 4 weeks ended February 23, but what we saw in the week ended March 1, which is in our fiscal fourth quarter, reaffirmed this return to consumption growth. And during the quarter, we continued to deliver on integration, synergies and deleveraging. 
On integration, we have been converting Legacy Pinnacle plants over to SAP. And through Q3, this multiyear process has been progressing on plan. We captured $33 million in incremental synergies, increasing our total through the end of Q3 million to $145 million. And we made further progress on reducing our net debt position by paying down $450 million of debt during the quarter. 
Slide 9 demonstrates our continued success in the important frozen category. As both graphics demonstrate, we maintained strong growth during the quarter across our frozen portfolio, both for Total Conagra Brands and Legacy Conagra Brands. As we will discuss later in the presentation, Total Conagra's frozen growth has been driven by both Legacy Conagra and Legacy Pinnacle. 
Slide 10 shows the outsized performance of Conagra's Frozen Meals within the category. Not only did we have yet another quarter of gaining share of shelf and share of sales, but we also did so at an accelerated rate. 
Our snacks segment reported solid growth in the third quarter. Total snacks were up 2.9% during the quarter and 8.7% on a 2-year basis. Our results were led by our meat snacks and seeds businesses, which delivered growth of 8.4% and 5.9%, respectively. 
And as Slide 12 shows, we continued to gain share in many of our snack categories in Q3. 
Another key objective for fiscal 2020 was to improve trends in Hunt's tomatoes and Chef Boyardee. As you can see on Slide 13, that's just what we've done. Over the 5-week period ended February 23, Hunt's tomatoes and Chef Boyardee gained 2.2% and 4.5% in dollar sales growth, respectively. And both brands also grew share of retail sales over that same period, as outlined on Slide 14. It's worth noting that these trends for Hunt's tomatoes and Chef Boyardee continued into the first week of our fiscal fourth quarter prior to the impact of COVID-19. 
Slide 15 shows a milestone for Conagra as we bent the trend on Legacy Pinnacle on both a 1-year and a 2-year basis. Recall that in December 2018, we outlined a number of actions that were needed to get Pinnacle back on track. We also indicated that we did not expect to see the impact of those actions until the second half of fiscal 2020, which, as you can see here, is exactly what has occurred. 
And Slide 16 shows how we've been able to bend the trend in the big 3 legacy Pinnacle brands by implementing the Conagra Way playbook. We started with Wish-Bone, where the missteps came from several executional issues, including a label change, which we quickly addressed to stabilize the brand. As a result, we saw an immediate spike in retail sales before returning to more normal levels. 
Birds Eye, which is our biggest brand, took a little longer as the playbook required us to remove lower-performing SKUs, which negatively impacted sales and distribution. Notably, Birds Eye is now contributing to our growth as the innovation we launched in the first half of fiscal 2020 builds momentum with more innovation to come. 
With respect to Duncan Hines, we've made great progress on reframing the brand as a sweet treat but recognize that there's more work to be done. We're focused on introducing more on-trend innovation as we trim lower-performing SKUs. While it will take time to return this brand to growth, we're confident in the ongoing implementation of the Conagra Way playbook. 
Another Legacy Pinnacle brand that has benefited from the Conagra Way is Gardein, which is accelerating at very strong rates. As a reminder, we've made significant investments to expand Gardein's manufacturing capacity, which came online earlier this fiscal year. As the slide shows, the brand's growth is attributed to more than just meatless burgers and includes meatless options for chicken, seafood and sausages, to name a few. As you can see, it's clear that we remained on track with all our fiscal 2020 operational objectives through the third quarter. 
Now let's turn to the current quarter and the balance of the year. Typically, we would be spending our time on this call reaffirming our guidance and discussing the shortlist of initiatives underway to close out the year. But this year is unprecedented, and the impact of COVID-19 will be significant. 
Let me start by saying that our top priorities right now are the health and safety of our employees as well as our ability to safely and responsibly meet customer and consumer needs. With respect to our results, the magnitude of the impact is difficult to predict. What we know to date, the Q4 retail demand surge is significant and spans multiple retail channels, including e-commerce. While our Foodservice segment is facing headwinds, that impact is more than offset by increased demand in our retail segments. Given the depth and breadth of our portfolio, we are well positioned to meet this increased demand for at-home consumption. Having all these brands and capabilities under one roof is enabling us to meet a wide array of customer and consumer demands. 
Importantly, we've been able to address this retail demand surge because of a strong business continuity plan that we were able to activate as soon as the market disruption began. I'm very proud of the extraordinary efforts across our company and the way our teams have supported each other and our business, all in the pursuit of ensuring that consumers are able to access food during this time. We have decided to temporarily delay some Legacy Pinnacle plants SAP implementation to prioritize supplying customers with the food they require now. But our integration plans are otherwise on track. We will continue to consider and prioritize our business needs as the COVID-19 situation unfolds. 
And I'd like to take a minute to talk a bit more about the Conagra team and, in particular, to highlight the exceptional work of our supply chain team. While demand has sharply increased, our order fulfillment rate so far in Q4 has remained above 90%. This is a testament to the systems we have in place and the commitment of our people. This has been remarkable to see, and I'd like to thank our Chief Supply Chain Officer, Dave Biegger, and the entire supply chain team for their incredible efforts. 
Our supplies of ingredients and packaging remain sufficient, and we've experienced minimal disruption so far in the quarter. All of our North America manufacturing facilities are open and running at high levels of utilization, and our distribution network remains fully operational. Our plants and locations have the resources and critical equipment they need to operate in full compliance with current regulations and CDC guidance. And I'm proud of the remarkable level of collaboration among our sales, customer order management and supply chain teams. That collaboration, along with the work we're doing with customers, is enabling us to ensure we are able to supply consumers with the food they need. Great job all around. 
Although providing specific Q4 guidance is not possible due to the uncertainty of this situation, we do want to give you a sense of our experience so far. The chart on Slide 20 shows what we've seen in the market to date. You can see that there has been a material increase in demand the past few weeks. While some categories are benefiting more than others, all categories and all temperature states are seeing increases. In addition to a significant uptick in sales, our execution has enabled Conagra to outperform and gain share in the categories in which we compete. The data we're showing in the chart is only measured channel data. It's important to note that demand has surged broadly across retail channels, including e-commerce as well as for pickup and delivery, most of which are not reflected in this data. Similar to our measured channel retail business, our e-commerce business is also up in sales, outpacing the competition and gaining share. 
Overall, we made good progress during the third quarter of the year. Our quarterly results were in line with our updated expectations, and we remained on track with all of our fiscal 2020 operational objectives. Going forward, our teams are prioritizing health and safety, adapting well and operating effectively to ensure consumers are able to access food they need. And while this is clearly an unprecedented time, we will not lose focus on executing the Conagra Way playbook. Our brand-building and innovation processes remain critical pieces to our long-term success. We're updating our full year guidance today to note that we now expect to exceed our prior full year guidance for total company sales and profit metrics. 
Beyond fiscal 2020, it's important to note that we are also working with customers as they reevaluate the timing of promotions and shelf resets as they look to minimize in-store disruption during this time of surging demand. Finally, while the situation is still evolving, we believe the sharp increase in at-home eating occasions is generating trial among new consumers that we did not anticipate accessing. We view this dynamic as a long-term opportunity for our portfolio overall and, in particular, our leading frozen business. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Dave."

Before I get into the details, I want to remind you that Q3 has been the first full quarter following the anniversary of the Pinnacle acquisition. As",2029,"Thanks, Sean, and good morning, everyone. I hope you and your families are all staying healthy and safe. Before I get into the details, I want to remind you that Q3 has been the first full quarter following the anniversary of the Pinnacle acquisition. As a result, Pinnacle's full quarterly results are now reflected in our organic figures. 
I'll start my remarks this morning by calling out a few highlights from our performance for the quarter, which are outlined on Slide 23. As Sean discussed, our Q3 performance was consistent with the expectations we've provided at CAGNY. This included broad-based category softness early in the quarter, and a return to consumption growth in February prior to the COVID-19 related surge in demand. I'll unpack these results further in the slides to come. But overall, for the third quarter, reported net sales were down 5.6% versus the same period a year ago, with organic net sales down 1.7%. The organic net sales decline was in line with the updated expectations that we provided in February. 
Adjusted gross profit decreased 10.5%, and adjusted operating profit declined 8.9%. We continued to operate efficiently from an SG&A perspective, capturing strong synergies. 
Adjusted EBITDA, which includes equity method investment earnings and pension and postretirement non-service income, decreased 7.1% in the quarter. And adjusted diluted EPS decreased 7.8% to $0.47 for the quarter. Again, this was in line with our updated expectations. 
Let's jump into net sales a bit more. Slide 24 depicts the 5.6% change versus the same period a year ago. As you can see, the broad-based category softness that we discussed at CAGNY drove our volume down 1.3%. Also, our price/mix was unfavorable 40 basis points as we continued to support many of our brands with incremental promotions. As I mentioned on prior quarterly calls, we expect that our year-over-year change in retailer investments to be much smaller and less material in the second half of fiscal '20 and beyond now that this type of spending is in our base. As a result, we will no longer be breaking out that bridging item and will return to our historical approach of showing just the impact of price/mix overall. 
Moving to Slide 25, you can find our sales summary by segment. In the quarter, organic net sales for the Grocery & Snacks segment decreased 3.6%. The snacks business continued to perform well. However, this segment was negatively affected by weather with a warmer-than-normal winter this year stacked against an abnormally cold prior year. On a reported net sales basis, divestiture activity subtracted 5.9%. Organic net sales for Refrigerated & Frozen increased 0.3% as the frozen business continued to perform well behind the recent innovation launches. Importantly, as Sean mentioned, we saw Frozen Meals continue to gain share at an accelerated rate in the quarter. The strength in the frozen business continued to be somewhat masked by declines in the refrigerated business. 
Turning to our international segment. Quarterly net sales and organic net sales for the segment decreased 3.2% and 1.9%, respectively. Throughout the quarter, the segment continued to benefit from the growth in the Canadian snacks business and frozen businesses. Recall that earlier this year, we said that the business in India had a transitory headwind that would rebound in the second half, and that is what we saw in Q3. These benefits were more than offset by economic challenges, primarily in Mexico, and certain planned value-over-volume actions. 
Net sales for the Foodservice segment decreased 8% in Q3, while organic net sales decreased 2.2% as divestitures subtracted 5.8%. The organic net sales decrease was driven by volume declines of 4.6% as a result of soft industry traffic trends early in the quarter that were partially offset by a 2.4% improvement in price/mix. 
Turning to Slide 26, you can see the adjusted operating bridge for the quarter versus the prior year. As I mentioned on our second quarter call, input cost inflation did start to increase in Q3. In the quarter, inflation was just over 3%, which translated into a 240-basis-point headwind to margin. Importantly, however, our gross margin expansion levers such as realized productivity, pricing, mix and synergies continue to be effective in Q3. The increased promotional support in the quarter partially offset these benefits, resulting in a 90-basis-point improvement in gross margin. A&P had only a modest impact on margin in the quarter, while reduced SG&A spend benefited our operating margin by 100 basis points during the quarter. 
Slide 27 highlights the significant progress that we've made to date on our overall synergy capture from the Pinnacle acquisition. In Q3, we realized $33 million of incremental synergies, bringing our total synergy capture through the end of Q3 to $145 million. We remain on track to achieve approximately $180 million of synergies by the end of fiscal '20, with $20 million being reinvested into longer-term business opportunities.  We also remain on track to deliver our total synergy target of $305 million, again, with $20 million of that being reinvested into longer-term business opportunities. 
Turning to Slide 28, you will see an outline of our adjusted operating profit and operating margin for the third quarter. Our adjusted operating profit decreased 8.9% in Q3, and our adjusted operating margin came in at 15.7%. Across our segments, realized productivity and cost synergies benefited our operating profit in the quarter. These benefits were more than offset by the impacts of higher input costs, lower organic net sales, inventory write-offs, lost profit from divested businesses. 
Slide 29 outlines the various drivers of our Q3 adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations. In Q3, our adjusted diluted EPS of $0.47 decreased by $0.04 compared to the same period a year ago. The decrease in adjusted operating profit and higher tax rate during the quarter more than offset the benefit from improved pension income and interest. 
Slide 30 summarizes Conagra's net debt and cash flow information. I'm sure that our perspective on the balance sheet and liquidity are top of mind in these uncertain times. I'll start by reminding you that we have made significant progress towards our deleveraging and free cash flow targets in recent quarters. Since the closing of the Pinnacle acquisition through the end of Q3, we have reduced total gross debt by over $1.5 billion, improving our balance sheet and the overall health of our business. With respect to Q3, we reduced debt by $450 million while our net debt balance at quarter end was $9.9 billion, and the net debt leverage ratio was 4.8x. At the end of the third quarter, our average debt maturity was approximately 8.8 years. Our weighted average coupon was approximately 4.7%, and approximately 92% of our total debt was fixed. 
Free cash flow year-to-date is $641 million, marking an improvement of over $100 million against the same period last year. We remain on schedule with our deleveraging targets and are confident we will achieve our fiscal '21 leverage target of 3.6 to 3.5x. 
Overall, we remain confident in the strength of our balance sheet, and we have many options for maintaining liquidity. First, we ended the quarter with $99 million of cash on hand. We expect stronger cash flows in Q4 due to the normal seasonality of our business and because of the increased retail demand we're experiencing in light of COVID-19. Our capital allocation priorities remain constant. We are committed to maintaining our dividend, deleveraging and maintaining a solid investment-grade credit rating. Along these lines, we anticipate deleveraging further in Q4 of fiscal '20. 
In addition to cash flow from operations, we also have a $1.6 billion fully undrawn revolving credit facility. During certain months of the year, we issued commercial paper against this revolver to fund working capital needs. We did not need to access the commercial paper markets during Q3, and we don't anticipate needing access during the rest of Q4. Given our strong cash flow and borrowing capacity, we have many options available to fund upcoming debt maturities in August and October. 
At CAGNY last month, we discussed that we continue to explore smart divestitures that can help sculpt top line performance and generate cash flow to support deleveraging. By smart, we mean ensuring that any potential divestiture will deliver a valuation that exceeds our intrinsic value. In this environment, our brands are growing and playing an important role for consumers, and they are generating sales and cash flow in excess of historic levels. While we continue to evaluate portfolio actions, we do not feel pressure to pursue any divestitures that are not value-creating. 
Now recognizing that our new guidance isn't specific, I want to give you some color on what we do know and what we don't know at this point. What we do know is that our retail businesses have seen accelerating shipments. In our domestic retail business, which is about 80% of total company sales, total fourth quarter-to-date shipments have increased approximately 50% versus last year, similar to the most recent consumption data. Internationally, the impact has been a bit mixed, with the Canada retail business seeing increased demand but some softness in global export. All told, quarter to-go retail shipments are difficult to predict, given the wide range of possible outcomes. Just as the retail businesses are seeing a surge in demand, our Foodservice business, which is about 10% of total company sales, is beginning to experience the negative impact of the COVID-19 situation. So far in Q4, Foodservice shipment declines have accelerated, and trends imply a Q4 organic net sales decline that could be in the range of down 50% to 60% versus last year. 
Turning to profit. As you would expect, we believe that the significant demand surge in the retail businesses, which are the vast majority of our sales, will positively benefit profit versus our prior guidance. We also expect that the mix of sales and operating leverage of the increased volume will benefit gross margins. Just how much is too speculative to forecast at this time as we are also increasing investment where needed to ensure we support the surge in demand. We are incredibly proud of the investment we are making in the supply chain to meet demand. Not only are we investing as needed to meet customer orders, but we are providing direct financial support and recognition to our people and communities. 
I'd now like to turn to our fiscal '20 guidance on Slide 33. It was just a bit over a month ago that we shared our updated fiscal '20 guidance. And as we told you at CAGNY, we were already seeing improving trends in our categories, giving us confidence in our ability to deliver those updated results. However, as a result of what I just discussed about Q4 to date, we are now unable to forecast Q4 with specificity, but we can say that we expect to exceed the full year guidance on all sales, profit and cash flow metrics. Although this situation remains highly dynamic, we now see upside to the guidance we provided due to the quarter-to-date surge in consumer demand and the related sales and profit impacts. What we don't know is how long the impacts of this pandemic will last. Nor do we know exactly how consumers will continue to adapt to the situation in the immediate term or in the longer term as we move into fiscal '21. As Sean mentioned earlier, our portfolio is well positioned to meet this increased consumer demand, and our team is focused on working with customers to make sure that orders and shipments remain uninterrupted during this time of need. As long as our strong execution continues and there are no other material disruptions to our ability to provide products safely to our customers, we expect to exceed our fiscal '20 guidance across all sales, profit and cash flow metrics. 
Thanks for listening, everyone. That concludes my remarks. Sean and I are happy to take questions. Tom McGough and Darren Serrao are not joining us today as we wanted to minimize the number of speakers since we are managing this Q&A from different locations this morning. 
I'll now pass it back to the operator."

Any perspective there would be really helpful. And then I've just got a follow-up."

Let me tackle that. The concept you're raising is that because we've got this crisis situation and people are eating much more at home and not away from home, products like ours are getting levels of trial that were not anticipated, and that could turn into consistent users over time as that trial converts to repeat. 
I would tell you, that makes sense to me, both intuitively and in terms of the very early data we're beginning to see. There's been a massive amount of transformation in our categories in the last 5 years. Frozen, in particular, doesn't even closely resemble the category that it used to be. The quality of the food is in a completely different place. And we've seen consumers so far who have tried that new food respond extremely favorably to it, and large established brands that had long been forgotten are growing strongly again. 
Now because of this crisis situation, people are at home. As you know, everybody can see it. They're stocking up, and they're stocking up with foods of all kinds across all temperature states, including categories like frozen. So just logically, we know we are getting higher levels of trial here during this phenomenon. 
In terms of data that backs it up, quite frankly, it's just too early to point to a lot of data points. The one place I can tell you that we do look that tends to be a leading indicator is e-commerce. And in the world of e-commerce, what we are seeing is that we are reaching a large number of new triers that we had not reached previously. Now as you think about how that might convert to repeat, you all are probably accustomed to looking at national average repeat rates. Repeat rates will vary depending upon the users. So early adopters, super heavy users will have higher repeat than light users. When you get new triers like this, you tend to be getting lighter users. So it may not be the kind of repeat rates we get from super heavy users. But the point of all of this is it should help categories like frozen. It should help some of our other categories that people may have forgotten about, but it's just too early to quantify the impact of that. 
I would also tell you that we do expect, as this thing gets behind us, that we'll see a return to people eating out. Americans love their restaurants. They love to eat out. And, obviously, the foodservice space is  hurting badly right now, and so we're rooting for that side of the business to bounce back as well."

The priority right now is producing the maximum amount of food that we could possibly produce. And we are running our plants 7 days, as you might imagine. To do that, we have pared back on some of our SKUs so that we can continue to serve the highest-velocity SKUs. So keeping food and stock so we can feed America is our top priority right now, as it is the priority of our retailers. That has caused us to reprioritize in terms of SKUs. And in the case of the innovation resets, I would tell you, the word that comes to mind for me is fluid. We are hearing different things from different customers. Many customers -- most customers are just trying to keep products on the shelf right now. Some customers, big ones, have said to us that they want to continue with the shelf set timing. Others had said, we're going to push that back a bit just so we can ensure that we don't have any complexity in anything going on at the store shelves that's going to be a distraction from keeping products in stock. So we are trying to respond to all of our customers' requests so we can do whatever they want. 
In terms of our philosophy on innovation overall, it hasn't changed. It is a central part of the Conagra Way that we're going to keep building out our innovation pipeline. So it's industry-leading, and we're very confident we've got that. We're, as you know, from CAGNY, incredibly excited about the innovation slate that lies ahead. How it flows into the marketplace now will probably be a little bit more customer-by-customer than all in a tighter window as we previously expected. But I think it will be good news overall because we'll have the benefit of that innovation and the pipeline fill helping us next year. 
With respect to promotional activity, as you know, we've cut more promotions in the last 5 years than just about any company in food as we pursue value over volume. We have gotten more aggressive in the last year where we've seen Competition Act irrationally and we needed to defend our market shares, but that has not been in a broad-based way. What I'd tell you on promotions right now is we're honoring all the contracts we have in place, but the tactical dynamic is that we're in daily discussions with our customers on how to help them meet the needs of their shoppers. And many customers are looking to pull back on promotions as they try to manage the basics of just keeping their shelves stocked. And running promotions can exacerbate out of stocks, which is clearly not their goal right now. So we're seeing some cutback on that, and that will just be more of a timing issue than anything else.

So as we finish the fiscal year, we'll have our full $1.6 billion revolving credit line, which will be undrawn, and we don't have any debt maturities in Q4 of this year.

Our next maturities of $775 million are in October. And we'll have flexibility to fund that from the higher expected free cash flow from the business, and we'll just have to see where we land with that given the upside that we're seeing right now.

But simply put, until we're on the other side of this pandemic, sales growth is likely to remain elevated because you've got most of the food away-from-home volume is moving to food at home. And so we've got, obviously, lots of experience with how pantries and warehouses get filled by customers and consumers around situations like hurricanes, and you always see big volumes move into warehouses at the customer level and into pantries and freezers and refrigerators at the consumer level. But how long the pull remains, in this particular case, is directly a function of how long does this thing last and how long are people sheltering in place? And I don't think anybody can predict right now when that is going to end. Obviously, the latest thinking here is that we will go until a minimum the end of April with people really spending lots and lots of time at home. And who knows how much further it can extend beyond that. So the way this works is the initial surge of volume is volume that is going to fill warehouses and to fill pantries. But with people not eating out away from home, I think a reasonable person could conclude that they're then in the mode of consuming that volume aggressively. And as they work down those pantry levels and warehouse levels come down to normal levels, then it just becomes kind of a just-in-time replenishment as long as the elevated level of consumption remains. So it's just too early to pin this with any accuracy, but that's kind of the mechanics of how this works."

Is it, A, I don't know. Yes, given March is up 40%. Retail consumer, if that were sustainable, then yes, I would take that piece of the business and say up 40%. And given our guide on Foodservice, take that down 50%, and then we'll just have to see how that plays out. And maybe that reverses next year if there's a pantry load, and maybe not. So just -- there's a lot in there, but I just kind of wanted to hear what do you want us to do in terms of if there is no specificity that can be provided.

As you might imagine, if it's business as usual, it's kind of one set of assumptions. If this thing were to continue, if it were to come back in the fall, as I read this morning, that's a whole another ball game. So it's an almost impossible thing to predict. Nobody has a crystal ball, but I think what you guys are going to be looking is a scanner data. What we look at is the scanner data to understand takeaway, what we look at or our shipment patterns. And of course, we follow any -- all the health news on the national news every single day, multiple times a day. So I think we're in one of these times where we will endeavor to be incredibly transparent with what we're seeing, what we're thinking, so that we can provide the best perspective we can provide while fully acknowledging that it's awfully -- it's impossible task to be precise right now.

Since quarter-to-date on the retail side of the business, domestic retail, which is 80% of our business, shipments and consumption are in line. And so what I would say is consumption could be a good proxy to try to forecast quarter to go in the retail business since they're in line. There's no guarantee there, right, because you do have ebbs and flows with shipments versus consumption in a short amount of time. But that, I think, would be a proxy to be able to at least try to figure out how this is trending as we move forward. But there's no silver bullets here, unfortunately."

And then just quickly, in terms of your shelf-stable products, I feel like even at CAGNY, the focus here going forward, the strategy is more frozen snacks. Shelf-stable can have a place within the portfolio, but my feel at least is that you might look at some of those brands more proactively in terms of divestment potential. Now, I don't know, right? I mean, it seems like you highlighted today on the slides, except Hunt's, Chef Boyardee doing incrementally better before COVID-19 hit. Now there's a pantry load. My feel would be that those areas would actually now do better maybe than some other areas. 
So in terms of the tax asset that you have and kind of entire thought process around divestments and shelf stable, what have you might. Is it fair to think that, at least for the time being, given everything that's going on, that you kind of step back from that and say, ""Well, let's just see how things settle, keep the business as is. We'll reevaluate as we kind of get through this a bit more. But yes, we still realize that we have a tax asset that's expiring at the end of next fiscal year."""

So I did make some comments, Rob, on our prepared comments. The way that we look at divestitures hasn't changed, right? It all starts with our strategic rationale and then the financial rationale. And the point I made today was financial rationale means that the valuation for any potential divested asset must exceed our intrinsic value for the asset. And given the growth we're seeing in our business, given the sales and cash flow at higher levels than they've historically been, that factors into kind of how we view those assets. They're generating a lot of cash for us right now. But my comments were meant to stress that we're going to continue to identify assets for divestiture, but if the potential price doesn't exceed the value to Conagra that we see the brands are worth, then we don't feel pressure to move forward. 
And so we have our capital loss carryforward. It doesn't expend -- it doesn't expire until the end of fiscal '21. And so as Sean said earlier, it's fluid, but we wanted to make sure that point was clear."

I would call it the staples business. And that's how we talked about it at CAGNY, is we've got a decent-sized chunk of our portfolio in what we call staples, and these are products that people rely on. These are our products that drive a lot of foot traffic to our retailers. They're very important to the retailers. They tend to be high gross margin, good cash flow businesses. 
And as I pointed out, at CAGNY, just a small handful of them add up to a big, big chunk of our total staples sales. And so these businesses are very important to us when they're reliably contributing. And most of them have been reliably contributing, and they do a lot of good for our portfolio. On occasion, we've seen competitive activity or other dynamics drive weakness. And our philosophy, historically, has been, look, if we don't have a line of sight to stabilizing something on the top line and the bottom line, then we've divested it. And we've always been open to that. What Dave is pointing out is these are just different times where everything is moving. So it takes any kind of compulsion to want to move and do that and kind of reduces that because these are contributing a lot to us right now. But in general, the point that I wanted to make is our staples businesses across the board almost are very strong, valuable businesses to us. And we'll continue to monitor them to make sure that they are contributing reliably once we get through this pandemic, and then we'll go from there."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our third quarter fiscal 2020 earnings call. On behalf of Conagra Brands, I want to start by expressing my heartfelt hope that you and your families are staying safe during this unprecedented time. 
Today, I'm going to address 2 main topics: Our response to COVID-19 and its impact on our business as well as the underlying trends that we saw in the third quarter, which ended just before the impact of COVID-19 started. Rest assured that we're taking all necessary precautions to protect the health and safety of our employees and our ability to safely and reliably meet consumers' needs. For the most recent status of our efforts to respond to COVID-19, please visit conagrabrands.com. We'll continue to provide updated information on our site as the situation evolves. 
As I'll describe in more detail in a moment, we've taken a number of steps to ensure our supply chain continues to operate well. We're incredibly proud of our teams who have been producing and delivering without disruption. 
While we all remain focused on executing through this rapidly evolving situation, I don't want to lose sight of the fact that we've made significant progress against the operational objectives we established for fiscal 2020. In many ways, our progress against these objectives is enhancing our ability to navigate this crisis. Recall, at the outset of fiscal 2020, we set out to execute on integration, synergy capture and deleveraging, drive strong consumption growth in frozen and snacks, improved trends in Hunt's Tomatoes and Chef Boyardee and the trend in the Legacy Pinnacle business, and drive innovation and growth in Gardein. I'm proud to say that through the third quarter, we remain squarely on track with all of these objectives. 
And from a financial standpoint, the third quarter results are in line with the expectations we provided at CAGNY. As we previously described, industry softness, which started in December in foodservice and pivoted to retail in January, put pressure on consumption trends in several of our key categories, which more than offset share gains. As expected, consumption trends recovered in February prior to COVID-19 impact. It's important to keep in mind that our third quarter ended on February 23. At that time, there were very few reported cases in the U.S. and, notably, no widespread change in behavior. As we all know, that has changed significantly in recent weeks. 
From the second week of our fiscal fourth quarter-to-date, we've experienced the unprecedented impact of COVID-19 as consumers have stocked up on food and shift rapidly to eating more at home. Given the quality of our brands and the categories we participate in, Conagra is well positioned to serve consumers during this time of disruption and extraordinary demand. Our team is hard at work in close coordination with our customers to ensure that consumers have access to the food they need to stay safe at home. 
At this point, the magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 impact is still uncertain. However, I can tell you that we expect to exceed our prior full year guidance for total company sales and profit metrics, assuming the end-to-end supply chain continues to operate effectively. We will provide more detail on the impact of COVID-19 in a moment. But first, we would like to walk you through the highlights of the third quarter. 
During the third quarter, our performance was in line with the updated expectations that we provided at CAGNY. Organic net sales growth decreased 1.7%, while our adjusted operating margin was 15.7%, and our adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations was $0.47 for the quarter. As we noted at CAGNY, we saw category softness in January that was greater than anticipated. At the time, we told you that our more recent data was improving, and we expect it to bounce back, and that's exactly what happened. 
As you can see on Slide 7, Total Conagra retail sales returned to growth in the final 4 weeks of February and sustained a normal rate into the first week of Q4. Clearly, even before the current disruption due to COVID-19, we were well on track and had already seen the expected rebound in consumption trends. 
Not only did we see growth of 0.9% in the 4 weeks ended February 23, but what we saw in the week ended March 1, which is in our fiscal fourth quarter, reaffirmed this return to consumption growth. And during the quarter, we continued to deliver on integration, synergies and deleveraging. 
On integration, we have been converting Legacy Pinnacle plants over to SAP. And through Q3, this multiyear process has been progressing on plan. We captured $33 million in incremental synergies, increasing our total through the end of Q3 million to $145 million. And we made further progress on reducing our net debt position by paying down $450 million of debt during the quarter. 
Slide 9 demonstrates our continued success in the important frozen category. As both graphics demonstrate, we maintained strong growth during the quarter across our frozen portfolio, both for Total Conagra Brands and Legacy Conagra Brands. As we will discuss later in the presentation, Total Conagra's frozen growth has been driven by both Legacy Conagra and Legacy Pinnacle. 
Slide 10 shows the outsized performance of Conagra's Frozen Meals within the category. Not only did we have yet another quarter of gaining share of shelf and share of sales, but we also did so at an accelerated rate. 
Our snacks segment reported solid growth in the third quarter. Total snacks were up 2.9% during the quarter and 8.7% on a 2-year basis. Our results were led by our meat snacks and seeds businesses, which delivered growth of 8.4% and 5.9%, respectively. 
And as Slide 12 shows, we continued to gain share in many of our snack categories in Q3. 
Another key objective for fiscal 2020 was to improve trends in Hunt's tomatoes and Chef Boyardee. As you can see on Slide 13, that's just what we've done. Over the 5-week period ended February 23, Hunt's tomatoes and Chef Boyardee gained 2.2% and 4.5% in dollar sales growth, respectively. And both brands also grew share of retail sales over that same period, as outlined on Slide 14. It's worth noting that these trends for Hunt's tomatoes and Chef Boyardee continued into the first week of our fiscal fourth quarter prior to the impact of COVID-19. 
Slide 15 shows a milestone for Conagra as we bent the trend on Legacy Pinnacle on both a 1-year and a 2-year basis. Recall that in December 2018, we outlined a number of actions that were needed to get Pinnacle back on track. We also indicated that we did not expect to see the impact of those actions until the second half of fiscal 2020, which, as you can see here, is exactly what has occurred. 
And Slide 16 shows how we've been able to bend the trend in the big 3 legacy Pinnacle brands by implementing the Conagra Way playbook. We started with Wish-Bone, where the missteps came from several executional issues, including a label change, which we quickly addressed to stabilize the brand. As a result, we saw an immediate spike in retail sales before returning to more normal levels. 
Birds Eye, which is our biggest brand, took a little longer as the playbook required us to remove lower-performing SKUs, which negatively impacted sales and distribution. Notably, Birds Eye is now contributing to our growth as the innovation we launched in the first half of fiscal 2020 builds momentum with more innovation to come. 
With respect to Duncan Hines, we've made great progress on reframing the brand as a sweet treat but recognize that there's more work to be done. We're focused on introducing more on-trend innovation as we trim lower-performing SKUs. While it will take time to return this brand to growth, we're confident in the ongoing implementation of the Conagra Way playbook. 
Another Legacy Pinnacle brand that has benefited from the Conagra Way is Gardein, which is accelerating at very strong rates. As a reminder, we've made significant investments to expand Gardein's manufacturing capacity, which came online earlier this fiscal year. As the slide shows, the brand's growth is attributed to more than just meatless burgers and includes meatless options for chicken, seafood and sausages, to name a few. As you can see, it's clear that we remained on track with all our fiscal 2020 operational objectives through the third quarter. 
Now let's turn to the current quarter and the balance of the year. Typically, we would be spending our time on this call reaffirming our guidance and discussing the shortlist of initiatives underway to close out the year. But this year is unprecedented, and the impact of COVID-19 will be significant. 
Let me start by saying that our top priorities right now are the health and safety of our employees as well as our ability to safely and responsibly meet customer and consumer needs. With respect to our results, the magnitude of the impact is difficult to predict. What we know to date, the Q4 retail demand surge is significant and spans multiple retail channels, including e-commerce. While our Foodservice segment is facing headwinds, that impact is more than offset by increased demand in our retail segments. Given the depth and breadth of our portfolio, we are well positioned to meet this increased demand for at-home consumption. Having all these brands and capabilities under one roof is enabling us to meet a wide array of customer and consumer demands. 
Importantly, we've been able to address this retail demand surge because of a strong business continuity plan that we were able to activate as soon as the market disruption began. I'm very proud of the extraordinary efforts across our company and the way our teams have supported each other and our business, all in the pursuit of ensuring that consumers are able to access food during this time. We have decided to temporarily delay some Legacy Pinnacle plants SAP implementation to prioritize supplying customers with the food they require now. But our integration plans are otherwise on track. We will continue to consider and prioritize our business needs as the COVID-19 situation unfolds. 
And I'd like to take a minute to talk a bit more about the Conagra team and, in particular, to highlight the exceptional work of our supply chain team. While demand has sharply increased, our order fulfillment rate so far in Q4 has remained above 90%. This is a testament to the systems we have in place and the commitment of our people. This has been remarkable to see, and I'd like to thank our Chief Supply Chain Officer, Dave Biegger, and the entire supply chain team for their incredible efforts. 
Our supplies of ingredients and packaging remain sufficient, and we've experienced minimal disruption so far in the quarter. All of our North America manufacturing facilities are open and running at high levels of utilization, and our distribution network remains fully operational. Our plants and locations have the resources and critical equipment they need to operate in full compliance with current regulations and CDC guidance. And I'm proud of the remarkable level of collaboration among our sales, customer order management and supply chain teams. That collaboration, along with the work we're doing with customers, is enabling us to ensure we are able to supply consumers with the food they need. Great job all around. 
Although providing specific Q4 guidance is not possible due to the uncertainty of this situation, we do want to give you a sense of our experience so far. The chart on Slide 20 shows what we've seen in the market to date. You can see that there has been a material increase in demand the past few weeks. While some categories are benefiting more than others, all categories and all temperature states are seeing increases. In addition to a significant uptick in sales, our execution has enabled Conagra to outperform and gain share in the categories in which we compete. The data we're showing in the chart is only measured channel data. It's important to note that demand has surged broadly across retail channels, including e-commerce as well as for pickup and delivery, most of which are not reflected in this data. Similar to our measured channel retail business, our e-commerce business is also up in sales, outpacing the competition and gaining share. 
Overall, we made good progress during the third quarter of the year. Our quarterly results were in line with our updated expectations, and we remained on track with all of our fiscal 2020 operational objectives. Going forward, our teams are prioritizing health and safety, adapting well and operating effectively to ensure consumers are able to access food they need. And while this is clearly an unprecedented time, we will not lose focus on executing the Conagra Way playbook. Our brand-building and innovation processes remain critical pieces to our long-term success. We're updating our full year guidance today to note that we now expect to exceed our prior full year guidance for total company sales and profit metrics. 
Beyond fiscal 2020, it's important to note that we are also working with customers as they reevaluate the timing of promotions and shelf resets as they look to minimize in-store disruption during this time of surging demand. Finally, while the situation is still evolving, we believe the sharp increase in at-home eating occasions is generating trial among new consumers that we did not anticipate accessing. We view this dynamic as a long-term opportunity for our portfolio overall and, in particular, our leading frozen business. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Dave."

I hope you and your families are all staying healthy and safe. Before I get into the details, I want to remind you that Q3 has been the first full quarter following the anniversary of the Pinnacle acquisition. As",2029,"Thanks, Sean, and good morning, everyone. I hope you and your families are all staying healthy and safe. Before I get into the details, I want to remind you that Q3 has been the first full quarter following the anniversary of the Pinnacle acquisition. As a result, Pinnacle's full quarterly results are now reflected in our organic figures. 
I'll start my remarks this morning by calling out a few highlights from our performance for the quarter, which are outlined on Slide 23. As Sean discussed, our Q3 performance was consistent with the expectations we've provided at CAGNY. This included broad-based category softness early in the quarter, and a return to consumption growth in February prior to the COVID-19 related surge in demand. I'll unpack these results further in the slides to come. But overall, for the third quarter, reported net sales were down 5.6% versus the same period a year ago, with organic net sales down 1.7%. The organic net sales decline was in line with the updated expectations that we provided in February. 
Adjusted gross profit decreased 10.5%, and adjusted operating profit declined 8.9%. We continued to operate efficiently from an SG&A perspective, capturing strong synergies. 
Adjusted EBITDA, which includes equity method investment earnings and pension and postretirement non-service income, decreased 7.1% in the quarter. And adjusted diluted EPS decreased 7.8% to $0.47 for the quarter. Again, this was in line with our updated expectations. 
Let's jump into net sales a bit more. Slide 24 depicts the 5.6% change versus the same period a year ago. As you can see, the broad-based category softness that we discussed at CAGNY drove our volume down 1.3%. Also our price/mix was unfavorable 40 basis points as we continued to support many of our brands with incremental promotions. As I mentioned on prior quarterly calls, we expect that our year-over-year change in retailer investments to be much smaller and less material in the second half of fiscal '20 and beyond now that this type of spending is in our base. As a result, we will no longer be breaking out that bridging item and will return to our historical approach of showing just the impact of price/mix overall. 
Moving to Slide 25, you can find our sales summary by segment. In the quarter, organic net sales for the Grocery & Snacks segment decreased 3.6%. The snacks business continued to perform well. However, this segment was negatively affected by weather with a warmer-than-normal winter this year stacked against an abnormally cold prior year. On a reported net sales basis, divestiture activity subtracted 5.9%. Organic net sales for Refrigerated & Frozen increased 0.3% as the frozen business continued to perform well behind the recent innovation launches. Importantly, as Sean mentioned, we saw Frozen Meals continue to gain share at an accelerated rate in the quarter. The strength in the frozen business continued to be somewhat masked by declines in the refrigerated business. 
Turning to our international segment. Quarterly net sales and organic net sales for the segment decreased 3.2% and 1.9%, respectively. Throughout the quarter, the segment continued to benefit from the growth in the Canadian snacks business and frozen businesses. Recall that earlier this year, we said that the business in India had a transitory headwind that would rebound in the second half, and that is what we saw in Q3. These benefits were more than offset by economic challenges primarily in Mexico, and certain planned value-over-volume actions. 
Net sales for the Foodservice segment decreased 8% in Q3, while organic net sales decreased 2.2% as divestitures subtracted 5.8%. The organic net sales decrease was driven by volume declines of 4.6% as a result of soft industry traffic trends early in the quarter that were partially offset by a 2.4% improvement in price/mix. 
Turning to Slide 26, you can see the adjusted operating bridge for the quarter versus the prior year. As I mentioned on our second quarter call, input cost inflation did start to increase in Q3. In the quarter, inflation was just over 3%, which translated into a 240-basis-point headwind to margin. Importantly, however, our gross margin expansion levers such as realized productivity, pricing, mix and synergies continue to be effective in Q3. The increased promotional support in the quarter partially offset these benefits, resulting in a 90-basis-point improvement in gross margin. A&P had only a modest impact on margin in the quarter, while reduced SG&A spend benefited our operating margin by 100 basis points during the quarter. 
Slide 27 highlights the significant progress that we've made to date on our overall synergy capture from the Pinnacle acquisition. In Q3, we realized $33 million of incremental synergies, bringing our total synergy capture through the end of Q3 to $145 million. We remain on track to achieve approximately $180 million of synergies by the end of fiscal '20, with $20 million being reinvested into longer-term business opportunities. We also remain on track to deliver our total synergy target of $305 million, again, with $20 million of that being reinvested into longer-term business opportunities. 
Turning to Slide 28, you will see an outline of our adjusted operating profit and operating margin for the third quarter. Our adjusted operating profit decreased 8.9% in Q3, and our adjusted operating margin came in at 15.7%. Across our segments, realized productivity and cost synergies benefited our operating profit in the quarter. These benefits were more than offset by the impacts of higher input costs, lower organic net sales, inventory write-offs, lost profit from divested businesses. 
Slide 29 outlines the various drivers of our Q3 adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations. In Q3, our adjusted diluted EPS of $0.47 decreased by $0.04 compared to the same period a year ago. The decrease in adjusted operating profit and higher tax rate during the quarter more than offset the benefit from improved pension income and interest. 
Slide 30 summarizes Conagra's net debt and cash flow information. I'm sure that our perspective on the balance sheet and liquidity are top of mind in these uncertain times. I'll start by reminding you that we have made significant progress towards our deleveraging and free cash flow targets in recent quarters. Since the closing of the Pinnacle acquisition through the end of Q3, we have reduced total gross debt by over $1.5 billion, improving our balance sheet and the overall health of our business. With respect to Q3, we reduced debt by $450 million while our net debt balance at quarter end was $9.9 billion, and the net debt leverage ratio was 4.8x. At the end of the third quarter, our average debt maturity was approximately 8.8 years. Our weighted average coupon was approximately 4.7%, and approximately 92% of our total debt was fixed. 
Free cash flow year-to-date is $641 million, marking an improvement of over $100 million against the same period last year. We remain on schedule with our deleveraging targets and are confident we will achieve our fiscal '21 leverage target of 3.6 to 3.5x. 
Overall, we remain confident in the strength of our balance sheet, and we have many options for maintaining liquidity. First, we ended the quarter with $99 million of cash on hand. We expect stronger cash flows in Q4 due to the normal seasonality of our business and because of the increased retail demand we're experiencing in light of COVID-19. Our capital allocation priorities remain constant. We are committed to maintaining our dividend, deleveraging and maintaining a solid investment-grade credit rating. Along these lines, we anticipate deleveraging further in Q4 of fiscal '20. 
In addition to cash flow from operations, we also have a $1.6 billion fully undrawn revolving credit facility. During certain months of the year, we issued commercial paper against this revolver to fund working capital needs. We did not need to access the commercial paper markets during Q3, and we don't anticipate needing access during the rest of Q4. Given our strong cash flow and borrowing capacity, we have many options available to fund upcoming debt maturities in August and October. 
At CAGNY last month, we discussed that we continue to explore smart divestitures that can help sculpt top line performance and generate cash flow to support deleveraging. By smart, we mean ensuring that any potential divestiture will deliver a valuation that exceeds our intrinsic value. In this environment, our brands are growing and playing an important role for consumers, and they are generating sales and cash flow in excess of historic levels. While we continue to evaluate portfolio actions, we do not feel pressure to pursue any divestitures that are not value-creating. 
Now recognizing that our new guidance isn't specific, I want to give you some color on what we do know and what we don't know at this point. What we do know is that our retail businesses have seen accelerating shipments. In our domestic retail business, which is about 80% of total company sales, total fourth quarter-to-date shipments have increased approximately 50% versus last year, similar to the most recent consumption data. Internationally, the impact has been a bit mixed, with the Canada retail business seeing increased demand but some softness in global export. 
All told, quarter to-go retail shipments are difficult to predict, given the wide range of possible outcomes. Just as the retail businesses are seeing a surge in demand, our Foodservice business, which is about 10% of total company sales, is beginning to experience the negative impact of the COVID-19 situation. So far in Q4, Foodservice shipment declines have accelerated, and trends imply a Q4 organic net sales decline that could be in the range of down 50% to 60% versus last year. 
Turning to profit. As you would expect, we believe that the significant demand surge in the retail businesses, which are the vast majority of our sales, will positively benefit profit versus our prior guidance. We also expect that the mix of sales and operating leverage of the increased volume will benefit gross margins. Just how much is too speculative to forecast at this time as we are also increasing investment where needed to ensure we support the surge in demand. We are incredibly proud of the investment we are making in the supply chain to meet demand. Not only are we investing as needed to meet customer orders, but we are providing direct financial support and recognition to our people and communities. 
I'd now like to turn to our fiscal '20 guidance on Slide 33. It was just a bit over a month ago that we shared our updated fiscal '20 guidance. And as we told you at CAGNY, we were already seeing improving trends in our categories, giving us confidence in our ability to deliver those updated results. However, as a result of what I just discussed about Q4 to date, we are now unable to forecast Q4 with specificity, but we can say that we expect to exceed the full year guidance on all sales, profit and cash flow metrics. Although this situation remains highly dynamic, we now see upside to the guidance we provided due to the quarter-to-date surge in consumer demand and the related sales and profit impacts. 
What we don't know is how long the impacts of this pandemic will last. Nor do we know exactly how consumers will continue to adapt to the situation in the immediate term or in the longer term as we move into fiscal '21. As Sean mentioned earlier, our portfolio is well positioned to meet this increased consumer demand, and our team is focused on working with customers to make sure that orders and shipments remain uninterrupted during this time of need. As long as our strong execution continues and there are no other material disruptions to our ability to provide products safely to our customers, we expect to exceed our fiscal '20 guidance across all sales, profit and cash flow metrics. 
Thanks for listening, everyone. That concludes my remarks. Sean and I are happy to take questions. Tom McGough and Darren Serrao are not joining us today as we wanted to minimize the number of speakers since we are managing this Q&A from different locations this morning. 
I'll now pass it back to the operator."

Is there any data maybe that can add a little context around this? I know it's early, but maybe from some of your panel data that you track around some of the increases in either household penetration that you've seen, with some of the quality enhancements you've done, particularly in the frozen space, maybe what some of the repeat rates or -- look like or the ability to gain some of the new trialers that might not have, let's say, tried this product in the last several years or so? Any perspective there would be really helpful. And then I've just got a follow-up."
26893,657097579,1953534,"Conagra Brands, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Mar 31, 2020",2020-03-31,"Earnings Calls","Conagra Brands, Inc.","Executives","Okay, sure, Andrew. Let me tackle that. The concept you're raising is that because we've got this crisis situation and people are eating much more at home and not away from home, products like ours are getting levels of trial that were not anticipated, an",445,"Okay, sure, Andrew. Let me tackle that. The concept you're raising is that because we've got this crisis situation and people are eating much more at home and not away from home, products like ours are getting levels of trial that were not anticipated, and that could turn into consistent users over time as that trial converts to repeat. 
I would tell you, that makes sense to me, both intuitively and in terms of the very early data we're beginning to see. There's been a massive amount of transformation in our categories in the last 5 years. Frozen, in particular, doesn't even closely resemble the category that it used to be. The quality of the food is in a completely different place. And we've seen consumers so far who have tried that new food respond extremely favorably to it, and large established brands that had long been forgotten are growing strongly again. 
Now because of this crisis situation, people are at home. As you know, everybody can see it. They're stocking up, and they're stocking up with foods of all kinds across all temperature states, including categories like frozen. So just logically, we know we are getting higher levels of trial here during this phenomenon. 
In terms of data that backs it up, quite frankly, it's just too early to point to a lot of data points. The one place I can tell you that we do look that tends to be a leading indicator is e-commerce. And in the world of e-commerce, what we are seeing is that we are reaching a large number of new triers that we had not reached previously. Now as you think about how that might convert to repeat, you all are probably accustomed to looking at national average repeat rates. Repeat rates will vary depending upon the users. So early adopters, super heavy users will have higher repeat than light users. When you get new triers like this, you tend to be getting lighter users. So it may not be the kind of repeat rates we get from super heavy users. But the point of all of this is it should help categories like frozen. It should help some of our other categories that people may have forgotten about, but it's just too early to quantify the impact of that. 
I would also tell you that we do expect, as this thing gets behind us, that we'll see a return to people eating out. Americans love their restaurants. They love to eat out. And, obviously, the foodservice space is hurting badly right now, and so we're rooting for that side of the business to bounce back as well."

On the positive side, of course, all of the increased volume leverage that's coming through from running at very high levels of utilization and whatnot, maybe some of the -- if there's a reduction in assortment and focusing on the longest run length SKUs to maximize output and things like that, I would think, would be on the positive side of the ledger. On the other hand, there are some increased costs, as you've talked about, whether it be for employee benefits and things like that and just the simple inefficiencies of maybe running at, whatever, 100% utilization in inside. But it sounded like you may not know the exact magnitude in the way it all comes together, but the balance of those things, at least of what you're seeing so far, are more to the positive than the negative. I just want to make sure I kind of heard that right."

And the significant volumes resulting in incremental costs that we're incurring in the form of overtime, higher spot freight rates, expediting certain supplies and then additional costs. So when you net it all together and you factor in the significant declines in Foodservice as well, we do expect an increase in gross margin year-on-year for the quarter, but we didn't want to give specificity around that."

The priority right now is producing the maximum amount of food that we could possibly produce. And we are running our plants 7 days, as you might imagine. To do that, we have pared back on some of our SKUs so that we can continue to serve the highest-velocity SKUs. So keeping food and stock so we can feed America is our top priority right now, as it is the priority of our retailers. That has caused us to reprioritize in terms of SKUs. And in the case of the innovation resets, I would tell you, the word that comes to mind for me is fluid. We are hearing different things from different customers. 
Many customers -- most customers are just trying to keep products on the shelf right now. Some customers, big ones, have said to us that they want to continue with the shelf set timing. Others had said, we're going to push that back a bit just so we can ensure that we don't have any complexity in anything going on at the store shelves that's going to be a distraction from keeping products in stock. So we are trying to respond to all of our customers' requests so we can do whatever they want. 
In terms of our philosophy on innovation overall, it hasn't changed. It is a central part of the Conagra Way that we're going to keep building out our innovation pipeline. So it's industry-leading, and we're very confident we've got that. We're, as you know, from CAGNY, incredibly excited about the innovation slate that lies ahead. How it flows into the marketplace now will probably be a little bit more customer-by-customer than all in a tighter window as we previously expected. But I think it will be good news overall because we'll have the benefit of that innovation and the pipeline fill helping us next year. 
With respect to promotional activity, as you know, we've cut more promotions in the last 5 years than just about any company in food as we pursue value over volume. We have gotten more aggressive in the last year where we've seen Competition Act irrationally and we needed to defend our market shares, but that has not been in a broad-based way. What I'd tell you on promotions right now is we're honoring all the contracts we have in place, but the tactical dynamic is that we're in daily discussions with our customers on how to help them meet the needs of their shoppers. And many customers are looking to pull back on promotions as they try to manage the basics of just keeping their shelves stocked. And running promotions can exacerbate out of stocks, which is clearly not their goal right now. So we're seeing some cutback on that, and that will just be more of a timing issue than anything else.

Impressive so far. But I wanted to understand a little bit how to think about free cash flow generation as we look forward to address both maturity schedule and liquidity. I think through 9 months, your slide says you've paid down $641 million of debt, but guidance is greater than $950 million, so you should be doing $300 million to $400 million of free cash in the fourth quarter ex divestitures. Can you just help us think through what we should be thinking about to understand the maturity schedule?

That we are -- we remain committed to solid investment grade credit rating. Since we've closed on Pinnacle, we've paid down over $1.5 billion in gross debt. 
For Q4, we expect to be cash positive at a higher level than we previously anticipated, and that additional cash flow, we're going to use to pay down debt. So we don't expect we're going to be net cash flow positive in the fourth quarter at higher-than-expected levels. So as we finish the fiscal year, we'll have our full $1.6 billion revolving credit line, which will be undrawn, and we don't have any debt maturities in Q4 of this year. So as we look to fiscal '21, we have $1.1 billion in debt maturities for the full fiscal year. Our August maturities of $127 million, we expect to fund that from cash on hand. Our next maturities of $775 million are in October. And we'll have flexibility to fund that from the higher expected free cash flow from the business, and we'll just have to see where we land with that given the upside that we're seeing right now. We can access our revolver or we can refinance in the form of either term loans or investment grade notes. 
So as we've been doing every day with our advisers, we'll continue to monitor the markets and evaluate the best structure for Conagra and stay in a position of readiness because, I mean if you look at the market today, as you know, the bank markets are significantly different than they were 2 weeks ago, and I expect that they'll be significantly different a month from now. And so we want to constantly look, see what the markets are saying. But the good news is that we're cash flow positive. We're generating cash. We're going to use that cash to pay down debt. And we have our full revolver, so I think our liquidity is very strong."

But simply put, until we're on the other side of this pandemic, sales growth is likely to remain elevated because you've got most of the food away-from-home volume is moving to food at home. And so we've got, obviously, lots of experience with how pantries and warehouses get filled by customers and consumers around situations like hurricanes, and you always see big volumes move into warehouses at the customer level and into pantries and freezers and refrigerators at the consumer level. But how long the pull remains, in this particular case, is directly a function of how long does this thing last and how long are people sheltering in place? And I don't think anybody can predict right now when that is going to end. 
Obviously, the latest thinking here is that we will go until a minimum the end of April with people really spending lots and lots of time at home. And who knows how much further it can extend beyond that. So the way this works is the initial surge of volume is volume that is going to fill warehouses and to fill pantries. But with people not eating out away from home, I think a reasonable person could conclude that they're then in the mode of consuming that volume aggressively. And as they work down those pantry levels and warehouse levels come down to normal levels, then it just becomes kind of a just-in-time replenishment as long as the elevated level of consumption remains. So it's just too early to pin this with any accuracy, but that's kind of the mechanics of how this works."

Obviously, it's a fluid situation, which is fully understandable that you can't pinpoint how Q4 plays out or even Q1. 
But just in terms of kind of consensus and how we're all used to looking at that as a benchmark, I guess, first question is just like how do you think we should then be modeling the forecast for your business in terms of top line? Is it, A, I don't know. Yes, given March is up 40%. Retail consumer, if that were sustainable, then yes, I would take that piece of the business and say up 40%. And given our guide on Foodservice, take that down 50%, and then we'll just have to see how that plays out. And maybe that reverses next year if there's a pantry load, and maybe not. So just -- there's a lot in there, but I just kind of wanted to hear what do you want us to do in terms of if there is no specificity that can be provided.

Let me just make one general comment, Dave, and then you could take a shot. But I would just say that the unenviable task you all have of kind of coming up with consensus is very similar to the unenviable task we have of things like trying to contemplate fiscal '21 annual operating plan. As you might imagine, if it's business as usual, it's kind of one set of assumptions. If this thing were to continue, if it were to come back in the fall, as I read this morning, that's a whole another ball game. So it's an almost impossible thing to predict. Nobody has a crystal ball, but I think what you guys are going to be looking is a scanner data. What we look at is the scanner data to understand takeaway, what we look at or our shipment patterns. 
And of course, we follow any -- all the health news on the national news every single day, multiple times a day. So I think we're in one of these times where we will endeavor to be incredibly transparent with what we're seeing, what we're thinking, so that we can provide the best perspective we can provide while fully acknowledging that it's awfully -- it's impossible task to be precise right now.

We wanted to tell you, what do we know right now, what don't we know. And from there, you could then kind of make some assumptions on sort of different scenarios. Sean said it. Since quarter-to-date on the retail side of the business, domestic retail, which is 80% of our business, shipments and consumption are in line. 
And so what I would say is consumption could be a good proxy to try to forecast quarter to go in the retail business since they're in line. There's no guarantee there, right, because you do have ebbs and flows with shipments versus consumption in a short amount of time. But that, I think, would be a proxy to be able to at least try to figure out how this is trending as we move forward. But there's no silver bullets here, unfortunately."

And then just quickly, in terms of your shelf-stable products, I feel like even at CAGNY, the focus here going forward, the strategy is more frozen snacks. Shelf-stable can have a place within the portfolio, but my feel at least is that you might look at some of those brands more proactively in terms of divestment potential. Now, I don't know, right? I mean it seems like you highlighted today on the slides, except Hunt's, Chef Boyardee doing incrementally better before COVID-19 hit. Now there's a pantry load. My feel would be that those areas would actually now do better maybe than some other areas. 
So in terms of the tax asset that you have and kind of entire thought process around divestments and shelf stable, what have you might. Is it fair to think that, at least for the time being, given everything that's going on, that you kind of step back from that and say, ""Well, let's just see how things settle, keep the business as is. We'll reevaluate as we kind of get through this a bit more. But yes, we still realize that we have a tax asset that's expiring at the end of next fiscal year."""

So I did make some comments, Rob, on our prepared comments. The way that we look at divestitures hasn't changed, right? It all starts with our strategic rationale and then the financial rationale. And the point I made today was financial rationale means that the valuation for any potential divested asset must exceed our intrinsic value for the asset. And given the growth we're seeing in our business, given the sales and cash flow at higher levels than they've historically been, that factors into kind of how we view those assets. They're generating a lot of cash for us right now. But my comments were meant to stress that we're going to continue to identify assets for divestiture, but if the potential price doesn't exceed the value to Conagra that we see the brands are worth, then we don't feel pressure to move forward. 
And so we have our capital loss carryforward. It doesn't expend -- it doesn't expire until the end of fiscal '21. And so as Sean said earlier, it's fluid, but we wanted to make sure that point was clear."

I would call it the staples business. And that's how we talked about it at CAGNY, is we've got a decent-sized chunk of our portfolio in what we call staples, and these are products that people rely on. These are our products that drive a lot of foot traffic to our retailers. They're very important to the retailers. They tend to be high gross margin, good cash flow businesses. 
And as I pointed out, at CAGNY, just a small handful of them add up to a big, big chunk of our total staples sales. And so these businesses are very important to us when they're reliably contributing. And most of them have been reliably contributing, and they do a lot of good for our portfolio. On occasion, we've seen competitive activity or other dynamics drive weakness. And our philosophy, historically, has been, look, if we don't have a line of sight to stabilizing something on the top line and the bottom line, then we've divested it. And we've always been open to that. What Dave is pointing out is these are just different times where everything is moving. So it takes any kind of compulsion to want to move and do that and kind of reduces that because these are contributing a lot to us right now. But in general, the point that I wanted to make is our staples businesses across the board almost are very strong, valuable businesses to us. And we'll continue to monitor them to make sure that they are contributing reliably once we get through this pandemic, and then we'll go from there."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our third quarter fiscal 2020 earnings call. On behalf of Conagra Brands, I want to start by expressing my heartfelt hope that you and your families are staying safe during this unprecedented time. 
Today, I'm going to address 2 main topics: Our response to COVID-19 and its impact on our business as well as the underlying trends that we saw in the third quarter, which ended just before the impact of COVID-19 started. Rest assured that we're taking all necessary precautions to protect the health and safety of our employees and our ability to safely and reliably meet consumers' needs. For the most recent status of our efforts to respond to COVID-19, please visit conagrabrands.com. We'll continue to provide updated information on our site as the situation evolves. 
As I'll describe in more detail in a moment, we've taken a number of steps to ensure our supply chain continues to operate well. We're incredibly proud of our teams who have been producing and delivering without disruption. 
While we all remain focused on executing through this rapidly evolving situation, I don't want to lose sight of the fact that we've made significant progress against the operational objectives we established for fiscal 2020. In many ways, our progress against these objectives is enhancing our ability to navigate this crisis. Recall, at the outset of fiscal 2020, we set out to execute on integration, synergy capture and deleveraging, drive strong consumption growth in frozen and snacks, improved trends in Hunt's Tomatoes and Chef Boyardee and the trend in the Legacy Pinnacle business, and drive innovation and growth in Gardein. I'm proud to say that through the third quarter, we remain squarely on track with all of these objectives. 
And from a financial standpoint, the third quarter results are in line with the expectations we provided at CAGNY. As we previously described, industry softness, which started in December in foodservice and pivoted to retail in January, put pressure on consumption trends in several of our key categories, which more than offset share gains. As expected, consumption trends recovered in February prior to COVID-19 impact. It's important to keep in mind that our third quarter ended on February 23. At that time, there were very few reported cases in the U.S. and, notably, no widespread change in behavior. As we all know, that has changed significantly in recent weeks. 
From the second week of our fiscal fourth quarter-to-date, we've experienced the unprecedented impact of COVID-19 as consumers have stocked up on food and shift rapidly to eating more at home. Given the quality of our brands and the categories we participate in, Conagra is well positioned to serve consumers during this time of disruption and extraordinary demand. Our team is hard at work in close coordination with our customers to ensure that consumers have access to the food they need to stay safe at home. 
At this point, the magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 impact is still uncertain. However, I can tell you that we expect to exceed our prior full year guidance for total company sales and profit metrics, assuming the end-to-end supply chain continues to operate effectively. We will provide more detail on the impact of COVID-19 in a moment. But first, we would like to walk you through the highlights of the third quarter. 
During the third quarter, our performance was in line with the updated expectations that we provided at CAGNY. Organic net sales growth decreased 1.7%, while our adjusted operating margin was 15.7%, and our adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations was $0.47 for the quarter. As we noted at CAGNY, we saw category softness in January that was greater than anticipated. At the time, we told you that our more recent data was improving, and we expect it to bounce back, and that's exactly what happened. 
As you can see on Slide 7, Total Conagra retail sales returned to growth in the final 4 weeks of February and sustained a normal rate into the first week of Q4. Clearly, even before the current disruption due to COVID-19, we were well on track and had already seen the expected rebound in consumption trends. 
Not only did we see growth of 0.9% in the 4 weeks ended February 23, but what we saw in the week ended March 1, which is in our fiscal fourth quarter, reaffirmed this return to consumption growth. And during the quarter, we continued to deliver on integration, synergies and deleveraging. 
On integration, we have been converting Legacy Pinnacle plants over to SAP. And through Q3, this multiyear process has been progressing on plan. We captured $33 million in incremental synergies, increasing our total through the end of Q3 million to $145 million. And we made further progress on reducing our net debt position by paying down $450 million of debt during the quarter. 
Slide 9 demonstrates our continued success in the important frozen category. As both graphics demonstrate, we maintained strong growth during the quarter across our frozen portfolio, both for Total Conagra Brands and Legacy Conagra Brands. As we will discuss later in the presentation, Total Conagra's frozen growth has been driven by both Legacy Conagra and Legacy Pinnacle. 
Slide 10 shows the outsized performance of Conagra's Frozen Meals within the category. Not only did we have yet another quarter of gaining share of shelf and share of sales, but we also did so at an accelerated rate. 
Our snacks segment reported solid growth in the third quarter. Total snacks were up 2.9% during the quarter and 8.7% on a 2-year basis. Our results were led by our meat snacks and seeds businesses, which delivered growth of 8.4% and 5.9%, respectively. 
And as Slide 12 shows, we continued to gain share in many of our snack categories in Q3. 
Another key objective for fiscal 2020 was to improve trends in Hunt's tomatoes and Chef Boyardee. As you can see on Slide 13, that's just what we've done. Over the 5-week period ended February 23, Hunt's tomatoes and Chef Boyardee gained 2.2% and 4.5% in dollar sales growth, respectively. And both brands also grew share of retail sales over that same period, as outlined on Slide 14. It's worth noting that these trends for Hunt's tomatoes and Chef Boyardee continued into the first week of our fiscal fourth quarter prior to the impact of COVID-19. 
Slide 15 shows a milestone for Conagra as we bent the trend on Legacy Pinnacle on both a 1-year and a 2-year basis. Recall that in December 2018, we outlined a number of actions that were needed to get Pinnacle back on track. We also indicated that we did not expect to see the impact of those actions until the second half of fiscal 2020, which, as you can see here, is exactly what has occurred. 
And Slide 16 shows how we've been able to bend the trend in the big 3 legacy Pinnacle brands by implementing the Conagra Way playbook. We started with Wish-Bone, where the missteps came from several executional issues, including a label change, which we quickly addressed to stabilize the brand. As a result, we saw an immediate spike in retail sales before returning to more normal levels. 
Birds Eye, which is our biggest brand, took a little longer as the playbook required us to remove lower-performing SKUs, which negatively impacted sales and distribution. Notably, Birds Eye is now contributing to our growth as the innovation we launched in the first half of fiscal 2020 builds momentum with more innovation to come. 
With respect to Duncan Hines, we've made great progress on reframing the brand as a sweet treat but recognize that there's more work to be done. We're focused on introducing more on-trend innovation as we trim lower-performing SKUs. While it will take time to return this brand to growth, we're confident in the ongoing implementation of the Conagra Way playbook. 
Another Legacy Pinnacle brand that has benefited from the Conagra Way is Gardein, which is accelerating at very strong rates. As a reminder, we've made significant investments to expand Gardein's manufacturing capacity, which came online earlier this fiscal year. As the slide shows, the brand's growth is attributed to more than just meatless burgers and includes meatless options for chicken, seafood and sausages, to name a few. As you can see, it's clear that we remained on track with all our fiscal 2020 operational objectives through the third quarter. 
Now let's turn to the current quarter and the balance of the year. Typically, we would be spending our time on this call reaffirming our guidance and discussing the shortlist of initiatives underway to close out the year. But this year is unprecedented, and the impact of COVID-19 will be significant. 
Let me start by saying that our top priorities right now are the health and safety of our employees as well as our ability to safely and responsibly meet customer and consumer needs. With respect to our results, the magnitude of the impact is difficult to predict. What we know to date, the Q4 retail demand surge is significant and spans multiple retail channels, including e-commerce. While our Foodservice segment is facing headwinds, that impact is more than offset by increased demand in our retail segments. Given the depth and breadth of our portfolio, we are well positioned to meet this increased demand for at-home consumption. Having all these brands and capabilities under one roof is enabling us to meet a wide array of customer and consumer demands. 
Importantly, we've been able to address this retail demand surge because of a strong business continuity plan that we were able to activate as soon as the market disruption began. I'm very proud of the extraordinary efforts across our company and the way our teams have supported each other and our business, all in the pursuit of ensuring that consumers are able to access food during this time. We have decided to temporarily delay some Legacy Pinnacle plants SAP implementation to prioritize supplying customers with the food they require now. But our integration plans are otherwise on track. We will continue to consider and prioritize our business needs as the COVID-19 situation unfolds. 
And I'd like to take a minute to talk a bit more about the Conagra team and, in particular, to highlight the exceptional work of our supply chain team. While demand has sharply increased, our order fulfillment rate so far in Q4 has remained above 90%. This is a testament to the systems we have in place and the commitment of our people. This has been remarkable to see, and I'd like to thank our Chief Supply Chain Officer, Dave Biegger, and the entire supply chain team for their incredible efforts. 
Our supplies of ingredients and packaging remain sufficient, and we've experienced minimal disruption so far in the quarter. All of our North America manufacturing facilities are open and running at high levels of utilization, and our distribution network remains fully operational. Our plants and locations have the resources and critical equipment they need to operate in full compliance with current regulations and CDC guidance. And I'm proud of the remarkable level of collaboration among our sales, customer order management and supply chain teams. That collaboration, along with the work we're doing with customers, is enabling us to ensure we are able to supply consumers with the food they need. Great job all around. 
Although providing specific Q4 guidance is not possible due to the uncertainty of this situation, we do want to give you a sense of our experience so far. The chart on Slide 20 shows what we've seen in the market to date. You can see that there has been a material increase in demand the past few weeks. While some categories are benefiting more than others, all categories and all temperature states are seeing increases. In addition to a significant uptick in sales, our execution has enabled Conagra to outperform and gain share in the categories in which we compete. The data we're showing in the chart is only measured channel data. It's important to note that demand has surged broadly across retail channels, including e-commerce as well as for pickup and delivery, most of which are not reflected in this data. Similar to our measured channel retail business, our e-commerce business is also up in sales, outpacing the competition and gaining share. 
Overall, we made good progress during the third quarter of the year. Our quarterly results were in line with our updated expectations, and we remained on track with all of our fiscal 2020 operational objectives. Going forward, our teams are prioritizing health and safety, adapting well and operating effectively to ensure consumers are able to access food they need. And while this is clearly an unprecedented time, we will not lose focus on executing the Conagra Way playbook. Our brand-building and innovation processes remain critical pieces to our long-term success. We're updating our full year guidance today to note that we now expect to exceed our prior full year guidance for total company sales and profit metrics. 
Beyond fiscal 2020, it's important to note that we are also working with customers as they reevaluate the timing of promotions and shelf resets as they look to minimize in-store disruption during this time of surging demand. Finally, while the situation is still evolving, we believe the sharp increase in at-home eating occasions is generating trial among new consumers that we did not anticipate accessing. We view this dynamic as a long-term opportunity for our portfolio overall and, in particular, our leading frozen business. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Dave."

I hope you and your families are all staying healthy and safe. Before I get into the details, I want to remind you that Q3 has been the first full quarter following the anniversary of the Pinnacle acquisition. As a result, Pinnacle's full quarterly results are now reflected in our organic figures. 
I'll start my remarks this morning by calling out a few highlights from our performance for the quarter, which are outlined on Slide 23. As Sean discussed, our Q3 performance was consistent with the expectations we've provided at CAGNY. This included broad-based category softness early in the quarter, and a return to consumption growth in February prior to the COVID-19 related surge in demand. I'll unpack these results further in the slides to come. But overall, for the third quarter, reported net sales were down 5.6% versus the same period a year ago, with organic net sales down 1.7%. The organic net sales decline was in line with the updated expectations that we provided in February. 
Adjusted gross profit decreased 10.5%, and adjusted operating profit declined 8.9%. We continued to operate efficiently from an SG&A perspective, capturing strong synergies. 
Adjusted EBITDA, which includes equity method investment earnings and pension and postretirement nonservice income, decreased 7.1% in the quarter. And adjusted diluted EPS decreased 7.8% to $0.47 for the quarter. Again, this was in line with our updated expectations. 
Let's jump into net sales a bit more. Slide 24 depicts the 5.6% change versus the same period a year ago. As you can see, the broad-based category softness that we discussed at CAGNY drove our volume down 1.3%. Also our price/mix was unfavorable 40 basis points as we continued to support many of our brands with incremental promotions. As I mentioned on prior quarterly calls, we expect that our year-over-year change in retailer investments to be much smaller and less material in the second half of fiscal '20 and beyond now that this type of spending is in our base. As a result, we will no longer be breaking out that bridging item and will return to our historical approach of showing just the impact of price/mix overall. 
Moving to Slide 25, you can find our sales summary by segment. In the quarter, organic net sales for the Grocery & Snacks segment decreased 3.6%. The snacks business continued to perform well. However, this segment was negatively affected by weather with a warmer-than-normal winter this year stacked against an abnormally cold prior year. On a reported net sales basis, divestiture activity subtracted 5.9%. Organic net sales for Refrigerated & Frozen increased 0.3% as the frozen business continued to perform well behind the recent innovation launches. Importantly, as Sean mentioned, we saw Frozen Meals continue to gain share at an accelerated rate in the quarter. The strength in the frozen business continued to be somewhat masked by declines in the refrigerated business. 
Turning to our international segment. Quarterly net sales and organic net sales for the segment decreased 3.2% and 1.9%, respectively. Throughout the quarter, the segment continued to benefit from the growth in the Canadian snacks business and frozen businesses. Recall that earlier this year, we said that the business in India had a transitory headwind that would rebound in the second half, and that is what we saw in Q3. These benefits were more than offset by economic challenges primarily in Mexico, and certain planned value-over-volume actions. 
Net sales for the Foodservice segment decreased 8% in Q3, while organic net sales decreased 2.2% as divestitures subtracted 5.8%. The organic net sales decrease was driven by volume declines of 4.6% as a result of soft industry traffic trends early in the quarter that were partially offset by a 2.4% improvement in price/mix. 
Turning to Slide 26, you can see the adjusted operating bridge for the quarter versus the prior year. As I mentioned on our second quarter call, input cost inflation did start to increase in Q3. In the quarter, inflation was just over 3%, which translated into a 240-basis-point headwind to margin. Importantly, however, our gross margin expansion levers such as realized productivity, pricing, mix and synergies continue to be effective in Q3. The increased promotional support in the quarter partially offset these benefits, resulting in a 90-basis-point improvement in gross margin. A&P had only a modest impact on margin in the quarter, while reduced SG&A spend benefited our operating margin by 100 basis points during the quarter. 
Slide 27 highlights the significant progress that we've made to date on our overall synergy capture from the Pinnacle acquisition. In Q3, we realized $33 million of incremental synergies, bringing our total synergy capture through the end of Q3 to $145 million. We remain on track to achieve approximately $180 million of synergies by the end of fiscal '20, with $20 million being reinvested into longer-term business opportunities. We also remain on track to deliver our total synergy target of $305 million, again, with $20 million of that being reinvested into longer-term business opportunities. 
Turning to Slide 28, you will see an outline of our adjusted operating profit and operating margin for the third quarter. Our adjusted operating profit decreased 8.9% in Q3, and our adjusted operating margin came in at 15.7%. Across our segments, realized productivity and cost synergies benefited our operating profit in the quarter. These benefits were more than offset by the impacts of higher input costs, lower organic net sales, inventory write-offs, lost profit from divested businesses. 
Slide 29 outlines the various drivers of our Q3 adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations. In Q3, our adjusted diluted EPS of $0.47 decreased by $0.04 compared to the same period a year ago. The decrease in adjusted operating profit and higher tax rate during the quarter more than offset the benefit from improved pension income and interest. 
Slide 30 summarizes Conagra's net debt and cash flow information. I'm sure that our perspective on the balance sheet and liquidity are top of mind in these uncertain times. I'll start by reminding you that we have made significant progress towards our deleveraging and free cash flow targets in recent quarters. Since the closing of the Pinnacle acquisition through the end of Q3, we have reduced total gross debt by over $1.5 billion, improving our balance sheet and the overall health of our business. With respect to Q3, we reduced debt by $450 million while our net debt balance at quarter end was $9.9 billion, and the net debt leverage ratio was 4.8x. At the end of the third quarter, our average debt maturity was approximately 8.8 years. Our weighted average coupon was approximately 4.7%, and approximately 92% of our total debt was fixed. 
Free cash flow year-to-date is $641 million, marking an improvement of over $100 million against the same period last year. We remain on schedule with our deleveraging targets and are confident we will achieve our fiscal '21 leverage target of 3.6 to 3.5x. 
Overall, we remain confident in the strength of our balance sheet, and we have many options for maintaining liquidity. First, we ended the quarter with $99 million of cash on hand. We expect stronger cash flows in Q4 due to the normal seasonality of our business and because of the increased retail demand we're experiencing in light of COVID-19. Our capital allocation priorities remain constant. We are committed to maintaining our dividend, deleveraging and maintaining a solid investment-grade credit rating. Along these lines, we anticipate deleveraging further in Q4 of fiscal '20. 
In addition to cash flow from operations, we also have a $1.6 billion fully undrawn revolving credit facility. During certain months of the year, we issued commercial paper against this revolver to fund working capital needs. We did not need to access the commercial paper markets during Q3, and we don't anticipate needing access during the rest of Q4. Given our strong cash flow and borrowing capacity, we have many options available to fund upcoming debt maturities in August and October. 
At CAGNY last month, we discussed that we continue to explore smart divestitures that can help sculpt top line performance and generate cash flow to support deleveraging. By smart, we mean ensuring that any potential divestiture will deliver a valuation that exceeds our intrinsic value. In this environment, our brands are growing and playing an important role for consumers, and they are generating sales and cash flow in excess of historic levels. While we continue to evaluate portfolio actions, we do not feel pressure to pursue any divestitures that are not value-creating. 
Now recognizing that our new guidance isn't specific, I want to give you some color on what we do know and what we don't know at this point. What we do know is that our retail businesses have seen accelerating shipments. In our domestic retail business, which is about 80% of total company sales, total fourth quarter-to-date shipments have increased approximately 50% versus last year, similar to the most recent consumption data. Internationally, the impact has been a bit mixed, with the Canada retail business seeing increased demand but some softness in global export. 
All told, quarter to-go retail shipments are difficult to predict, given the wide range of possible outcomes. Just as the retail businesses are seeing a surge in demand, our Foodservice business, which is about 10% of total company sales, is beginning to experience the negative impact of the COVID-19 situation. So far in Q4, Foodservice shipment declines have accelerated, and trends imply a Q4 organic net sales decline that could be in the range of down 50% to 60% versus last year. 
Turning to profit. As you would expect, we believe that the significant demand surge in the retail businesses, which are the vast majority of our sales, will positively benefit profit versus our prior guidance. We also expect that the mix of sales and operating leverage of the increased volume will benefit gross margins. Just how much is too speculative to forecast at this time as we are also increasing investment where needed to ensure we support the surge in demand. We are incredibly proud of the investment we are making in the supply chain to meet demand. Not only are we investing as needed to meet customer orders, but we are providing direct financial support and recognition to our people and communities. 
I'd now like to turn to our fiscal '20 guidance on Slide 33. It was just a bit over a month ago that we shared our updated fiscal '20 guidance. And as we told you at CAGNY, we were already seeing improving trends in our categories, giving us confidence in our ability to deliver those updated results. However, as a result of what I just discussed about Q4 to date, we are now unable to forecast Q4 with specificity, but we can say that we expect to exceed the full year guidance on all sales, profit and cash flow metrics. Although this situation remains highly dynamic, we now see upside to the guidance we provided due to the quarter-to-date surge in consumer demand and the related sales and profit impacts. 
What we don't know is how long the impacts of this pandemic will last. Nor do we know exactly how consumers will continue to adapt to the situation in the immediate term or in the longer term as we move into fiscal '21. As Sean mentioned earlier, our portfolio is well positioned to meet this increased consumer demand, and our team is focused on working with customers to make sure that orders and shipments remain uninterrupted during this time of need. As long as our strong execution continues and there are no other material disruptions to our ability to provide products safely to our customers, we expect to exceed our fiscal '20 guidance across all sales, profit and cash flow metrics. 
Thanks for listening, everyone. That concludes my remarks. Sean and I are happy to take questions. Tom McGough and Darren Serrao are not joining us today as we wanted to minimize the number of speakers since we are managing this Q&A from different locations this morning. 
I'll now pass it back to the operator."

I know it's early, but maybe from some of your panel data that you track around some of the increases in either household penetration that you've seen, with some of the quality enhancements you've done, particularly in the frozen space, maybe what some of the repeat rates or -- look like or the ability to gain some of the new trialers that might not have, let's say, tried this product in the last several years or so? Any perspective there would be really helpful. And then I've just got a follow-up."
26893,657097579,1953558,"Conagra Brands, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Mar 31, 2020",2020-03-31,"Earnings Calls","Conagra Brands, Inc.","Executives","Okay, sure, Andrew. Let me tackle that.

Let me tackle that. The concept you're raising is that because we've got this crisis situation and people are eating much more at home and not away from home, products like ours are getting levels of trial that were not anticipated, and that could turn into consistent users over time as that trial converts to repeat. 
I would tell you, that makes sense to me, both intuitively and in terms of the very early data we're beginning to see. There's been a massive amount of transformation in our categories in the last 5 years. Frozen, in particular, doesn't even closely resemble the category that it used to be. The quality of the food is in a completely different place. And we've seen consumers so far who have tried that new food respond extremely favorably to it, and large established brands that had long been forgotten are growing strongly again. 
Now because of this crisis situation, people are at home. As you know, everybody can see it. They're stocking up, and they're stocking up with foods of all kinds across all temperature states, including categories like frozen. So just logically, we know we are getting higher levels of trial here during this phenomenon. 
In terms of data that backs it up, quite frankly, it's just too early to point to a lot of data points. The one place I can tell you that we do look that tends to be a leading indicator is e-commerce. And in the world of e-commerce, what we are seeing is that we are reaching a large number of new triers that we had not reached previously. Now as you think about how that might convert to repeat, you all are probably accustomed to looking at national average repeat rates. Repeat rates will vary depending upon the users. So early adopters, super heavy users will have higher repeat than light users. When you get new triers like this, you tend to be getting lighter users. So it may not be the kind of repeat rates we get from super heavy users. But the point of all of this is it should help categories like frozen. It should help some of our other categories that people may have forgotten about, but it's just too early to quantify the impact of that. 
I would also tell you that we do expect, as this thing gets behind us, that we'll see a return to people eating out. Americans love their restaurants. They love to eat out. And obviously the foodservice space is hurting badly right now, and so we're rooting for that side of the business to bounce back as well."

On the other hand, there are some increased costs, as you've talked about, whether it be for employee benefits and things like that and just the simple inefficiencies of maybe running at, whatever, 100% utilization in inside. But it sounded like you may not know the exact magnitude in the way it all comes together, but the balance of those things, at least of what you're seeing so far, are more to the positive than the negative. I just want to make sure I kind of heard that right."

The priority right now is producing the maximum amount of food that we could possibly produce. And we are running our plants 7 days, as you might imagine. To do that, we have pared back on some of our SKUs so that we can continue to serve the highest-velocity SKUs. So keeping food and stock so we can feed America is our top priority right now, as it is the priority of our retailers. That has caused us to reprioritize in terms of SKUs. And in the case of the innovation resets, I would tell you, the word that comes to mind for me is fluid. We are hearing different things from different customers. 
Many customers -- most customers are just trying to keep products on the shelf right now. Some customers, big ones, have said to us that they want to continue with the shelf set timing. Others had said, we're going to push that back a bit just so we can ensure that we don't have any complexity in anything going on at the store shelves that's going to be a distraction from keeping products in stock. So we are trying to respond to all of our customers' requests so we can do whatever they want. 
In terms of our philosophy on innovation overall, it hasn't changed. It is a central part of the Conagra Way that we're going to keep building out our innovation pipeline. So it's industry-leading, and we're very confident we've got that. We're, as you know, from CAGNY, incredibly excited about the innovation slate that lies ahead. How it flows into the marketplace now will probably be a little bit more customer-by-customer than all in a tighter window as we previously expected. But I think it will be good news overall because we'll have the benefit of that innovation and the pipeline fill helping us next year. 
With respect to promotional activity, as you know, we've cut more promotions in the last 5 years than just about any company in food as we pursue value over volume. We have gotten more aggressive in the last year where we've seen Competition Act irrationally and we needed to defend our market shares, but that has not been in a broad-based way. What I'd tell you on promotions right now is we're honoring all the contracts we have in place, but the tactical dynamic is that we're in daily discussions with our customers on how to help them meet the needs of their shoppers. And many customers are looking to pull back on promotions as they try to manage the basics of just keeping their shelves stocked. And running promotions can exacerbate out of stocks, which is clearly not their goal right now. So we're seeing some cutback on that, and that will just be more of a timing issue than anything else.

That we are -- we remain committed to solid investment grade credit rating. Since we've closed on Pinnacle, we've paid down over $1.5 billion in gross debt. 
For Q4, we expect to be cash positive at a higher level than we previously anticipated, and that additional cash flow, we're going to use to pay down debt. So we don't expect we're going to be net cash flow positive in the fourth quarter at higher-than-expected levels. So as we finish the fiscal year, we'll have our full $1.6 billion revolving credit line, which will be undrawn, and we don't have any debt maturities in Q4 of this year. So as we look to fiscal '21, we have $1.1 billion in debt maturities for the full fiscal year. Our August maturities of $127 million, we expect to fund that from cash on hand. Our next maturities of $775 million are in October. And we'll have flexibility to fund that from the higher expected free cash flow from the business, and we'll just have to see where we land with that given the upside that we're seeing right now. We can access our revolver or we can refinance in the form of either term loans or investment grade notes. 
So as we've been doing every day with our advisers, we'll continue to monitor the markets and evaluate the best structure for Conagra and stay in a position of readiness because, I mean if you look at the market today, as you know, the bank markets are significantly different than they were 2 weeks ago, and I expect that they'll be significantly different a month from now. And so we want to constantly look, see what the markets are saying. But the good news is that we're cash flow positive. We're generating cash. We're going to use that cash to pay down debt.

But simply put, until we're on the other side of this pandemic, sales growth is likely to remain elevated because you've got most of the food away-from-home volume is moving to food at home. And so we've got, obviously, lots of experience with how pantries and warehouses get filled by customers and consumers around situations like hurricanes, and you always see big volumes move into warehouses at the customer level and into pantries and freezers and refrigerators at the consumer level. But how long the pull remains, in this particular case, is directly a function of how long does this thing last and how long are people sheltering in place? And I don't think anybody can predict right now when that is going to end. 
Obviously, the latest thinking here is that we will go until a minimum the end of April with people really spending lots and lots of time at home. And who knows how much further it can extend beyond that. So the way this works is the initial surge of volume is volume that is going to fill warehouses and to fill pantries. But with people not eating out away from home, I think a reasonable person could conclude that they're then in the mode of consuming that volume aggressively. And as they work down those pantry levels and warehouse levels come down to normal levels, then it just becomes kind of a just-in-time replenishment as long as the elevated level of consumption remains. So it's just too early to pin this with any accuracy, but that's kind of the mechanics of how this works."

But I would just say that the unenviable task you all have of kind of coming up with consensus is very similar to the unenviable task we have of things like trying to contemplate fiscal '21 annual operating plan. As you might imagine, if it's business as usual, it's kind of one set of assumptions. If this thing were to continue, if it were to come back in the fall, as I read this morning, that's a whole another ball game. So it's an almost impossible thing to predict. Nobody has a crystal ball, but I think what you guys are going to be looking is a scanner data. What we look at is the scanner data to understand takeaway, what we look at or our shipment patterns. 
And of course, we follow any -- all the health news on the national news every single day, multiple times a day. So I think we're in one of these times where we will endeavor to be incredibly transparent with what we're seeing, what we're thinking, so that we can provide the best perspective we can provide while fully acknowledging that it's awfully -- it's impossible task to be precise right now. Dave, you want to add to that?"

I mean in my whole career, I've never done daily forecasting where you're going out quarters and years and all these things. And so the way we approach it is almost a kind of a high, medium, low type scenario of -- and that's why we laid out what we did today. We wanted to tell you, what do we know right now, what don't we know. And from there, you could then kind of make some assumptions on sort of different scenarios. Sean said it. Since quarter-to-date on the retail side of the business, domestic retail, which is 80% of our business, shipments and consumption are in line. 
And so what I would say is consumption could be a good proxy to try to forecast quarter to go in the retail business since they're in line. There's no guarantee there, right, because you do have ebbs and flows with shipments versus consumption in a short amount of time. But that, I think, would be a proxy to be able to at least try to figure out how this is trending as we move forward. But there's no silver bullets here, unfortunately."

And then just quickly, in terms of your shelf-stable products, I feel like even at CAGNY, the focus here going forward, the strategy is more frozen snacks. Shelf-stable can have a place within the portfolio, but my feel at least is that you might look at some of those brands more proactively in terms of divestment potential. Now, I don't know, right? I mean it seems like you highlighted today on the slides, except Hunt's, Chef Boyardee doing incrementally better before COVID-19 hit. Now there's a pantry load. My feel would be that those areas would actually now do better maybe than some other areas. 
So in terms of the tax asset that you have and kind of entire thought process around divestments and shelf stable, what have you might. Is it fair to think that, at least for the time being, given everything that's going on, that you kind of step back from that and say, ""Well, let's just see how things settle, keep the business as is. We'll reevaluate as we kind of get through this a bit more. But yes, we still realize that we have a tax asset that's expiring at the end of next fiscal year."""

So I did make some comments, Rob, on our prepared comments. The way that we look at divestitures hasn't changed, right? It all starts with our strategic rationale and then the financial rationale. And the point I made today was financial rationale means that the valuation for any potential divested asset must exceed our intrinsic value for the asset. And given the growth we're seeing in our business, given the sales and cash flow at higher levels than they've historically been, that factors into kind of how we view those assets. They're generating a lot of cash for us right now. But my comments were meant to stress that we're going to continue to identify assets for divestiture, but if the potential price doesn't exceed the value to Conagra that we see the brands are worth, then we don't feel pressure to move forward. 
And so we have our capital loss carryforward. It doesn't expend -- it doesn't expire until the end of fiscal '21. And so as Sean said earlier, it's fluid, but we wanted to make sure that point was clear."

I would call it the staples business. And that's how we talked about it at CAGNY, is we've got a decent-sized chunk of our portfolio in what we call staples, and these are products that people rely on. These are our products that drive a lot of foot traffic to our retailers. They're very important to the retailers. They tend to be high gross margin, good cash flow businesses. 
And as I pointed out, at CAGNY, just a small handful of them add up to a big, big chunk of our total staples sales. And so these businesses are very important to us when they're reliably contributing. And most of them have been reliably contributing, and they do a lot of good for our portfolio. On occasion, we've seen competitive activity or other dynamics drive weakness. And our philosophy, historically, has been, look, if we don't have a line of sight to stabilizing something on the top line and the bottom line, then we've divested it. And we've always been open to that. What Dave is pointing out is these are just different times where everything is moving. So it takes any kind of compulsion to want to move and do that and kind of reduces that because these are contributing a lot to us right now. But in general, the point that I wanted to make is our staples businesses across the board almost are very strong, valuable businesses to us. And we'll continue to monitor them to make sure that they are contributing reliably once we get through this pandemic, and then we'll go from there."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our third quarter fiscal 2020 earnings call. On behalf of Conagra Brands, I want to start by expressing my heartfelt hope that you and your families are staying safe during this unprecedented time. 
Today, I'm going to address 2 main topics: Our response to COVID-19 and its impact on our business as well as the underlying trends that we saw in the third quarter, which ended just before the impact of COVID-19 started. Rest assured that we're taking all necessary precautions to protect the health and safety of our employees and our ability to safely and reliably meet consumers' needs. For the most recent status of our efforts to respond to COVID-19, please visit conagrabrands.com. We'll continue to provide updated information on our site as the situation evolves. 
As I'll describe in more detail in a moment, we've taken a number of steps to ensure our supply chain continues to operate well. We're incredibly proud of our teams who have been producing and delivering without disruption. 
While we all remain focused on executing through this rapidly evolving situation, I don't want to lose sight of the fact that we've made significant progress against the operational objectives we established for fiscal 2020. In many ways, our progress against these objectives is enhancing our ability to navigate this crisis. Recall, at the outset of fiscal 2020, we set out to execute on integration, synergy capture and deleveraging, drive strong consumption growth in frozen and snacks, improved trends in Hunt's Tomatoes and Chef Boyardee and the trend in the Legacy Pinnacle business, and drive innovation and growth in Gardein. I'm proud to say that through the third quarter, we remain squarely on track with all of these objectives. 
And from a financial standpoint, the third quarter results are in line with the expectations we provided at CAGNY. As we previously described, industry softness, which started in December in foodservice and pivoted to retail in January, put pressure on consumption trends in several of our key categories, which more than offset share gains. As expected, consumption trends recovered in February prior to COVID-19 impact. It's important to keep in mind that our third quarter ended on February 23. At that time, there were very few reported cases in the U.S. and, notably, no widespread change in behavior. As we all know, that has changed significantly in recent weeks. 
From the second week of our fiscal fourth quarter-to-date, we've experienced the unprecedented impact of COVID-19 as consumers have stocked up on food and shift rapidly to eating more at home. Given the quality of our brands and the categories we participate in, Conagra is well positioned to serve consumers during this time of disruption and extraordinary demand. Our team is hard at work in close coordination with our customers to ensure that consumers have access to the food they need to stay safe at home. 
At this point, the magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 impact is still uncertain. However, I can tell you that we expect to exceed our prior full year guidance for total company sales and profit metrics, assuming the end-to-end supply chain continues to operate effectively. We will provide more detail on the impact of COVID-19 in a moment. But first, we would like to walk you through the highlights of the third quarter. 
During the third quarter, our performance was in line with the updated expectations that we provided at CAGNY. Organic net sales growth decreased 1.7%, while our adjusted operating margin was 15.7%, and our adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations was $0.47 for the quarter. As we noted at CAGNY, we saw category softness in January that was greater than anticipated. At the time, we told you that our more recent data was improving, and we expect it to bounce back, and that's exactly what happened. 
As you can see on Slide 7, Total Conagra retail sales returned to growth in the final 4 weeks of February and sustained a normal rate into the first week of Q4. Clearly, even before the current disruption due to COVID-19, we were well on track and had already seen the expected rebound in consumption trends. 
Not only did we see growth of 0.9% in the 4 weeks ended February 23, but what we saw in the week ended March 1, which is in our fiscal fourth quarter, reaffirmed this return to consumption growth. And during the quarter, we continued to deliver on integration, synergies and deleveraging. 
On integration, we have been converting Legacy Pinnacle plants over to SAP. And through Q3, this multiyear process has been progressing on plan. We captured $33 million in incremental synergies, increasing our total through the end of Q3 million to $145 million. And we made further progress on reducing our net debt position by paying down $450 million of debt during the quarter. 
Slide 9 demonstrates our continued success in the important frozen category. As both graphics demonstrate, we maintained strong growth during the quarter across our frozen portfolio, both for Total Conagra Brands and Legacy Conagra Brands. As we will discuss later in the presentation, Total Conagra's frozen growth has been driven by both Legacy Conagra and Legacy Pinnacle. 
Slide 10 shows the outsized performance of Conagra's Frozen Meals within the category. Not only did we have yet another quarter of gaining share of shelf and share of sales, but we also did so at an accelerated rate. 
Our snacks segment reported solid growth in the third quarter. Total snacks were up 2.9% during the quarter and 8.7% on a 2-year basis. Our results were led by our meat snacks and seeds businesses, which delivered growth of 8.4% and 5.9%, respectively. 
And as Slide 12 shows, we continued to gain share in many of our snack categories in Q3. 
Another key objective for fiscal 2020 was to improve trends in Hunt's tomatoes and Chef Boyardee. As you can see on Slide 13, that's just what we've done. Over the 5-week period ended February 23, Hunt's tomatoes and Chef Boyardee gained 2.2% and 4.5% in dollar sales growth, respectively. And both brands also grew share of retail sales over that same period, as outlined on Slide 14. It's worth noting that these trends for Hunt's tomatoes and Chef Boyardee continued into the first week of our fiscal fourth quarter prior to the impact of COVID-19. 
Slide 15 shows a milestone for Conagra as we bent the trend on Legacy Pinnacle on both a 1-year and a 2-year basis. Recall that in December 2018, we outlined a number of actions that were needed to get Pinnacle back on track. We also indicated that we did not expect to see the impact of those actions until the second half of fiscal 2020, which, as you can see here, is exactly what has occurred. 
And Slide 16 shows how we've been able to bend the trend in the big 3 legacy Pinnacle brands by implementing the Conagra Way playbook. We started with Wish-Bone, where the missteps came from several executional issues, including a label change, which we quickly addressed to stabilize the brand. As a result, we saw an immediate spike in retail sales before returning to more normal levels. 
Birds Eye, which is our biggest brand, took a little longer as the playbook required us to remove lower-performing SKUs, which negatively impacted sales and distribution. Notably, Birds Eye is now contributing to our growth as the innovation we launched in the first half of fiscal 2020 builds momentum with more innovation to come. 
With respect to Duncan Hines, we've made great progress on reframing the brand as a sweet treat but recognize that there's more work to be done. We're focused on introducing more on-trend innovation as we trim lower-performing SKUs. While it will take time to return this brand to growth, we're confident in the ongoing implementation of the Conagra Way playbook. 
Another Legacy Pinnacle brand that has benefited from the Conagra Way is Gardein, which is accelerating at very strong rates. As a reminder, we've made significant investments to expand Gardein's manufacturing capacity, which came online earlier this fiscal year. As the slide shows, the brand's growth is attributed to more than just meatless burgers and includes meatless options for chicken, seafood and sausages, to name a few. As you can see, it's clear that we remained on track with all our fiscal 2020 operational objectives through the third quarter. 
Now let's turn to the current quarter and the balance of the year. Typically, we would be spending our time on this call reaffirming our guidance and discussing the shortlist of initiatives underway to close out the year. But this year is unprecedented, and the impact of COVID-19 will be significant. 
Let me start by saying that our top priorities right now are the health and safety of our employees as well as our ability to safely and responsibly meet customer and consumer needs. With respect to our results, the magnitude of the impact is difficult to predict. What we know to date, the Q4 retail demand surge is significant and spans multiple retail channels, including e-commerce. While our Foodservice segment is facing headwinds, that impact is more than offset by increased demand in our retail segments. Given the depth and breadth of our portfolio, we are well positioned to meet this increased demand for at-home consumption. Having all these brands and capabilities under one roof is enabling us to meet a wide array of customer and consumer demands. 
Importantly, we've been able to address this retail demand surge because of a strong business continuity plan that we were able to activate as soon as the market disruption began. I'm very proud of the extraordinary efforts across our company and the way our teams have supported each other and our business, all in the pursuit of ensuring that consumers are able to access food during this time. We have decided to temporarily delay some Legacy Pinnacle plants SAP implementation to prioritize supplying customers with the food they require now. But our integration plans are otherwise on track. We will continue to consider and prioritize our business needs as the COVID-19 situation unfolds. 
And I'd like to take a minute to talk a bit more about the Conagra team and, in particular, to highlight the exceptional work of our supply chain team. While demand has sharply increased, our order fulfillment rate so far in Q4 has remained above 90%. This is a testament to the systems we have in place and the commitment of our people. This has been remarkable to see, and I'd like to thank our Chief Supply Chain Officer, Dave Biegger, and the entire supply chain team for their incredible efforts. 
Our supplies of ingredients and packaging remain sufficient, and we've experienced minimal disruption so far in the quarter. All of our North America manufacturing facilities are open and running at high levels of utilization, and our distribution network remains fully operational. Our plants and locations have the resources and critical equipment they need to operate in full compliance with current regulations and CDC guidance. And I'm proud of the remarkable level of collaboration among our sales, customer order management and supply chain teams. That collaboration, along with the work we're doing with customers, is enabling us to ensure we are able to supply consumers with the food they need. Great job all around. 
Although providing specific Q4 guidance is not possible due to the uncertainty of this situation, we do want to give you a sense of our experience so far. The chart on Slide 20 shows what we've seen in the market to date. You can see that there has been a material increase in demand the past few weeks. While some categories are benefiting more than others, all categories and all temperature states are seeing increases. In addition to a significant uptick in sales, our execution has enabled Conagra to outperform and gain share in the categories in which we compete. The data we're showing in the chart is only measured channel data. It's important to note that demand has surged broadly across retail channels, including e-commerce as well as for pickup and delivery, most of which are not reflected in this data. Similar to our measured channel retail business, our e-commerce business is also up in sales, outpacing the competition and gaining share. 
Overall, we made good progress during the third quarter of the year. Our quarterly results were in line with our updated expectations, and we remained on track with all of our fiscal 2020 operational objectives. Going forward, our teams are prioritizing health and safety, adapting well and operating effectively to ensure consumers are able to access food they need. And while this is clearly an unprecedented time, we will not lose focus on executing the Conagra Way playbook. Our brand-building and innovation processes remain critical pieces to our long-term success. We're updating our full year guidance today to note that we now expect to exceed our prior full year guidance for total company sales and profit metrics. 
Beyond fiscal 2020, it's important to note that we are also working with customers as they reevaluate the timing of promotions and shelf resets as they look to minimize in-store disruption during this time of surging demand. Finally, while the situation is still evolving, we believe the sharp increase in at-home eating occasions is generating trial among new consumers that we did not anticipate accessing. We view this dynamic as a long-term opportunity for our portfolio overall and, in particular, our leading frozen business. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Dave."

Before I get into the details, I want to remind you that Q3 has been the first full quarter following the anniversary of the Pinnacle acquisition. As",2029,"Thanks, Sean, and good morning, everyone. I hope you and your families are all staying healthy and safe. Before I get into the details, I want to remind you that Q3 has been the first full quarter following the anniversary of the Pinnacle acquisition. As a result, Pinnacle's full quarterly results are now reflected in our organic figures. 
I'll start my remarks this morning by calling out a few highlights from our performance for the quarter, which are outlined on Slide 23. As Sean discussed, our Q3 performance was consistent with the expectations we've provided at CAGNY. This included broad-based category softness early in the quarter, and a return to consumption growth in February prior to the COVID-19 related surge in demand. I'll unpack these results further in the slides to come. But overall, for the third quarter, reported net sales were down 5.6% versus the same period a year ago, with organic net sales down 1.7%. The organic net sales decline was in line with the updated expectations that we provided in February. 
Adjusted gross profit decreased 10.5%, and adjusted operating profit declined 8.9%. We continued to operate efficiently from an SG&A perspective, capturing strong synergies. 
Adjusted EBITDA, which includes equity method investment earnings and pension and postretirement nonservice income, decreased 7.1% in the quarter. And adjusted diluted EPS decreased 7.8% to $0.47 for the quarter. Again, this was in line with our updated expectations. 
Let's jump into net sales a bit more. Slide 24 depicts the 5.6% change versus the same period a year ago. As you can see, the broad-based category softness that we discussed at CAGNY drove our volume down 1.3%. Also our price/mix was unfavorable 40 basis points as we continued to support many of our brands with incremental promotions. As I mentioned on prior quarterly calls, we expect that our year-over-year change in retailer investments to be much smaller and less material in the second half of fiscal '20 and beyond now that this type of spending is in our base. As a result, we will no longer be breaking out that bridging item and will return to our historical approach of showing just the impact of price/mix overall. 
Moving to Slide 25, you can find our sales summary by segment. In the quarter, organic net sales for the Grocery & Snacks segment decreased 3.6%. The snacks business continued to perform well. However, this segment was negatively affected by weather with a warmer-than-normal winter this year stacked against an abnormally cold prior year. On a reported net sales basis, divestiture activity subtracted 5.9%. Organic net sales for Refrigerated & Frozen increased 0.3% as the frozen business continued to perform well behind the recent innovation launches. Importantly, as Sean mentioned, we saw Frozen Meals continue to gain share at an accelerated rate in the quarter. The strength in the frozen business continued to be somewhat masked by declines in the refrigerated business. 
Turning to our international segment. Quarterly net sales and organic net sales for the segment decreased 3.2% and 1.9%, respectively. Throughout the quarter, the segment continued to benefit from the growth in the Canadian snacks business and frozen businesses. Recall that earlier this year, we said that the business in India had a transitory headwind that would rebound in the second half, and that is what we saw in Q3. These benefits were more than offset by economic challenges primarily in Mexico, and certain planned value-over-volume actions. 
Net sales for the Foodservice segment decreased 8% in Q3, while organic net sales decreased 2.2% as divestitures subtracted 5.8%. The organic net sales decrease was driven by volume declines of 4.6% as a result of soft industry traffic trends early in the quarter that were partially offset by a 2.4% improvement in price/mix. 
Turning to Slide 26, you can see the adjusted operating bridge for the quarter versus the prior year. As I mentioned on our second quarter call, input cost inflation did start to increase in Q3. In the quarter, inflation was just over 3%, which translated into a 240-basis-point headwind to margin. Importantly, however, our gross margin expansion levers such as realized productivity, pricing, mix and synergies continue to be effective in Q3. The increased promotional support in the quarter partially offset these benefits, resulting in a 90-basis-point improvement in gross margin. A&P had only a modest impact on margin in the quarter, while reduced SG&A spend benefited our operating margin by 100 basis points during the quarter. 
Slide 27 highlights the significant progress that we've made to date on our overall synergy capture from the Pinnacle acquisition. In Q3, we realized $33 million of incremental synergies, bringing our total synergy capture through the end of Q3 to $145 million. We remain on track to achieve approximately $180 million of synergies by the end of fiscal '20, with $20 million being reinvested into longer-term business opportunities. We also remain on track to deliver our total synergy target of $305 million, again, with $20 million of that being reinvested into longer-term business opportunities. 
Turning to Slide 28, you will see an outline of our adjusted operating profit and operating margin for the third quarter. Our adjusted operating profit decreased 8.9% in Q3, and our adjusted operating margin came in at 15.7%. Across our segments, realized productivity and cost synergies benefited our operating profit in the quarter. These benefits were more than offset by the impacts of higher input costs, lower organic net sales, inventory write-offs, lost profit from divested businesses. 
Slide 29 outlines the various drivers of our Q3 adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations. In Q3, our adjusted diluted EPS of $0.47 decreased by $0.04 compared to the same period a year ago. The decrease in adjusted operating profit and higher tax rate during the quarter more than offset the benefit from improved pension income and interest. 
Slide 30 summarizes Conagra's net debt and cash flow information. I'm sure that our perspective on the balance sheet and liquidity are top of mind in these uncertain times. I'll start by reminding you that we have made significant progress towards our deleveraging and free cash flow targets in recent quarters. Since the closing of the Pinnacle acquisition through the end of Q3, we have reduced total gross debt by over $1.5 billion, improving our balance sheet and the overall health of our business. With respect to Q3, we reduced debt by $450 million while our net debt balance at quarter end was $9.9 billion, and the net debt leverage ratio was 4.8x. At the end of the third quarter, our average debt maturity was approximately 8.8 years. Our weighted average coupon was approximately 4.7%, and approximately 92% of our total debt was fixed. 
Free cash flow year-to-date is $641 million, marking an improvement of over $100 million against the same period last year. We remain on schedule with our deleveraging targets and are confident we will achieve our fiscal '21 leverage target of 3.6 to 3.5x. 
Overall, we remain confident in the strength of our balance sheet, and we have many options for maintaining liquidity. First, we ended the quarter with $99 million of cash on hand. We expect stronger cash flows in Q4 due to the normal seasonality of our business and because of the increased retail demand we're experiencing in light of COVID-19. Our capital allocation priorities remain constant. We are committed to maintaining our dividend, deleveraging and maintaining a solid investment-grade credit rating. Along these lines, we anticipate deleveraging further in Q4 of fiscal '20. 
In addition to cash flow from operations, we also have a $1.6 billion fully undrawn revolving credit facility. During certain months of the year, we issued commercial paper against this revolver to fund working capital needs. We did not need to access the commercial paper markets during Q3, and we don't anticipate needing access during the rest of Q4. Given our strong cash flow and borrowing capacity, we have many options available to fund upcoming debt maturities in August and October. 
At CAGNY last month, we discussed that we continue to explore smart divestitures that can help sculpt top line performance and generate cash flow to support deleveraging. By smart, we mean ensuring that any potential divestiture will deliver a valuation that exceeds our intrinsic value. In this environment, our brands are growing and playing an important role for consumers, and they are generating sales and cash flow in excess of historic levels. While we continue to evaluate portfolio actions, we do not feel pressure to pursue any divestitures that are not value-creating. 
Now recognizing that our new guidance isn't specific, I want to give you some color on what we do know and what we don't know at this point. What we do know is that our retail businesses have seen accelerating shipments. In our domestic retail business, which is about 80% of total company sales, total fourth quarter-to-date shipments have increased approximately 50% versus last year, similar to the most recent consumption data. Internationally, the impact has been a bit mixed, with the Canada retail business seeing increased demand but some softness in global export. 
All told, quarter to-go retail shipments are difficult to predict, given the wide range of possible outcomes. Just as the retail businesses are seeing a surge in demand, our Foodservice business, which is about 10% of total company sales, is beginning to experience the negative impact of the COVID-19 situation. So far in Q4, Foodservice shipment declines have accelerated, and trends imply a Q4 organic net sales decline that could be in the range of down 50% to 60% versus last year. 
Turning to profit. As you would expect, we believe that the significant demand surge in the retail businesses, which are the vast majority of our sales, will positively benefit profit versus our prior guidance. We also expect that the mix of sales and operating leverage of the increased volume will benefit gross margins. Just how much is too speculative to forecast at this time as we are also increasing investment where needed to ensure we support the surge in demand. We are incredibly proud of the investment we are making in the supply chain to meet demand. Not only are we investing as needed to meet customer orders, but we are providing direct financial support and recognition to our people and communities. 
I'd now like to turn to our fiscal '20 guidance on Slide 33. It was just a bit over a month ago that we shared our updated fiscal '20 guidance. And as we told you at CAGNY, we were already seeing improving trends in our categories, giving us confidence in our ability to deliver those updated results. However, as a result of what I just discussed about Q4 to date, we are now unable to forecast Q4 with specificity, but we can say that we expect to exceed the full year guidance on all sales, profit and cash flow metrics. Although this situation remains highly dynamic, we now see upside to the guidance we provided due to the quarter-to-date surge in consumer demand and the related sales and profit impacts. 
What we don't know is how long the impacts of this pandemic will last. Nor do we know exactly how consumers will continue to adapt to the situation in the immediate term or in the longer term as we move into fiscal '21. As Sean mentioned earlier, our portfolio is well positioned to meet this increased consumer demand, and our team is focused on working with customers to make sure that orders and shipments remain uninterrupted during this time of need. As long as our strong execution continues and there are no other material disruptions to our ability to provide products safely to our customers, we expect to exceed our fiscal '20 guidance across all sales, profit and cash flow metrics. 
Thanks for listening, everyone. That concludes my remarks. Sean and I are happy to take questions. Tom McGough and Darren Serrao are not joining us today as we wanted to minimize the number of speakers since we are managing this Q&A from different locations this morning. 
I'll now pass it back to the operator."

I know it's early, but maybe from some of your panel data that you track around some of the increases in either household penetration that you've seen, with some of the quality enhancements you've done, particularly in the frozen space, maybe what some of the repeat rates or -- look like or the ability to gain some of the new trialers that might not have, let's say, tried this product in the last several years or so? Any perspective there would be really helpful. And then I've just got a follow-up."

Let me tackle that. The concept you're raising is that because we've got this crisis situation and people are eating much more at home and not away from home, products like ours are getting levels of trial that were not anticipated, and that could turn into consistent users over time as that trial converts to repeat. 
I would tell you, that makes sense to me, both intuitively and in terms of the very early data we're beginning to see. There's been a massive amount of transformation in our categories in the last 5 years. Frozen, in particular, doesn't even closely resemble the category that it used to be. The quality of the food is in a completely different place. And we've seen consumers so far who have tried that new food respond extremely favorably to it, and large established brands that had long been forgotten are growing strongly again. 
Now because of this crisis situation, people are at home. As you know, everybody can see it. They're stocking up, and they're stocking up with foods of all kinds across all temperature states, including categories like frozen. So just logically, we know we are getting higher levels of trial here during this phenomenon. 
In terms of data that backs it up, quite frankly, it's just too early to point to a lot of data points. The one place I can tell you that we do look that tends to be a leading indicator is e-commerce. And in the world of e-commerce, what we are seeing is that we are reaching a large number of new triers that we had not reached previously. Now as you think about how that might convert to repeat, you all are probably accustomed to looking at national average repeat rates. Repeat rates will vary depending upon the users. So early adopters, super heavy users will have higher repeat than light users. When you get new triers like this, you tend to be getting lighter users. So it may not be the kind of repeat rates we get from super heavy users. But the point of all of this is it should help categories like frozen. It should help some of our other categories that people may have forgotten about, but it's just too early to quantify the impact of that. 
I would also tell you that we do expect, as this thing gets behind us, that we'll see a return to people eating out. Americans love their restaurants. They love to eat out. And obviously the foodservice space is hurting badly right now, and so we're rooting for that side of the business to bounce back as well."

The priority right now is producing the maximum amount of food that we could possibly produce. And we are running our plants 7 days, as you might imagine. To do that, we have pared back on some of our SKUs so that we can continue to serve the highest-velocity SKUs. So keeping food and stock so we can feed America is our top priority right now, as it is the priority of our retailers. That has caused us to reprioritize in terms of SKUs. And in the case of the innovation resets, I would tell you, the word that comes to mind for me is fluid. We are hearing different things from different customers. 
Many customers -- most customers are just trying to keep products on the shelf right now. Some customers, big ones, have said to us that they want to continue with the shelf set timing. Others had said, we're going to push that back a bit just so we can ensure that we don't have any complexity in anything going on at the store shelves that's going to be a distraction from keeping products in stock. So we are trying to respond to all of our customers' requests so we can do whatever they want. 
In terms of our philosophy on innovation overall, it hasn't changed. It is a central part of the Conagra Way that we're going to keep building out our innovation pipeline. So it's industry-leading, and we're very confident we've got that. We're, as you know, from CAGNY, incredibly excited about the innovation slate that lies ahead. How it flows into the marketplace now will probably be a little bit more customer-by-customer than all in a tighter window as we previously expected. But I think it will be good news overall because we'll have the benefit of that innovation and the pipeline fill helping us next year. 
With respect to promotional activity, as you know, we've cut more promotions in the last 5 years than just about any company in food as we pursue value over volume. We have gotten more aggressive in the last year where we've seen Competition Act irrationally and we needed to defend our market shares, but that has not been in a broad-based way. What I'd tell you on promotions right now is we're honoring all the contracts we have in place, but the tactical dynamic is that we're in daily discussions with our customers on how to help them meet the needs of their shoppers. And many customers are looking to pull back on promotions as they try to manage the basics of just keeping their shelves stocked. And running promotions can exacerbate out of stocks, which is clearly not their goal right now. So we're seeing some cutback on that, and that will just be more of a timing issue than anything else.

So as we finish the fiscal year, we'll have our full $1.6 billion revolving credit line, which will be undrawn, and we don't have any debt maturities in Q4 of this year.

Our next maturities of $775 million are in October. And we'll have flexibility to fund that from the higher expected free cash flow from the business, and we'll just have to see where we land with that given the upside that we're seeing right now.

In terms of the retail or investment, yes, it's really de minimis. So a lot of the slotting and other investments year-on-year, it's just not as significant, so we're just going to show price/mix in total as opposed to break that out now."

But simply put, until we're on the other side of this pandemic, sales growth is likely to remain elevated because you've got most of the food away-from-home volume is moving to food at home. And so we've got, obviously, lots of experience with how pantries and warehouses get filled by customers and consumers around situations like hurricanes, and you always see big volumes move into warehouses at the customer level and into pantries and freezers and refrigerators at the consumer level. But how long the pull remains, in this particular case, is directly a function of how long does this thing last and how long are people sheltering in place? And I don't think anybody can predict right now when that is going to end. 
Obviously, the latest thinking here is that we will go until a minimum the end of April with people really spending lots and lots of time at home. And who knows how much further it can extend beyond that. So the way this works is the initial surge of volume is volume that is going to fill warehouses and to fill pantries. But with people not eating out away from home, I think a reasonable person could conclude that they're then in the mode of consuming that volume aggressively. And as they work down those pantry levels and warehouse levels come down to normal levels, then it just becomes kind of a just-in-time replenishment as long as the elevated level of consumption remains. So it's just too early to pin this with any accuracy, but that's kind of the mechanics of how this works."

Is it, A, I don't know. Yes, given March is up 40%. Retail consumer, if that were sustainable, then yes, I would take that piece of the business and say up 40%. And given our guide on Foodservice, take that down 50%, and then we'll just have to see how that plays out. And maybe that reverses next year if there's a pantry load, and maybe not. So just -- there's a lot in there, but I just kind of wanted to hear what do you want us to do in terms of if there is no specificity that can be provided.

Let me just make one general comment, Dave, and then you could take a shot. But I would just say that the unenviable task you all have of kind of coming up with consensus is very similar to the unenviable task we have of things like trying to contemplate fiscal '21 annual operating plan. As you might imagine, if it's business as usual, it's kind of one set of assumptions. If this thing were to continue, if it were to come back in the fall, as I read this morning, that's a whole another ball game. So it's an almost impossible thing to predict. Nobody has a crystal ball, but I think what you guys are going to be looking is a scanner data. What we look at is the scanner data to understand takeaway, what we look at or our shipment patterns. 
And of course, we follow any -- all the health news on the national news every single day, multiple times a day. So I think we're in one of these times where we will endeavor to be incredibly transparent with what we're seeing, what we're thinking, so that we can provide the best perspective we can provide while fully acknowledging that it's awfully -- it's impossible task to be precise right now.

Since quarter-to-date on the retail side of the business, domestic retail, which is 80% of our business, shipments and consumption are in line. 
And so what I would say is consumption could be a good proxy to try to forecast quarter to go in the retail business since they're in line. There's no guarantee there, right, because you do have ebbs and flows with shipments versus consumption in a short amount of time. But that, I think, would be a proxy to be able to at least try to figure out how this is trending as we move forward. But there's no silver bullets here, unfortunately."

And then just quickly, in terms of your shelf-stable products, I feel like even at CAGNY, the focus here going forward, the strategy is more frozen snacks. Shelf-stable can have a place within the portfolio, but my feel at least is that you might look at some of those brands more proactively in terms of divestment potential. Now, I don't know, right? I mean it seems like you highlighted today on the slides, except Hunt's, Chef Boyardee doing incrementally better before COVID-19 hit. Now there's a pantry load. My feel would be that those areas would actually now do better maybe than some other areas. 
So in terms of the tax asset that you have and kind of entire thought process around divestments and shelf stable, what have you might. Is it fair to think that, at least for the time being, given everything that's going on, that you kind of step back from that and say, ""Well, let's just see how things settle, keep the business as is. We'll reevaluate as we kind of get through this a bit more. But yes, we still realize that we have a tax asset that's expiring at the end of next fiscal year."""

And given the growth we're seeing in our business, given the sales and cash flow at higher levels than they've historically been, that factors into kind of how we view those assets. They're generating a lot of cash for us right now. But my comments were meant to stress that we're going to continue to identify assets for divestiture, but if the potential price doesn't exceed the value to Conagra that we see the brands are worth, then we don't feel pressure to move forward. 
And so we have our capital loss carryforward. It doesn't expend -- it doesn't expire until the end of fiscal '21. And so as Sean said earlier, it's fluid, but we wanted to make sure that point was clear."

I would call it the staples business. And that's how we talked about it at CAGNY, is we've got a decent-sized chunk of our portfolio in what we call staples, and these are products that people rely on. These are our products that drive a lot of foot traffic to our retailers. They're very important to the retailers. They tend to be high gross margin, good cash flow businesses. 
And as I pointed out, at CAGNY, just a small handful of them add up to a big, big chunk of our total staples sales. And so these businesses are very important to us when they're reliably contributing. And most of them have been reliably contributing, and they do a lot of good for our portfolio. On occasion, we've seen competitive activity or other dynamics drive weakness. And our philosophy, historically, has been, look, if we don't have a line of sight to stabilizing something on the top line and the bottom line, then we've divested it. And we've always been open to that. What Dave is pointing out is these are just different times where everything is moving. So it takes any kind of compulsion to want to move and do that and kind of reduces that because these are contributing a lot to us right now. But in general, the point that I wanted to make is our staples businesses across the board almost are very strong, valuable businesses to us. And we'll continue to monitor them to make sure that they are contributing reliably once we get through this pandemic, and then we'll go from there."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter fiscal 2020 earnings call. On behalf of Conagra Brands, I want to start by expressing my heartfelt hope that you and your families are continuing to stay safe and healthy. 
On today's call, we're going to address our fourth quarter and fiscal 2020 results, our expectations for fiscal 2021 and our perspective on why Conagra is uniquely positioned to succeed in this new environment. But first, I want to provide some context around what has brought us to this point. Over the past 5 years, we have been purposefully architecting one of the largest transformations in the food industry. When we embarked on this process, we made major strategic decisions on where to compete and how to win. After decades as a food conglomerate, we transformed into a pure-play branded food company with a portfolio focused on competing in 3 domains: frozen, snacks and staples. 
We committed to perpetually reshaping our portfolio for better growth and better margins and established a disciplined approach rooted in a playbook that we call the Conagra Way. This relentlessly principle-based playbook is filled with repeatable and scalable processes that focus on modernizing our iconic brands through superior food, contemporary packaging and strong consistent marketing investment. The Conagra Way is not just a way to build brands but an operating model that has helped cultivate our agile, motivated and highly energized culture. As I'll describe in more detail in a moment, fiscal 2020 saw unprecedented performance as we built upon the extraordinary progress we have made over the past 5 years. We further strengthened our business, including getting Legacy Pinnacle back on track and delivered strong financial results. 
During the fourth quarter, in particular, our transformation was put to the test, and you are seeing the fruits of our labor. Our modernized portfolio and agile culture enabled us to respond the increased consumer demand driven by COVID-19. At this point, the degree to which demand will return to historical norms is still uncertain. And the timing of the changes in consumer demand is also uncertain. However, we believe that demand will likely remain elevated in the near term given both consumer perceptions about returning to work and eating outside the home as well as the fact that consumers are discovering and rediscovering the pleasures, conveniences and tremendous value proposition of dining at home. 
Dave will cover the financials in more detail, but I want to let you know that we continue to be on track to deliver our fiscal 2022 algorithm, and we remain committed to achieving our leverage target of 3.5x to 3.6x by the end of fiscal 2021. 
As we'll detail today, we believe our portfolio is optimally positioned to succeed in the new normal. We are focused on making the right investments to ensure that we can continue to safely and reliably meet consumers' needs in fiscal '21 and the longer term. 
In today's presentation, we will cover our business update, the behavioral shifts we have seen and how Conagra is well positioned to benefit from these shifts and what we expect going forward in terms of our near-term outlook and the opportunity to create long-term value. 
Beginning with our business update. Before I get into the numbers, I would like to recognize that our extraordinary results have only been possible because of the thousands of hard-working Conagra team members on the front lines across North America. Here at Conagra, we talk about infusing a refuse-to-lose attitude and never before have we seen our team make such extraordinary efforts. The team's commitment has enabled us to meet the elevated demand from our customers and the communities we serve and deliver the strong results that we are announcing today. I couldn't be more proud of all that they have accomplished. To all of our team members, thank you. Great job all around. 
During the fourth quarter, we experienced significant growth across our core operating metrics, including 21.5% growth in organic net sales and a 108.3% growth in adjusted EPS. These results helped contribute to our rapid progress in reducing our leverage, and I'm proud to say that we ended the quarter with a net leverage ratio of 4.0x, down from 4.8x in the third quarter. 
As you can see on Slide 9, our growth was not confined to one area, but was driven by strong retail sales across our portfolio, spanning staples, frozen and snacks. Our strong growth in e-commerce continued to accelerate, both on an absolute basis and as a percentage of our overall sales. The work we've done over the past several years to improve our e-commerce capabilities has certainly paid off. As consumers increasingly adopt online grocery shopping, our share of e-commerce sales has steadily increased. 
Slide 11 highlights that our disciplined approach to innovation is clearly working. Our absolute sales on new innovation introduced this year increased 43% compared to our innovation slate of fiscal 2019. As a reminder, we stated at our initial Investor Day that our goal was to have 15% of total sales coming from products launched within the past 3 years. Well, today, I'm proud to say that we're consistently performing above that level. In a few minutes, we'll provide you some of the new innovation that we have in store for fiscal 2021 as we seek to build upon this success. 
As we've discussed previously, frozen is an increasingly important domain for consumers, especially in today's environment. For the fourth quarter, total Conagra frozen retail sales grew 26.2% over last year with strong growth across each frozen category, including single-serve meals, vegetables, multi-serve meals and plant-based meal alternatives. 
And Slide 13 shows, as we grew, we also gained share in the important Frozen Meals category during the quarter, continuing a trend we've seen for some time now. The Conagra Way playbook continues to pay off. And while the trends have remained strong, there's even more opportunity, particularly in frozen vegetables. Birds Eye faced some unique dynamics in the quarter. As I said earlier, the category remained extremely relevant for consumers. We continue to see robust demand for frozen vegetables, and our retail sales up 26.5% during the quarter. Importantly, Birds Eye hold the top position in category share and has 2x the share of the next branded player. 
Given the incredible surge in demand we experienced during the fourth quarter and our #1 brand position, we hit a ceiling on capacity. Furthermore, we made the decision to temporarily close a plant during the quarter due to COVID-19, which further constrained capacity. The good news is the plant is safe back up and running flat out. In addition, we have made the strategic decision to bring on more external partners to fulfill demand and rebuild inventory. These investments in our supply chain will allow us to efficiently meet the elevated demand we are seeing today and expect to see going forward. This is an important example of that investment, and I will expand on this in a few minutes. 
Turning to snacks. Recall that our snacks business overindexes to convenience stores, which saw softer traffic due to COVID-19 during our Q4. Also, the seeds category was impacted by the postponement and, in many areas of the country, cancellation of baseball and softball seasons. Baseball and seeds go hand in hand, and the loss of these opportunities had a negative impact on the category. Even despite these discrete headwinds, the snacks business delivered a terrific 20.1% year-over-year growth and a 26.4% growth on a 2-year basis. 
And on Slide 16, you can see our performance in staples, a category that is more relevant than ever before. Our total staples business grew an incredible 46.3% for the quarter. The 6 brands to the right are our largest staples brands accounting for over 50% of our staple sales at retail pre-COVID, and each experienced considerable growth in the quarter. These businesses are proving to be a distinct benefit to our portfolio. But while we're pleased with our results for the quarter and the year, we are particularly excited about what the quarter has taught us about the opportunity that lies ahead as consumers have shifted their behaviors and eating habits. 
Slide 18 shows some of the key ways in which we're seeing consumers' behavior shift in response to COVID-19. Many consumers are rediscovering the enjoyment associated with at-home eating, whether it's making fun baked goods, cooking with the family or enjoying a movie night with some snacks. Numerous consumers are also discovering new things about food during this time. Many are learning how to truly cook for the first time or discovering they can recreate restaurant favorites at home. We believe that many of these activities have staying power and are likely to persist even after a post-COVID world in whatever new normal we settle into. We also believe our broad and refreshed portfolio of innovative products is best suited to meet consumers' needs as they engage in these food behaviors. 
And Slide 19 shows the strong growth during the quarter across our iconic brands, demonstrating how well suited our portfolio is to meet these behaviors. 
Our ability to meet the changing consumer needs is balanced across our 3 domains. Slide 20 shows how household penetration grew during the quarter in staples, snacks and frozen. 
And as we've been able to modernize and innovate our iconic brands, we are attracting younger consumers. Slide 21 shows that new consumers to our brands over-indexed in the younger millennial and Gen X market segments. 
Driving new trial is always a key focus for us. The investments that we've made over the past 5 years in updating our food with bold, on-trend flavors and modern food attributes were premised on the belief that if we can get people to try our food, they will come back for more. And that is exactly what's happening. 
Slide 22 shows the continually improving repeat rates from consumers who tried our foods for the first time in March when the pandemic really started to accelerate in the U.S. The improved repeat rates are broad-based across many of our iconic brands. Importantly, when we attract new triers to our brands, they are coming back to purchase again more often than they did a year ago. It's worth noting that this trend holds true for the big 3 Pinnacle brands, validating our work over the last 12 months. 
As Slide 24 shows, we're not just seeing an increase in repeat buyers, but we're seeing an increase in the frequency at which they return. Customers are not just coming back for more, they're coming back time and time again. In addition to the strength of our trial and repeat results on an absolute basis, we are outperforming our peers in terms of new trial. Let's take frozen as an example. Slide 25 demonstrates how our Banquet, Healthy Choice and Marie Callender's brands are leading frozen single-serve peers in new buyer acquisition. 
And as Slide 26 shows, these new frozen buyers are disproportionately coming from the millennial and Gen X market segments, similar to what we see in total Conagra trends. And like the total Conagra trends we discussed, not only are we attracting new buyers, but we're seeing higher repeat rates in our frozen segment than our peers. 
Similarly, despite the supply constraints we faced that I noted earlier, Birds Eye continue to lead its category in terms of both new consumers and repeat purchases compared to peers during the quarter. All of these trends have important implications for our value creation opportunity as we look ahead. We believe the dynamic environment in which we find ourselves provides a unique window of opportunity to maintain the current momentum such that we maximize our long-term value-creation potential. Make that possible, we need to make investments focused on doing everything in our power to ensure the physical availability of our products. Instead of choosing to simply accept the elevated demand as transitory and focus on maximizing near-term margins, we have chosen to bolster the long-term earnings potential of our company. We plan to accomplish this through investing in the key areas you see on this slide, which include increasing capacity, both internal and external; innovation; inventory; e-commerce; and safety. By investing behind today's elevated trial rates, we will build relationships with new consumers and maximize consumer conversion. The lifetime value of these consumers easily justifies these actions. 
Slide 31 shows some highlights of our fiscal '21 innovation slate. Some of these items, again, launching in Q4, and we will continue to roll out these new products throughout the year. Overall, we are confident that the investments we are making will produce strong ROIs. They will also maximize our long-term value creation and, ultimately, shareholder value. 
Turning to our guidance on Slide 32. We know that you would like as much information about our expectations for the year as possible. Given the very dynamic nature of the external environment, forecasting the full year right now is more difficult than normal. As of today, therefore, we're providing Q1 guidance. We hope that when we report Q1 results, we will be in a position to give you a further update on our outlook. While we don't expect the next few months to drive as much change as the past few, we expect to know a lot more by then. 
Dave is going to go into more depth regarding the guidance, so I'll just hit the highlights here. 
During the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we expect to deliver organic net sales growth of 10% to 13%, adjusted operating margin of 17% to 17.5%, adjusted EPS of $0.54 to $0.59. As I said earlier, we remain on track to reach our fiscal 2022 targets outlined on this slide as well as our deleveraging ratio. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Dave."

I hope you and your families are continuing to stay healthy and safe. 
I'll kick off this portion of the call by pointing out a few highlights for the quarter and the full fiscal year, which are captured on Slide 34. 
Overall, we're very pleased with our performance for Q4 and the fiscal year. As Sean discussed earlier, in the fourth quarter, the COVID-19 pandemic led to unprecedented demand in our retail businesses, which more than offset the softer Foodservice demand. This increased retail demand, combined with our strong execution, enabled us to exceed the most recent full year fiscal '20 guidance for total company sales, profit and free cash flow metrics. The key takeaways for Q4 and fiscal '20 are: Organic net sales increased 21.5% in the fourth quarter and 5.6% for the full year. Adjusted operating margin increased almost 400 basis points for the fourth quarter and over 100 basis points for the full year. Adjusted EPS more than doubled in the fourth quarter and grew 13% for the full year. And adjusted EBITDA increased 21.6% for the full year to just under $2.3 billion, helping to reduce the leverage ratio to 4.0x at the end of fiscal '20. 
Let's start with the net sales bridge on Slide 35. As you can see, our 21.5% organic net sales growth in the fourth quarter was driven by 21% volume growth with price/mix contributing 0.5 percentage point. Divestitures were a 310 basis point headwind in the quarter. This headwind will diminish sequentially as we continue to anniversary the divestiture closing dates going forward. Foreign exchange was a 70 basis point headwind in the quarter, with the weakening of the Mexican peso, representing about 2/3 of the headwind. This was a bit higher than we were expecting for Q4. 
Finally, the 53rd week added 810 basis points to the quarter, which was more of a net sales tailwind than we expected due to the elevated COVID-related demand at the end of the quarter, taking total reported net sales growth to plus 25.8% for Q4 versus a year ago. 
Turning to Slide 36, you see our sales summary by segment. In the fourth quarter and the fiscal year, we saw strong growth across our 3 retail-focused businesses. 
Our Grocery & Snacks segment reported very strong organic net sales growth of 40.4%. The grocery business proved to be a significant asset as consumers reengaged with convenient, shelf-stable products to facilitate and enhance the at-home eating experience. 
The Refrigerated & Frozen segment continued to perform very well in the quarter. The segment reported organic net sales growth in each quarter of this fiscal year and has now had positive organic net sales growth in 11 of the last 12 fiscal quarters. This consistency shows that our modernization efforts have been working and are sustainable. 
The International segment's 19.8% organic net sales growth was due to strong growth in Canada and better-than-expected growth in the Mexican and export businesses due to the pandemic. 
Foodservice reported an organic net sales decline of 31.5%, which was better than expected as many restaurants continue to serve customer -- consumers with curbside pickup, drive-through or partial capacity. 
Slide 37 outlines the progress we've made on our Q4 adjusted operating margin versus the prior year. Throughout the quarter, our gross margin expansion levers such as realized productivity, pricing, mix and COGS synergies continued to be effective. We also benefited from value-driven operating leverage in the quarter, approximating 100 basis points. These tailwinds were partially offset by increased COVID-related costs, dilution from significant Foodservice operating margin declines and a 170 basis point headwind from inflation, resulting in a net gross margin improvement of approximately 110 basis points. 
Given the already increased demand for food at home, we chose to pull back a bit on A&P in the quarter. That, coupled with increased net sales, drove a 100 basis point improvement to operating margin. While adjusted SG&A expense increased 5.7% in Q4 versus a year ago, net sales grew much faster, resulting in a 180 basis point tailwind to operating margin. 
Turning to Slide 38. You can see that our adjusted operating profit was $562 million in the quarter, an increase of 63.5%. Adjusted operating margin increased just below 400 basis points to 17.1%. This chart clearly summarizes the outstanding operating margin improvement during Q4 in our domestic retail and International segments. This was partially offset by our Foodservice segment, which has significantly lower operating profit due to the 32% organic net sales decline, unfavorable fixed cost leverage on net sales decline, higher inventory write-offs and higher input costs. 
Turning to Slide 29. We've summarized the various drivers of adjusted diluted EPS in Q4 versus a year ago. As you can see, our adjusted EPS increased $0.39 in the quarter, representing growth of over 100% from the same quarter last year. While the increase in EPS is primarily driven by the increase in operating profit associated with the net sales and margin increases, we also had higher income from Ardent Mills as COVID-related demand was a net benefit. We also estimate a $0.05 per share benefit from the 53rd week. 
Slide 40 summarizes the excellent progress we've made on our overall synergy capture from the acquisition of Pinnacle Foods in fiscal year '19. We realized $39 million of incremental synergies during the fourth quarter, bringing our total cumulative synergy capture since the close of the Pinnacle acquisition through the end of fiscal '20 to $184 million, exceeding our fiscal '20 goal of $180 million. Importantly, we remain on track to deliver our total synergy target of $305 million by the end of fiscal '22. As a reminder, we have reinvested $20 million from our synergy realization to date into longer-term business opportunities, such as product and packaging improvements and innovation-related retailer investments. 
As I stated on our last earnings call, we expected stronger cash flows in Q4 due to the normal seasonality of our business and the expected increase in retail demand from COVID-19. As a result, we updated our free cash flow expectations to be north of $950 million for fiscal '20. Fiscal '20 ended with the company generating approximately $1.47 billion of free cash flow, which was well above those revised expectations. Some of this benefit was timing related. Due to the significant increase in sales, we reduced our days of inventory on hand during the quarter, which positively impacted Q4 free cash flow. We expect to build that inventory back as we progress through fiscal '21, which will be a headwind to free cash flow. It is not yet clear as to the exact timing of the fiscal '21 inventory rebuild. 
Another timing item in Q4 was from federal tax payment deferrals, pushing payments from Q4 into Q1 of fiscal '21. We estimate the combined impact of these timing items on free cash flow between fiscal '20 and fiscal '21 to approximate $350 million. 
Turning to Slide 42. From the close of the Pinnacle acquisition in Q2 fiscal '19 through the end of the fourth quarter in fiscal '20, we've reduced net debt by nearly $2 billion. In the fourth quarter, we reduced gross debt by $271 million and net debt by $725 million, improving our leverage ratio to 4.0x at the end of Q4, down from 4.8x at the end of Q3. 
What's not shown on this slide but is important to note is that we improved the funded status of our pension plans during fiscal '20 by $80 million, with the total underfunded status declining to approximately $50 million. For context, the pension plan's underfunded status were approximately $565 million at the end of fiscal '17, a reduction of over $500 million. This significant improvement was driven by planned pension contributions, lump sum payments to participants and actual returns on plan assets exceeding expectations. 
In addition to the significant progress we made towards deleveraging in fiscal '20, we also further strengthened our liquidity position. We obtained a $600 million 3-year senior unsecured term loan, which remains undrawn. This facility provides us with additional flexibility to repay debt maturity through fiscal '21 and positions us to refinance current fiscal '21 debt maturities at attractive rates with prepayable debt. As a reminder, we also have a $1.6 billion undrawn revolving credit facility. Given where we finished fiscal '20 from a net debt perspective and given the continued momentum we expect in Q1 as outlined in our guidance, we are confident in our ability to achieve our targeted net debt to trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio of 3.5 to 3.6x by the end of fiscal '21. And importantly, we continue to remain committed to a solid investment-grade credit rating. In addition, we continue to remain open to smart divestitures that can help sculpt top line performance and generate cash flow to accelerate deleveraging. While we continue to evaluate portfolio actions, we will not pursue any divestitures that are not value-creating for the long term. 
As we approach our targeted leverage ratio, we continue to evaluate opportunities to use capital allocation to drive shareholder value. 
Slide 44 outlines our guidance for the first quarter of fiscal '21 and our fiscal year '22 algorithm. We are expecting the elevated retail demand to continue into Q1 although at a lower rate than Q4, leading us to our Q1 organic net sales expectation of plus 10% to plus 13%. We continue to expect the favorable operating leverage from the elevated volumes in Q1 to offset the additional COVID-related costs. Therefore, we expect adjusted operating margin to be in the range of 17% to 17.5%. These operating margin increases, coupled with expected improvement in our below-the-line items, lead to an expected EPS range for the first quarter of fiscal '21 of $0.54 to $0.59. As I already mentioned, we remain confident in our ability to hit our leverage ratio target of 3.5x to 3.6x by the end of fiscal '21. And lastly, we are today reaffirming our fiscal year '22 algorithm, which is outlined on this slide and in the earnings release. 
Thank you, everyone. That concludes my comments. I'll now pass it back to Sean."

Specifically, while I understand certainly the rationale for perhaps not yet providing full fiscal year '21 guidance, the fact that you're comfortable reiterating fiscal '22 EPS means, at least to me, that there should be some good progress in '21 versus '20 to be able to achieve '22 guidance in a reasonable way, where, I guess, not all of the EPS growth needs to come in '22 versus '21, if you see what I'm saying. So any perspective you can add around that, whether I'm thinking about that in the right way, even though I understand not providing specific guidance for this fiscal year."

But when you step back and you look at where we landed '20, if you look at the momentum of the business, the continued elevated demand, the new triers, the very strong repeat and synergies remaining on track, our view is that it would be hard to argue that we're not on a path to the '22 targets. And the real question for us is, kind of, you think about our prepared remarks today on trial and repeat is whether these dynamics that we're seeing currently offer incremental long-term upside beyond our '22 algorithm. Obviously, we're not going to comment on a longer-term algorithm. But certainly, these are positive markers, and we have elected to invest behind that option, for lack of a better phrase."

But in light, I guess, of the metrics you've discussed, I mean, would it be your expectation that for some of your key categories, Conagra should see an elevated rate of growth versus, let's say, pre-COVID for a more prolonged period of time? The investments that you discussed on the call with respect to incremental capacity and such would seem to support that thought process. But again, I wanted to hear it from you and get some clarity."

Something is happening that is above and beyond what our normal marketing programs would do. COVID has introduced this dynamic where, as you saw on the slides earlier, consumers are legitimately rediscovering certain things in their house, whether it's their kitchens, their freezers, being together, and they like it. They're also discovering that some of the things that they thought existed actually have changed quite a bit. So for example, the quality of frozen food. And as you know, we've spent the last 5 years dramatically transforming our products. So you put both of those things together, and there is clearly an element of pleasant surprise that consumers have when it comes to cooking at home. And given the tremendous value proposition of cooking at home and that we are in a recessionary environment, it's entirely plausible that these dynamics persist for some time, especially with the news changing hourly on COVID and what's happening with positive cases. And we believe that once people try our products, the data supports that we stand a very good chance they'll come back again and again and again. So we are investing today in order to maximize long-term value creation potential of this portfolio and really seize any option that there is further upside beyond our current algorithm."

Just more broadly, retailers are, at some point, going to rebuild inventories, I would imagine, in all their categories. And if you think of in the last several years, the focus on on-time in full of the focus we've talked about recently with retailers putting more phasings against high velocities, retailers ate out of stocks. So that is not going to change. And at some point, I would imagine that inventory levels would revert to kind of historical norms. The question, of course, is when will that happen? Because the way that happens is 1 of 2 things or both have to happen, either demand has to slow or capacity has to increase. 
We've seen demand slow recently, but it's still at very, very high levels. You also heard me talk about how we are making investments to increase capacities, but there's an upper control limit to how we can do that. So for the foreseeable future, in the near term, we are running flat out. And much of what we make and leaves our plants is going straight through to the consumer. When that slows down and the inventory levels build back is one of the wildcards that's virtually impossible to predict. And while I've got you, since you raised ACT II, I want to link your question on ACT II back to Andrew's question, which is we'll end what we're seeing now persist. Well, interestingly, one of the things that you're seeing now and you're reading about now is movie studios are going to direct release at home on demand. And there are some questions around what's going to happen with movie theaters going forward. As that happens, people will be watching movies as a group at home at a level we probably have not seen before. We're already experiencing this. And the shift in our microwaveable popcorn business has been dramatic reflecting that new behavior. That could very well be a persistent thing, but it may depend in part on what the movie studios ultimately choose to do. But those are the kinds of things that seem to be logically tracking in our favor, but we need to see how long they persist."

Number one, our portfolio, as you know, has a very strong value segment to it. Brands like Banquet and other already offer extremely favorable value that is and historically have proven very resilient in a recessionary environment. The other piece of it, too, is that in many of the categories, you continue to see out of stocks because the throughput is flat out and demand still exceeds that production availability, and therefore, you only exacerbate that problem when you price promote in that type of a category. So I think it will be category-specific. 
I will point out, though, that in our Q4, we did honor most of our promotional commitments, and that's because those were long-standing commitments. We have a principle of not kind of backing out. But going forward, I would expect our average scan prices may move north a little bit near-term because we are likely to see less discounting price promotion activity. However, I wouldn't want you to take that as less retailer investment because it's more likely to be a shift in retailer investments, really the profile of the retailer spend than the absolute level. So less discounting, more brand building, more new habit creation. To give you a specific example, a good example would be creating loyalty on our frozen brands with millennials by making click and collect behaviors habitual by increasing our e-com spend with retailers. That's a positive constructive alternative in a supply-constrained environment to more of a price promotion approach."

On the first piece, if you go back to the beginning of this thing, Nik, what happened was we had this massive initial surge, right, with pantry stocking and the like. And that went a long way toward kind of depleting our inventories and really starting to deplete customer inventories. Since then, while we haven't been at the level of that initial surge, demand has been extremely high. So we've got categories where we've hit the ceiling where we're just flat out. We've got categories where we've made some early progress in starting to kind of catch up. But with another surge, that's just going to put more strain on it. So we are focused -- it's interesting because we are typically focused on optimizing demand. And now we're in this environment where we are really heavily focused on optimizing supply because we're really up against it. And that has been the case in the early days of our Q1. And even if you look at the scanner data, it's been pretty strong. And that's all previous news of these upticks. 
So we've got to monitor it. We're doing everything in our power to add additional capacity so that we can protect the upside to the best of our ability. But it's going to be strained near term, and we are investing to make sure that, that happens. Did you have anything else to add on that point, Dave?"

Because recall at CAGNY, we had talked about how some of our customer base had moved up their shelf resets in frozen, and I'm sure many of you are curious what happened with that with respect to COVID hitting. Well, you may be surprised to learn that the vast majority of our customers proceeded as planned in Q4 with their earlier frozen resets. And that's good news. We see our exciting fiscal '21 innovations on the shelf, and they look great. And we are hustling to try to keep them in stock because they're obviously getting good trial. 
And also, with respect to Q4 innovation in total, which includes the innovations we launched earlier in the year, the Q4 innovation was up over 25% versus the prior Q4. And it definitely had some benefit versus the prior Q4 of shipments of the following year's innovation coming a little bit earlier, and that's because of those frozen shelf resets that we talked about. But the reality is, despite what you've heard about SKU reduction to maximize throughput and things like that, we have continued to have strong favorable reaction from our retailers on our new innovation, and we continue to feel super strong about the slate we've got out there and expect it to perform well this year. As you've seen in the last few years, every year's innovation has outperformed the prior years for the last several years. And there's no reason to expect this year wouldn't continue, albeit we have a few more wildcards that we are dealing with than in previous years."

Sean, you got nice metrics here, but what I want to get your impression of is the you've made a comment repeatedly for years that your expectation is that frozen is going to be just a critical area of growth in the grocery store. When we just look at these 4Q results, obviously, heavily affected by COVID, right, the staples piece is growing much, much faster than frozen. There's that initial stock-up that's going on in there. What I was hoping you could do is just explain how you thought frozen would grow relative to that of staples on a go-forward basis. Should frozen be half as much as staples as we see almost in this graph? Or should frozen, on a relative basis, begin to be much stronger after we've kind of come through that first stock up that occurred in March, April?"

Whenever you see any kind of crisis hit, people will load their dry goods pantry, which has a tremendous amount of holding power. And actually, you tend to see more of a pantry load dynamic there because of the holding power of pantry relative to the holding power of a freezer. Most freezers are actually incredibly limited in space, and that's one of the governors that you see on frozen. Interestingly, one of the things we didn't put in the deck is the sales rate of stand-alone frozen freezers. If you had gone to a Home Depot or a Best Buy in the last few months in search of a freezer, you would not have been able to find one. So clearly, consumers are recognizing there's a limit to what they can fit in their freezer. I know in my household, we were frustrated because we get to -- you'd go to the store on a day as shipments came and you want to buy stuff, but you had nowhere to put it because your freezer was full. So that's a governor you have there versus staples. That said, while I might expect the 2 to converge more going forward, staples, what you see in the staples space is a super value proposition. So Chef Boyardee, and this may be more of a function of what is the consumer's household balance sheet look like going forward, how long does the recessionary environment persist, items like Chef are a tremendous value proposition in that kind of environment should continue to perform well. Furthermore, if people are learning to cook again and cooking from scratch, a lot of the staples products we have like PAM cooking spray or our beans business or our tomato business ought to remain elevated, and these are the kinds of things you can use in multiple recipes throughout the week that are different recipes as opposed to eating the same thing again and again. 
So I'm not going to try to forecast how these will perform relative to one another. The key point we wanted to make today is that all 3 of our consumer dip domains have been elevated and are enjoying this notion of rediscovery and discovery that I talked about."

So that is starting to work its way in quarter-by-quarter into our actual results. 
So as I look to Q1, because we gave specific margin guidance in Q1, a big part of the operating margin improvement versus the prior year is actually because of the leverage on SG&A. So the 17% to 17.5%, a good amount of that improvement is the SG&A leverage. Gross margin, there's a lot of puts and takes with all the different costs. So there'd be more moderate improvement there, but it's mostly SG&A. So we start seeing that leverage in a bigger way starting in Q1. And you'll continue to see leverage going forward.

On behalf of Conagra Brands, I want to start by expressing my heartfelt hope that you and your families are continuing to stay safe and healthy.",2321,"Thanks, Brian. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter fiscal 2020 earnings call. On behalf of Conagra Brands, I want to start by expressing my heartfelt hope that you and your families are continuing to stay safe and healthy.
On today's call, we're going to address our fourth quarter and fiscal 2020 results, our expectations for fiscal 2021 and our perspective on why Conagra is uniquely positioned to succeed in this new environment. But first, I want to provide some context around what has brought us to this point. Over the past 5 years, we have been purposefully architecting one of the largest transformations in the food industry. When we embarked on this process, we made major strategic decisions on where to compete and how to win. After decades as a food conglomerate, we transformed into a pure-play branded food company with a portfolio focused on competing in 3 domains: frozen, snacks and staples.
We committed to perpetually reshaping our portfolio for better growth and better margins and established a disciplined approach rooted in a playbook that we call the Conagra Way. This relentlessly principle-based playbook is filled with repeatable and scalable processes that focus on modernizing our iconic brands through superior food, contemporary packaging and strong consistent marketing investment. The Conagra Way is not just a way to build brands but an operating model that has helped cultivate our agile, motivated and highly energized culture. As I'll describe in more detail in a moment, fiscal 2020 saw unprecedented performance as we built upon the extraordinary progress we have made over the past 5 years. We further strengthened our business, including getting Legacy Pinnacle back on track and delivered strong financial results.
During the fourth quarter, in particular, our transformation was put to the test, and you are seeing the fruits of our labor. Our modernized portfolio and agile culture enabled us to respond to the increased consumer demand driven by COVID-19. At this point, the degree to which demand will return to historical norms is still uncertain, and the timing of the changes in consumer demand is also uncertain. However, we believe that demand will likely remain elevated in the near term given both consumer perceptions about returning to work and eating outside the home as well as the fact that consumers are discovering and rediscovering the pleasures, conveniences and tremendous value proposition of dining at home.
Dave will cover the financials in more detail, but I want to let you know that we continue to be on track to deliver our fiscal 2022 algorithm, and we remain committed to achieving our leverage target of 3.5x to 3.6x by the end of fiscal 2021.
As we'll detail today, we believe our portfolio is optimally positioned to succeed in the new normal. We are focused on making the right investments to ensure that we can continue to safely and reliably meet consumers' needs in fiscal '21 and the longer term.
In today's presentation, we will cover our business update, the behavioral shifts we have seen and how Conagra is well positioned to benefit from these shifts and what we expect going forward in terms of our near-term outlook and the opportunity to create long-term value.
Beginning with our business update. Before I get into the numbers, I would like to recognize that our extraordinary results have only been possible because of the thousands of hard-working Conagra team members on the frontlines across North America. Here at Conagra, we talk about infusing a refuse-to-lose attitude and never before have we seen our team make such extraordinary efforts. The team's commitment has enabled us to meet the elevated demand from our customers and the communities we serve and deliver the strong results that we are announcing today. I couldn't be more proud of all that they have accomplished. To all of our team members, thank you. Great job all around.
During the fourth quarter, we experienced significant growth across our core operating metrics, including 21.5% growth in organic net sales and a 108.3% growth in adjusted EPS. These results helped contribute to our rapid progress in reducing our leverage, and I'm proud to say that we ended the quarter with a net leverage ratio of 4.0x, down from 4.8x in the third quarter.
As you can see on Slide 9, our growth was not confined to one area but was driven by strong retail sales across our portfolio, spanning staples, frozen and snacks. Our strong growth in e-commerce continued to accelerate, both on an absolute basis and as a percentage of our overall sales. The work we've done over the past several years to improve our e-commerce capabilities has certainly paid off. As consumers increasingly adopt online grocery shopping, our share of e-commerce sales has steadily increased.
Slide 11 highlights that our disciplined approach to innovation is clearly working. Our absolute sales on new innovation introduced this year increased 43% compared to our innovation slate of fiscal 2019. As a reminder, we stated at our initial Investor Day that our goal was to have 15% of total sales coming from products launched within the past 3 years. Well, today, I'm proud to say that we're consistently performing above that level. In a few minutes, we'll provide you some of the new innovation that we have in store for fiscal 2021 as we seek to build upon this success.
As we've discussed previously, frozen is an increasingly important domain for consumers, especially in today's environment. For the fourth quarter, total Conagra frozen retail sales grew 26.2% over last year with strong growth across each frozen category, including single-serve meals, vegetables, multi-serve meals and plant-based meal alternatives.
And as Slide 13 shows, as we grew, we also gained share in the important Frozen Meals category during the quarter, continuing a trend we've seen for some time now. The Conagra Way playbook continues to pay off. And while the trends have remained strong, there's even more opportunity, particularly in frozen vegetables. Birds Eye faced some unique dynamics in the quarter. As I said earlier, the category remained extremely relevant for consumers. We continue to see robust demand for frozen vegetables, and our retail sales up 26.5% during the quarter. Importantly, Birds Eye hold the top position in category share and has 2x the share of the next branded player.
Given the incredible surge in demand we experienced during the fourth quarter and our #1 brand position, we hit a ceiling on capacity. Furthermore, we made the decision to temporarily close a plant during the quarter due to COVID-19, which further constrained capacity. The good news is the plant is safely back up and running flat out. In addition, we have made the strategic decision to bring on more external partners to fulfill demand and rebuild inventory. These investments in our supply chain will allow us to efficiently meet the elevated demand we are seeing today and expect to see going forward. This is an important example of that investment, and I will expand on this in a few minutes.
Turning to snacks. Recall that our snacks business overindexes to convenience stores, which saw softer traffic due to COVID-19 during our Q4. Also, the seeds category was impacted by the postponement and, in many areas of the country, cancellation of baseball and softball seasons. Baseball and seeds go hand in hand, and the loss of these opportunities had a negative impact on the category. Even despite these discrete headwinds, the snacks business delivered a terrific 20.1% year-over-year growth and a 26.4% growth on a 2-year basis.
And on Slide 16, you can see our performance in staples, a category that is more relevant than ever before. Our total staples business grew an incredible 46.3% for the quarter. The 6 brands to the right are our largest staples brands accounting for over 50% of our staples sales at retail pre-COVID, and each experienced considerable growth in the quarter. These businesses are proving to be a distinct benefit to our portfolio. But while we're pleased with our results for the quarter and the year, we are particularly excited about what the quarter has taught us about the opportunity that lies ahead as consumers have shifted their behaviors and eating habits.
Slide 18 shows some of the key ways in which we're seeing consumers' behavior shift in response to COVID-19. Many consumers are rediscovering the enjoyment associated with at-home eating, whether it's making fun baked goods, cooking with the family or enjoying a movie night with some snacks. Numerous consumers are also discovering new things about food during this time. Many are learning how to truly cook for the first time or discovering they can recreate restaurant favorites at home. We believe that many of these activities have staying power and are likely to persist even after a post-COVID world in whatever new normal we settle into. We also believe our broad and refreshed portfolio of innovative products is best suited to meet consumers' needs as they engage in these food behaviors.
And Slide 19 shows the strong growth during the quarter across our iconic brands, demonstrating how well suited our portfolio is to meet these behaviors.
Our ability to meet the changing consumer needs is balanced across our 3 domains. Slide 20 shows how household penetration grew during the quarter in staples, snacks and frozen.
And as we've been able to modernize and innovate our iconic brands, we are attracting younger consumers. Slide 21 shows that new consumers to our brands overindexed in the younger millennial and Gen X market segments.
Driving new trial is always a key focus for us. The investments that we've made over the past 5 years in updating our food with bold, on-trend flavors and modern food attributes were premised on the belief that if we can get people to try our food, they will come back for more. And that is exactly what's happening.
Slide 22 shows the continually improving repeat rates from consumers who tried our foods for the first time in March when the pandemic really started to accelerate in the U.S. The improved repeat rates are broad-based across many of our iconic brands. Importantly, when we attract new triers to our brands, they are coming back to purchase again more often than they did a year ago. It's worth noting that this trend holds true for the big 3 Pinnacle brands, validating our work over the last 12 months.
As Slide 24 shows, we're not just seeing an increase in repeat buyers, but we're seeing an increase in the frequency at which they return. Customers are not just coming back for more; they're coming back time and time again.
In addition to the strength of our trial and repeat results on an absolute basis, we are outperforming our peers in terms of new trial. Let's take frozen as an example. Slide 25 demonstrates how our Banquet, Healthy Choice and Marie Callender's brands are leading frozen single-serve peers in new buyer acquisition.
And as Slide 26 shows, these new frozen buyers are disproportionately coming from the millennial and Gen X market segments, similar to what we see in total Conagra trends. And like the total Conagra trends we discussed, not only are we attracting new buyers, but we're seeing higher repeat rates in our frozen segment than our peers.
Similarly, despite the supply constraints we faced that I noted earlier, Birds Eye continued to lead its category in terms of both new consumers and repeat purchases compared to peers during the quarter. All of these trends have important implications for our value creation opportunity as we look ahead. We believe the dynamic environment in which we find ourselves provides a unique window of opportunity to maintain the current momentum such that we maximize our long-term value-creation potential. Make that possible, we need to make investments focused on doing everything in our power to ensure the physical availability of our products.
Instead of choosing to simply accept the elevated demand as transitory and focus on maximizing near-term margins, we have chosen to bolster the long-term earnings potential of our company. We plan to accomplish this through investing in the key areas you see on this slide, which include increasing capacity, both internal and external; innovation; inventory; e-commerce; and safety. By investing behind today's elevated trial rates, we will build relationships with new consumers and maximize consumer conversion. The lifetime value of these consumers easily justifies these actions.
Slide 31 shows some highlights of our fiscal '21 innovation slate. Some of these items began launching in Q4, and we will continue to roll out these new products throughout the year. Overall, we are confident that the investments we are making will produce strong ROIs. They will also maximize our long-term value creation and, ultimately, shareholder value.
Turning to our guidance on Slide 32. We know that you would like as much information about our expectations for the year as possible. Given the very dynamic nature of the external environment, forecasting the full year right now is more difficult than normal. As of today, therefore, we're providing Q1 guidance. We hope that when we report Q1 results, we will be in a position to give you a further update on our outlook. While we don't expect the next few months to drive as much change as the past few, we expect to know a lot more by then.
Dave is going to go into more depth regarding the guidance, so I'll just hit the highlights here. During the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we expect to deliver organic net sales growth of 10% to 13%, adjusted operating margin of 17% to 17.5%, adjusted EPS of $0.54 to $0.59. As I said earlier, we remain on track to reach our fiscal 2022 targets outlined on this slide as well as our deleveraging ratio.
With that, I'll turn it over to Dave."

Before I discuss the details of the quarter, I want to take a moment to wish you all well. I hope you and your families are continuing to stay healthy and safe.
I'll kick off this portion of the call by pointing out a few highlights for the quarter and the full fiscal year, which are captured on Slide 34. Overall, we're very pleased with our performance for Q4 and the fiscal year. As Sean discussed earlier, in the fourth quarter, the COVID-19 pandemic led to unprecedented demand in our retail businesses, which more than offset the softer Foodservice demand. This increased retail demand, combined with our strong execution, enabled us to exceed the most recent full year fiscal '20 guidance for total company sales, profit and free cash flow metrics. The key takeaways for Q4 and fiscal '20 are: organic net sales increased 21.5% in the fourth quarter and 5.6% for the full year. Adjusted operating margin increased almost 400 basis points for the fourth quarter and over 100 basis points for the full year. Adjusted EPS more than doubled in the fourth quarter and grew 13% for the full year. And adjusted EBITDA increased 21.6% for the full year to just under $2.3 billion, helping to reduce the leverage ratio to 4.0x at the end of fiscal '20.
Let's start with the net sales bridge on Slide 35. As you can see, our 21.5% organic net sales growth in the fourth quarter was driven by 21% volume growth with price/mix contributing 0.5 percentage point. Divestitures were a 310-basis-point headwind in the quarter. This headwind will diminish sequentially as we continue to anniversary the divestiture closing dates going forward. Foreign exchange was a 70-basis-point headwind in the quarter with the weakening of the Mexican peso representing about 2/3 of the headwind. This was a bit higher than we were expecting for Q4.
Finally, the 53rd week added 810 basis points to the quarter, which was more of a net sales tailwind than we expected due to the elevated COVID-related demand at the end of the quarter, taking total reported net sales growth to plus 25.8% for Q4 versus a year ago.
Turning to Slide 36, you see our sales summary by segment. In the fourth quarter and the fiscal year, we saw strong growth across our 3 retail-focused businesses.
Our Grocery & Snacks segment reported very strong organic net sales growth of 40.4%. The grocery business proved to be a significant asset as consumers reengaged with convenient, shelf-stable products to facilitate and enhance the at-home eating experience.
The Refrigerated & Frozen segment continued to perform very well in the quarter. The segment reported organic net sales growth in each quarter of this fiscal year and has now had positive organic net sales growth in 11 of the last 12 fiscal quarters. This consistency shows that our modernization efforts have been working and are sustainable.
The International segment's 19.8% organic net sales growth was due to strong growth in Canada and better-than-expected growth in the Mexican and export businesses due to the pandemic.
Foodservice reported an organic net sales decline of 31.5%, which was better than expected as many restaurants continue to serve customer -- consumers with curbside pickup, drive-through for partial capacity.
Slide 37 outlines the progress we've made on our Q4 adjusted operating margin versus the prior year. Throughout the quarter, our gross margin expansion levers such as realized productivity, pricing, mix and COGS synergies continued to be effective. We also benefited from value-driven operating leverage in the quarter, approximating 100 basis points. These tailwinds were partially offset by increased COVID-related costs, dilution from significant Foodservice operating margin declines and a 170-basis-point headwind from inflation, resulting in a net gross margin improvement of approximately 110 basis points.
Given the already increased demand for food at home, we chose to pull back a bit on A&P in the quarter. That, coupled with increased net sales, drove a 100-basis-point improvement to operating margin. While adjusted SG&A expense increased 5.7% in Q4 versus a year ago, net sales grew much faster, resulting in a 180-basis-point tailwind to operating margin.
Turning to Slide 38. You can see that our adjusted operating profit was $562 million in the quarter, an increase of 63.5%. Adjusted operating margin increased just below 400 basis points to 17.1%. This chart clearly summarizes the outstanding operating margin improvement during Q4 in our domestic retail and International segments. This was partially offset by our Foodservice segment, which had significantly lower operating profit due to the 32% organic net sales decline, unfavorable fixed cost leverage on net sales decline, higher inventory write-offs and higher input costs.
Turning to Slide 39. We've summarized the various drivers of adjusted diluted EPS in Q4 versus a year ago. As you can see, our adjusted EPS increased $0.39 in the quarter, representing growth of over 100% from the same quarter last year. While the increase in EPS is primarily driven by the increase in operating profit associated with the net sales and margin increases, we also had higher income from Ardent Mills as COVID-related demand was a net benefit. We also estimate a $0.05 per share benefit from the 53rd week.
Slide 40 summarizes the excellent progress we've made on our overall synergy capture from the acquisition of Pinnacle Foods in fiscal year '19. We realized $39 million of incremental synergies during the fourth quarter, bringing our total cumulative synergy capture since the close of the Pinnacle acquisition through the end of fiscal '20 to $184 million, exceeding our fiscal '20 goal of $180 million. Importantly, we remain on track to deliver our total synergy target of $305 million by the end of fiscal '22. As a reminder, we have reinvested $20 million from our synergy realization to date into longer-term business opportunities, such as product and packaging improvements and innovation-related retailer investments.
As I stated on our last earnings call, we expected stronger cash flows in Q4 due to the normal seasonality of our business and the expected increase in retail demand from COVID-19. As a result, we updated our free cash flow expectations to be north of $950 million for fiscal '20. Fiscal '20 ended with the company generating approximately $1.47 billion of free cash flow, which was well above those revised expectations. Some of this benefit was timing-related. Due to the significant increase in sales, we reduced our days of inventory on hand during the quarter, which positively impacted Q4 free cash flow. We expect to build that inventory back as we progress through fiscal '21, which will be a headwind to free cash flow. It is not yet clear as to the exact timing of the fiscal '21 inventory rebuild.
Another timing item in Q4 was from federal tax payment deferrals, pushing payments from Q4 into Q1 of fiscal '21. We estimate the combined impact of these timing items on free cash flow between fiscal '20 and fiscal '21 to approximate $350 million.
Turning to Slide 42. From the close of the Pinnacle acquisition in Q2 fiscal '19 through the end of the fourth quarter in fiscal '20, we've reduced net debt by nearly $2 billion. In the fourth quarter, we reduced gross debt by $271 million and net debt by $725 million, improving our leverage ratio to 4.0x at the end of Q4, down from 4.8x at the end of Q3.
What's not shown on this slide but is important to note is that we improved the funded status of our pension plans during fiscal '20 by $80 million with the total underfunded status declining to approximately $50 million. For context, the pension plan's underfunded status were approximately $565 million at the end of fiscal '17, a reduction of over $500 million. This significant improvement was driven by planned pension contributions, lump sum payments to participants and actual returns on planned assets exceeding expectations.
In addition to the significant progress we made towards deleveraging in fiscal '20, we also further strengthened our liquidity position. We obtained a $600 million, 3-year senior unsecured term loan, which remains undrawn. This facility provides us with additional flexibility to repay debt maturity through fiscal '21 and positions us to refinance current fiscal '21 debt maturities at attractive rates with prepayable debt. As a reminder, we also have a $1.6 billion undrawn revolving credit facility.
Given where we finished fiscal '20 from a net debt perspective and given the continued momentum we expect in Q1 as outlined in our guidance, we are confident in our ability to achieve our targeted net debt to trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio of 3.5 to 3.6x by the end of fiscal '21. And importantly, we continue to remain committed to a solid investment-grade credit rating. In addition, we continue to remain open to smart divestitures that can help sculpt top line performance and generate cash flow to accelerate deleveraging. While we continue to evaluate portfolio actions, we will not pursue any divestitures that are not value-creating for the long term.
As we approach our targeted leverage ratio, we continue to evaluate opportunities to use capital allocation to drive shareholder value. Slide 44 outlines our guidance for the first quarter of fiscal '21 and our fiscal year '22 algorithm. We are expecting the elevated retail demand to continue into Q1 although at a lower rate than Q4, leading us to our Q1 organic net sales expectation of plus 10% to plus 13%. We continue to expect the favorable operating leverage from the elevated volumes in Q1 to offset the additional COVID-related costs. Therefore, we expect adjusted operating margin to be in the range of 17% to 17.5%. These operating margin increases, coupled with expected improvement in our below-the-line items, lead to an expected EPS range for the first quarter of fiscal '21 of $0.54 to $0.59. As I already mentioned, we remain confident in our ability to hit our leverage ratio target of 3.5 to 3.6x by the end of fiscal '21. And lastly, we are today reaffirming our fiscal year '22 algorithm, which is outlined on this slide and in the earnings release.
Thank you, everyone. That concludes my comments. I'll now pass it back to Sean."

And the real question for us is kind of you think about our prepared remarks today on trial and repeat is whether these dynamics that we're seeing currently offer incremental long-term upside beyond our '22 algorithm. Obviously, we're not going to comment on a longer-term algorithm. But certainly, these are positive markers, and we have elected to invest behind that option, for lack of a better phrase."

The investments that you discussed on the call with respect to incremental capacity and such would seem to support that thought process. But again, I wanted to hear it from you and get some clarity."

Something is happening that is above and beyond what our normal marketing programs would do. COVID has introduced this dynamic where, as you saw on the slides earlier, consumers are legitimately rediscovering certain things in their house, whether it's their kitchens, their freezers, being together, and they like it. They're also discovering that some of the things that they thought existed actually have changed quite a bit. So for example, the quality of frozen food. And as you know, we've spent the last 5 years dramatically transforming our products. So you put both of those things together, and there is clearly an element of pleasant surprise that consumers have when it comes to cooking at home.
And given the tremendous value proposition of cooking at home and that we are in a recessionary environment, it's entirely plausible that these dynamics persist for some time, especially with the news changing hourly on COVID and what's happening with positive cases. And we believe that once people try our products, the data supports that we stand a very good chance that they'll come back again and again and again. So we are investing today in order to maximize long-term value creation potential of this portfolio and really seize any option that there is further upside beyond our current algorithm."

Just more broadly, retailers are, at some point, going to rebuild inventories, I would imagine, in all their categories. And if you think of in the last several years, the focus on on-time in full of the focus we've talked about recently with retailers putting more phasings against high velocities, retailers paid out of stocks. So that is not going to change. And at some point, I would imagine that inventory levels would revert to kind of historical norms. The question, of course, is when will that happen? Because the way that happens is 1 of 2 things or both have to happen, either demand has to slow or capacity has to increase.
We've seen demand slow recently, but it's still at very, very high levels. You also heard me talk about how we are making investments to increase capacities, but there's an upper control limit to how we can do that. So for the foreseeable future, in the near term, we are running flat out. And much of what we make and leaves our plants is going straight through to the consumer. When that slows down and the inventory levels build back is one of the wildcards that's virtually impossible to predict.
And while I've got you, since you raised ACT II, I want to link your question on ACT II back to Andrew's question, which is will any of what we're seeing now persist. Well, interestingly, one of the things that you're seeing now and you're reading about now is movie studios are going to direct release at home on demand. And there are some questions around what's going to happen with movie theaters going forward. As that happens, people will be watching movies as a group at home at a level we probably have not seen before. We're already experiencing this. And the shift in our microwaveable popcorn business has been dramatic, reflecting that new behavior. That could very well be a persistent thing, but it may depend in part on what the movie studios ultimately choose to do. But those are the kinds of things that seem to be logically tracking in our favor, but we need to see how long they persist."

Number one, our portfolio, as you know, has a very strong value segment to it. Brands like Banquet and other already offer extremely favorable value that is and historically have proven very resilient in a recessionary environment. The other piece of it, too, is that in many of the categories, you continue to see out of stocks because the throughput is flat out, and demand still exceeds that production availability, and therefore, you only exacerbate that problem when you price promote in that type of a category. So I think it will be category-specific.
I will point out, though, that in our Q4, we did honor most of our promotional commitments, and that's because those were long-standing commitments. We have a principle of not kind of backing out. But going forward, I would expect our average scan prices may move north a little bit near term because we are likely to see less discounting price promotion activity. However, I wouldn't want you to take that as less retailer investment because it's more likely to be a shift in retailer investments, really the profile of the retailer spend than the absolute level. So less discounting, more brand building, more new habit creation.
To give you a specific example, a good example would be creating loyalty on our frozen brands with millennials by making click and collect behaviors habitual by increasing our e-com spend with retailers. That's a positive constructive alternative in a supply-constrained environment to more of a price promotion approach."

On the first piece, if you go back to the beginning of this thing, Nik, what happened was we had this massive initial surge, right, with pantry stocking and the like. And that went a long way toward kind of depleting our inventories and really starting to deplete customer inventories. Since then, while we haven't been at the level of that initial surge, demand has been extremely high. So we've got categories where we've hit the ceiling where we're just flat out. We've got categories where we've made some early progress and starting to kind of catch up. But with another surge, that's just going to put more strain on it. So we are focused -- it's interesting because we are typically focused on optimizing demand. And now we're in this environment where we are really heavily focused on optimizing supply because we're really up against it. And that has been the case in the early days of our Q1. And even if you look at the scanner data, it's been pretty strong. And that's all previous news of these upticks.
So we've got to monitor it. We're doing everything in our power to add additional capacity, so that we can protect the upside to the best of our ability. But it's going to be strained near term, and we are investing to make sure that, that happens.

Because recall at CAGNY, we had talked about how some of our customer base had moved up their shelf resets in frozen, and I'm sure many of you are curious what happened with that with respect to COVID hitting. Well, you may be surprised to learn that the vast majority of our customers proceeded as planned in Q4 with their earlier frozen resets. And that's good news. We see our exciting fiscal '21 innovations on the shelf, and they look great. And we are hustling to try to keep them in stock because they're obviously getting good trial.
And also, with respect to Q4 innovation in total, which includes the innovations we launched earlier in the year, the Q4 innovation was up over 25% versus the prior Q4. And it definitely had some benefit versus the prior Q4 of shipments of the following year's innovation coming a little bit earlier, and that's because of those frozen shelf resets that we talked about. But the reality is, despite what you've heard about SKU reduction to maximize throughput and things like that, we have continued to have strong favorable reaction from our retailers on our new innovation, and we continue to feel super strong about the slate we've got out there and expect it to perform well this year.

Whenever you see any kind of crisis hit, people will load their dry goods pantry, which has a tremendous amount of holding power. And actually, you tend to see more of a pantry load dynamic there because of the holding power of pantry relative to the holding power of a freezer. Most freezers are actually incredibly limited in space, and that's one of the governors that you see on frozen. Interestingly, one of the things we didn't put in the deck is the sales rate of stand-alone frozen freezers. If you had gone to a Home Depot or a Best Buy in the last few months in search of a freezer, you would not have been able to find one. So clearly, consumers are recognizing there's a limit to what they can fit in their freezer. I know in my household, we were frustrated because we get to -- you'd go to the store on a day as shipments came and you want to buy stuff, but you had nowhere to put it because your freezer was full. So that's a governor you have there versus staples.
That said, while I might expect the 2 to converge more going forward, staples, what you see in the staples space is a super value proposition. So Chef Boyardee, and this may be more of a function of what is the consumer's household balance sheet look like going forward, how long does the recessionary environment persist, items like Chef are a tremendous value proposition, and that kind of environment should continue to perform well. Furthermore, if people are learning to cook again and cooking from scratch, a lot of the staples products we have like PAM cooking spray or our beans business or our tomato business ought to remain elevated, and these are the kinds of things you can use in multiple recipes throughout the week that are different recipes as opposed to eating the same thing again and again.
So I'm not going to try to forecast how these will perform relative to one another. The key point we wanted to make today is that all 3 of our consumer domains have been elevated and are enjoying this notion of rediscovery and discovery that I talked about."

So as I look to Q1, because we gave specific margin guidance in Q1, a big part of the operating margin improvement versus the prior year is actually because of the leverage on SG&A. So the 17% to 17.5%, a good amount of that improvement is the SG&A leverage. Gross margin, there's a lot of puts and takes with all the different costs. So there'd be more moderate improvement there, but it's mostly SG&A. So we start seeing that leverage in a bigger way starting in Q1. And you'll continue to see leverage going forward.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter fiscal 2020 earnings call. On behalf of Conagra Brands, I want to start by expressing my heartfelt hope that you and your families are continuing to stay safe and healthy.
On today's call, we're going to address our fourth quarter and fiscal 2020 results, our expectations for fiscal 2021 and our perspective on why Conagra is uniquely positioned to succeed in this new environment. But first, I want to provide some context around what has brought us to this point. Over the past 5 years, we have been purposefully architecting one of the largest transformations in the food industry. When we embarked on this process, we made major strategic decisions on where to compete and how to win. After decades as a food conglomerate, we transformed into a pure-play branded food company with a portfolio focused on competing in 3 domains: frozen, snacks and staples.
We committed to perpetually reshaping our portfolio for better growth and better margins and established a disciplined approach rooted in a playbook that we call the Conagra Way. This relentlessly principle-based playbook is filled with repeatable and scalable processes that focus on modernizing our iconic brands through superior food, contemporary packaging and strong consistent marketing investment. The Conagra Way is not just a way to build brands but an operating model that has helped cultivate our agile, motivated and highly energized culture. As I'll describe in more detail in a moment, fiscal 2020 saw unprecedented performance as we built upon the extraordinary progress we have made over the past 5 years. We further strengthened our business, including getting Legacy Pinnacle back on track and delivered strong financial results.
During the fourth quarter, in particular, our transformation was put to the test, and you are seeing the fruits of our labor. Our modernized portfolio and agile culture enabled us to respond to the increased consumer demand driven by COVID-19. At this point, the degree to which demand will return to historical norms is still uncertain, and the timing of the changes in consumer demand is also uncertain. However, we believe that demand will likely remain elevated in the near term given both consumer perceptions about returning to work and eating outside the home as well as the fact that consumers are discovering and rediscovering the pleasures, conveniences and tremendous value proposition of dining at home.
Dave will cover the financials in more detail, but I want to let you know that we continue to be on track to deliver our fiscal 2022 algorithm, and we remain committed to achieving our leverage target of 3.5x to 3.6x by the end of fiscal 2021.
As we'll detail today, we believe our portfolio is optimally positioned to succeed in the new normal. We are focused on making the right investments to ensure that we can continue to safely and reliably meet consumers' needs in fiscal '21 and the longer term.
In today's presentation, we will cover our business update, the behavioral shifts we have seen and how Conagra is well positioned to benefit from these shifts and what we expect going forward in terms of our near-term outlook and the opportunity to create long-term value.
Beginning with our business update. Before I get into the numbers, I would like to recognize that our extraordinary results have only been possible because of the thousands of hard-working Conagra team members on the frontlines across North America. Here at Conagra, we talk about infusing a refuse-to-lose attitude and never before have we seen our team make such extraordinary efforts. The team's commitment has enabled us to meet the elevated demand from our customers and the communities we serve and deliver the strong results that we are announcing today. I couldn't be more proud of all that they have accomplished. To all of our team members, thank you. Great job all around.
During the fourth quarter, we experienced significant growth across our core operating metrics, including 21.5% growth in organic net sales and a 108.3% growth in adjusted EPS. These results helped contribute to our rapid progress in reducing our leverage, and I'm proud to say that we ended the quarter with a net leverage ratio of 4.0x, down from 4.8x in the third quarter.
As you can see on Slide 9, our growth was not confined to one area but was driven by strong retail sales across our portfolio, spanning staples, frozen and snacks. Our strong growth in e-commerce continued to accelerate, both on an absolute basis and as a percentage of our overall sales. The work we've done over the past several years to improve our e-commerce capabilities has certainly paid off. As consumers increasingly adopt online grocery shopping, our share of e-commerce sales has steadily increased.
Slide 11 highlights that our disciplined approach to innovation is clearly working. Our absolute sales on new innovation introduced this year increased 43% compared to our innovation slate of fiscal 2019. As a reminder, we stated at our initial Investor Day that our goal was to have 15% of total sales coming from products launched within the past 3 years. Well, today, I'm proud to say that we're consistently performing above that level. In a few minutes, we'll provide you some of the new innovation that we have in store for fiscal 2021 as we seek to build upon this success.
As we've discussed previously, frozen is an increasingly important domain for consumers, especially in today's environment. For the fourth quarter, total Conagra frozen retail sales grew 26.2% over last year with strong growth across each frozen category, including single-serve meals, vegetables, multi-serve meals and plant-based meal alternatives.
And as Slide 13 shows, as we grew, we also gained share in the important Frozen Meals category during the quarter, continuing a trend we've seen for some time now. The Conagra Way playbook continues to pay off. And while the trends have remained strong, there's even more opportunity, particularly in frozen vegetables. Birds Eye faced some unique dynamics in the quarter. As I said earlier, the category remained extremely relevant for consumers. We continue to see robust demand for frozen vegetables, and our retail sales up 26.5% during the quarter. Importantly, Birds Eye hold the top position in category share and has 2x the share of the next branded player.
Given the incredible surge in demand we experienced during the fourth quarter and our #1 brand position, we hit a ceiling on capacity. Furthermore, we made the decision to temporarily close a plant during the quarter due to COVID-19, which further constrained capacity. The good news is the plant is safely back up and running flat out. In addition, we have made the strategic decision to bring on more external partners to fulfill demand and rebuild inventory. These investments in our supply chain will allow us to efficiently meet the elevated demand we are seeing today and expect to see going forward. This is an important example of that investment, and I will expand on this in a few minutes.
Turning to snacks. Recall that our snacks business overindexes to convenience stores, which saw softer traffic due to COVID-19 during our Q4. Also, the seeds category was impacted by the postponement and, in many areas of the country, cancellation of baseball and softball seasons. Baseball and seeds go hand in hand, and the loss of these opportunities had a negative impact on the category. Even despite these discrete headwinds, the snacks business delivered a terrific 20.1% year-over-year growth and a 26.4% growth on a 2-year basis.
And on Slide 16, you can see our performance in staples, a category that is more relevant than ever before. Our total staples business grew an incredible 46.3% for the quarter. The 6 brands to the right are our largest staples brands accounting for over 50% of our staples sales at retail pre-COVID, and each experienced considerable growth in the quarter. These businesses are proving to be a distinct benefit to our portfolio. But while we're pleased with our results for the quarter and the year, we are particularly excited about what the quarter has taught us about the opportunity that lies ahead as consumers have shifted their behaviors and eating habits.
Slide 18 shows some of the key ways in which we're seeing consumers' behavior shift in response to COVID-19. Many consumers are rediscovering the enjoyment associated with at-home eating, whether it's making fun baked goods, cooking with the family or enjoying a movie night with some snacks. Numerous consumers are also discovering new things about food during this time. Many are learning how to truly cook for the first time or discovering they can recreate restaurant favorites at home. We believe that many of these activities have staying power and are likely to persist even after a post-COVID world in whatever new normal we settle into. We also believe our broad and refreshed portfolio of innovative products is best suited to meet consumers' needs as they engage in these food behaviors.
And Slide 19 shows the strong growth during the quarter across our iconic brands, demonstrating how well suited our portfolio is to meet these behaviors.
Our ability to meet the changing consumer needs is balanced across our 3 domains. Slide 20 shows how household penetration grew during the quarter in staples, snacks and frozen.
And as we've been able to modernize and innovate our iconic brands, we are attracting younger consumers. Slide 21 shows that new consumers to our brands overindexed in the younger millennial and Gen X market segments.
Driving new trial is always a key focus for us. The investments that we've made over the past 5 years in updating our food with bold, on-trend flavors and modern food attributes were premised on the belief that if we can get people to try our food, they will come back for more. And that is exactly what's happening.
Slide 22 shows the continually improving repeat rates from consumers who tried our foods for the first time in March when the pandemic really started to accelerate in the U.S. The improved repeat rates are broad-based across many of our iconic brands. Importantly, when we attract new triers to our brands, they are coming back to purchase again more often than they did a year ago. It's worth noting that this trend holds true for the big 3 Pinnacle brands, validating our work over the last 12 months.
As Slide 24 shows, we're not just seeing an increase in repeat buyers, but we're seeing an increase in the frequency at which they return. Customers are not just coming back for more; they're coming back time and time again.
In addition to the strength of our trial and repeat results on an absolute basis, we are outperforming our peers in terms of new trial. Let's take frozen as an example. Slide 25 demonstrates how our Banquet, Healthy Choice and Marie Callender's brands are leading frozen single-serve peers in new buyer acquisition.
And as Slide 26 shows, these new frozen buyers are disproportionately coming from the millennial and Gen X market segments, similar to what we see in total Conagra trends. And like the total Conagra trends we discussed, not only are we attracting new buyers, but we're seeing higher repeat rates in our frozen segment than our peers.
Similarly, despite the supply constraints we faced that I noted earlier, Birds Eye continued to lead its category in terms of both new consumers and repeat purchases compared to peers during the quarter. All of these trends have important implications for our value creation opportunity as we look ahead. We believe the dynamic environment in which we find ourselves provides a unique window of opportunity to maintain the current momentum such that we maximize our long-term value-creation potential. Make that possible, we need to make investments focused on doing everything in our power to ensure the physical availability of our products.
Instead of choosing to simply accept the elevated demand as transitory and focus on maximizing near-term margins, we have chosen to bolster the long-term earnings potential of our company. We plan to accomplish this through investing in the key areas you see on this slide, which include increasing capacity, both internal and external; innovation; inventory; e-commerce; and safety. By investing behind today's elevated trial rates, we will build relationships with new consumers and maximize consumer conversion. The lifetime value of these consumers easily justifies these actions.
Slide 31 shows some highlights of our fiscal '21 innovation slate. Some of these items began launching in Q4, and we will continue to roll out these new products throughout the year. Overall, we are confident that the investments we are making will produce strong ROIs. They will also maximize our long-term value creation and, ultimately, shareholder value.
Turning to our guidance on Slide 32. We know that you would like as much information about our expectations for the year as possible. Given the very dynamic nature of the external environment, forecasting the full year right now is more difficult than normal. As of today, therefore, we're providing Q1 guidance. We hope that when we report Q1 results, we will be in a position to give you a further update on our outlook. While we don't expect the next few months to drive as much change as the past few, we expect to know a lot more by then.
Dave is going to go into more depth regarding the guidance, so I'll just hit the highlights here. During the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we expect to deliver organic net sales growth of 10% to 13%, adjusted operating margin of 17% to 17.5%, adjusted EPS of $0.54 to $0.59. As I said earlier, we remain on track to reach our fiscal 2022 targets outlined on this slide as well as our deleveraging ratio.
With that, I'll turn it over to Dave."

Before I discuss the details of the quarter, I want to take a moment to wish you all well. I hope you and your families are continuing to stay healthy and safe.
I'll kick off this portion of the call by pointing out a few highlights for the quarter and the full fiscal year, which are captured on Slide 34. Overall, we're very pleased with our performance for Q4 and the fiscal year. As Sean discussed earlier, in the fourth quarter, the COVID-19 pandemic led to unprecedented demand in our retail businesses, which more than offset the softer Foodservice demand. This increased retail demand, combined with our strong execution, enabled us to exceed the most recent full year fiscal '20 guidance for total company sales, profit and free cash flow metrics. The key takeaways for Q4 and fiscal '20 are: organic net sales increased 21.5% in the fourth quarter and 5.6% for the full year. Adjusted operating margin increased almost 400 basis points for the fourth quarter and over 100 basis points for the full year. Adjusted EPS more than doubled in the fourth quarter and grew 13% for the full year. And adjusted EBITDA increased 21.6% for the full year to just under $2.3 billion, helping to reduce the leverage ratio to 4.0x at the end of fiscal '20.
Let's start with the net sales bridge on Slide 35. As you can see, our 21.5% organic net sales growth in the fourth quarter was driven by 21% volume growth with price/mix contributing 0.5 percentage point. Divestitures were a 310-basis-point headwind in the quarter. This headwind will diminish sequentially as we continue to anniversary the divestiture closing dates going forward. Foreign exchange was a 70-basis-point headwind in the quarter with the weakening of the Mexican peso representing about 2/3 of the headwind. This was a bit higher than we were expecting for Q4.
Finally, the 53rd week added 810 basis points to the quarter, which was more of a net sales tailwind than we expected due to the elevated COVID-related demand at the end of the quarter, taking total reported net sales growth to plus 25.8% for Q4 versus a year ago.
Turning to Slide 36, you see our sales summary by segment. In the fourth quarter and the fiscal year, we saw strong growth across our 3 retail-focused businesses.
Our Grocery & Snacks segment reported very strong organic net sales growth of 40.4%. The grocery business proved to be a significant asset as consumers reengaged with convenient, shelf-stable products to facilitate and enhance the at-home eating experience.
The Refrigerated & Frozen segment continued to perform very well in the quarter. The segment reported organic net sales growth in each quarter of this fiscal year and has now had positive organic net sales growth in 11 of the last 12 fiscal quarters. This consistency shows that our modernization efforts have been working and are sustainable.
The International segment's 19.8% organic net sales growth was due to strong growth in Canada and better-than-expected growth in the Mexican and export businesses due to the pandemic.
Foodservice reported an organic net sales decline of 31.5%, which was better than expected as many restaurants continue to serve customer -- consumers with curbside pickup, drive-through for partial capacity.
Slide 37 outlines the progress we've made on our Q4 adjusted operating margin versus the prior year. Throughout the quarter, our gross margin expansion levers such as realized productivity, pricing, mix and COGS synergies continued to be effective. We also benefited from value-driven operating leverage in the quarter, approximating 100 basis points. These tailwinds were partially offset by increased COVID-related costs, dilution from significant Foodservice operating margin declines and a 170-basis-point headwind from inflation, resulting in a net gross margin improvement of approximately 110 basis points.
Given the already increased demand for food at home, we chose to pull back a bit on A&P in the quarter. That, coupled with increased net sales, drove a 100-basis-point improvement to operating margin. While adjusted SG&A expense increased 5.7% in Q4 versus a year ago, net sales grew much faster, resulting in a 180-basis-point tailwind to operating margin.
Turning to Slide 38. You can see that our adjusted operating profit was $562 million in the quarter, an increase of 63.5%. Adjusted operating margin increased just below 400 basis points to 17.1%. This chart clearly summarizes the outstanding operating margin improvement during Q4 in our domestic retail and International segments. This was partially offset by our Foodservice segment, which had significantly lower operating profit due to the 32% organic net sales decline, unfavorable fixed cost leverage on net sales decline, higher inventory write-offs and higher input costs.
Turning to Slide 39. We've summarized the various drivers of adjusted diluted EPS in Q4 versus a year ago. As you can see, our adjusted EPS increased $0.39 in the quarter, representing growth of over 100% from the same quarter last year. While the increase in EPS is primarily driven by the increase in operating profit associated with the net sales and margin increases, we also had higher income from Ardent Mills as COVID-related demand was a net benefit. We also estimate a $0.05 per share benefit from the 53rd week.
Slide 40 summarizes the excellent progress we've made on our overall synergy capture from the acquisition of Pinnacle Foods in fiscal year '19. We realized $39 million of incremental synergies during the fourth quarter, bringing our total cumulative synergy capture since the close of the Pinnacle acquisition through the end of fiscal '20 to $184 million, exceeding our fiscal '20 goal of $180 million. Importantly, we remain on track to deliver our total synergy target of $305 million by the end of fiscal '22. As a reminder, we have reinvested $20 million from our synergy realization to date into longer-term business opportunities, such as product and packaging improvements and innovation-related retailer investments.
As I stated on our last earnings call, we expected stronger cash flows in Q4 due to the normal seasonality of our business and the expected increase in retail demand from COVID-19. As a result, we updated our free cash flow expectations to be north of $950 million for fiscal '20. Fiscal '20 ended with the company generating approximately $1.47 billion of free cash flow, which was well above those revised expectations. Some of this benefit was timing-related. Due to the significant increase in sales, we reduced our days of inventory on hand during the quarter, which positively impacted Q4 free cash flow. We expect to build that inventory back as we progress through fiscal '21, which will be a headwind to free cash flow. It is not yet clear as to the exact timing of the fiscal '21 inventory rebuild.
Another timing item in Q4 was from federal tax payment deferrals, pushing payments from Q4 into Q1 of fiscal '21. We estimate the combined impact of these timing items on free cash flow between fiscal '20 and fiscal '21 to approximate $350 million.
Turning to Slide 42. From the close of the Pinnacle acquisition in Q2 fiscal '19 through the end of the fourth quarter in fiscal '20, we've reduced net debt by nearly $2 billion. In the fourth quarter, we reduced gross debt by $271 million and net debt by $725 million, improving our leverage ratio to 4.0x at the end of Q4, down from 4.8x at the end of Q3.
What's not shown on this slide but is important to note is that we improved the funded status of our pension plans during fiscal '20 by $80 million with the total underfunded status declining to approximately $50 million. For context, the pension plan's underfunded status were approximately $565 million at the end of fiscal '17, a reduction of over $500 million. This significant improvement was driven by planned pension contributions, lump sum payments to participants and actual returns on planned assets exceeding expectations.
In addition to the significant progress we made towards deleveraging in fiscal '20, we also further strengthened our liquidity position. We obtained a $600 million, 3-year senior unsecured term loan, which remains undrawn. This facility provides us with additional flexibility to repay debt maturity through fiscal '21 and positions us to refinance current fiscal '21 debt maturities at attractive rates with prepayable debt. As a reminder, we also have a $1.6 billion undrawn revolving credit facility.
Given where we finished fiscal '20 from a net debt perspective and given the continued momentum we expect in Q1 as outlined in our guidance, we are confident in our ability to achieve our targeted net debt to trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio of 3.5 to 3.6x by the end of fiscal '21. And importantly, we continue to remain committed to a solid investment-grade credit rating. In addition, we continue to remain open to smart divestitures that can help sculpt top line performance and generate cash flow to accelerate deleveraging. While we continue to evaluate portfolio actions, we will not pursue any divestitures that are not value-creating for the long term.
As we approach our targeted leverage ratio, we continue to evaluate opportunities to use capital allocation to drive shareholder value. Slide 44 outlines our guidance for the first quarter of fiscal '21 and our fiscal year '22 algorithm. We are expecting the elevated retail demand to continue into Q1 although at a lower rate than Q4, leading us to our Q1 organic net sales expectation of plus 10% to plus 13%. We continue to expect the favorable operating leverage from the elevated volumes in Q1 to offset the additional COVID-related costs. Therefore, we expect adjusted operating margin to be in the range of 17% to 17.5%. These operating margin increases, coupled with expected improvement in our below-the-line items, lead to an expected EPS range for the first quarter of fiscal '21 of $0.54 to $0.59. As I already mentioned, we remain confident in our ability to hit our leverage ratio target of 3.5 to 3.6x by the end of fiscal '21. And lastly, we are today reaffirming our fiscal year '22 algorithm, which is outlined on this slide and in the earnings release.
Thank you, everyone. That concludes my comments. I'll now pass it back to Sean."

Specifically, while I understand certainly the rationale for perhaps not yet providing full fiscal year '21 guidance, the fact that you're comfortable reiterating fiscal '22 EPS means, at least to me, that there should be some good progress in '21 versus '20 to be able to achieve '22 guidance in a reasonable way, where, I guess, not all of the EPS growth needs to come in '22 versus '21, if you see what I'm saying.

But when you step back and you look at where we landed '20, if you look at the momentum of the business, the continued elevated demand, the new triers, the very strong repeat and synergies remaining on track, our view is that it would be hard to argue that we're not on a path to the '22 targets. And the real question for us is kind of you think about our prepared remarks today on trial and repeat is whether these dynamics that we're seeing currently offer incremental long-term upside beyond our '22 algorithm.

Something is happening that is above and beyond what our normal marketing programs would do. COVID has introduced this dynamic where, as you saw on the slides earlier, consumers are legitimately rediscovering certain things in their house, whether it's their kitchens, their freezers, being together, and they like it. They're also discovering that some of the things that they thought existed actually have changed quite a bit. So for example, the quality of frozen food. And as you know, we've spent the last 5 years dramatically transforming our products. So you put both of those things together, and there is clearly an element of pleasant surprise that consumers have when it comes to cooking at home.
And given the tremendous value proposition of cooking at home and that we are in a recessionary environment, it's entirely plausible that these dynamics persist for some time, especially with the news changing hourly on COVID and what's happening with positive cases. And we believe that once people try our products, the data supports that we stand a very good chance that they'll come back again and again and again. So we are investing today in order to maximize long-term value creation potential of this portfolio and really seize any option that there is further upside beyond our current algorithm."

Just more broadly, retailers are, at some point, going to rebuild inventories, I would imagine, in all their categories. And if you think of in the last several years, the focus on on-time in full of the focus we've talked about recently with retailers putting more phasings against high velocities, retailers paid out of stocks. So that is not going to change. And at some point, I would imagine that inventory levels would revert to kind of historical norms. The question, of course, is when will that happen? Because the way that happens is 1 of 2 things or both have to happen, either demand has to slow or capacity has to increase.
We've seen demand slow recently, but it's still at very, very high levels. You also heard me talk about how we are making investments to increase capacities, but there's an upper control limit to how we can do that. So for the foreseeable future, in the near term, we are running flat out. And much of what we make and leaves our plants is going straight through to the consumer. When that slows down and the inventory levels build back is one of the wildcards that's virtually impossible to predict.
And while I've got you, since you raised ACT II, I want to link your question on ACT II back to Andrew's question, which is will any of what we're seeing now persist. Well, interestingly, one of the things that you're seeing now and you're reading about now is movie studios are going to direct release at home on demand. And there are some questions around what's going to happen with movie theaters going forward. As that happens, people will be watching movies as a group at home at a level we probably have not seen before. We're already experiencing this. And the shift in our microwaveable popcorn business has been dramatic, reflecting that new behavior. That could very well be a persistent thing, but it may depend in part on what the movie studios ultimately choose to do. But those are the kinds of things that seem to be logically tracking in our favor, but we need to see how long they persist."

Number one, our portfolio, as you know, has a very strong value segment to it. Brands like Banquet and other already offer extremely favorable value that is and historically have proven very resilient in a recessionary environment. The other piece of it, too, is that in many of the categories, you continue to see out of stocks because the throughput is flat out, and demand still exceeds that production availability, and therefore, you only exacerbate that problem when you price promote in that type of a category. So I think it will be category-specific.
I will point out, though, that in our Q4, we did honor most of our promotional commitments, and that's because those were long-standing commitments. We have a principle of not kind of backing out. But going forward, I would expect our average scan prices may move north a little bit near term because we are likely to see less discounting price promotion activity. However, I wouldn't want you to take that as less retailer investment because it's more likely to be a shift in retailer investments, really the profile of the retailer spend than the absolute level. So less discounting, more brand building, more new habit creation.
To give you a specific example, a good example would be creating loyalty on our frozen brands with millennials by making click and collect behaviors habitual by increasing our e-com spend with retailers. That's a positive constructive alternative in a supply-constrained environment to more of a price promotion approach."

On the first piece, if you go back to the beginning of this thing, Nik, what happened was we had this massive initial surge, right, with pantry stocking and the like. And that went a long way toward kind of depleting our inventories and really starting to deplete customer inventories. Since then, while we haven't been at the level of that initial surge, demand has been extremely high. So we've got categories where we've hit the ceiling where we're just flat out. We've got categories where we've made some early progress and starting to kind of catch up. But with another surge, that's just going to put more strain on it. So we are focused -- it's interesting because we are typically focused on optimizing demand. And now we're in this environment where we are really heavily focused on optimizing supply because we're really up against it. And that has been the case in the early days of our Q1. And even if you look at the scanner data, it's been pretty strong. And that's all previous news of these upticks.
So we've got to monitor it. We're doing everything in our power to add additional capacity, so that we can protect the upside to the best of our ability. But it's going to be strained near term, and we are investing to make sure that, that happens.

Because recall at CAGNY, we had talked about how some of our customer base had moved up their shelf resets in frozen, and I'm sure many of you are curious what happened with that with respect to COVID hitting. Well, you may be surprised to learn that the vast majority of our customers proceeded as planned in Q4 with their earlier frozen resets. And that's good news. We see our exciting fiscal '21 innovations on the shelf, and they look great. And we are hustling to try to keep them in stock because they're obviously getting good trial.
And also, with respect to Q4 innovation in total, which includes the innovations we launched earlier in the year, the Q4 innovation was up over 25% versus the prior Q4. And it definitely had some benefit versus the prior Q4 of shipments of the following year's innovation coming a little bit earlier, and that's because of those frozen shelf resets that we talked about. But the reality is, despite what you've heard about SKU reduction to maximize throughput and things like that, we have continued to have strong favorable reaction from our retailers on our new innovation, and we continue to feel super strong about the slate we've got out there and expect it to perform well this year.

Sean, you got nice metrics here, but what I want to get your impression of is the -- you've made a comment repeatedly for years that your expectation is that frozen is going to be just a critical area of growth in the grocery store. When we just look at these 4Q results, obviously, heavily affected by COVID, right, the staples piece is growing much, much faster than frozen, there's that initial stock-up that's going on in there. What I was hoping you could do is just explain how you thought frozen would grow relative to that of staples on a go-forward basis. Should frozen be half as much as staples as we see almost in this graph? Or should frozen, on a relative basis, begin to be much stronger after we've kind of cleared through that first stock-up that occurred in March, April?"

Whenever you see any kind of crisis hit, people will load their dry goods pantry, which has a tremendous amount of holding power. And actually, you tend to see more of a pantry load dynamic there because of the holding power of pantry relative to the holding power of a freezer. Most freezers are actually incredibly limited in space, and that's one of the governors that you see on frozen. Interestingly, one of the things we didn't put in the deck is the sales rate of stand-alone frozen freezers. If you had gone to a Home Depot or a Best Buy in the last few months in search of a freezer, you would not have been able to find one. So clearly, consumers are recognizing there's a limit to what they can fit in their freezer. I know in my household, we were frustrated because we get to -- you'd go to the store on a day as shipments came and you want to buy stuff, but you had nowhere to put it because your freezer was full. So that's a governor you have there versus staples.
That said, while I might expect the 2 to converge more going forward, staples, what you see in the staples space is a super value proposition. So Chef Boyardee, and this may be more of a function of what is the consumer's household balance sheet look like going forward, how long does the recessionary environment persist, items like Chef are a tremendous value proposition, and that kind of environment should continue to perform well. Furthermore, if people are learning to cook again and cooking from scratch, a lot of the staples products we have like PAM cooking spray or our beans business or our tomato business ought to remain elevated, and these are the kinds of things you can use in multiple recipes throughout the week that are different recipes as opposed to eating the same thing again and again.
So I'm not going to try to forecast how these will perform relative to one another. The key point we wanted to make today is that all 3 of our consumer domains have been elevated and are enjoying this notion of rediscovery and discovery that I talked about."

So that is starting to work its way in quarter-by-quarter into our actual results.
So as I look to Q1, because we gave specific margin guidance in Q1, a big part of the operating margin improvement versus the prior year is actually because of the leverage on SG&A. So the 17% to 17.5%, a good amount of that improvement is the SG&A leverage. Gross margin, there's a lot of puts and takes with all the different costs. So there'd be more moderate improvement there, but it's mostly SG&A. So we start seeing that leverage in a bigger way starting in Q1. And you'll continue to see leverage going forward.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter fiscal 2020 earnings call. On behalf of Conagra Brands, I want to start by expressing my heartfelt hope that you and your families are continuing to stay safe and healthy.
On today's call, we're going to address our fourth quarter and fiscal 2020 results, our expectations for fiscal 2021 and our perspective on why Conagra is uniquely positioned to succeed in this new environment. But first, I want to provide some context around what has brought us to this point. Over the past 5 years, we have been purposefully architecting one of the largest transformations in the food industry. When we embarked on this process, we made major strategic decisions on where to compete and how to win. After decades as a food conglomerate, we transformed into a pure-play branded food company with a portfolio focused on competing in 3 domains: frozen, snacks and staples.
We committed to perpetually reshaping our portfolio for better growth and better margins and established a disciplined approach rooted in a playbook that we call the Conagra Way. This relentlessly principle-based playbook is filled with repeatable and scalable processes that focus on modernizing our iconic brands through superior food, contemporary packaging and strong consistent marketing investment. The Conagra Way is not just a way to build brands but an operating model that has helped cultivate our agile, motivated and highly energized culture. As I'll describe in more detail in a moment, fiscal 2020 saw unprecedented performance as we built upon the extraordinary progress we have made over the past 5 years. We further strengthened our business, including getting Legacy Pinnacle back on track and delivered strong financial results.
During the fourth quarter, in particular, our transformation was put to the test, and you are seeing the fruits of our labor. Our modernized portfolio and agile culture enabled us to respond to the increased consumer demand driven by COVID-19. At this point, the degree to which demand will return to historical norms is still uncertain, and the timing of the changes in consumer demand is also uncertain. However, we believe that demand will likely remain elevated in the near term given both consumer perceptions about returning to work and eating outside the home as well as the fact that consumers are discovering and rediscovering the pleasures, conveniences and tremendous value proposition of dining at home.
Dave will cover the financials in more detail, but I want to let you know that we continue to be on track to deliver our fiscal 2022 algorithm, and we remain committed to achieving our leverage target of 3.5x to 3.6x by the end of fiscal 2021.
As we'll detail today, we believe our portfolio is optimally positioned to succeed in the new normal. We are focused on making the right investments to ensure that we can continue to safely and reliably meet consumers' needs in fiscal '21 and the longer term.
In today's presentation, we will cover our business update, the behavioral shifts we have seen and how Conagra is well positioned to benefit from these shifts and what we expect going forward in terms of our near-term outlook and the opportunity to create long-term value.
Beginning with our business update. Before I get into the numbers, I would like to recognize that our extraordinary results have only been possible because of the thousands of hard-working Conagra team members on the frontlines across North America. Here at Conagra, we talk about infusing a refuse-to-lose attitude and never before have we seen our team make such extraordinary efforts. The team's commitment has enabled us to meet the elevated demand from our customers and the communities we serve and deliver the strong results that we are announcing today. I couldn't be more proud of all that they have accomplished. To all of our team members, thank you. Great job all around.
During the fourth quarter, we experienced significant growth across our core operating metrics, including 21.5% growth in organic net sales and a 108.3% growth in adjusted EPS. These results helped contribute to our rapid progress in reducing our leverage, and I'm proud to say that we ended the quarter with a net leverage ratio of 4.0x, down from 4.8x in the third quarter.
As you can see on Slide 9, our growth was not confined to one area but was driven by strong retail sales across our portfolio, spanning staples, frozen and snacks. Our strong growth in e-commerce continued to accelerate, both on an absolute basis and as a percentage of our overall sales. The work we've done over the past several years to improve our e-commerce capabilities has certainly paid off. As consumers increasingly adopt online grocery shopping, our share of e-commerce sales has steadily increased.
Slide 11 highlights that our disciplined approach to innovation is clearly working. Our absolute sales on new innovation introduced this year increased 43% compared to our innovation slate of fiscal 2019. As a reminder, we stated at our initial Investor Day that our goal was to have 15% of total sales coming from products launched within the past 3 years. Well, today, I'm proud to say that we're consistently performing above that level. In a few minutes, we'll provide you some of the new innovation that we have in store for fiscal 2021 as we seek to build upon this success.
As we've discussed previously, frozen is an increasingly important domain for consumers, especially in today's environment. For the fourth quarter, total Conagra frozen retail sales grew 26.2% over last year with strong growth across each frozen category, including single-serve meals, vegetables, multi-serve meals and plant-based meal alternatives.
And as Slide 13 shows, as we grew, we also gained share in the important Frozen Meals category during the quarter, continuing a trend we've seen for some time now. The Conagra Way playbook continues to pay off. And while the trends have remained strong, there's even more opportunity, particularly in frozen vegetables. Birds Eye faced some unique dynamics in the quarter. As I said earlier, the category remained extremely relevant for consumers. We continue to see robust demand for frozen vegetables, and our retail sales up 26.5% during the quarter. Importantly, Birds Eye hold the top position in category share and has 2x the share of the next branded player.
Given the incredible surge in demand we experienced during the fourth quarter and our #1 brand position, we hit a ceiling on capacity. Furthermore, we made the decision to temporarily close a plant during the quarter due to COVID-19, which further constrained capacity. The good news is the plant is safely back up and running flat out. In addition, we have made the strategic decision to bring on more external partners to fulfill demand and rebuild inventory. These investments in our supply chain will allow us to efficiently meet the elevated demand we are seeing today and expect to see going forward. This is an important example of that investment, and I will expand on this in a few minutes.
Turning to snacks. Recall that our snacks business overindexes to convenience stores, which saw softer traffic due to COVID-19 during our Q4. Also, the seeds category was impacted by the postponement and, in many areas of the country, cancellation of baseball and softball seasons. Baseball and seeds go hand in hand, and the loss of these opportunities had a negative impact on the category. Even despite these discrete headwinds, the snacks business delivered a terrific 20.1% year-over-year growth and a 26.4% growth on a 2-year basis.
And on Slide 16, you can see our performance in staples, a category that is more relevant than ever before. Our total staples business grew an incredible 46.3% for the quarter. The 6 brands to the right are our largest staples brands accounting for over 50% of our staples sales at retail pre-COVID, and each experienced considerable growth in the quarter. These businesses are proving to be a distinct benefit to our portfolio. But while we're pleased with our results for the quarter and the year, we are particularly excited about what the quarter has taught us about the opportunity that lies ahead as consumers have shifted their behaviors and eating habits.
Slide 18 shows some of the key ways in which we're seeing consumers' behavior shift in response to COVID-19. Many consumers are rediscovering the enjoyment associated with at-home eating, whether it's making fun baked goods, cooking with the family or enjoying a movie night with some snacks. Numerous consumers are also discovering new things about food during this time. Many are learning how to truly cook for the first time or discovering they can recreate restaurant favorites at home. We believe that many of these activities have staying power and are likely to persist even after a post-COVID world in whatever new normal we settle into. We also believe our broad and refreshed portfolio of innovative products is best suited to meet consumers' needs as they engage in these food behaviors.
And Slide 19 shows the strong growth during the quarter across our iconic brands, demonstrating how well suited our portfolio is to meet these behaviors.
Our ability to meet the changing consumer needs is balanced across our 3 domains. Slide 20 shows how household penetration grew during the quarter in staples, snacks and frozen.
And as we've been able to modernize and innovate our iconic brands, we are attracting younger consumers. Slide 21 shows that new consumers to our brands overindexed in the younger millennial and Gen X market segments.
Driving new trial is always a key focus for us. The investments that we've made over the past 5 years in updating our food with bold, on-trend flavors and modern food attributes were premised on the belief that if we can get people to try our food, they will come back for more. And that is exactly what's happening.
Slide 22 shows the continually improving repeat rates from consumers who tried our foods for the first time in March when the pandemic really started to accelerate in the U.S. The improved repeat rates are broad-based across many of our iconic brands. Importantly, when we attract new triers to our brands, they are coming back to purchase again more often than they did a year ago. It's worth noting that this trend holds true for the big 3 Pinnacle brands, validating our work over the last 12 months.
As Slide 24 shows, we're not just seeing an increase in repeat buyers, but we're seeing an increase in the frequency at which they return. Customers are not just coming back for more; they're coming back time and time again.
In addition to the strength of our trial and repeat results on an absolute basis, we are outperforming our peers in terms of new trial. Let's take frozen as an example. Slide 25 demonstrates how our Banquet, Healthy Choice and Marie Callender's brands are leading frozen single-serve peers in new buyer acquisition.
And as Slide 26 shows, these new frozen buyers are disproportionately coming from the millennial and Gen X market segments, similar to what we see in total Conagra trends. And like the total Conagra trends we discussed, not only are we attracting new buyers, but we're seeing higher repeat rates in our frozen segment than our peers.
Similarly, despite the supply constraints we faced that I noted earlier, Birds Eye continued to lead its category in terms of both new consumers and repeat purchases compared to peers during the quarter. All of these trends have important implications for our value creation opportunity as we look ahead. We believe the dynamic environment in which we find ourselves provides a unique window of opportunity to maintain the current momentum such that we maximize our long-term value-creation potential. Make that possible, we need to make investments focused on doing everything in our power to ensure the physical availability of our products.
Instead of choosing to simply accept the elevated demand as transitory and focus on maximizing near-term margins, we have chosen to bolster the long-term earnings potential of our company. We plan to accomplish this through investing in the key areas you see on this slide, which include increasing capacity, both internal and external; innovation; inventory; e-commerce; and safety. By investing behind today's elevated trial rates, we will build relationships with new consumers and maximize consumer conversion. The lifetime value of these consumers easily justifies these actions.
Slide 31 shows some highlights of our fiscal '21 innovation slate. Some of these items began launching in Q4, and we will continue to roll out these new products throughout the year. Overall, we are confident that the investments we are making will produce strong ROIs. They will also maximize our long-term value creation and, ultimately, shareholder value.
Turning to our guidance on Slide 32. We know that you would like as much information about our expectations for the year as possible. Given the very dynamic nature of the external environment, forecasting the full year right now is more difficult than normal. As of today, therefore, we're providing Q1 guidance. We hope that when we report Q1 results, we will be in a position to give you a further update on our outlook. While we don't expect the next few months to drive as much change as the past few, we expect to know a lot more by then.
Dave is going to go into more depth regarding the guidance, so I'll just hit the highlights here. During the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we expect to deliver organic net sales growth of 10% to 13%, adjusted operating margin of 17% to 17.5%, adjusted EPS of $0.54 to $0.59. As I said earlier, we remain on track to reach our fiscal 2022 targets outlined on this slide as well as our deleveraging ratio.
With that, I'll turn it over to Dave."

Before I discuss the details of the quarter, I want to take a moment to wish you all well. I hope you and your families are continuing to stay healthy and safe.
I'll kick off this portion of the call by pointing out a few highlights for the quarter and the full fiscal year, which are captured on Slide 34. Overall, we're very pleased with our performance for Q4 and the fiscal year. As Sean discussed earlier, in the fourth quarter, the COVID-19 pandemic led to unprecedented demand in our retail businesses, which more than offset the softer Foodservice demand. This increased retail demand, combined with our strong execution, enabled us to exceed the most recent full year fiscal '20 guidance for total company sales, profit and free cash flow metrics. The key takeaways for Q4 and fiscal '20 are: organic net sales increased 21.5% in the fourth quarter and 5.6% for the full year. Adjusted operating margin increased almost 400 basis points for the fourth quarter and over 100 basis points for the full year. Adjusted EPS more than doubled in the fourth quarter and grew 13% for the full year. And adjusted EBITDA increased 21.6% for the full year to just under $2.3 billion, helping to reduce the leverage ratio to 4.0x at the end of fiscal '20.
Let's start with the net sales bridge on Slide 35. As you can see, our 21.5% organic net sales growth in the fourth quarter was driven by 21% volume growth with price/mix contributing 0.5 percentage point. Divestitures were a 310-basis-point headwind in the quarter. This headwind will diminish sequentially as we continue to anniversary the divestiture closing dates going forward. Foreign exchange was a 70-basis-point headwind in the quarter with the weakening of the Mexican peso representing about 2/3 of the headwind. This was a bit higher than we were expecting for Q4.
Finally, the 53rd week added 810 basis points to the quarter, which was more of a net sales tailwind than we expected due to the elevated COVID-related demand at the end of the quarter, taking total reported net sales growth to plus 25.8% for Q4 versus a year ago.
Turning to Slide 36, you see our sales summary by segment. In the fourth quarter and the fiscal year, we saw strong growth across our 3 retail-focused businesses.
Our Grocery & Snacks segment reported very strong organic net sales growth of 40.4%. The grocery business proved to be a significant asset as consumers reengaged with convenient, shelf-stable products to facilitate and enhance the at-home eating experience.
The Refrigerated & Frozen segment continued to perform very well in the quarter. The segment reported organic net sales growth in each quarter of this fiscal year and has now had positive organic net sales growth in 11 of the last 12 fiscal quarters. This consistency shows that our modernization efforts have been working and are sustainable.
The International segment's 19.8% organic net sales growth was due to strong growth in Canada and better-than-expected growth in the Mexican and export businesses due to the pandemic.
Foodservice reported an organic net sales decline of 31.5%, which was better than expected as many restaurants continue to serve customer -- consumers with curbside pickup, drive-through for partial capacity.
Slide 37 outlines the progress we've made on our Q4 adjusted operating margin versus the prior year. Throughout the quarter, our gross margin expansion levers such as realized productivity, pricing, mix and COGS synergies continued to be effective. We also benefited from value-driven operating leverage in the quarter, approximating 100 basis points. These tailwinds were partially offset by increased COVID-related costs, dilution from significant Foodservice operating margin declines and a 170-basis-point headwind from inflation, resulting in a net gross margin improvement of approximately 110 basis points.
Given the already increased demand for food at home, we chose to pull back a bit on A&P in the quarter. That, coupled with increased net sales, drove a 100-basis-point improvement to operating margin. While adjusted SG&A expense increased 5.7% in Q4 versus a year ago, net sales grew much faster, resulting in a 180-basis-point tailwind to operating margin.
Turning to Slide 38. You can see that our adjusted operating profit was $562 million in the quarter, an increase of 63.5%. Adjusted operating margin increased just below 400 basis points to 17.1%. This chart clearly summarizes the outstanding operating margin improvement during Q4 in our domestic retail and International segments. This was partially offset by our Foodservice segment, which had significantly lower operating profit due to the 32% organic net sales decline, unfavorable fixed cost leverage on net sales decline, higher inventory write-offs and higher input costs.
Turning to Slide 39. We've summarized the various drivers of adjusted diluted EPS in Q4 versus a year ago. As you can see, our adjusted EPS increased $0.39 in the quarter, representing growth of over 100% from the same quarter last year. While the increase in EPS is primarily driven by the increase in operating profit associated with the net sales and margin increases, we also had higher income from Ardent Mills as COVID-related demand was a net benefit. We also estimate a $0.05 per share benefit from the 53rd week.
Slide 40 summarizes the excellent progress we've made on our overall synergy capture from the acquisition of Pinnacle Foods in fiscal year '19. We realized $39 million of incremental synergies during the fourth quarter, bringing our total cumulative synergy capture since the close of the Pinnacle acquisition through the end of fiscal '20 to $184 million, exceeding our fiscal '20 goal of $180 million. Importantly, we remain on track to deliver our total synergy target of $305 million by the end of fiscal '22. As a reminder, we have reinvested $20 million from our synergy realization to date into longer-term business opportunities, such as product and packaging improvements and innovation-related retailer investments.
As I stated on our last earnings call, we expected stronger cash flows in Q4 due to the normal seasonality of our business and the expected increase in retail demand from COVID-19. As a result, we updated our free cash flow expectations to be north of $950 million for fiscal '20. Fiscal '20 ended with the company generating approximately $1.47 billion of free cash flow, which was well above those revised expectations. Some of this benefit was timing-related. Due to the significant increase in sales, we reduced our days of inventory on hand during the quarter, which positively impacted Q4 free cash flow. We expect to build that inventory back as we progress through fiscal '21, which will be a headwind to free cash flow. It is not yet clear as to the exact timing of the fiscal '21 inventory rebuild.
Another timing item in Q4 was from federal tax payment deferrals, pushing payments from Q4 into Q1 of fiscal '21. We estimate the combined impact of these timing items on free cash flow between fiscal '20 and fiscal '21 to approximate $350 million.
Turning to Slide 42. From the close of the Pinnacle acquisition in Q2 fiscal '19 through the end of the fourth quarter in fiscal '20, we've reduced net debt by nearly $2 billion. In the fourth quarter, we reduced gross debt by $271 million and net debt by $725 million, improving our leverage ratio to 4.0x at the end of Q4, down from 4.8x at the end of Q3.
What's not shown on this slide but is important to note is that we improved the funded status of our pension plans during fiscal '20 by $80 million with the total underfunded status declining to approximately $50 million. For context, the pension plan's underfunded status were approximately $565 million at the end of fiscal '17, a reduction of over $500 million. This significant improvement was driven by planned pension contributions, lump sum payments to participants and actual returns on planned assets exceeding expectations.
In addition to the significant progress we made towards deleveraging in fiscal '20, we also further strengthened our liquidity position. We obtained a $600 million, 3-year senior unsecured term loan, which remains undrawn. This facility provides us with additional flexibility to repay debt maturity through fiscal '21 and positions us to refinance current fiscal '21 debt maturities at attractive rates with prepayable debt. As a reminder, we also have a $1.6 billion undrawn revolving credit facility.
Given where we finished fiscal '20 from a net debt perspective and given the continued momentum we expect in Q1 as outlined in our guidance, we are confident in our ability to achieve our targeted net debt to trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio of 3.5 to 3.6x by the end of fiscal '21. And importantly, we continue to remain committed to a solid investment-grade credit rating. In addition, we continue to remain open to smart divestitures that can help sculpt top line performance and generate cash flow to accelerate deleveraging. While we continue to evaluate portfolio actions, we will not pursue any divestitures that are not value-creating for the long term.
As we approach our targeted leverage ratio, we continue to evaluate opportunities to use capital allocation to drive shareholder value. Slide 44 outlines our guidance for the first quarter of fiscal '21 and our fiscal year '22 algorithm. We are expecting the elevated retail demand to continue into Q1 although at a lower rate than Q4, leading us to our Q1 organic net sales expectation of plus 10% to plus 13%. We continue to expect the favorable operating leverage from the elevated volumes in Q1 to offset the additional COVID-related costs. Therefore, we expect adjusted operating margin to be in the range of 17% to 17.5%. These operating margin increases, coupled with expected improvement in our below-the-line items, lead to an expected EPS range for the first quarter of fiscal '21 of $0.54 to $0.59. As I already mentioned, we remain confident in our ability to hit our leverage ratio target of 3.5 to 3.6x by the end of fiscal '21. And lastly, we are today reaffirming our fiscal year '22 algorithm, which is outlined on this slide and in the earnings release.
Thank you, everyone. That concludes my comments. I'll now pass it back to Sean."

Specifically, while I understand certainly the rationale for perhaps not yet providing full fiscal year '21 guidance, the fact that you're comfortable reiterating fiscal '22 EPS means, at least to me, that there should be some good progress in '21 versus '20 to be able to achieve '22 guidance in a reasonable way, where, I guess, not all of the EPS growth needs to come in '22 versus '21, if you see what I'm saying.

And the real question for us is kind of you think about our prepared remarks today on trial and repeat is whether these dynamics that we're seeing currently offer incremental long-term upside beyond our '22 algorithm. Obviously, we're not going to comment on a longer-term algorithm. But certainly, these are positive markers, and we have elected to invest behind that option, for lack of a better phrase."

And of course, none of us have a crystal ball regarding where consumption and growth rates for many of your key categories ultimately settle out. But in light, I guess, of the metrics you've discussed, I mean, would it be your expectation that for some of your key categories, Conagra should see an elevated rate of growth versus, let's say, pre-COVID for a more prolonged period of time? The investments that you discussed on the call with respect to incremental capacity and such would seem to support that thought process. But again, I wanted to hear it from you and get some clarity."

Something is happening that is above and beyond what our normal marketing programs would do. COVID has introduced this dynamic where, as you saw on the slides earlier, consumers are legitimately rediscovering certain things in their house, whether it's their kitchens, their freezers, being together, and they like it. They're also discovering that some of the things that they thought existed actually have changed quite a bit. So for example, the quality of frozen food. And as you know, we've spent the last 5 years dramatically transforming our products. So you put both of those things together, and there is clearly an element of pleasant surprise that consumers have when it comes to cooking at home.
And given the tremendous value proposition of cooking at home and that we are in a recessionary environment, it's entirely plausible that these dynamics persist for some time, especially with the news changing hourly on COVID and what's happening with positive cases. And we believe that once people try our products, the data supports that we stand a very good chance that they'll come back again and again and again. So we are investing today in order to maximize long-term value creation potential of this portfolio and really seize any option that there is further upside beyond our current algorithm."

Just more broadly, retailers are, at some point, going to rebuild inventories, I would imagine, in all their categories. And if you think of in the last several years, the focus on on-time in full of the focus we've talked about recently with retailers putting more phasings against high velocities, retailers paid out of stocks. So that is not going to change. And at some point, I would imagine that inventory levels would revert to kind of historical norms. The question, of course, is when will that happen? Because the way that happens is 1 of 2 things or both have to happen, either demand has to slow or capacity has to increase.
We've seen demand slow recently, but it's still at very, very high levels. You also heard me talk about how we are making investments to increase capacities, but there's an upper control limit to how we can do that. So for the foreseeable future, in the near term, we are running flat out. And much of what we make and leaves our plants is going straight through to the consumer. When that slows down and the inventory levels build back is one of the wildcards that's virtually impossible to predict.
And while I've got you, since you raised ACT II, I want to link your question on ACT II back to Andrew's question, which is will any of what we're seeing now persist. Well, interestingly, one of the things that you're seeing now and you're reading about now is movie studios are going to direct release at home on demand. And there are some questions around what's going to happen with movie theaters going forward. As that happens, people will be watching movies as a group at home at a level we probably have not seen before. We're already experiencing this. And the shift in our microwaveable popcorn business has been dramatic, reflecting that new behavior. That could very well be a persistent thing, but it may depend in part on what the movie studios ultimately choose to do. But those are the kinds of things that seem to be logically tracking in our favor, but we need to see how long they persist."

Number one, our portfolio, as you know, has a very strong value segment to it. Brands like Banquet and other already offer extremely favorable value that is and historically have proven very resilient in a recessionary environment. The other piece of it, too, is that in many of the categories, you continue to see out of stocks because the throughput is flat out, and demand still exceeds that production availability, and therefore, you only exacerbate that problem when you price promote in that type of a category. So I think it will be category-specific.
I will point out, though, that in our Q4, we did honor most of our promotional commitments, and that's because those were long-standing commitments. We have a principle of not kind of backing out. But going forward, I would expect our average scan prices may move north a little bit near term because we are likely to see less discounting price promotion activity. However, I wouldn't want you to take that as less retailer investment because it's more likely to be a shift in retailer investments, really the profile of the retailer spend than the absolute level. So less discounting, more brand building, more new habit creation.
To give you a specific example, a good example would be creating loyalty on our frozen brands with millennials by making click and collect behaviors habitual by increasing our e-com spend with retailers. That's a positive constructive alternative in a supply-constrained environment to more of a price promotion approach."

On the first piece, if you go back to the beginning of this thing, Nik, what happened was we had this massive initial surge, right, with pantry stocking and the like. And that went a long way toward kind of depleting our inventories and really starting to deplete customer inventories. Since then, while we haven't been at the level of that initial surge, demand has been extremely high. So we've got categories where we've hit the ceiling where we're just flat out. We've got categories where we've made some early progress and starting to kind of catch up. But with another surge, that's just going to put more strain on it. So we are focused -- it's interesting because we are typically focused on optimizing demand. And now we're in this environment where we are really heavily focused on optimizing supply because we're really up against it. And that has been the case in the early days of our Q1. And even if you look at the scanner data, it's been pretty strong. And that's all previous news of these upticks.
So we've got to monitor it. We're doing everything in our power to add additional capacity, so that we can protect the upside to the best of our ability. But it's going to be strained near term, and we are investing to make sure that, that happens.
Did you have anything else to add on that point, Dave?"

Because recall at CAGNY, we had talked about how some of our customer base had moved up their shelf resets in frozen, and I'm sure many of you are curious what happened with that with respect to COVID hitting. Well, you may be surprised to learn that the vast majority of our customers proceeded as planned in Q4 with their earlier frozen resets. And that's good news. We see our exciting fiscal '21 innovations on the shelf, and they look great. And we are hustling to try to keep them in stock because they're obviously getting good trial.
And also, with respect to Q4 innovation in total, which includes the innovations we launched earlier in the year, the Q4 innovation was up over 25% versus the prior Q4. And it definitely had some benefit versus the prior Q4 of shipments of the following year's innovation coming a little bit earlier, and that's because of those frozen shelf resets that we talked about. But the reality is, despite what you've heard about SKU reduction to maximize throughput and things like that, we have continued to have strong favorable reaction from our retailers on our new innovation, and we continue to feel super strong about the slate we've got out there and expect it to perform well this year. As you've seen in the last few years, every year's innovation has outperformed the prior years for the last several years. And there's no reason to expect this year wouldn't continue, albeit we have a few more wildcards that we are dealing with than in previous years."

Sean, you got nice metrics here, but what I want to get your impression of is the -- you've made a comment repeatedly for years that your expectation is that frozen is going to be just a critical area of growth in the grocery store. When we just look at these 4Q results, obviously, heavily affected by COVID, right, the staples piece is growing much, much faster than frozen, there's that initial stock-up that's going on in there. What I was hoping you could do is just explain how you thought frozen would grow relative to that of staples on a go-forward basis. Should frozen be half as much as staples as we see almost in this graph? Or should frozen, on a relative basis, begin to be much stronger after we've kind of cleared through that first stock-up that occurred in March, April?"

Whenever you see any kind of crisis hit, people will load their dry goods pantry, which has a tremendous amount of holding power. And actually, you tend to see more of a pantry load dynamic there because of the holding power of pantry relative to the holding power of a freezer. Most freezers are actually incredibly limited in space, and that's one of the governors that you see on frozen. Interestingly, one of the things we didn't put in the deck is the sales rate of stand-alone frozen freezers. If you had gone to a Home Depot or a Best Buy in the last few months in search of a freezer, you would not have been able to find one. So clearly, consumers are recognizing there's a limit to what they can fit in their freezer. I know in my household, we were frustrated because we get to -- you'd go to the store on a day as shipments came and you want to buy stuff, but you had nowhere to put it because your freezer was full. So that's a governor you have there versus staples.
That said, while I might expect the 2 to converge more going forward, staples, what you see in the staples space is a super value proposition. So Chef Boyardee, and this may be more of a function of what is the consumer's household balance sheet look like going forward, how long does the recessionary environment persist, items like Chef are a tremendous value proposition, and that kind of environment should continue to perform well. Furthermore, if people are learning to cook again and cooking from scratch, a lot of the staples products we have like PAM cooking spray or our beans business or our tomato business ought to remain elevated, and these are the kinds of things you can use in multiple recipes throughout the week that are different recipes as opposed to eating the same thing again and again.
So I'm not going to try to forecast how these will perform relative to one another. The key point we wanted to make today is that all 3 of our consumer domains have been elevated and are enjoying this notion of rediscovery and discovery that I talked about."

So that is starting to work its way in quarter-by-quarter into our actual results.
So as I look to Q1, because we gave specific margin guidance in Q1, a big part of the operating margin improvement versus the prior year is actually because of the leverage on SG&A. So the 17% to 17.5%, a good amount of that improvement is the SG&A leverage. Gross margin, there's a lot of puts and takes with all the different costs. So there'd be more moderate improvement there, but it's mostly SG&A. So we start seeing that leverage in a bigger way starting in Q1. And you'll continue to see leverage going forward.

I hope that you and your families are continuing to stay safe and healthy. 
Today, I'm going to unpack the quarter for you and then share our perspective on how the evolving consumer environment is shaping longer-term demand for our products. So let's get started. 
Building upon our impressive momentum at the end of last year, we're off to a strong start in Q1. We exceeded our expectations and saw broad-based strength across the portfolio. We will detail today, we believe our business is well positioned to continue to deliver strong results, both in the near and long term. The transformation we've undertaken over the past 5 years by following our Conagra Way playbook to perpetually shape our portfolio and capabilities for growth and better margins has proven critical in enabling us to respond to the changing dynamics in the current environment. Our modernized portfolio, commitment to innovate and agile culture have allowed us to respond to the increased consumer demand and changing preferences today and position us to deliver meaningful growth into the future. 
Our robust performance has also helped us to get ahead of our expected deleveraging cadence. As Dave will detail later, we expect to reach our net leverage ratio target of 3.5x to 3.6x by the third quarter of fiscal 2021. Paying down debt has been a capital allocation priority in recent quarters, but you also know that we are committed long-term to a balanced capital allocation approach, given our progress on deleveraging and because we remain confident in the long-term outlook for our business, our Board has increased our quarterly dividend by 29% to $1.10 on an annualized basis. And as I'll discuss more, we also continue to invest in the business. 
Our performance reflects the great work our team has accomplished during these challenging times. In particular, I want to recognize the thousands of hard-working Conagra team members on the front lines. Their extraordinary efforts in simultaneously keeping employees safe and maximizing our supply have made it possible for us to continue to meet the needs of our communities, customers and consumers, and I couldn't be prouder of them. 
Let's get into the business update. As the table on Slide 7 shows, our execution in the quarter enabled us to exceed our expectations across the board. We delivered organic net sales growth of 15%, adjusted operating margins of 20.2%, adjusted EPS of $0.70. We ended the quarter with a net leverage ratio of 3.7x compared to 4.0x at the end of Q4. 
During the first quarter, we continued to drive significant growth in each of our 3 retail segments. Total Conagra retail sales grew 12.9% year-over-year, driven by double-digit growth in snacks, frozen and staples. Importantly, our higher-margin nonpromoted volume contributed significantly to this growth. And not only did we grow at a great rate, we expanded our presence with consumers and gained share. We increased household penetration by 100 basis points and category share by 30 basis points. 
Slide 9 demonstrates how our investments in e-commerce over the last several years continued to yield results in the quarter. Strengthening our e-commerce capabilities has been an area of focus for us, and we're seeing the fruits of our labor. Our e-commerce retail sales have recently demonstrated impressive growth and over the past 5 quarters have consistently outpaced total industry e-commerce growth. 
First quarter also saw continued strong innovation momentum. Our steadfast commitment to the Conagra Way playbook has enabled us to consistently exceed our goal of having 15% of total retail sales each year coming from products launched within the past 3 years. And of course, as our overall sales continue to increase, this percentage of sales represents a larger absolute dollar amount. Even during these challenging times, we remain committed to delivering innovation to our customers and consumers. Our growth is rooted in innovation, and we are driving category performance. 
Slide 11 highlights 2 examples in big growth areas: frozen and snacks. Let's take a look at the frozen single-serve meals category. As compared to our fiscal '17, this category experienced a $575 million increase in retail sales during the 52-week period ended August 30. Our innovation in frozen single-serve meals over the past 3 years is unmistakable. We've generated almost 100% of that category's growth over the same period. We've applied this proven strategy to our snacks portfolio and are seeing similar category driving growth. Slim Jim has consistently gained share and has the top position in dollar sales for meat snack innovation. And to top it all off, our new Slim Jim Savage Stick has the #1 velocity in all meat snacks. Given this track record, our innovation's success has earned tremendous credibility with our customers. And our most recent slate of innovation is enabling us to further enhance that credibility. 
Slide 12 shows some of the highlights. Offerings packed with modern food attributes and bold on-trend flavors. Some of these began launching in Q4, and we're pleased with their early end market performance. We will continue to roll these out throughout the year. 
We're also excited about the innovation shown here on Slide 13. We're using our broad portfolio to extend high growth brands beyond their legacy forms. By leveraging our existing capabilities, we're extending Gardein and Healthy Choice into attractive categories with large profit pools, soups, jerky and salad dressing. And these 2 success stories are even going 1 step further, co-branding single-serve frozen meals. 
Slide 14 shows some examples of what else we have on deck for the balance of fiscal '21. Clearly, we are not slowing down on our innovation agenda. 
I'd now like to take a moment to touch on recent performance in our 3 domestic retail domains, starting with frozen. Slide 15 shows our impressive performance in total frozen during the quarter. This business is over $5 billion in annual retail sales, and it grew 13.5% in the quarter with double-digit growth in single-serve meals, multi-serve meals and plant-based meat alternatives. 
With respect to frozen vegetables, recall that last quarter, we were supply-constrained in Birds Eye. Demand was in excess of our available capacity, exacerbated by a brief plant shutdown to keep our employees safe and healthy. I'm pleased to report that during the first quarter, our Birds Eye plants are at full capacity, and as the quarter progressed, we qualified external manufacturers to supplement our capabilities. While our consumption in frozen vegetables grew 0.7% in the quarter, our shipments grew at a much faster rate as retailers started rebuilding inventories. Sitting here today, Birds Eye, which holds the #1 position in the category and has over twice the category share compared to the closest branded competitor, is very well positioned as we enter the important holiday season. 
Turning to snacks. Snacks business delivered another impressive quarter of growth, 14.6% versus the previous year and 22.7% on a 2-year basis. In meat snacks, we are working to maintain our growth and capabilities by investing in expanded capacity at our Troy, Ohio plant. To be clear, this investment is not a reaction to the near-term environment, but a decision made pre-COVID and rooted in our longer-term outlook for the business. 
Our meaningful staples results, as shown on Slide 17, demonstrate that this domain remains extremely relevant. Our staples business grew retail sales 11.6% year-over-year, with strong performance across our portfolio of iconic brands. 
I'd now like to turn to our perspective on the evolving environment and what we see going forward. While we hope and expect that the most acute and severe impact of COVID-19 is behind us, we believe that recent shifts in consumer behavior, coupled with macroeconomic trends suggest that at-home eating will remain elevated for some time. We also believe that we are very well positioned to capitalize on this opportunity. I'll unpack these points a bit more, but we see consumers experiencing and making lifestyle changes driven by COVID-19, and that suggests the arrival of a sustained shift in eating habits. 
We also know from prior recessions that an economic downturn typically leads to a permanent increase in at-home eating even when economic growth returns. These consumer trends affect everyone in our industry, but we believe that Conagra is uniquely positioned to benefit substantially from this environment. Our portfolio is well-developed in the eating occasions that have seen the most significant and sustained shift to at-home eating, and our portfolio delivers against the cooking behaviors that consumers are adopting. 
We're attracting more new buyers than our peers and consumers are choosing to stick with Conagra and come back for more. With our proven track record of innovation, we believe we will continue to attract new consumers and deliver food that meets their evolving needs. 
Let's drill down on some of the proof points that underpin these expectations. Starting with why we believe at-home heating will remain elevated. As you know, the vast majority of our sales are sourced from the United States. And unfortunately, the U.S. economy has been greatly affected by the pandemic. Unemployment in the U.S. remains high, the pace of new job growth is decelerating and many U.S. households have limited savings. To understand how this recession may impact American's eating habits going forward, we looked back at how behavior changed in the wake of the last recession. 
Slide 20 shows the percent of eating occasions that have been sourced at-home in the U.S. since 2007. As you can see, the '08 recession was a catalyst for a 200 basis point increase in at-home eating occasions from 80% to 82%, over the course of 4 years. Importantly, that rate held steady long after the recession ended, even when the economy returned to growth and employment hit record levels. With the COVID-19 disruption, we've already seen another 200 basis point increase to 84% in the 4 months from March to June 2020. History as a guide, the increased percentage of at-home eating occasions should persist even when economic growth returns. 
And as Slide 21 shows, as consumers are saving money in their food budgets, they are using their dollars and time differently. They're preparing to be at home for an extended period of time. Consumers are investing in their houses, their home gyms, their entertainment systems and their kitchens. 
In the chart on the right, you can see that consumers are also spending more time cooking. Data is showing that consumers are tackling more complex mediums. In other words, they're upgrading their culinary skills. We don't expect these upgrades to homes, at-home entertainment, kitchens and cooking skills to go away anytime soon. This all leads to 1 conclusion, more time at home. And as a result, more consumption of food at home. 
The pivot to remote work is also a meaningful development. The significant workplace disruption we've experienced over the past several months has given way to a new normal remote workforce. The chart on the left of Slide 22 shows how even baseline projections see office vacancies remaining elevated over the coming years. Furthermore, on the right, we can see how remote workforce adoption has significantly increased. More working from home means more lunch is eaten at home and real opportunity for a portfolio like ours. And while we're well past the initial spike of stocked up behavior when COVID first emerged in the U.S. in March, at-home eating occasions have remained elevated, even increasing over the most recent 2 weeks of data. 
As the chart on Slide 23 shows, we're continuing to see a double-digit percent increase in total industry sales at retail versus the prior year. During our first quarter, food and beverage industry sales rose an impressive 14%. While we don't know exactly how these growth rates will trend going forward, we do know that we're entering the cold and flu season and that winter weather could limit the appeal of outdoor restaurant dining in many parts of the country. All of these factors give us reason to believe that the elevated levels of at-home eating should persist. We also believe that Conagra is uniquely positioned to benefit. 
Let's start with Slide 24. Total at-home meals have increased almost 6% in the 3 months ending July 2020, that's almost 7 billion meals. When you take a closer look at this growth by daypart, the increases in meals and dollars are skewing toward lunch and dinner. And as you know, Conagra is well-developed in both of these dayparts. The chart on the right shows that, in fact, our portfolio overindexes in dinner and is almost at parity for lunch compared to the overall mix. And whether a consumer wants to cook from scratch to put those newly developed culinary skills to the test or heat-and-eat, Conagra's diverse portfolio can deliver a solution for every need in every daypart. So we are very well positioned for when and how people are eating more at home. 
On Slide 25, you can see the benefits. Over 80% of our categories have been growing in line or faster than the industry. And as I mentioned earlier, we've been gaining share within those categories. 
This is further demonstrated by Slide 26, which shows we're attracting new buyers at a faster rate than any of our peers. 
Slide 27 shows that the buyers we're attracting overindexed to the coveted millennial and Gen X generations. As you might expect, we're seeing substantial millennial expansion in frozen but just as importantly, we're seeing their expansion in snacks and staples as well. Because of this, we're creating the groundwork for future growth above the category and above our peers. We're attracting younger generations and building superior consumer lifetime value. And not only are more consumers trying our product, they're liking them and coming back for more. Take a look at the chart on Slide 28. New trier repeat rates for our consumers, whose first trial was in March or April, have remained steady at above 50%. That stickiness can be seen further in the chart on Slide 29. 
Not only are repeat rates sustaining, but the depth of repeat is improving. More consumers are choosing to repurchase a Conagra product 2 or more times compared to where we were a year ago. When you compare us to our peers, we are at the front of the pack. 
Slide 30 shows that we rank above nearly all of our peers in the total percentage of repeat purchasers, demonstrating the improved stickiness of our brand loyalty. 
So in summary, executing our disciplined Conagra Way playbook over the last 5 years has grown our portfolio, grown our capabilities and positioned us to meet the evolving needs of our consumers, while earning the confidence of our customers. We believe that at-home eating will remain elevated for some time as consumers seek affordable and convenient meals that meet the needs of their new normal. And we are confident that Conagra is well positioned to see sustained benefit. And with that, I'll turn it over to Dave."
26893,686424270,2106037,"Conagra Brands, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 01, 2020",2020-10-01,"Earnings Calls","Conagra Brands, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Sean, and good morning, everyone. I'll walk through our first quarter financial performance and outlook before opening the line for questions. Let's look at the P&L highlights for the quarter, which are captured on Slide 33. As Sean discussed, w",1677,"Thanks, Sean, and good morning, everyone. I'll walk through our first quarter financial performance and outlook before opening the line for questions. 
Let's look at the P&L highlights for the quarter, which are captured on Slide 33. As Sean discussed, we started fiscal '21 on a strong note. Elevated demand across our retail segments, coupled with effective execution, enabled us to exceed expectations for net sales, profitability, free cash flow and deleveraging. Compared to the same period a year ago, net sales and organic net sales for the first quarter were up 12.1% and 15%, respectively. Adjusted gross margin increased 244 basis points to 30.7%. Adjusted operating margin increased 450 basis points versus the same period a year ago, reaching 20.2% for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA increased 34.5% to $647 million. And adjusted EPS increased 62.8% to $0.70, exceeding our first quarter guidance. 
Slide 34 outlines the drivers of our first quarter net sales versus the same period a year ago. As you can see, the 15% increase in organic net sales was driven by a double-digit increase in volume as well as favorable impacts from price mix. Favorable pricing and sales mix both contributed to the growth in the quarter. Price/mix also included a benefit of approximately 70 basis points from a favorable change in estimate associated with a prior period trade expense accrual. The organic net sales increase more than offset headwinds from divestitures and foreign exchange. As we pointed out in the past, the impact from divestitures continues to diminish sequentially as we anniversary the divestiture closing dates. Including the impact of the recently announced divestiture of HK Anderson, the full year impact of divestitures is expected to approximate 100 basis points. 
Turning to Slide 35. You'll find a summary of net sales by segment for the first quarter. We saw continued strong growth in each of the company's 3 retail segments on both a reported and organic basis. The net sales increase was primarily driven by consumers increasing their at-home food consumption as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which benefited our 3 retail segments, but negatively impacted the Foodservice segment. 
In the quarter, our Grocery & Snacks segment reported organic net sales growth of 20.7%. This segment benefited as consumers continue to purchase convenient, shelf-stable products to enhance their at-home eating experience. Segment growth in shipments this quarter exceeded growth in consumption as retailers began rebuilding inventories on brands such as Hunts, PAM, Duncan Hines and Vlasic. 
The Refrigerated & Frozen segment also experienced strong growth in the quarter. The 19% increase in organic net sales is a testament to our innovation and modernization efforts and the role our portfolio plays in meeting the needs of today's consumers. This segment also experienced shipment growth greater than consumption growth in the quarter, primarily as a result of Birds Eye. As Sean mentioned, we increased capacity in frozen vegetables during the quarter, enabling retailers to start replenishing their inventories. The International segment's 13.1% organic net sales growth came in stronger than we forecasted, with each of the segment's regions posting growth higher than projected, primarily from COVID-related demand. 
Our Foodservice segment reported a 20.3% organic net sales decline, primarily driven by a volume decrease of 24.2% due to lower restaurant traffic. This marks an improvement from last quarter as some restaurant traffic began to rebound. 
Slide 36 outlines the drivers of the 450 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion in the first quarter. Our margin levers, such as realized productivity, price/mix, operating leverage and synergies drove a 610 basis point increase in the quarter. The specific drivers of this increase are: supply chain realized productivity of 290 basis points, price/mix of 250 basis points, cost of goods sold synergies of 90 basis points and operating leverage of 60 basis points. Also, the net impact of divestitures, FX and other items negatively impacted operating margin by 80 basis points. 
Cost of goods sold inflation was approximately 3.1% in the quarter, which negatively impacted gross margin by 220 basis points. We incurred approximately $34 million in cost of goods sold directly related to our COVID-19 response, which negatively impacted gross margin by 150 basis points. Our A&P rate was favorable by 20 basis points in the quarter due to the favorable sales leverage. As on a dollar basis, we spent approximately the same amount as last year's first quarter. 
Finally, our SG&A rate was favorable by 190 basis points. Approximately 160 basis points was related to the combination of fixed cost leverage on higher net sales and reduced spending related to COVID-19 as employees worked from home and did not travel. The remaining 30 basis point improvement was driven by synergies, partially offset by normal SG&A inflation and increases in stock-based compensation expense. 
We have certainly seen a margin benefit driven by the current environment. But it's also clear to see that we have made great progress improving the underlying operating margin of the business. 
Slide 37 shows our adjusted operating profit and margin summary by segment in the first quarter. Our total company adjusted operating profit increased 44.2% to $541 million in the quarter. Importantly, all 4 of our segments reported margin expansion in the quarter. These results demonstrate the tremendous operating margin improvement in our domestic retail and International segments. While the Foodservice segment saw a decline in operating profit dollars, the segment reported a 28 basis point increase in adjusted operating margin. This was aided by lower inventory write-offs and less trade spending in the quarter. 
Slide 38 highlights that our adjusted EPS increased 62.8% to $0.70 in the quarter, primarily driven by the increase in adjusted operating profit associated with the net sales increase and margin expansion. 
Turning to Slide 39. You will see a summary of our synergy capture since the close of the Pinnacle Foods acquisition in fiscal '19. After exceeding our fiscal '20 goal of $180 million, we have continued our strong synergy progress in the beginning of fiscal '21. In Q1, we captured an incremental $35 million in savings, bringing total cumulative synergies through the end of the first quarter to $219 million. To date, the majority of our synergies have been in SG&A, and we expect the majority of the remaining synergies to be reflected in cost of goods sold. We're very pleased with our progress and are confident that we will continue to deliver on our commitment. 
Slide 40 shows the strong progress we've made to improve our balance sheet and cash flow. From the close of the Pinnacle acquisition in the second quarter of fiscal '19 through the end of the first quarter of fiscal '21, we have reduced total gross debt by more than $1.9 billion, resulting in total net debt of $9.2 billion. 
As of the end of the first quarter, our net leverage ratio was 3.7x, down from 4x at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal '20. Given our income, we are confident in our ability to achieve our targeted leverage ratio of 3.5 to 3.6x by the third quarter of fiscal '21. In addition, we remain committed to solid investment-grade credit ratings. 
Also, our cash flow remains very strong. In the first quarter, our cash flow from operating activities increased $78 million or 37% compared to the prior year. At the same time, we increased our investment in the business by increasing CapEx by $39 million or 36%. Supply chain investments and cost savings and capacity projects made up most of our year-over-year spend as we continue to optimize our network and drive brand growth. This has led to our free cash flow increasing $39 million, 38% to last year's first quarter. As a result of our strong cash flows and progress reducing debt, we have greater financial flexibility to both invest in the business and return cash to shareholders. This, coupled with consistent successful execution of our strategic priorities and our ongoing confidence in the long-term strength of the business, led our Board to approve a 29% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.275 per share or $1.10 per share on an annualized basis. This action is consistent with our commitment to maintaining a balanced approach to capital allocation. As we return cash to shareholders, we are also increasing our investments in the business as evidenced by the 36% increase in Q1 CapEx I just mentioned. 
Turning to Slide 42. You will find a summary of our outlook. As you've heard both Sean and me shared this morning, we believe there is much to look forward to in the quarters ahead. However, the dynamics surrounding COVID-19 continue to make forecasting with specificity a challenge. What we can share is that we anticipate a continuation of elevated retail demand throughout the second quarter. We are, therefore, providing second quarter guidance, as noted in the release and on this slide. 
We expect organic net sales growth of plus 6% to plus 8% in the second quarter. We expect adjusted operating margin in the second quarter to be in the range of 18% to 18.5%. Relative to Q1 operating margin, we expect less operating leverage benefit and we expect to increase our marketing support, both above the line and below the line. We believe there are opportunities to increase brand building investments where capacity permits. Given these operating margin factors, along with expected improvement in below-the-line items. We expect to deliver second quarter adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations in the range of $0.70 to $0.74. We expect to reach our leverage target of 3.5 to 3.6x by the third quarter of this fiscal year. Of course, our ability to achieve these targets assumes continued performance end-to-end by our supply chain. 
Finally, we are reaffirming all of our fiscal '22 targets this morning. Note that the impact of the HK Anderson divestiture is small enough that we will not be adjusting our fiscal '22 EPS targets for the divestiture. Thanks for listening, everyone. That concludes my remarks. I'll now pass it to the operator to open it up for questions."

Andrew, let me give you some big picture perspective on how we think about this and then we can talk a little bit about the year ago period because I think it's important that you all understand what we intend to do, what we do not intend to do and why. 
First off, before we ever contemplate an increase in our brand-building investments, 2 simple things have to be in place: one, the capacity to supply new demand generation; and two, evidence of a strong ROI. Now on this latter ROI point, there are 2 types of investments where the evidence is quite strong regarding ROI, investments to increase consumer awareness around our new innovations and investments to further build out our e-commerce business. So on new innovation, awareness, think of it this way, it's the precursor to trial. We do great at trial, but you got and it repeat, but you've got to get that awareness in place. So as you saw in the data, our repeat performance has been stumped. 
On e-commerce, we've learned that what we get out of it is directly a function of what we put into it. We've also learned, though, that speed in supporting the business is very important because it enables you to build a beachhead in the e-tailing universe that helps us fuel future purchases. So if we were to see this opportunity, someone else would build that beachhead. But overall, I'd say we believe that supporting innovation and e-commerce undoubtedly maximizes long-term value because it maximizes consumer penetration, which then converts to loyalty. But let's keep things in perspective about the level of support we're talking about. As you know, our A&P is very hard working, but it's also very, very efficient. And the rate has hovered around 2% over the last year or so, working synergistically with our retailer investments. So that's been our playbook. It works, and we will continue to do it. 
In this coming quarter, the spend is likely to be a bit higher than Q1 because we have more capacity and because it's usually higher in Q2 than Q1 because it's the holiday season. And as the stores get crowded around holidays, we want to win at the point of purchase and we know that if we create awareness, the rest will take care of itself, which sets up a good back half and a good fiscal '22. 
In terms of flow through to the year, as you know, we're not guiding to the year. And the reason for that today is the same as the reason a year ago, which is we're trying to manage this unpredictable environment quarter-to-quarter. We don't know what the back half will give us so the key thing for us right now is keeping people healthy and keeping our plants running because if we can't do that, obviously, it puts a limit on our ability to drive revenue, which then converts to profit. So we're just navigating this quarter-by-quarter right now."

What I will say is that our realized productivity programs and supply chain are tracking very well. Our synergy capture, which is a big part of our margin improvement is on track and continues to be on track, and we're confident that will continue. So when you look at those items and you compare to inflation and you strip it out at a high level, we're seeing improvement in core operating margin performance as we expected to pre-COVID. So I'm not going to give you an exact number, but generally, I feel like we're on track and the pinnacle synergies was an important part of that improvement."

That began to rebuild in the quarter, which obviously will lead to shipments being ahead of consumption. But the net takeaway in terms of absolute status of inventories in trade right now is it's still larger than it is historically in terms of days on hand. That's both because not every single category is flushed with capacity on the supply side, but also because the takeaway is higher. So when the pull-through is more -- your days on hand drops.

So the supply constraints that you're seeing on Birds Eye are not just those that we've had in terms of our ability to manufacture but it's also some retailers prioritizing, preserving holiday inventory above, call it, late summer inventory. Because as you can imagine, when consumers go to buy their Thanksgiving dinner and vegetables, and they can't get what they want, that becomes a very emotional, a very negative emotional event, and we don't want that nor do our retailers."

On the sales side of that, your 1% to 2% CAGR, if I flatline the back half of the year, I've got to take 2022 organic sales down 9%-or-so to get that multiyear CAGR down to 1% to 2%.

The difference between Q1 and sort of the midpoint of the 2Q guide is about 150 basis points lower. That difference between Q1 and Q2 is roughly split among investments in A&P, in above-the-line investments in merchandising and slotting, and then growth focused, cost of goods sold investments to support our innovation and capital investment.

In terms of supply chain, remember, it's the end-to-end supply chain. So it's not just our manufacturing, it's our co-mans, but it's also our suppliers. So to the extent that certain regions get hit with COVID, and then there's impacts on labor, it impacts the entire supply chain. And so we're on that every day, every hour of every day, making sure that we understand kind of where we are with demand and then where we are with supply. We're manufacturing full out at all our manufacturing locations, and we're really working closely with our suppliers to make sure we understand where they are with their lead times on ingredients and packaging and all the things that are critical for us to be able to make a finished product. So Sean, anything?"

I think everyone would agree it's working well now. But I think that a lot of investors watching your story from the outside and watching other CPG companies lean into today's demand with more elevated A&P investment carry some concerns about your top line having any more headwinds when the music stops on at-home demand, so to speak. And I appreciate everything you said about demand staying elevated for longer potentially. But I guess it's important to -- from what I hear to address that concern head on because it's a question for would be investors who like what you're doing on the innovation, on the trial and near-term repeat fronts, but are more concerned about your brand equity is being strong enough going forward to cement long-term loyalty."

My consistent encouragement to investors is to think about our brand-building work holistically. It starts with the design of the product and the packages, and then it includes all the investments we make to create a connection between our consumer and the brands. Some of that connection happens in the grocery store. Some of it -- a lot of it happens on their phone or on their computer or digitally. All of it works together. But a big piece of our first investment in how we get sustained growth is in designing the right products and the right packages. If you look at the single-serve frozen meal slide that I shared today, we are now multiple years into reinnovating that category. And it started with major investments in the food quality and the packaging. And then on top of that, we layered investments in A&P and investment with our retailers. And when we got to year 1 of our success there, the question we got is, how are you going to wrap this? What's going to happen in year 2 when your competition sees this and they emulate you and you've got difficult comps? Well, now we've done it year after year after year, and we've retained just about 100% of the category growth in that space, which suggests that all the investments we make holistically in brand building from product to package to retailer investments to A&P works very hard and is driving sustained performance. 
What sometimes strips people up is they get accustomed to seeing thinking that all brand building resides on the A&P line, and that a good rate of A&P, which is kind of an artifact of the industry from the past is a 4% rate or something like that. If you dig deep within most of the companies that have had those kinds of rates, what you find is an extraordinary amount of  nonworking dollars and then working dollars that are still used against traditional tools like inline TV media, things like that. We are far beyond those days, and we've purged out that inefficient spend, and we've converted the old analog spend to heavily digital. And what we find is when we put that profile together, and we do it with the work we do with retailers in store, which, by the way, as you know, is not just deep discounting, that's not really the Conagra playbook anymore, it has been very successful for us. 
With respect to taking that investment up in any given COVID window, it kind of depends upon what brand we're talking about because the last thing that would make sense would be to be spending a bunch of A&P on a brand that we're short on supply, and we're not doing that. But what we've said in the call earlier today is if we have available capacity and if we have evidence of good ROI, we'll absolutely increase the spend. So if you look at the average, it doesn't tell you much on some brands, the rate is much higher than that, and those are brands usually where we get tremendous responsiveness, and we have available capacity."

Today, I'm going to unpack the quarter for you and then share our pers",2510,"Thanks, Brian. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our first quarter fiscal 2021 earnings call. I hope that you and your families are continuing to stay safe and healthy. Today, I'm going to unpack the quarter for you and then share our perspective on how the evolving consumer environment is shaping longer-term demand for our products. So let's get started. 
Building upon our impressive momentum at the end of last year, we're off to a strong start in Q1. We exceeded our expectations and saw broad-based strength across the portfolio. We will detail today we believe our business is well positioned to continue to deliver strong results, both in the near and long term. 
The transformation we've undertaken over the past 5 years by following our Conagra Way playbook to perpetually reshape our portfolio and capabilities for growth and better margins has proven critical in enabling us to respond to the changing dynamics in the current environment. Our modernized portfolio, commitment to innovate and agile culture have allowed us to respond to the increased consumer demand and changing preferences today and position us to deliver meaningful growth into the future. 
Our robust performance has also helped us to get ahead of our expected deleveraging cadence. As Dave will detail later, we expect to reach our net leverage ratio target of 3.5x to 3.6x by the third quarter of fiscal 2021. 
Paying down debt has been a capital allocation priority in recent quarters, but you also know that we are committed long-term to a balanced capital allocation approach. Given our progress on deleveraging and because we remain confident in the long-term outlook for our business, our Board has increased our quarterly dividend by 29% to $1.10 on an annualized basis. And as I'll discuss more, we also continue to invest in the business. 
Our performance reflects the great work our team has accomplished during these challenging times. In particular, I want to recognize the thousands of hard-working Conagra team members on the front lines. Their extraordinary efforts in simultaneously keeping employees safe and maximizing our supplies have made it possible for us to continue to meet the needs of our communities, customers and consumers, and I couldn't be prouder of them. 
Let's get into the business update. As the table on Slide 7 shows, our execution in the quarter enabled us to exceed our expectations across the board. We delivered organic net sales growth of 15%, adjusted operating margins of 20.2%, adjusted EPS of $0.70. We ended the quarter with a net leverage ratio of 3.7x compared to 4.0x at the end of Q4. 
During the first quarter, we continued to drive significant growth in each of our 3 retail segments. Total Conagra retail sales grew 12.9% year-over-year, driven by double-digit growth in snacks, frozen and staples. Importantly, our higher-margin, nonpromoted volume contributed significantly to this growth. And not only did we grow at a great rate, we expanded our presence with consumers and gained share. We increased household penetration by 100 basis points and category share by 30 basis points. 
Slide 9 demonstrates how our investments in e-commerce over the last several years continued to yield results in the quarter. Strengthening our e-commerce capabilities has been an area of focus for us, and we're seeing the fruits of our labor. Our e-commerce retail sales have recently demonstrated impressive growth and, over the past 5 quarters, have consistently outpaced total industry e-commerce growth. 
First quarter also saw continued strong innovation momentum. Our steadfast commitment to the Conagra Way playbook has enabled us to consistently exceed our goal of having 15% of total retail sales each year coming from products launched within the past 3 years. And of course, as our overall sales continue to increase, this percentage of sales represents a larger absolute dollar amount. Even during these challenging times, we remain committed to delivering innovation to our customers and consumers. Our growth is rooted in innovation, and we are driving category performance. 
Slide 11 highlights 2 examples in big growth areas: frozen and snacks. Let's take a look at the frozen single-serve meals category. As compared to our fiscal '17, this category experienced a $575 million increase in retail sales during the 52-week period ended August 30. Our innovation in frozen single-serve meals over the past 3 years is unmistakable. We've generated almost 100% of that category's growth over the same period. 
We've applied this proven strategy to our snacks portfolio and are seeing similar category-driving growth. Slim Jim has consistently gained share and has the top position in dollar sales for meat snack innovation. And to top it all off, our new Slim Jim Savage stick has the #1 velocity in all meat snacks. Given this track record, our innovation success has earned tremendous credibility with our customers. 
And our most recent slate of innovation is enabling us to further enhance that credibility. Slide 12 shows some of the highlights, offerings packed with modern food attributes and bold on-trend flavors. Some of these began launching in Q4, and we're pleased with their early end-market performance. We will continue to roll these out throughout the year. 
We're also excited about the innovations shown here on Slide 13. We're using our broad portfolio to extend high-growth brands beyond their legacy forms. By leveraging our existing capabilities, we're extending Gardein and Healthy Choice into attractive categories with large profit pools: soups, jerky and salad dressing. And these 2 success stories are even going 1 step further, co-branding single-serve frozen meals. 
Slide 14 shows some examples of what else we have on deck for the balance of fiscal '21. Clearly, we are not slowing down on our innovation agenda. 
I'd now like to take a moment to touch on recent performance in our 3 domestic retail domains, starting with frozen. Slide 15 shows our impressive performance in total frozen during the quarter. This business is over $5 billion in annual retail sales, and it grew 13.5% in the quarter, with double-digit growth in single-serve meals, multi-serve meals and plant-based meat alternatives. 
With respect to frozen vegetables, recall that last quarter, we were supply-constrained in Birds Eye. Demand was in excess of our available capacity, exacerbated by a brief plant shutdown to keep our employees safe and healthy. I'm pleased to report that during the first quarter, our Birds Eye plants are at full capacity and, as the quarter progressed, we qualified external manufacturers to supplement our capabilities. 
While our consumption in frozen vegetables grew 0.7% in the quarter, our shipments grew at a much faster rate as retailers started rebuilding inventories. Sitting here today, Birds Eye, which holds the #1 position in the category and has over twice the category share compared to the closest branded competitor, is very well positioned as we enter the important holiday season. 
Turning to snacks. Snacks business delivered another impressive quarter of growth, 14.6% versus the previous year and 22.7% on a 2-year basis. In meat snacks, we are working to maintain our growth and capabilities by investing in expanded capacity at our Troy, Ohio plant. To be clear, this investment is not a reaction to the near-term environment, but a decision made pre-COVID and rooted in our longer-term outlook for the business. 
Our meaningful staples results, as shown on Slide 17, demonstrate that this domain remains extremely relevant. Our staples business grew retail sales 11.6% year-over-year, with strong performance across our portfolio of iconic brands. 
I'd now like to turn to our perspective on the evolving environment and what we see going forward. While we hope and expect that the most acute and severe impact of COVID-19 is behind us, we believe that recent shifts in consumer behavior, coupled with macroeconomic trends, suggest that at-home eating will remain elevated for some time. We also believe that we are very well positioned to capitalize on this opportunity. 
I'll unpack these points a little bit more, but we see consumers experiencing and making lifestyle changes, driven by COVID-19, that suggests the arrival of a sustained shift in eating habits. We also know from prior recessions that an economic downturn typically leads to a permanent increase in at-home eating, even when economic growth returns. These consumer trends affect everyone in our industry, but we believe that Conagra is uniquely positioned to benefit substantially from this environment. 
Our portfolio is well-developed in the eating occasions that have seen the most significant and sustained shift to at-home eating, and our portfolio delivers against the cooking behaviors that consumers are adopting. We're attracting more new buyers than our peers, and consumers are choosing to stick with Conagra and come back for more. With our proven track record of innovation, we believe we will continue to attract new consumers and deliver food that meets their evolving needs. 
Let's drill down on some of the proof points that underpin these expectations, starting with why we believe at-home eating will remain elevated. As you know, the vast majority of our sales are sourced from the United States. And unfortunately, the U.S. economy has been greatly affected by the pandemic. Unemployment in the U.S. remains high, the pace of new job growth is decelerating and many U.S. households have limited savings. To understand how this recession may impact Americans' eating habits going forward, we looked back at how behavior changed in the wake of the last recession. 
Slide 20 shows the percent of eating occasions that have been sourced at-home in the U.S. since 2007. As you can see, the '08 recession was a catalyst for a 200 basis point increase in at-home eating occasions, from 80% to 82% over the course of 4 years. Importantly, that rate held steady long after the recession ended, even when the economy returned to growth and employment hit record levels. 
With the COVID-19 disruption, we've already seen another 200 basis point increase to 84% in the 4 months from March to June 2020. History as a guide, the increased percentage of at-home eating occasions should persist even when economic growth returns. 
And as Slide 21 shows, as consumers are saving money in their food budgets, they are using their dollars and time differently. They're preparing to be at home for an extended period of time. Consumers are investing in their houses, their home gyms, their entertainment systems and their kitchens. 
In the chart on the right, you can see that consumers are also spending more time cooking. Data is showing that consumers are tackling more complex mediums. In other words, they're upgrading their culinary skills. We don't expect these upgrades to homes, at-home entertainment, kitchens and cooking skills to go away anytime soon. This all leads to 1 conclusion: more time at home and, as a result, more consumption of food at home. 
The pivot to remote work is also a meaningful development. The significant workplace disruption we've experienced over the past several months has given way to a new normal remote workforce. The chart on the left of Slide 22 shows how even baseline projections see office vacancies remaining elevated over the coming years. Furthermore, on the right, we can see how remote workforce adoption has significantly increased. 
More working from home means more lunch is eaten at home and real opportunity for a portfolio like ours. And while we're well past the initial spike of stock-up behavior when COVID first emerged in the U.S. in March, at-home eating occasions have remained elevated, even increasing over the most recent 2 weeks of data. 
As the chart on Slide 23 shows, we're continuing to see a double-digit percent increase in total industry sales at retail versus the prior year. During our first quarter, food and beverage industry sales rose an impressive 14%. While we don't know exactly how these growth rates will trend going forward, we do know that we're entering the cold and flu season and that winter weather could limit the appeal of outdoor restaurant dining in many parts of the country. All of these factors give us reason to believe that the elevated levels of at-home eating should persist. We also believe that Conagra is uniquely positioned to benefit. 
Let's start with Slide 24. Total at-home meals have increased almost 6% in the 3 months ending July 2020, that's almost 7 billion meals. When you take a closer look at this growth by daypart, the increases in meals and dollars are skewing toward lunch and dinner. And as you know, Conagra is well-developed in both of these dayparts. 
The chart on the right shows that, in fact, our portfolio overindexes in dinner and is almost at parity for lunch compared to the overall mix. And whether a consumer wants to cook from scratch to put those newly developed culinary skills to the test, or heat and eat, Conagra's diverse portfolio can deliver a solution for every need in every daypart. So we are very well positioned for when and how people are eating more at home. 
On Slide 25, you can see the benefits. Over 80% of our categories have been growing in line or faster than the industry. And as I mentioned earlier, we've been gaining share within those categories. This is further demonstrated by Slide 26, which shows we're attracting new buyers at a faster rate than any of our peers. 
Slide 27 shows that the buyers we're attracting overindexed to the coveted millennial and Gen X generations. As you might expect, we're seeing substantial millennial expansion in frozen but, just as importantly, we're seeing their expansion in snacks and staples as well. 
Because of this, we're creating the groundwork for future growth above the category and above our peers. We're attracting younger generations and building superior consumer lifetime value. And not only are more consumers trying our products, they're liking them and coming back for more. 
Take a look at the chart on Slide 28. New trier repeat rates for our consumers, whose first trial was in March or April, have remained steady at above 50%. 
That stickiness can be seen further in the chart on Slide 29. Not only are repeat rates sustaining, but the depth of repeat is improving. More consumers are choosing to repurchase a Conagra product 2 or more times compared to where we were a year ago. 
When you compare us to our peers, we are at the front of the pack. Slide 30 shows that we rank above nearly all of our peers in the total percentage of repeat purchasers, demonstrating the improved stickiness of our brand loyalty. 
So in summary, executing our disciplined Conagra Way playbook over the last 5 years has grown our portfolio, grown our capabilities and positioned us to meet the evolving needs of our consumers, while earning the confidence of our customers. We believe that at-home eating will remain elevated for some time as consumers seek affordable and convenient meals that meet the needs of their new normal.

I'll walk through our first quarter financial performance and outlook before opening the line for questions. Let's look at the P&L highlights for the quarter, which are captured on Slide 33. As Sean discussed, w",1675,"Thanks, Sean, and good morning, everyone. I'll walk through our first quarter financial performance and outlook before opening the line for questions. 
Let's look at the P&L highlights for the quarter, which are captured on Slide 33. As Sean discussed, we started fiscal '21 on a strong note. Elevated demand across our retail segments, coupled with effective execution, enabled us to exceed expectations for net sales, profitability, free cash flow and deleveraging. 
Compared to the same period a year ago, net sales and organic net sales for the first quarter were up 12.1% and 15%, respectively. Adjusted gross margin increased 244 basis points to 30.7%. Adjusted operating margin increased 450 basis points versus the same period a year ago, reaching 20.2% for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA increased 34.5% to $647 million. And adjusted EPS increased 62.8% to $0.70, exceeding our first quarter guidance. 
Slide 34 outlines the drivers of our first quarter net sales versus the same period a year ago. As you can see, the 15% increase in organic net sales was driven by a double-digit increase in volume as well as favorable impacts from price/mix. Favorable pricing and sales mix both contributed to the growth in the quarter. Price/mix also included a benefit of approximately 70 basis points from a favorable change in estimate associated with a prior period trade expense accrual. 
The organic net sales increase more than offset headwinds from divestitures and foreign exchange. As we pointed out in the past, the impact from divestitures continues to diminish sequentially as we anniversary the divestiture closing dates. Including the impact of the recently announced divestiture of HK Anderson, the full year impact of divestitures is expected to approximate 100 basis points. 
Turning to Slide 35. You'll find a summary of net sales by segment for the first quarter. We saw continued strong growth in each of the company's 3 retail segments on both a reported and organic basis. The net sales increase was primarily driven by consumers increasing their at-home food consumption as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which benefited our 3 retail segments but negatively impacted the Foodservice segment. 
In the quarter, our Grocery & Snacks segment reported organic net sales growth of 20.7%. This segment benefited as consumers continue to purchase convenient, shelf-stable products to enhance their at-home eating experience. Segment growth in shipments this quarter exceeded growth in consumption as retailers began rebuilding inventories on brands such as Hunt's, PAM, Duncan Hines and Vlasic. 
The Refrigerated & Frozen segment also experienced strong growth in the quarter. The 19% increase in organic net sales is a testament to our innovation and modernization efforts and the role our portfolio plays in meeting the needs of today's consumers. This segment also experienced shipment growth greater than consumption growth in the quarter, primarily as a result of Birds Eye. As Sean mentioned, we increased capacity in frozen vegetables during the quarter, enabling retailers to start replenishing their inventories. 
The International segment's 13.1% organic net sales growth came in stronger than we forecasted, with each of the segment's regions posting growth higher than projected, primarily from COVID-related demand. Our Foodservice segment reported a 20.3% organic net sales decline, primarily driven by a volume decrease of 24.2% due to lower restaurant traffic. This marks an improvement from last quarter as some restaurant traffic began to rebound. 
Slide 36 outlines the drivers of the 450 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion in the first quarter. Our margin levers, such as realized productivity, price/mix, operating leverage and synergies drove a 610 basis point increase in the quarter. The specific drivers of this increase are: supply chain realized productivity of 290 basis points, price/mix of 250 basis points, cost of goods sold synergy of 90 basis points and operating leverage of 60 basis points. Also, the net impact of divestitures, FX and other items negatively impacted operating margin by 80 basis points. 
Cost of goods sold inflation was approximately 3.1% in the quarter, which negatively impacted gross margin by 220 basis points. We incurred approximately $34 million in cost of goods sold directly related to our COVID-19 response, which negatively impacted gross margin by 150 basis points. Our A&P rate was favorable by 20 basis points in the quarter due to the favorable sales leverage. As on a dollar basis, we spent approximately the same amount as last year's first quarter. 
Finally, our SG&A rate was favorable by 190 basis points. Approximately 160 basis points was related to the combination of fixed cost leverage on higher net sales and reduced spending related to COVID-19 as employees worked from home and did not travel. The remaining 30 basis point improvement was driven by synergies, partially offset by normal SG&A inflation and increases in stock-based compensation expense. 
We have certainly seen a margin benefit driven by the current environment. But it's also clear to see that we have made great progress improving the underlying operating margin of the business. 
Slide 37 shows our adjusted operating profit and margin summary by segment in the first quarter. Our total company adjusted operating profit increased 44.2% to $541 million in the quarter. Importantly, all 4 of our segments reported margin expansion in the quarter. 
These results demonstrate the tremendous operating margin improvement in our domestic retail and International segments. While the Foodservice segment saw a decline in operating profit dollars, the segment reported a 28 basis point increase in adjusted operating margin. This was aided by lower inventory write-offs and less trade spending in the quarter. 
Slide 38 highlights that our adjusted EPS increased 62.8% to $0.70 in the quarter, primarily driven by the increase in adjusted operating profit associated with the net sales increase and margin expansion. 
Turning to Slide 39. You will see a summary of our synergy capture since the close of the Pinnacle Foods acquisition in fiscal '19. After exceeding our fiscal '20 goal of $180 million, we have continued our strong synergy progress in the beginning of fiscal '21. 
In Q1, we captured an incremental $35 million in savings, bringing total cumulative synergies through the end of the first quarter to $219 million. To date, the majority of our synergies have been in SG&A, and we expect the majority of the remaining synergies to be reflected in cost of goods sold. We're very pleased with our progress and are confident that we will continue to deliver on our commitment. 
Slide 40 shows the strong progress we've made to improve our balance sheet and cash flow. From the close of the Pinnacle acquisition in the second quarter of fiscal '19 through the end of the first quarter of fiscal '21, we have reduced total gross debt by more than $1.9 billion, resulting in total net debt of $9.2 billion. 
As of the end of the first quarter, our net leverage ratio was 3.7x, down from 4x at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal '20. Given our income, we are confident in our ability to achieve our targeted leverage ratio of 3.5 to 3.6x by the third quarter of fiscal '21. In addition, we remain committed to solid investment-grade credit ratings. 
Also, our cash flow remains very strong. In the first quarter, our cash flow from operating activities increased $78 million or 37% compared to the prior year. At the same time, we increased our investment in the business by increasing CapEx by $39 million or 36%. Supply chain investments and cost savings and capacity projects made up most of our year-over-year spend as we continue to optimize our network and drive brand growth. This has led to our free cash flow increasing $39 million, 38% to last year's first quarter. 
As a result of our strong cash flows and progress reducing debt, we have greater financial flexibility to both invest in the business and return cash to shareholders. This, coupled with consistent successful execution of our strategic priorities and our ongoing confidence in the long-term strength of the business, led our Board to approve a 29% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.275 per share or $1.10 per share on an annualized basis. This action is consistent with our commitment to maintaining a balanced approach to capital allocation. As we return cash to shareholders, we are also increasing our investments in the business, as evidenced by the 36% increase in Q1 CapEx I just mentioned. 
Turning to Slide 42. You will find a summary of our outlook. As you've heard both Sean and me share this morning, we believe there is much to look forward to in the quarters ahead. However, the dynamics surrounding COVID-19 continue to make forecasting with specificity a challenge. What we can share is that we anticipate a continuation of elevated retail demand throughout the second quarter. We are, therefore, providing second quarter guidance, as noted in the release and on this slide. 
We expect organic net sales growth of plus 6% to plus 8% in the second quarter. We expect adjusted operating margin in the second quarter to be in the range of 18% to 18.5%. Relative to Q1 operating margin, we expect less operating leverage benefit, and we expect to increase our marketing support, both above the line and below the line. We believe there are opportunities to increase brand-building investments where capacity permits. 
Given these operating margin factors, along with expected improvement in below-the-line items, we expect to deliver second quarter adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations in the range of $0.70 to $0.74. We expect to reach our leverage target of 3.5 to 3.6x by the third quarter of this fiscal year. Of course, our ability to achieve these targets assumes continued performance end-to-end by our supply chain. 
Finally, we are reaffirming all of our fiscal '22 targets this morning. Note that the impact of the HK Anderson divestiture is small enough that we will not be adjusting our fiscal '22 EPS targets for the divestiture. 
Thanks for listening, everyone. That concludes my remarks. I'll now pass it to the operator to open it up for questions."

Andrew, let me give you some big-picture perspective on how we think about this and then we can talk a little bit about the year ago period because I think it's important that you all understand what we intend to do, what we do not intend to do and w",501,"Yes. Andrew, let me give you some big-picture perspective on how we think about this and then we can talk a little bit about the year ago period because I think it's important that you all understand what we intend to do, what we do not intend to do and why. 
First off, before we ever contemplate an increase in our brand-building investments, 2 simple things have to be in place: one, the capacity to supply new demand generation; and two, evidence of a strong ROI. Now on this latter ROI point, there are 2 types of investments where the evidence is quite strong regarding ROI: investments to increase consumer awareness around our new innovations and investments to further build out our e-commerce business. 
So on new innovation, awareness, think of it this way, it's the precursor to trial. We do great at trial, but you got -- and it repeats, but you've got to get that awareness in place. So as you saw in the data, our repeat performance has been stumped. On e-commerce, we've learned that what we get out of it is directly a function of what we put into it. We've also learned, though, that speed in supporting the business is very important because it enables you to build a beachhead in the e-tailing universe that helps us fuel future purchases. 
So if we were to seed this opportunity, someone else would build that beachhead. But overall, I'd say, we believe that supporting innovation and e-commerce undoubtedly maximizes long-term value because it maximizes consumer penetration, which then converts to loyalty. 
But let's keep things in perspective about the level of support we're talking about. As you know, our A&P is very hardworking, but it's also very, very efficient. And the rate has hovered around 2% over the last year or so, working synergistically with our retailer investments. So that's been our playbook. It works, and we will continue to do it. 
In this coming quarter, the spend is likely to be a bit higher than Q1 because we have more capacity and because it's usually higher in Q2 than Q1 because it's the holiday season. And as the stores get crowded around holidays, we want to win at the point of purchase. And we know that if we create awareness, the rest will take care of itself, which sets up a good back half and a good fiscal '22. 
In terms of flow-through to the year, as you know, we're not guiding to the year. And the reason for that today is the same as the reason a year ago, which is we're trying to manage this unpredictable environment quarter-to-quarter. We don't know what the back half will give us. 
So the key thing for us right now is keeping people healthy and keeping our plants running because if we can't do that, obviously, it puts a limit on our ability to drive revenue, which then converts to profit. So we're just navigating this quarter-by-quarter right now."

Dave, I appreciate you mention that operating leverage added only 60 basis points to the margin this quarter. It's a bit less than I might have expected, but maybe your mix was also helped by the load or maybe you're just using so many co-packers, the benefits of the margin from higher volume just wasn't that big.

What I will say is that our realized productivity programs and supply chain are tracking very well. Our synergy capture, which is a big part of our margin improvement, is on track and continues to be on track, and we're confident that will continue. 
So when you look at those items and you compare to inflation and you strip it out at a high level, we're seeing improvement in core operating margin performance as we expected to pre-COVID. So I'm not going to give you an exact number but, generally, I feel like we're on track, and the Pinnacle synergies was an important part of that improvement."

Let me just recharacterize, too, the shipment perspective from Q1 because I would think -- I want you to think of it a little bit differently than some of the language you used. I would characterize it as a partial replenishment. We exited Q4 with retailer inventories highly depleted, way below kind of normalized levels in terms of stock on hand. That began to rebuild in the quarter, which obviously will lead to shipments being ahead of consumption. 
But the net takeaway in terms of absolute status of inventories in trade right now is it's still larger than it is historically in terms of days on hand. That's both because not every single category is flushed with capacity on the supply side, but also because the takeaway is higher. So when the pull-through is more -- your days on hand drops. So that's how I want you guys to think about the retail inventory dynamics."

And it is very, very important to retailers to have vegetable inventory during the holidays. 
So the supply constraints that you're seeing on Birds Eye are not just those that we've had in terms of our ability to manufacture, but it's also some retailers prioritizing, preserving holiday inventory above, call it, late summer inventory.

I think, at CAGNY, we said over 80% of it was a digital spend. So that spans everything from e-commerce investments to digital, social advertising, working direct-to-consumer messaging, all of that stuff. 
And so we've hovered, historically, over the last number of quarters about 2%. This last quarter, we were below that because we were supply-constrained, and it didn't make sense to pour more A&P on top of a supply constraint.

So if you look at the Q2 guide for operating margin versus where we came in at Q1 at 20.2%, let me give you kind of a few pieces here that will help you also on the marketing investment. 
So first, the trade change in estimate, that's about 40 basis points. So if you take that out, because that's a benefit to the first quarter, that's just going to stay for the year. The difference between Q1 and sort of the midpoint of the 2Q guide is about 150 basis points lower. 
That difference between Q1 and Q2 is roughly split among investments in A&P, in above-the-line investments in merchandising and slotting and then growth-focused, cost of goods sold investments to support our innovation and capital investments. So that's of the 150 basis points that kind of splits into those buckets. 
So the Q2 A&P level will be up versus Q1. It will be more consistent with the level that we saw Q2 a year ago for A&P."

So we've made very good progress on our deleveraging, getting ahead of our expectations there. It's not as if we feel pressure such that we would ever liquidate an asset below its intrinsic value.

I'd tell you, Chris, back when this all hit in March, April, I would have thought more customers would have wanted to delay some of the new innovations. But given our track record and given, especially in frozen and snacks, the way our innovation has driven category growth and the way we've really accounted for almost all of the share in some of our key categories in terms of growth, that demand from customers for our new innovation remained extremely strong. 
So a lot of our products have been going out the door. We've got more yet to go out the door. And the performance of those products in marketplace have been strong. So we've been doing a combination to maximize supply of SKU rationalization, where it makes sense to do so, on brands like Chef Boyardee, so we can maximize the volume we're putting out there. 
But at the same time, we've been very strong on innovation, and it has been working. So that's strictly a function of how well our innovation does in terms of velocities in the marketplace. We've got, if you look at some velocities, just new stuff that we've got out there, like Duncan Hines is a brand we don't always talk about, we've got these new keto-friendly cups. And this is brand-new, and it's already got the #1 dollar velocity SKU in that segment. 
Our Slim Jim products, the velocity is just crushing it. Our Slim Jim Savage initiative is the #1 velocity in all meat snacks, and it's been the #2 velocity in all snacks overall in the last 13 weeks. So these new products are not only going out the door, they are really performing."

As we look going forward, we estimate that, that overall inflation rate is going to come down more to kind of the low to mid-2% if you look going forward. 
As you mentioned, there have been increases in spot rates for freight. Freight's about 10% of our overall cost of goods sold, but it's a very small piece of our business because we contract for our freight. So clearly going to be an impact, but on an overall weighted basis, we think it's manageable. And we have other favorability that we can offset that. 
Yes, in terms of supply chain, remember, it's the end-to-end supply chain. So it's not just our manufacturing, it's our co-mans, but it's also our suppliers. So to the extent that certain regions get hit with COVID and then there's impacts on labor, it impacts the entire supply chain. 
And so we're on that every day, every hour of every day, making sure that we understand kind of where we are with demand and then where we are with supply. We're manufacturing full out at all our manufacturing locations, and we're really working closely with our suppliers to make sure we understand where they are with their lead times on ingredients and packaging and all the things that are critical for us to be able to make a finished product.

But I think that a lot of investors watching your story from the outside and watching other CPG companies lean in to today's demand with more elevated A&P investment, carry some concerns about your top line having more headwinds when the music stops on at-home demand, so to speak. 
And I appreciate everything you said about demand staying elevated for longer, potentially, but I guess it's important to -- from what I hear, to address that concern head-on because it's a question for would-be investors who like what you're doing on the innovation, on the trial and near-term repeat fronts but are more concerned about your brand equity as being strong enough going forward to cement long-term loyalty."

My consistent encouragement to investors is to think about our brand-building work holistically. It starts with the design of the product and the packages, and then it includes all the investments we make to create a connection between our consumer and the brands. Some of that connection happens in the grocery store. Some of it -- a lot of it happens on their phone or on their computer or digitally. All of it works together. 
But a big piece of our first investment and how we get sustained growth is in designing the right products and the right packages. If you look at the single-serve frozen meal slide that I shared today, we are now multiple years into reinnovating that category. And it started with major investments in the food quality and the packaging. And then on top of that, we layered investments in A&P and investment with our retailers. 
And when we got to year 1 of our success there, the question we got is, how are you going to wrap this? What's going to happen in year 2 when your competition sees this and they emulate you and you've got difficult comps? Well, now we've done it year after year after year, and we've retained just about 100% of the category growth in that space, which suggests that all the investments we make holistically in brand building, from product to package to retailer investments to A&P, works very hard and is driving sustained performance. 
What sometimes strips people up is they get accustomed to seeing -- thinking that all brand building resides on the A&P line. And that a good rate of A&P, which is kind of an artifact of the industry from the past, is a 4% rate or something like that. If you dig deep within most of the companies that have had those kinds of rates, what you find is an extraordinary amount of nonworking dollars and then working dollars that are still used against traditional tools like in-line TV media, things like that. 
We are far beyond those days, and we've purged out that inefficient spend, and we've converted the old analog spend to heavily digital. And what we find is when we put that profile together, and we do it with the work we do with retailers in store, which, by the way, as you know, is not just deep discounting, that's not really the Conagra playbook anymore, it has been very successful for us. 
With respect to taking that investment up in any given COVID window, it kind of depends upon what brand we're talking about because the last thing that would make sense would be to be spending a bunch of A&P on a brand that we're short on supply, and we're not doing that. But what we've said in the call earlier today is if we have available capacity and if we have evidence of good ROI, we'll absolutely increase the spend. So if you look at the average and it doesn't tell you much on some brands, the rate is much higher than that. And those are brands usually where we get tremendous responsiveness, and we have available capacity."

I hope that you and your families are continuing to stay safe and healthy. Today, I'm going to unpack the quarter for you and then share our perspective on how the evolving consumer environment is shaping longer-term demand for our products. So let's get started. 
Building upon our impressive momentum at the end of last year, we're off to a strong start in Q1. We exceeded our expectations and saw broad-based strength across the portfolio. We will detail today we believe our business is well positioned to continue to deliver strong results, both in the near and long term. 
The transformation we've undertaken over the past 5 years by following our Conagra Way playbook to perpetually reshape our portfolio and capabilities for growth and better margins has proven critical in enabling us to respond to the changing dynamics in the current environment. Our modernized portfolio, commitment to innovate and agile culture have allowed us to respond to the increased consumer demand and changing preferences today and position us to deliver meaningful growth into the future. 
Our robust performance has also helped us to get ahead of our expected deleveraging cadence. As Dave will detail later, we expect to reach our net leverage ratio target of 3.5x to 3.6x by the third quarter of fiscal 2021. 
Paying down debt has been a capital allocation priority in recent quarters, but you also know that we are committed long-term to a balanced capital allocation approach. Given our progress on deleveraging and because we remain confident in the long-term outlook for our business, our Board has increased our quarterly dividend by 29% to $1.10 on an annualized basis. And as I'll discuss more, we also continue to invest in the business. 
Our performance reflects the great work our team has accomplished during these challenging times. In particular, I want to recognize the thousands of hard-working Conagra team members on the front lines. Their extraordinary efforts in simultaneously keeping employees safe and maximizing our supplies have made it possible for us to continue to meet the needs of our communities, customers and consumers, and I couldn't be prouder of them. 
Let's get into the business update. As the table on Slide 7 shows, our execution in the quarter enabled us to exceed our expectations across the board. We delivered organic net sales growth of 15%, adjusted operating margins of 20.2%, adjusted EPS of $0.70. We ended the quarter with a net leverage ratio of 3.7x compared to 4.0x at the end of Q4. 
During the first quarter, we continued to drive significant growth in each of our 3 retail segments. Total Conagra retail sales grew 12.9% year-over-year, driven by double-digit growth in snacks, frozen and staples. Importantly, our higher-margin, nonpromoted volume contributed significantly to this growth. And not only did we grow at a great rate, we expanded our presence with consumers and gained share. We increased household penetration by 100 basis points and category share by 30 basis points. 
Slide 9 demonstrates how our investments in e-commerce over the last several years continued to yield results in the quarter. Strengthening our e-commerce capabilities has been an area of focus for us, and we're seeing the fruits of our labor. Our e-commerce retail sales have recently demonstrated impressive growth and, over the past 5 quarters, have consistently outpaced total industry e-commerce growth. 
First quarter also saw continued strong innovation momentum. Our steadfast commitment to the Conagra Way playbook has enabled us to consistently exceed our goal of having 15% of total retail sales each year coming from products launched within the past 3 years. And of course, as our overall sales continue to increase, this percentage of sales represents a larger absolute dollar amount. Even during these challenging times, we remain committed to delivering innovation to our customers and consumers. Our growth is rooted in innovation, and we are driving category performance. 
Slide 11 highlights 2 examples in big growth areas: frozen and snacks. Let's take a look at the frozen single-serve meals category. As compared to our fiscal '17, this category experienced a $575 million increase in retail sales during the 52-week period ended August 30. Our innovation in frozen single-serve meals over the past 3 years is unmistakable. We've generated almost 100% of that category's growth over the same period. 
We've applied this proven strategy to our snacks portfolio and are seeing similar category-driving growth. Slim Jim has consistently gained share and has the top position in dollar sales for meat snack innovation. And to top it all off, our new Slim Jim Savage stick has the #1 velocity in all meat snacks. Given this track record, our innovation success has earned tremendous credibility with our customers. 
And our most recent slate of innovation is enabling us to further enhance that credibility. Slide 12 shows some of the highlights, offerings packed with modern food attributes and bold on-trend flavors. Some of these began launching in Q4, and we're pleased with their early end-market performance. We will continue to roll these out throughout the year. 
We're also excited about the innovations shown here on Slide 13. We're using our broad portfolio to extend high-growth brands beyond their legacy forms. By leveraging our existing capabilities, we're extending Gardein and Healthy Choice into attractive categories with large profit pools: soups, jerky and salad dressing. And these 2 success stories are even going 1 step further, co-branding single-serve frozen meals. 
Slide 14 shows some examples of what else we have on deck for the balance of fiscal '21. Clearly, we are not slowing down on our innovation agenda. 
I'd now like to take a moment to touch on recent performance in our 3 domestic retail domains, starting with frozen. Slide 15 shows our impressive performance in total frozen during the quarter. This business is over $5 billion in annual retail sales, and it grew 13.5% in the quarter, with double-digit growth in single-serve meals, multi-serve meals and plant-based meat alternatives. 
With respect to frozen vegetables, recall that last quarter, we were supply-constrained in Birds Eye. Demand was in excess of our available capacity, exacerbated by a brief plant shutdown to keep our employees safe and healthy. I'm pleased to report that during the first quarter, our Birds Eye plants are at full capacity and, as the quarter progressed, we qualified external manufacturers to supplement our capabilities. 
While our consumption in frozen vegetables grew 0.7% in the quarter, our shipments grew at a much faster rate as retailers started rebuilding inventories. Sitting here today, Birds Eye, which holds the #1 position in the category and has over twice the category share compared to the closest branded competitor, is very well positioned as we enter the important holiday season. 
Turning to snacks. Snacks business delivered another impressive quarter of growth, 14.6% versus the previous year and 22.7% on a 2-year basis. In meat snacks, we are working to maintain our growth and capabilities by investing in expanded capacity at our Troy, Ohio plant. To be clear, this investment is not a reaction to the near-term environment, but a decision made pre-COVID and rooted in our longer-term outlook for the business. 
Our meaningful staples results, as shown on Slide 17, demonstrate that this domain remains extremely relevant. Our staples business grew retail sales 11.6% year-over-year, with strong performance across our portfolio of iconic brands. 
I'd now like to turn to our perspective on the evolving environment and what we see going forward. While we hope and expect that the most acute and severe impact of COVID-19 is behind us, we believe that recent shifts in consumer behavior, coupled with macroeconomic trends, suggest that at-home eating will remain elevated for some time. We also believe that we are very well positioned to capitalize on this opportunity. 
I'll unpack these points a little bit more, but we see consumers experiencing and making lifestyle changes, driven by COVID-19, that suggests the arrival of a sustained shift in eating habits. We also know from prior recessions that an economic downturn typically leads to a permanent increase in at-home eating, even when economic growth returns. These consumer trends affect everyone in our industry, but we believe that Conagra is uniquely positioned to benefit substantially from this environment. 
Our portfolio is well-developed in the eating occasions that have seen the most significant and sustained shift to at-home eating, and our portfolio delivers against the cooking behaviors that consumers are adopting. We're attracting more new buyers than our peers, and consumers are choosing to stick with Conagra and come back for more. With our proven track record of innovation, we believe we will continue to attract new consumers and deliver food that meets their evolving needs. 
Let's drill down on some of the proof points that underpin these expectations, starting with why we believe at-home eating will remain elevated. As you know, the vast majority of our sales are sourced from the United States. And unfortunately, the U.S. economy has been greatly affected by the pandemic. Unemployment in the U.S. remains high, the pace of new job growth is decelerating and many U.S. households have limited savings. To understand how this recession may impact Americans' eating habits going forward, we looked back at how behavior changed in the wake of the last recession. 
Slide 20 shows the percent of eating occasions that have been sourced at-home in the U.S. since 2007. As you can see, the '08 recession was a catalyst for a 200 basis point increase in at-home eating occasions, from 80% to 82% over the course of 4 years. Importantly, that rate held steady long after the recession ended, even when the economy returned to growth and employment hit record levels. 
With the COVID-19 disruption, we've already seen another 200 basis point increase to 84% in the 4 months from March to June 2020. History as a guide, the increased percentage of at-home eating occasions should persist even when economic growth returns. 
And as Slide 21 shows, as consumers are saving money in their food budgets, they are using their dollars and time differently. They're preparing to be at home for an extended period of time. Consumers are investing in their houses, their home gyms, their entertainment systems and their kitchens. 
In the chart on the right, you can see that consumers are also spending more time cooking. Data is showing that consumers are tackling more complex mediums. In other words, they're upgrading their culinary skills. We don't expect these upgrades to homes, at-home entertainment, kitchens and cooking skills to go away anytime soon. This all leads to 1 conclusion: more time at home and, as a result, more consumption of food at home. 
The pivot to remote work is also a meaningful development. The significant workplace disruption we've experienced over the past several months has given way to a new normal remote workforce. The chart on the left of Slide 22 shows how even baseline projections see office vacancies remaining elevated over the coming years. Furthermore, on the right, we can see how remote workforce adoption has significantly increased. 
More working from home means more lunch is eaten at home and real opportunity for a portfolio like ours. And while we're well past the initial spike of stock-up behavior when COVID first emerged in the U.S. in March, at-home eating occasions have remained elevated, even increasing over the most recent 2 weeks of data. 
As the chart on Slide 23 shows, we're continuing to see a double-digit percent increase in total industry sales at retail versus the prior year. During our first quarter, food and beverage industry sales rose an impressive 14%. While we don't know exactly how these growth rates will trend going forward, we do know that we're entering the cold and flu season and that winter weather could limit the appeal of outdoor restaurant dining in many parts of the country. All of these factors give us reason to believe that the elevated levels of at-home eating should persist. We also believe that Conagra is uniquely positioned to benefit. 
Let's start with Slide 24. Total at-home meals have increased almost 6% in the 3 months ending July 2020, that's almost 7 billion meals. When you take a closer look at this growth by daypart, the increases in meals and dollars are skewing toward lunch and dinner. And as you know, Conagra is well-developed in both of these dayparts. 
The chart on the right shows that, in fact, our portfolio overindexes in dinner and is almost at parity for lunch compared to the overall mix. And whether a consumer wants to cook from scratch to put those newly developed culinary skills to the test, or heat and eat, Conagra's diverse portfolio can deliver a solution for every need in every daypart. So we are very well positioned for when and how people are eating more at home. 
On Slide 25, you can see the benefits. Over 80% of our categories have been growing in line or faster than the industry. And as I mentioned earlier, we've been gaining share within those categories. This is further demonstrated by Slide 26, which shows we're attracting new buyers at a faster rate than any of our peers. 
Slide 27 shows that the buyers we're attracting overindexed to the coveted millennial and Gen X generations. As you might expect, we're seeing substantial millennial expansion in frozen but, just as importantly, we're seeing their expansion in snacks and staples as well. 
Because of this, we're creating the groundwork for future growth above the category and above our peers. We're attracting younger generations and building superior consumer lifetime value. And not only are more consumers trying our products, they're liking them and coming back for more. 
Take a look at the chart on Slide 28. New trier repeat rates for our consumers, whose first trial was in March or April, have remained steady at above 50%. 
That stickiness can be seen further in the chart on Slide 29. Not only are repeat rates sustaining, but the depth of repeat is improving. More consumers are choosing to repurchase a Conagra product 2 or more times compared to where we were a year ago. 
When you compare us to our peers, we are at the front of the pack. Slide 30 shows that we rank above nearly all of our peers in the total percentage of repeat purchasers, demonstrating the improved stickiness of our brand loyalty. 
So in summary, executing our disciplined Conagra Way playbook over the last 5 years has grown our portfolio, grown our capabilities and positioned us to meet the evolving needs of our consumers, while earning the confidence of our customers. We believe that at-home eating will remain elevated for some time as consumers seek affordable and convenient meals that meet the needs of their new normal. And we are confident that Conagra is well positioned to see sustained benefit. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Dave."

I'll walk through our first quarter financial performance and outlook before opening the line for questions. Let's look at the P&L highlights for the quarter, which are captured on Slide 33. As Sean discussed, w",1675,"Thanks, Sean, and good morning, everyone. I'll walk through our first quarter financial performance and outlook before opening the line for questions. 
Let's look at the P&L highlights for the quarter, which are captured on Slide 33. As Sean discussed, we started fiscal '21 on a strong note. Elevated demand across our retail segments, coupled with effective execution, enabled us to exceed expectations for net sales, profitability, free cash flow and deleveraging. 
Compared to the same period a year ago, net sales and organic net sales for the first quarter were up 12.1% and 15%, respectively. Adjusted gross margin increased 244 basis points to 30.7%. Adjusted operating margin increased 450 basis points versus the same period a year ago, reaching 20.2% for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA increased 34.5% to $647 million. And adjusted EPS increased 62.8% to $0.70, exceeding our first quarter guidance. 
Slide 34 outlines the drivers of our first quarter net sales versus the same period a year ago. As you can see, the 15% increase in organic net sales was driven by a double-digit increase in volume as well as favorable impacts from price/mix. Favorable pricing and sales mix both contributed to the growth in the quarter. Price/mix also included a benefit of approximately 70 basis points from a favorable change in estimate associated with a prior period trade expense accrual. 
The organic net sales increase more than offset headwinds from divestitures and foreign exchange. As we pointed out in the past, the impact from divestitures continues to diminish sequentially as we anniversary the divestiture closing dates. Including the impact of the recently announced divestiture of HK Anderson, the full year impact of divestitures is expected to approximate 100 basis points. 
Turning to Slide 35. You'll find a summary of net sales by segment for the first quarter. We saw continued strong growth in each of the company's 3 retail segments on both a reported and organic basis. The net sales increase was primarily driven by consumers increasing their at-home food consumption as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which benefited our 3 retail segments but negatively impacted the Foodservice segment. 
In the quarter, our Grocery & Snacks segment reported organic net sales growth of 20.7%. This segment benefited as consumers continue to purchase convenient, shelf-stable products to enhance their at-home eating experience. Segment growth in shipments this quarter exceeded growth in consumption as retailers began rebuilding inventories on brands such as Hunt's, PAM, Duncan Hines and Vlasic. 
The Refrigerated & Frozen segment also experienced strong growth in the quarter. The 19% increase in organic net sales is a testament to our innovation and modernization efforts and the role our portfolio plays in meeting the needs of today's consumers. This segment also experienced shipment growth greater than consumption growth in the quarter, primarily as a result of Birds Eye. As Sean mentioned, we increased capacity in frozen vegetables during the quarter, enabling retailers to start replenishing their inventories. 
The International segment's 13.1% organic net sales growth came in stronger than we forecasted, with each of the segment's regions posting growth higher than projected, primarily from COVID-related demand. Our Foodservice segment reported a 20.3% organic net sales decline, primarily driven by a volume decrease of 24.2% due to lower restaurant traffic. This marks an improvement from last quarter as some restaurant traffic began to rebound. 
Slide 36 outlines the drivers of the 450 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion in the first quarter. Our margin levers, such as realized productivity, price/mix, operating leverage and synergies drove a 610 basis point increase in the quarter. The specific drivers of this increase are: supply chain realized productivity of 290 basis points, price/mix of 250 basis points, cost of goods sold synergy of 90 basis points and operating leverage of 60 basis points. Also, the net impact of divestitures, FX and other items negatively impacted operating margin by 80 basis points. 
Cost of goods sold inflation was approximately 3.1% in the quarter, which negatively impacted gross margin by 220 basis points. We incurred approximately $34 million in cost of goods sold directly related to our COVID-19 response, which negatively impacted gross margin by 150 basis points. Our A&P rate was favorable by 20 basis points in the quarter due to the favorable sales leverage. As on a dollar basis, we spent approximately the same amount as last year's first quarter. 
Finally, our SG&A rate was favorable by 190 basis points. Approximately 160 basis points was related to the combination of fixed cost leverage on higher net sales and reduced spending related to COVID-19 as employees worked from home and did not travel. The remaining 30 basis point improvement was driven by synergies, partially offset by normal SG&A inflation and increases in stock-based compensation expense. 
We have certainly seen a margin benefit driven by the current environment. But it's also clear to see that we have made great progress improving the underlying operating margin of the business. 
Slide 37 shows our adjusted operating profit and margin summary by segment in the first quarter. Our total company adjusted operating profit increased 44.2% to $541 million in the quarter. Importantly, all 4 of our segments reported margin expansion in the quarter. 
These results demonstrate the tremendous operating margin improvement in our domestic retail and International segments. While the Foodservice segment saw a decline in operating profit dollars, the segment reported a 28 basis point increase in adjusted operating margin. This was aided by lower inventory write-offs and less trade spending in the quarter. 
Slide 38 highlights that our adjusted EPS increased 62.8% to $0.70 in the quarter, primarily driven by the increase in adjusted operating profit associated with the net sales increase and margin expansion. 
Turning to Slide 39. You will see a summary of our synergy capture since the close of the Pinnacle Foods acquisition in fiscal '19. After exceeding our fiscal '20 goal of $180 million, we have continued our strong synergy progress in the beginning of fiscal '21. 
In Q1, we captured an incremental $35 million in savings, bringing total cumulative synergies through the end of the first quarter to $219 million. To date, the majority of our synergies have been in SG&A, and we expect the majority of the remaining synergies to be reflected in cost of goods sold. We're very pleased with our progress and are confident that we will continue to deliver on our commitment. 
Slide 40 shows the strong progress we've made to improve our balance sheet and cash flow. From the close of the Pinnacle acquisition in the second quarter of fiscal '19 through the end of the first quarter of fiscal '21, we have reduced total gross debt by more than $1.9 billion, resulting in total net debt of $9.2 billion. 
As of the end of the first quarter, our net leverage ratio was 3.7x, down from 4x at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal '20. Given our income, we are confident in our ability to achieve our targeted leverage ratio of 3.5 to 3.6x by the third quarter of fiscal '21. In addition, we remain committed to solid investment-grade credit ratings. 
Also, our cash flow remains very strong. In the first quarter, our cash flow from operating activities increased $78 million or 37% compared to the prior year. At the same time, we increased our investment in the business by increasing CapEx by $39 million or 36%. Supply chain investments and cost savings and capacity projects made up most of our year-over-year spend as we continue to optimize our network and drive brand growth. This has led to our free cash flow increasing $39 million, 38% to last year's first quarter. 
As a result of our strong cash flows and progress reducing debt, we have greater financial flexibility to both invest in the business and return cash to shareholders. This, coupled with consistent successful execution of our strategic priorities and our ongoing confidence in the long-term strength of the business, led our Board to approve a 29% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.275 per share or $1.10 per share on an annualized basis. This action is consistent with our commitment to maintaining a balanced approach to capital allocation. As we return cash to shareholders, we are also increasing our investments in the business, as evidenced by the 36% increase in Q1 CapEx I just mentioned. 
Turning to Slide 42. You will find a summary of our outlook. As you've heard both Sean and me share this morning, we believe there is much to look forward to in the quarters ahead. However, the dynamics surrounding COVID-19 continue to make forecasting with specificity a challenge. What we can share is that we anticipate a continuation of elevated retail demand throughout the second quarter. We are, therefore, providing second quarter guidance, as noted in the release and on this slide. 
We expect organic net sales growth of plus 6% to plus 8% in the second quarter. We expect adjusted operating margin in the second quarter to be in the range of 18% to 18.5%. Relative to Q1 operating margin, we expect less operating leverage benefit, and we expect to increase our marketing support, both above the line and below the line. We believe there are opportunities to increase brand-building investments where capacity permits. 
Given these operating margin factors, along with expected improvement in below-the-line items, we expect to deliver second quarter adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations in the range of $0.70 to $0.74. We expect to reach our leverage target of 3.5 to 3.6x by the third quarter of this fiscal year. Of course, our ability to achieve these targets assumes continued performance end-to-end by our supply chain. 
Finally, we are reaffirming all of our fiscal '22 targets this morning. Note that the impact of the HK Anderson divestiture is small enough that we will not be adjusting our fiscal '22 EPS targets for the divestiture. 
Thanks for listening, everyone. That concludes my remarks. I'll now pass it to the operator to open it up for questions."

So the shipments above consumption in the first quarter were clearly just getting the inventory levels back to the days of supply that they're looking for. 
As we sit here -- as we ended Q1 and we sit here today, retailer days of supply are still below historic levels. So when you look at shipping above consumption, it wasn't now we're sitting here with heavy retailer inventories, we're still below historic averages. So it was a catch-up from where inventory levels were at the end of Q4."

Andrew, let me give you some big-picture perspective on how we think about this and then we can talk a little bit about the year ago period because I think it's important that you all understand what we intend to do, what we do not intend to do and why. 
First off, before we ever contemplate an increase in our brand-building investments, 2 simple things have to be in place: one, the capacity to supply new demand generation; and two, evidence of a strong ROI. Now on this latter ROI point, there are 2 types of investments where the evidence is quite strong regarding ROI: investments to increase consumer awareness around our new innovations and investments to further build out our e-commerce business. 
So on new innovation, awareness, think of it this way, it's the precursor to trial. We do great at trial, but you got -- and it repeats, but you've got to get that awareness in place. So as you saw in the data, our repeat performance has been stumped. On e-commerce, we've learned that what we get out of it is directly a function of what we put into it. We've also learned, though, that speed in supporting the business is very important because it enables you to build a beachhead in the e-tailing universe that helps us fuel future purchases. 
So if we were to seed this opportunity, someone else would build that beachhead. But overall, I'd say, we believe that supporting innovation and e-commerce undoubtedly maximizes long-term value because it maximizes consumer penetration, which then converts to loyalty. 
But let's keep things in perspective about the level of support we're talking about. As you know, our A&P is very hardworking, but it's also very, very efficient. And the rate has hovered around 2% over the last year or so, working synergistically with our retailer investments. So that's been our playbook. It works, and we will continue to do it. 
In this coming quarter, the spend is likely to be a bit higher than Q1 because we have more capacity and because it's usually higher in Q2 than Q1 because it's the holiday season. And as the stores get crowded around holidays, we want to win at the point of purchase. And we know that if we create awareness, the rest will take care of itself, which sets up a good back half and a good fiscal '22. 
In terms of flow-through to the year, as you know, we're not guiding to the year. And the reason for that today is the same as the reason a year ago, which is we're trying to manage this unpredictable environment quarter-to-quarter. We don't know what the back half will give us. 
So the key thing for us right now is keeping people healthy and keeping our plants running because if we can't do that, obviously, it puts a limit on our ability to drive revenue, which then converts to profit. So we're just navigating this quarter-by-quarter right now."

Dave, I appreciate you mention that operating leverage added only 60 basis points to the margin this quarter.

What I will say is that our realized productivity programs and supply chain are tracking very well. Our synergy capture, which is a big part of our margin improvement, is on track and continues to be on track, and we're confident that will continue. 
So when you look at those items and you compare to inflation and you strip it out at a high level, we're seeing improvement in core operating margin performance as we expected to pre-COVID. So I'm not going to give you an exact number but, generally, I feel like we're on track, and the Pinnacle synergies was an important part of that improvement."

Let me just recharacterize, too, the shipment perspective from Q1 because I would think -- I want you to think of it a little bit differently than some of the language you used. I would characterize it as a partial replenishment. We exited Q4 with retailer inventories highly depleted, way below kind of normalized levels in terms of stock on hand. That began to rebuild in the quarter, which obviously will lead to shipments being ahead of consumption. 
But the net takeaway in terms of absolute status of inventories in trade right now is it's still larger than it is historically in terms of days on hand. That's both because not every single category is flushed with capacity on the supply side, but also because the takeaway is higher. So when the pull-through is more -- your days on hand drops.

And it is very, very important to retailers to have vegetable inventory during the holidays. 
So the supply constraints that you're seeing on Birds Eye are not just those that we've had in terms of our ability to manufacture, but it's also some retailers prioritizing, preserving holiday inventory above, call it, late summer inventory.

That difference between Q1 and Q2 is roughly split among investments in A&P, in above-the-line investments in merchandising and slotting and then growth-focused, cost of goods sold investments to support our innovation and capital investments.

I'd tell you, Chris, back when this all hit in March, April, I would have thought more customers would have wanted to delay some of the new innovations. But given our track record and given, especially in frozen and snacks, the way our innovation has driven category growth and the way we've really accounted for almost all of the share in some of our key categories in terms of growth, that demand from customers for our new innovation remained extremely strong. 
So a lot of our products have been going out the door. We've got more yet to go out the door. And the performance of those products in marketplace have been strong. So we've been doing a combination to maximize supply of SKU rationalization, where it makes sense to do so, on brands like Chef Boyardee, so we can maximize the volume we're putting out there. 
But at the same time, we've been very strong on innovation, and it has been working. So that's strictly a function of how well our innovation does in terms of velocities in the marketplace. We've got, if you look at some velocities, just new stuff that we've got out there, like Duncan Hines is a brand we don't always talk about, we've got these new keto-friendly cups. And this is brand-new, and it's already got the #1 dollar velocity SKU in that segment. 
Our Slim Jim products, the velocity is just crushing it. Our Slim Jim Savage initiative is the #1 velocity in all meat snacks, and it's been the #2 velocity in all snacks overall in the last 13 weeks. So these new products are not only going out the door, they are really performing."

As we look going forward, we estimate that, that overall inflation rate is going to come down more to kind of the low to mid-2% if you look going forward. 
As you mentioned, there have been increases in spot rates for freight. Freight's about 10% of our overall cost of goods sold, but it's a very small piece of our business because we contract for our freight. So clearly going to be an impact, but on an overall weighted basis, we think it's manageable. And we have other favorability that we can offset that. 
Yes, in terms of supply chain, remember, it's the end-to-end supply chain. So it's not just our manufacturing, it's our co-mans, but it's also our suppliers. So to the extent that certain regions get hit with COVID and then there's impacts on labor, it impacts the entire supply chain. 
And so we're on that every day, every hour of every day, making sure that we understand kind of where we are with demand and then where we are with supply. We're manufacturing full out at all our manufacturing locations, and we're really working closely with our suppliers to make sure we understand where they are with their lead times on ingredients and packaging and all the things that are critical for us to be able to make a finished product.

I think everyone would agree it's working well now. But I think that a lot of investors watching your story from the outside and watching other CPG companies lean in to today's demand with more elevated A&P investment, carry some concerns about your top line having more headwinds when the music stops on at-home demand, so to speak. 
And I appreciate everything you said about demand staying elevated for longer, potentially, but I guess it's important to -- from what I hear, to address that concern head-on because it's a question for would-be investors who like what you're doing on the innovation, on the trial and near-term repeat fronts but are more concerned about your brand equity as being strong enough going forward to cement long-term loyalty."

My consistent encouragement to investors is to think about our brand-building work holistically. It starts with the design of the product and the packages, and then it includes all the investments we make to create a connection between our consumer and the brands. Some of that connection happens in the grocery store. Some of it -- a lot of it happens on their phone or on their computer or digitally. All of it works together. 
But a big piece of our first investment and how we get sustained growth is in designing the right products and the right packages. If you look at the single-serve frozen meal slide that I shared today, we are now multiple years into reinnovating that category. And it started with major investments in the food quality and the packaging. And then on top of that, we layered investments in A&P and investment with our retailers. 
And when we got to year 1 of our success there, the question we got is, how are you going to wrap this? What's going to happen in year 2 when your competition sees this and they emulate you and you've got difficult comps? Well, now we've done it year after year after year, and we've retained just about 100% of the category growth in that space, which suggests that all the investments we make holistically in brand building, from product to package to retailer investments to A&P, works very hard and is driving sustained performance. 
What sometimes strips people up is they get accustomed to seeing -- thinking that all brand building resides on the A&P line. And that a good rate of A&P, which is kind of an artifact of the industry from the past, is a 4% rate or something like that. If you dig deep within most of the companies that have had those kinds of rates, what you find is an extraordinary amount of nonworking dollars and then working dollars that are still used against traditional tools like in-line TV media, things like that. 
We are far beyond those days, and we've purged out that inefficient spend, and we've converted the old analog spend to heavily digital. And what we find is when we put that profile together, and we do it with the work we do with retailers in store, which, by the way, as you know, is not just deep discounting, that's not really the Conagra playbook anymore, it has been very successful for us. 
With respect to taking that investment up in any given COVID window, it kind of depends upon what brand we're talking about because the last thing that would make sense would be to be spending a bunch of A&P on a brand that we're short on supply, and we're not doing that. But what we've said in the call earlier today is if we have available capacity and if we have evidence of good ROI, we'll absolutely increase the spend. So if you look at the average and it doesn't tell you much on some brands, the rate is much higher than that. And those are brands usually where we get tremendous responsiveness, and we have available capacity."

Today, I'm going to unpack the quarter for you and then share our pers",2510,"Thanks, Brian. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our first quarter fiscal 2021 earnings call. I hope that you and your families are continuing to stay safe and healthy. Today, I'm going to unpack the quarter for you and then share our perspective on how the evolving consumer environment is shaping longer-term demand for our products. So let's get started. 
Building upon our impressive momentum at the end of last year, we're off to a strong start in Q1. We exceeded our expectations and saw broad-based strength across the portfolio. We will detail today we believe our business is well positioned to continue to deliver strong results, both in the near and long term. 
The transformation we've undertaken over the past 5 years by following our Conagra Way playbook to perpetually reshape our portfolio and capabilities for growth and better margins has proven critical in enabling us to respond to the changing dynamics in the current environment. Our modernized portfolio, commitment to innovate and agile culture have allowed us to respond to the increased consumer demand and changing preferences today and position us to deliver meaningful growth into the future. 
Our robust performance has also helped us to get ahead of our expected deleveraging cadence. As Dave will detail later, we expect to reach our net leverage ratio target of 3.5x to 3.6x by the third quarter of fiscal 2021. 
Paying down debt has been a capital allocation priority in recent quarters, but you also know that we are committed long-term to a balanced capital allocation approach. Given our progress on deleveraging and because we remain confident in the long-term outlook for our business, our Board has increased our quarterly dividend by 29% to $1.10 on an annualized basis. And as I'll discuss more, we also continue to invest in the business. 
Our performance reflects the great work our team has accomplished during these challenging times. In particular, I want to recognize the thousands of hard-working Conagra team members on the front lines. Their extraordinary efforts in simultaneously keeping employees safe and maximizing our supplies have made it possible for us to continue to meet the needs of our communities, customers and consumers, and I couldn't be prouder of them. 
Let's get into the business update. As the table on Slide 7 shows, our execution in the quarter enabled us to exceed our expectations across the board. We delivered organic net sales growth of 15%, adjusted operating margins of 20.2%, adjusted EPS of $0.70. We ended the quarter with a net leverage ratio of 3.7x compared to 4.0x at the end of Q4. 
During the first quarter, we continued to drive significant growth in each of our 3 retail segments. Total Conagra retail sales grew 12.9% year-over-year, driven by double-digit growth in snacks, frozen and staples. Importantly, our higher-margin, nonpromoted volume contributed significantly to this growth. And not only did we grow at a great rate, we expanded our presence with consumers and gained share. We increased household penetration by 100 basis points and category share by 30 basis points. 
Slide 9 demonstrates how our investments in e-commerce over the last several years continued to yield results in the quarter. Strengthening our e-commerce capabilities has been an area of focus for us, and we're seeing the fruits of our labor. Our e-commerce retail sales have recently demonstrated impressive growth and, over the past 5 quarters, have consistently outpaced total industry e-commerce growth. 
First quarter also saw continued strong innovation momentum. Our steadfast commitment to the Conagra Way playbook has enabled us to consistently exceed our goal of having 15% of total retail sales each year coming from products launched within the past 3 years. And of course, as our overall sales continue to increase, this percentage of sales represents a larger absolute dollar amount. Even during these challenging times, we remain committed to delivering innovation to our customers and consumers. Our growth is rooted in innovation, and we are driving category performance. 
Slide 11 highlights 2 examples in big growth areas: frozen and snacks. Let's take a look at the frozen single-serve meals category. As compared to our fiscal '17, this category experienced a $575 million increase in retail sales during the 52-week period ended August 30. Our innovation in frozen single-serve meals over the past 3 years is unmistakable. We've generated almost 100% of that category's growth over the same period. 
We've applied this proven strategy to our snacks portfolio and are seeing similar category-driving growth. Slim Jim has consistently gained share and has the top position in dollar sales for meat snack innovation. And to top it all off, our new Slim Jim Savage stick has the #1 velocity in all meat snacks. Given this track record, our innovation success has earned tremendous credibility with our customers. 
And our most recent slate of innovation is enabling us to further enhance that credibility. Slide 12 shows some of the highlights, offerings packed with modern food attributes and bold on-trend flavors. Some of these began launching in Q4, and we're pleased with their early end-market performance. We will continue to roll these out throughout the year. 
We're also excited about the innovations shown here on Slide 13. We're using our broad portfolio to extend high-growth brands beyond their legacy forms. By leveraging our existing capabilities, we're extending Gardein and Healthy Choice into attractive categories with large profit pools: soups, jerky and salad dressing. And these 2 success stories are even going 1 step further, co-branding single-serve frozen meals. 
Slide 14 shows some examples of what else we have on deck for the balance of fiscal '21. Clearly, we are not slowing down on our innovation agenda. 
I'd now like to take a moment to touch on recent performance in our 3 domestic retail domains, starting with frozen. Slide 15 shows our impressive performance in total frozen during the quarter. This business is over $5 billion in annual retail sales, and it grew 13.5% in the quarter, with double-digit growth in single-serve meals, multi-serve meals and plant-based meat alternatives. 
With respect to frozen vegetables, recall that last quarter, we were supply-constrained in Birds Eye. Demand was in excess of our available capacity, exacerbated by a brief plant shutdown to keep our employees safe and healthy. I'm pleased to report that during the first quarter, our Birds Eye plants are at full capacity and, as the quarter progressed, we qualified external manufacturers to supplement our capabilities. 
While our consumption in frozen vegetables grew 0.7% in the quarter, our shipments grew at a much faster rate as retailers started rebuilding inventories. Sitting here today, Birds Eye, which holds the #1 position in the category and has over twice the category share compared to the closest branded competitor, is very well positioned as we enter the important holiday season. 
Turning to snacks. Snacks business delivered another impressive quarter of growth, 14.6% versus the previous year and 22.7% on a 2-year basis. In meat snacks, we are working to maintain our growth and capabilities by investing in expanded capacity at our Troy, Ohio plant. To be clear, this investment is not a reaction to the near-term environment, but a decision made pre-COVID and rooted in our longer-term outlook for the business. 
Our meaningful staples results, as shown on Slide 17, demonstrate that this domain remains extremely relevant. Our staples business grew retail sales 11.6% year-over-year, with strong performance across our portfolio of iconic brands. 
I'd now like to turn to our perspective on the evolving environment and what we see going forward. While we hope and expect that the most acute and severe impact of COVID-19 is behind us, we believe that recent shifts in consumer behavior, coupled with macroeconomic trends, suggest that at-home eating will remain elevated for some time. We also believe that we are very well positioned to capitalize on this opportunity. 
I'll unpack these points a little bit more, but we see consumers experiencing and making lifestyle changes, driven by COVID-19, that suggests the arrival of a sustained shift in eating habits. We also know from prior recessions that an economic downturn typically leads to a permanent increase in at-home eating, even when economic growth returns. These consumer trends affect everyone in our industry, but we believe that Conagra is uniquely positioned to benefit substantially from this environment. 
Our portfolio is well-developed in the eating occasions that have seen the most significant and sustained shift to at-home eating, and our portfolio delivers against the cooking behaviors that consumers are adopting. We're attracting more new buyers than our peers, and consumers are choosing to stick with Conagra and come back for more. With our proven track record of innovation, we believe we will continue to attract new consumers and deliver food that meets their evolving needs. 
Let's drill down on some of the proof points that underpin these expectations, starting with why we believe at-home eating will remain elevated. As you know, the vast majority of our sales are sourced from the United States. And unfortunately, the U.S. economy has been greatly affected by the pandemic. Unemployment in the U.S. remains high, the pace of new job growth is decelerating and many U.S. households have limited savings. To understand how this recession may impact Americans' eating habits going forward, we looked back at how behavior changed in the wake of the last recession. 
Slide 20 shows the percent of eating occasions that have been sourced at-home in the U.S. since 2007. As you can see, the '08 recession was a catalyst for a 200 basis point increase in at-home eating occasions, from 80% to 82% over the course of 4 years. Importantly, that rate held steady long after the recession ended, even when the economy returned to growth and employment hit record levels. 
With the COVID-19 disruption, we've already seen another 200 basis point increase to 84% in the 4 months from March to June 2020. History as a guide, the increased percentage of at-home eating occasions should persist even when economic growth returns. 
And as Slide 21 shows, as consumers are saving money in their food budgets, they are using their dollars and time differently. They're preparing to be at home for an extended period of time. Consumers are investing in their houses, their home gyms, their entertainment systems and their kitchens. 
In the chart on the right, you can see that consumers are also spending more time cooking. Data is showing that consumers are tackling more complex mediums. In other words, they're upgrading their culinary skills. We don't expect these upgrades to homes, at-home entertainment, kitchens and cooking skills to go away anytime soon. This all leads to 1 conclusion: more time at home and, as a result, more consumption of food at home. 
The pivot to remote work is also a meaningful development. The significant workplace disruption we've experienced over the past several months has given way to a new normal remote workforce. The chart on the left of Slide 22 shows how even baseline projections see office vacancies remaining elevated over the coming years. Furthermore, on the right, we can see how remote workforce adoption has significantly increased. 
More working from home means more lunch is eaten at home and real opportunity for a portfolio like ours. And while we're well past the initial spike of stock-up behavior when COVID first emerged in the U.S. in March, at-home eating occasions have remained elevated, even increasing over the most recent 2 weeks of data. 
As the chart on Slide 23 shows, we're continuing to see a double-digit percent increase in total industry sales at retail versus the prior year. During our first quarter, food and beverage industry sales rose an impressive 14%. While we don't know exactly how these growth rates will trend going forward, we do know that we're entering the cold and flu season and that winter weather could limit the appeal of outdoor restaurant dining in many parts of the country. All of these factors give us reason to believe that the elevated levels of at-home eating should persist. We also believe that Conagra is uniquely positioned to benefit. 
Let's start with Slide 24. Total at-home meals have increased almost 6% in the 3 months ending July 2020, that's almost 7 billion meals. When you take a closer look at this growth by daypart, the increases in meals and dollars are skewing toward lunch and dinner. And as you know, Conagra is well-developed in both of these dayparts. 
The chart on the right shows that, in fact, our portfolio overindexes in dinner and is almost at parity for lunch compared to the overall mix. And whether a consumer wants to cook from scratch to put those newly developed culinary skills to the test, or heat and eat, Conagra's diverse portfolio can deliver a solution for every need in every daypart. So we are very well positioned for when and how people are eating more at home. 
On Slide 25, you can see the benefits. Over 80% of our categories have been growing in line or faster than the industry. And as I mentioned earlier, we've been gaining share within those categories. This is further demonstrated by Slide 26, which shows we're attracting new buyers at a faster rate than any of our peers. 
Slide 27 shows that the buyers we're attracting overindexed to the coveted millennial and Gen X generations. As you might expect, we're seeing substantial millennial expansion in frozen but, just as importantly, we're seeing their expansion in snacks and staples as well. 
Because of this, we're creating the groundwork for future growth above the category and above our peers. We're attracting younger generations and building superior consumer lifetime value. And not only are more consumers trying our products, they're liking them and coming back for more. 
Take a look at the chart on Slide 28. New trier repeat rates for our consumers, whose first trial was in March or April, have remained steady at above 50%. 
That stickiness can be seen further in the chart on Slide 29. Not only are repeat rates sustaining, but the depth of repeat is improving. More consumers are choosing to repurchase a Conagra product 2 or more times compared to where we were a year ago. 
When you compare us to our peers, we are at the front of the pack. Slide 30 shows that we rank above nearly all of our peers in the total percentage of repeat purchasers, demonstrating the improved stickiness of our brand loyalty. 
So in summary, executing our disciplined Conagra Way playbook over the last 5 years has grown our portfolio, grown our capabilities and positioned us to meet the evolving needs of our consumers, while earning the confidence of our customers. We believe that at-home eating will remain elevated for some time as consumers seek affordable and convenient meals that meet the needs of their new normal. And we are confident that Conagra is well positioned to see sustained benefit. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Dave."

I'll walk through our first quarter financial performance and outlook before opening the line for questions. Let's look at the P&L highlights for the quarter, which are captured on Slide 33. As Sean discussed, w",1675,"Thanks, Sean, and good morning, everyone. I'll walk through our first quarter financial performance and outlook before opening the line for questions. 
Let's look at the P&L highlights for the quarter, which are captured on Slide 33. As Sean discussed, we started fiscal '21 on a strong note. Elevated demand across our retail segments, coupled with effective execution, enabled us to exceed expectations for net sales, profitability, free cash flow and deleveraging. 
Compared to the same period a year ago, net sales and organic net sales for the first quarter were up 12.1% and 15%, respectively. Adjusted gross margin increased 244 basis points to 30.7%. Adjusted operating margin increased 450 basis points versus the same period a year ago, reaching 20.2% for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA increased 34.5% to $647 million. And adjusted EPS increased 62.8% to $0.70, exceeding our first quarter guidance. 
Slide 34 outlines the drivers of our first quarter net sales versus the same period a year ago. As you can see, the 15% increase in organic net sales was driven by a double-digit increase in volume as well as favorable impacts from price/mix. Favorable pricing and sales mix both contributed to the growth in the quarter. Price/mix also included a benefit of approximately 70 basis points from a favorable change in estimate associated with a prior period trade expense accrual. 
The organic net sales increase more than offset headwinds from divestitures and foreign exchange. As we pointed out in the past, the impact from divestitures continues to diminish sequentially as we anniversary the divestiture closing dates. Including the impact of the recently announced divestiture of HK Anderson, the full year impact of divestitures is expected to approximate 100 basis points. 
Turning to Slide 35. You'll find a summary of net sales by segment for the first quarter. We saw continued strong growth in each of the company's 3 retail segments on both a reported and organic basis. The net sales increase was primarily driven by consumers increasing their at-home food consumption as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which benefited our 3 retail segments but negatively impacted the Foodservice segment. 
In the quarter, our Grocery & Snacks segment reported organic net sales growth of 20.7%. This segment benefited as consumers continue to purchase convenient, shelf-stable products to enhance their at-home eating experience. Segment growth in shipments this quarter exceeded growth in consumption as retailers began rebuilding inventories on brands such as Hunt's, PAM, Duncan Hines and Vlasic. 
The Refrigerated & Frozen segment also experienced strong growth in the quarter. The 19% increase in organic net sales is a testament to our innovation and modernization efforts and the role our portfolio plays in meeting the needs of today's consumers. This segment also experienced shipment growth greater than consumption growth in the quarter, primarily as a result of Birds Eye. As Sean mentioned, we increased capacity in frozen vegetables during the quarter, enabling retailers to start replenishing their inventories. 
The International segment's 13.1% organic net sales growth came in stronger than we forecasted, with each of the segment's regions posting growth higher than projected, primarily from COVID-related demand. Our Foodservice segment reported a 20.3% organic net sales decline, primarily driven by a volume decrease of 24.2% due to lower restaurant traffic. This marks an improvement from last quarter as some restaurant traffic began to rebound. 
Slide 36 outlines the drivers of the 450 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion in the first quarter. Our margin levers, such as realized productivity, price/mix, operating leverage and synergies drove a 610 basis point increase in the quarter. The specific drivers of this increase are: supply chain realized productivity of 290 basis points, price/mix of 250 basis points, cost of goods sold synergy of 90 basis points and operating leverage of 60 basis points. Also, the net impact of divestitures, FX and other items negatively impacted operating margin by 80 basis points. 
Cost of goods sold inflation was approximately 3.1% in the quarter, which negatively impacted gross margin by 220 basis points. We incurred approximately $34 million in cost of goods sold directly related to our COVID-19 response, which negatively impacted gross margin by 150 basis points. Our A&P rate was favorable by 20 basis points in the quarter due to the favorable sales leverage. As on a dollar basis, we spent approximately the same amount as last year's first quarter. 
Finally, our SG&A rate was favorable by 190 basis points. Approximately 160 basis points was related to the combination of fixed cost leverage on higher net sales and reduced spending related to COVID-19 as employees worked from home and did not travel. The remaining 30 basis point improvement was driven by synergies, partially offset by normal SG&A inflation and increases in stock-based compensation expense. 
We have certainly seen a margin benefit driven by the current environment. But it's also clear to see that we have made great progress improving the underlying operating margin of the business. 
Slide 37 shows our adjusted operating profit and margin summary by segment in the first quarter. Our total company adjusted operating profit increased 44.2% to $541 million in the quarter. Importantly, all 4 of our segments reported margin expansion in the quarter. 
These results demonstrate the tremendous operating margin improvement in our domestic retail and International segments. While the Foodservice segment saw a decline in operating profit dollars, the segment reported a 28 basis point increase in adjusted operating margin. This was aided by lower inventory write-offs and less trade spending in the quarter. 
Slide 38 highlights that our adjusted EPS increased 62.8% to $0.70 in the quarter, primarily driven by the increase in adjusted operating profit associated with the net sales increase and margin expansion. 
Turning to Slide 39. You will see a summary of our synergy capture since the close of the Pinnacle Foods acquisition in fiscal '19. After exceeding our fiscal '20 goal of $180 million, we have continued our strong synergy progress in the beginning of fiscal '21. 
In Q1, we captured an incremental $35 million in savings, bringing total cumulative synergies through the end of the first quarter to $219 million. To date, the majority of our synergies have been in SG&A, and we expect the majority of the remaining synergies to be reflected in cost of goods sold. We're very pleased with our progress and are confident that we will continue to deliver on our commitment. 
Slide 40 shows the strong progress we've made to improve our balance sheet and cash flow. From the close of the Pinnacle acquisition in the second quarter of fiscal '19 through the end of the first quarter of fiscal '21, we have reduced total gross debt by more than $1.9 billion, resulting in total net debt of $9.2 billion. 
As of the end of the first quarter, our net leverage ratio was 3.7x, down from 4x at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal '20. Given our income, we are confident in our ability to achieve our targeted leverage ratio of 3.5 to 3.6x by the third quarter of fiscal '21. In addition, we remain committed to solid investment-grade credit ratings. 
Also, our cash flow remains very strong. In the first quarter, our cash flow from operating activities increased $78 million or 37% compared to the prior year. At the same time, we increased our investment in the business by increasing CapEx by $39 million or 36%. Supply chain investments and cost savings and capacity projects made up most of our year-over-year spend as we continue to optimize our network and drive brand growth. This has led to our free cash flow increasing $39 million, 38% to last year's first quarter. 
As a result of our strong cash flows and progress reducing debt, we have greater financial flexibility to both invest in the business and return cash to shareholders. This, coupled with consistent successful execution of our strategic priorities and our ongoing confidence in the long-term strength of the business, led our Board to approve a 29% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.275 per share or $1.10 per share on an annualized basis. This action is consistent with our commitment to maintaining a balanced approach to capital allocation. As we return cash to shareholders, we are also increasing our investments in the business, as evidenced by the 36% increase in Q1 CapEx I just mentioned. 
Turning to Slide 42. You will find a summary of our outlook. As you've heard both Sean and me share this morning, we believe there is much to look forward to in the quarters ahead. However, the dynamics surrounding COVID-19 continue to make forecasting with specificity a challenge. What we can share is that we anticipate a continuation of elevated retail demand throughout the second quarter. We are, therefore, providing second quarter guidance, as noted in the release and on this slide. 
We expect organic net sales growth of plus 6% to plus 8% in the second quarter. We expect adjusted operating margin in the second quarter to be in the range of 18% to 18.5%. Relative to Q1 operating margin, we expect less operating leverage benefit, and we expect to increase our marketing support, both above the line and below the line. We believe there are opportunities to increase brand-building investments where capacity permits. 
Given these operating margin factors, along with expected improvement in below-the-line items, we expect to deliver second quarter adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations in the range of $0.70 to $0.74. We expect to reach our leverage target of 3.5 to 3.6x by the third quarter of this fiscal year. Of course, our ability to achieve these targets assumes continued performance end-to-end by our supply chain. 
Finally, we are reaffirming all of our fiscal '22 targets this morning. Note that the impact of the HK Anderson divestiture is small enough that we will not be adjusting our fiscal '22 EPS targets for the divestiture. 
Thanks for listening, everyone. That concludes my remarks. I'll now pass it to the operator to open it up for questions."

Andrew, let me give you some big-picture perspective on how we think about this and then we can talk a little bit about the year ago period because I think it's important that you all understand what we intend to do, what we do not intend to do and w",501,"Yes. Andrew, let me give you some big-picture perspective on how we think about this and then we can talk a little bit about the year ago period because I think it's important that you all understand what we intend to do, what we do not intend to do and why. 
First off, before we ever contemplate an increase in our brand-building investments, 2 simple things have to be in place: one, the capacity to supply new demand generation; and two, evidence of a strong ROI. Now on this latter ROI point, there are 2 types of investments where the evidence is quite strong regarding ROI: investments to increase consumer awareness around our new innovations and investments to further build out our e-commerce business. 
So on new innovation, awareness, think of it this way, it's the precursor to trial. We do great at trial, but you got -- and it repeats, but you've got to get that awareness in place. So as you saw in the data, our repeat performance has been stumped. On e-commerce, we've learned that what we get out of it is directly a function of what we put into it. We've also learned, though, that speed in supporting the business is very important because it enables you to build a beachhead in the e-tailing universe that helps us fuel future purchases. 
So if we were to seed this opportunity, someone else would build that beachhead. But overall, I'd say, we believe that supporting innovation and e-commerce undoubtedly maximizes long-term value because it maximizes consumer penetration, which then converts to loyalty. 
But let's keep things in perspective about the level of support we're talking about. As you know, our A&P is very hardworking, but it's also very, very efficient. And the rate has hovered around 2% over the last year or so, working synergistically with our retailer investments. So that's been our playbook. It works, and we will continue to do it. 
In this coming quarter, the spend is likely to be a bit higher than Q1 because we have more capacity and because it's usually higher in Q2 than Q1 because it's the holiday season. And as the stores get crowded around holidays, we want to win at the point of purchase. And we know that if we create awareness, the rest will take care of itself, which sets up a good back half and a good fiscal '22. 
In terms of flow-through to the year, as you know, we're not guiding to the year. And the reason for that today is the same as the reason a year ago, which is we're trying to manage this unpredictable environment quarter-to-quarter. We don't know what the back half will give us. 
So the key thing for us right now is keeping people healthy and keeping our plants running because if we can't do that, obviously, it puts a limit on our ability to drive revenue, which then converts to profit. So we're just navigating this quarter-by-quarter right now."

What I will say is that our realized productivity programs and supply chain are tracking very well. Our synergy capture, which is a big part of our margin improvement, is on track and continues to be on track, and we're confident that will continue. 
So when you look at those items and you compare to inflation and you strip it out at a high level, we're seeing improvement in core operating margin performance as we expected to pre-COVID.

That began to rebuild in the quarter, which obviously will lead to shipments being ahead of consumption. 
But the net takeaway in terms of absolute status of inventories in trade right now is it's still larger than it is historically in terms of days on hand. That's both because not every single category is flushed with capacity on the supply side, but also because the takeaway is higher. So when the pull-through is more -- your days on hand drops.

We've got, thankfully, the plants are running well, and we are growing. 
But what you're seeing in consumption, it does -- it kind of confuse because the natural level of demand is actually higher than that. But what you see going on right now is we are approaching the all-important holiday season for vegetables. And it is very, very important to retailers to have vegetable inventory during the holidays. 
So the supply constraints that you're seeing on Birds Eye are not just those that we've had in terms of our ability to manufacture, but it's also some retailers prioritizing, preserving holiday inventory above, call it, late summer inventory. Because, as you can imagine, when consumers go to buy their Thanksgiving dinner and vegetables and they can't get what they want, that becomes a very emotional -- a very negative emotional event, and we don't want that, nor do our retailers."

On the sales side of that, your 1% to 2% CAGR, if I flatline the back half of the year, I've got to take 2022 organic sales down 9%-or-so to get that multi-year CAGR down to 1% to 2%.

So first, the trade change in estimate, that's about 40 basis points. So if you take that out, because that's a benefit to the first quarter, that's just going to stay for the year. The difference between Q1 and sort of the midpoint of the 2Q guide is about 150 basis points lower. 
That difference between Q1 and Q2 is roughly split among investments in A&P, in above-the-line investments in merchandising and slotting and then growth-focused, cost of goods sold investments to support our innovation and capital investments. So that's of the 150 basis points that kind of splits into those buckets.

But we've said pretty consistently from the beginning, it's not necessarily strategic to use the tax asset for the sake of using the tax asset. It's strategic if we use it to create value. And as we think about candidates, that could be outbound. It always comes down to can we get a value for it that is above what we see as the intrinsic value? 
So we've made very good progress on our deleveraging, getting ahead of our expectations there. It's not as if we feel pressure such that we would ever liquidate an asset below its intrinsic value.

But given our track record and given, especially in frozen and snacks, the way our innovation has driven category growth and the way we've really accounted for almost all of the share in some of our key categories in terms of growth, that demand from customers for our new innovation remained extremely strong. 
So a lot of our products have been going out the door. We've got more yet to go out the door. And the performance of those products in marketplace have been strong. So we've been doing a combination to maximize supply of SKU rationalization, where it makes sense to do so, on brands like Chef Boyardee, so we can maximize the volume we're putting out there. 
But at the same time, we've been very strong on innovation, and it has been working. So that's strictly a function of how well our innovation does in terms of velocities in the marketplace. We've got, if you look at some velocities, just new stuff that we've got out there, like Duncan Hines is a brand we don't always talk about, we've got these new keto-friendly cups. And this is brand-new, and it's already got the #1 dollar velocity SKU in that segment. 
Our Slim Jim products, the velocity is just crushing it. Our Slim Jim Savage initiative is the #1 velocity in all meat snacks, and it's been the #2 velocity in all snacks overall in the last 13 weeks. So these new products are not only going out the door, they are really performing."

As you mentioned, there have been increases in spot rates for freight. Freight's about 10% of our overall cost of goods sold, but it's a very small piece of our business because we contract for our freight. So clearly going to be an impact, but on an overall weighted basis, we think it's manageable. And we have other favorability that we can offset that. 
Yes, in terms of supply chain, remember, it's the end-to-end supply chain. So it's not just our manufacturing, it's our co-mans, but it's also our suppliers. So to the extent that certain regions get hit with COVID and then there's impacts on labor, it impacts the entire supply chain. 
And so we're on that every day, every hour of every day, making sure that we understand kind of where we are with demand and then where we are with supply.

Some of that connection happens in the grocery store. Some of it -- a lot of it happens on their phone or on their computer or digitally. All of it works together. 
But a big piece of our first investment and how we get sustained growth is in designing the right products and the right packages.

What's going to happen in year 2 when your competition sees this and they emulate you and you've got difficult comps? Well, now we've done it year after year after year, and we've retained just about 100% of the category growth in that space, which suggests that all the investments we make holistically in brand building, from product to package to retailer investments to A&P, works very hard and is driving sustained performance. 
What sometimes strips people up is they get accustomed to seeing -- thinking that all brand building resides on the A&P line. And that a good rate of A&P, which is kind of an artifact of the industry from the past, is a 4% rate or something like that. If you dig deep within most of the companies that have had those kinds of rates, what you find is an extraordinary amount of nonworking dollars and then working dollars that are still used against traditional tools like in-line TV media, things like that. 
We are far beyond those days, and we've purged out that inefficient spend, and we've converted the old analog spend to heavily digital. And what we find is when we put that profile together, and we do it with the work we do with retailers in store, which, by the way, as you know, is not just deep discounting, that's not really the Conagra playbook anymore, it has been very successful for us. 
With respect to taking that investment up in any given COVID window, it kind of depends upon what brand we're talking about because the last thing that would make sense would be to be spending a bunch of A&P on a brand that we're short on supply, and we're not doing that. But what we've said in the call earlier today is if we have available capacity and if we have evidence of good ROI, we'll absolutely increase the spend. So if you look at the average and it doesn't tell you much on some brands, the rate is much higher than that. And those are brands usually where we get tremendous responsiveness, and we have available capacity."

First, on the dividend, we've got a step-up today, which, in a sense, kind of makes up for the time that the dividend has been frozen. So at this level, at this payout ratio, should we think of it this now as kind of a normalized ratio? And assuming there's growth going forward, we're at a level where we can grow the dividend consistently? 
And then the second one is just in terms of the outlook or the lack of outlook for this fiscal year and the kind of the question around visibility, is the lack of visibility more around cost relative to revenues? Because it seems like you've got a pretty reasonable amount of confidence in the environment and your ability to drive revenue in this environment. So just curious if the inability to give guidance is more driven by cost versus revenues?"

So based on this progress and the Board's confidence and the structurally higher earnings power for the company, the Board approved a dividend from $0.85 to $1.10 annualized. And this increase moves us towards the longer-term historic payout ratio of 45% to 50%. So that's what I'll tell you related to the dividend.
