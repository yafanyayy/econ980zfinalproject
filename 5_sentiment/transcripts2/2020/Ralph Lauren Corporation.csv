Over the important holiday season, our teams consistently executed across each of our strategic priorities, enabling us to elevate our brand and deliver for our consumers across every touch point. The solid foundations we've put into place to reposition and elevate our brands helped to drive positive comp growth across all 3 regions, excluding the impact of Hong Kong this quarter. 
We were also encouraged by AUR growth of 6% and as we invest in brand elevation through our products, marketing, distribution and unique consumer experiences. At the same time, we continue to execute key initiatives to stabilize our North America business against an evolving retail landscape. 
As I've shared before, the 3 principles underlying this work include: putting the consumer at the center of everything we do; elevating the brand across all consumer touch points; and balancing growth and productivity. And we are doing all of this while managing through volatile industry dynamics including the recent coronavirus outbreak, which we are actively monitoring. Our top priorities are to keep our employees and consumers safe and to heed the advice of local and international health authorities. The situation is a dynamic one, and we will continue to assess the implications for our business across retail, corporate and our supply base. Our thoughts are with the many impacted by this virus. 
During the third quarter, we drove our performance across the 5 strategic priorities that we laid out as part of our 5-year plan to deliver long-term sustainable growth and value creation. These include: first, win over a new generation of consumers; second, energize core products and accelerate high-potential underdeveloped categories; third, drive targeted expansion in our regions and channels; fourth, lead with digital across all activities; and fifth, operate with discipline to show growth. 
Starting with win over a new generation of consumers. We're investing in media channels that matter most to consumers today, namely digital and social, and remain on track towards our long-term marketing investment target of 5% of sales. In the third quarter, marketing increased 16% to last year as we shifted investments back into the key holiday selling period. 
We are encouraged by consumer engagement across generations through our campaigns and programs. Notably, our total social media followers surpassed 40 million in the third quarter, a double-digit increase to last year, led by a 30% organic increase on Instagram. 
Let me touch on some of the highlights from our holiday campaigns this quarter. First, we launched a fully integrated holiday campaign across social media, television, our own stores and digital sites and wholesale environments, which we called Every Moment is a Gift. Among the exciting activations online, we drove strong engagement through our Snapchat holiday shopping filter and our first ever global digital game, The Holiday Run, where our iconic Polo bear dash through the streets of New York City, Paris, and Tokyo to collect festive bubbles and signature Ralph Lauren products. 
We also launched a digitally-targeted campaign for our Lauren women's ready-to-wear business in North America this season, featuring supermodel and mom Aldridge, along with her family. It was the first dedicated campaign for the brand in many years that had significant media support behind it. We were encouraged by the early consumer response as we work to get the Lauren women's business back on a positive trajectory. 
On our North American mobile app, we drove a successful 7 days 7 drops program, featuring limited edition releases and one-of-the-kind experiences. A highlight of the week was our 5 Horseman rugby shirt, which sold out in just 15 minutes online. And congratulations to Ralph Lauren Golf Ambassador Justin Thomas. He captured his 12th career win at the Century Tournament of Champions last month, wearing RLX to capture the #1 spot in the FedEx Cup standings. 
Moving on to our second key initiative, energize core products and accelerate high-potential underdeveloped categories. In the third quarter, Ralph and our design team drove excitement in core product categories while also expanding into our 5 high-potential underdeveloped categories. While we were pleased with the overall performance of these categories, our outerwear and fleece programs were the clear standouts this holiday, outperforming our total sales trends on both the sell-in and sell-out basis. Popular styles included heavyweight parkas, quoted car coats, light and midway down jackets, wind breakers and sharper styles. Other successes this season included woven shirts, sweaters and denim. 
In addition to the holiday drops in our mobile app, we released our limited edition Polo sports outdoors collection in November. The products retailed on our own digital commerce sites, North America app and select flagship stores around the world. We also partnered with influential specialty retailers, including Bodega, Fred Segal, Essence,  in the U.K. and Beams in Asia. 
Other exciting projects this quarter included an exclusive holiday capsule with Zalando, the Polo sport collaboration with one of the largest fashion online retailers in Korea, and the Wechat mini program for Singles Day in China. 
Moving on to our third key initiative, drive targeted expansion in our regions and channels. Our long-term expansion strategy remains focused on building a cohesive elevated Ralph Lauren experience across our retail, wholesale and digital commerce presence in key cities around the world. 
During the third quarter, we opened 48 new owned and operated stores and concessions globally goes 31 locations. This included 37 openings in Asia. We also continue to invest in door refreshes across our own stores and wholesale partners in key markets as we work to elevate our fleet across every touch point. 
Our city-by-city ecosystem approach drove strong results in the quarter, with Chinese Mainland sales up more than 30% in constant currency, driven by comp growth and new stores. Total China sales were up 6% to last year in constant currency, despite headwinds in Hong Kong that we discussed last quarter. 
In Europe, we opened 6 owned and partnered full-price stores including Polo boutiques in Covent Garden in London, Torino, Exxon Province and Lisbon. We're making good progress, but we still have significant expansion opportunities with only 46 full-price stores across Europe, with all of this complemented by our successful expansion into new specialty wholesale accounts and digital commerce growth. 
Which brings me to our fourth key initiative, lead with digital. Our global digital ecosystem, including our directly operated flagship sites, departmentstore.com, pure players and social commerce, increased low double digits in the third quarter in constant currency. The strong performance exceeded our expectations across all 3 regions. This was driven by double-digit growth in Europe and Asia, with North America up high single digits, improving from flat performance in the first half. 
Starting with Europe. Digital sales were up high teens in the quarter, with solid performance across both owned and wholesale digital accounts led by digital pure-play retailers. We added 6 new partners, including luisaviaroma in Italy, Shop in the U.K. & Brown Hamburg in Germany. 
Our directly operated digital sites in Europe also saw further momentum, delivering 15% comp growth this quarter. Highlights included the November launch of Polo mobile app in the U.K., our first app launch outside of North America, and the new digital commerce flagship for Switzerland, as we expand our localization efforts by market. 
In Asia, digital ecosystem sales were also up double digits, led by the Chinese Mainland. We launched new partnerships this quarter with Myer in Australia as well as Tmall's luxury selected platform in China. Lastly, our digital growth in China accelerated on the launch of buy online, ship from store fulfillment to leverage our store inventories. These omni-channel orders contributed to roughly half of our digital growth in the quarter. 
Turning to North America. Third quarter comps on RalphLauren.com were up 6%, largely in line with our expectations. We saw softness from international consumers due to FX and import restrictions in Asia, similar to the first half of the year. However, sales to domestic shoppers grew single digits as we started to drive improvements in mobile, tight personalization and rebalancing our buys to emphasize stronger selling core and seasonal core products. 
Lastly, we continue to build partnerships with newer digital platforms in North America which are extending our reach to new and younger consumers. In the third quarter, we launched Women's Polo on Daily Look, the premium subscription-based personal styling service; and Men's Polo on Simmons, a specialty designer boutique online. We also added kids to rent the runway, joining our Lauren, Women's Polo and Club Monaco brands on the platform. 
Touching on our fifth key initiative, operate with discipline to show growth. In the third quarter, we focused on challenging every cost and improving our efficiencies. Adjusted operating margin expanded 10 basis points, slightly ahead of our expectations with stronger-than-expected top line growth, partly offset by the planned timing of higher investments around holiday marketing and new stores. 
One important margin driver for us and a central part of our Next Great Chapter strategy is raising AUR to elevate the brand globally and create value. We're using multiple levers to realize AUR increases, including lower discounts, elevated product mix geographic and channel shifts and strategic ticket price increases. 
We began phasing in strategic ticket price increases in our North America factory outlet channel in late September, followed by our North America full price wholesale and direct-to-consumer doors in spring '20. Leveraging the success we've had implementing this strategy in Asia and Europe, these ticket increases reflect our competitive benchmarking analysis and our focus on providing a superior value proposition for our consumers. 
We were encouraged by the impact of these initial price increases this fall. While traffic was still a headwind for our factory business, we were able to drive positive comps in this channel through an 8% increase in AUR in the quarter. This was on top of 8% AUR growth last year and well above our expectations. Though it is still early in this journey, we are focused on elevating our brand positioning in the North American market and globally as part of our AUR-led strategy. 
And finally, I want to provide an update on our journey to further integrate citizenship and sustainability into our business. More than 50 years ago, Ralph built our company based on the idea of timelessness, creating products that are meant to be worn, love and passed on to the next generation. This continues to inspire everything we do as we build the business to deliver value for our shareholders and all of our stakeholders for the next 50 years. 
As part of this work, in December, we announced a new commitment to power all of our globally owned and operated offices, distribution centers and stores with 100% renewable electricity by 2025. We also took the Arctic shipping pledge, committing to reroute shipping to avoid the environmentally delicate Artic area. 
Driving diversity and inclusion across our business is another important piece of this work, and we are pleased to report that we have achieved our gender parity goal of equal representation in our leadership positions at the VP level and above more than 3 years ahead of our target. 
In closing, Ralph and I are energized by our team's execution over the important holiday quarter, and we are encouraged by the progress we are making on our Next Great Chapter plan across the business. While we are mindful of the challenges across our markets globally, we are intensely focused on delivering on the commitments we have made across every aspect of our business as we look to drive long-term sustainable growth and value creation for all of our stakeholders. 
And before I turn it over to Jane, sadly, I want to note the recent passing of our long-time board member and friend Arrinson. On behalf of Ralph and the entire organization, I want to express our deepest gratitude for his kindness, wisdom and service to our company over nearly 2 decades. 
Now over to Jane, and I'll join her at the end to answer your questions."

Our third quarter results demonstrates solid execution of our strategy through this holiday season and our team's agility in navigating a dynamic global geopolitical and retail environment. We delivered top",2198,"Thank you, Patrice, and good morning, everyone. Our third quarter results demonstrates solid execution of our strategy through this holiday season and our team's agility in navigating a dynamic global geopolitical and retail environment. We delivered top and bottom line growth and good progress across key metrics, including 6% AUR growth, double-digit growth in digital commerce and growth and operating margin expansion, coupled with solid inventory control. 
Third quarter revenues increased 1% on a reported basis and 2% in constant currency. Every region posted positive revenue growth driven by mid-single-digit constant currency growth in Europe and Asia, despite the ongoing headwinds in Hong Kong, as well as slight growth in North America. Excluding the impact of Hong Kong, total company top line grew 2.5% in constant currency and every region delivered positive comps as we work to elevate our brand across every consumer touch point, drive product quality, reduce promotional levels and enhance our digital presence. 
Adjusted gross margin was up 60 basis points in the third quarter, both on a reported and constant currency basis. Gross margins benefited from AUR growth of 6% on better pricing, lower promotions and elevated product mix, along with favorable channel and geographic mix. These more than offset investments in product elevation and sustainability and diversification of our supply chain. 
Looking ahead, we are encouraged by the early results of our fall pricing actions and expect our AUR strength to continue through the rest of the year, driving our full year expectation of low single-digit AUR growth for fiscal '20. 
Our inventory positions for both our direct-to-consumer and wholesale businesses are current and well controlled coming out of this holiday season. And we remain focused on managing our inventories with discipline and leveraging our supply chain agility and responsiveness. 
Adjusted operating margin in the third quarter was 14%, up 10 basis points on a reported basis and in constant currency. Adjusted operating profit dollars grew 3% to last year. Adjusted operating expense increased to 48.2% of sales, up 50 basis points to last year, both on a reported basis and in constant currency. 
Marketing was the key driver, with spending up 16% in the quarter as we shifted investments back into the key holiday selling period versus last year's focus on our 50th anniversary show and related events in the second quarter. We still expect marketing spend to grow ahead of sales for the full year fiscal '20 as we invest behind our brands with an emphasis on digital media. 
Excluding marketing, our adjusted operating expense leveraged 20 basis points to last year as our teams generated operating efficiencies across our business. Some key highlights from third quarter include: first, we continue to drive efficiencies across our end-to-end supply chain, including incremental savings across facilities, labor, airfreight and consolidation of materials, all contributing to mitigate the impact of tariffs. This work is also delivering an improved experience for our consumers, including faster delivery speeds on digital orders. 
Over the peak holiday period, for example, we more than doubled our penetration of orders delivered in 2 days or less over the prior year. We also piloted a new fast track model in the quarter, where we were able to meaningfully accelerate the development of special product concepts from design to shelf. Leveraging our investments in digital product development, we designed, produced and delivered an exclusive fleece sweater to a key wholesale customer in just 16 days, right in time for Black Friday. While just one early example, we expect this model to be a growing part of our supply chain as we continue our progress toward our 3-, 6- and 9-month lead time targets. 
Moving on to segment performance, starting with North America. Revenue increased slightly in the third quarter as strong growth in our retail business more than offset wholesale revenue declines. Adjusted operating margin was 22.3%, a 30 basis point decrease to last year, with operating margin expansion in our retail businesses more than offset by SG&A deleverage in our wholesale business on lower sales. 
In the retail channel in North America, comps were up 4% and ahead of our expectations, driven by 4% brick-and-mortar comps and 6% comps on our owned digital commerce site. Brick-and-mortar comps were driven by an 8% increase in AUR on top of 7% growth last year. This strong growth reflects our targeted price increases and a reduction in promotions, along with an improved product offering, new marketing activations and rebalanced assortments towards stronger selling core and underpenetrated categories. 
We also made key operational improvements such as the roll out of RFID technology across our fleet to improve out-of-stock replenishment sales. In addition, new staffing optimization tools in our stores drove productivity and improved service in peak periods. 
Our factory business led our AUR increase in North America with improved conversion. While traffic continued to be a headwind in the channel, we are focused on driving better traffic trends through enhanced digital marketing and refreshed and differentiated store experiences. 
Comps in our North America directly operated digital commerce business were up 6%. Our investments in mobile, personalization and site navigation drove positive growth from domestic consumers in the third quarter. 
Our digital business also benefited from favorable product mix towards categories like outerwear and fleece, along with a timing shift into the third quarter as we saw higher sell-through in the holiday period versus clearance period in Q4. Excluding this shift, we still expect second half comps to improve incrementally compared to first half comps. 
Sales to international shoppers purchasing on our U.S. site and shipping to U.S. addresses remained soft in the third quarter and should remain a headwind through the rest of fiscal '20. 
Moving on to North America wholesale. Third quarter revenue declined 8%, in line with expectations. Excluding a decline in off price sales, our underlying North America wholesale business was also down high single digits. However, our full-price sellout improved from recent trends. In the near term, we are focused on improving the consumer experience in the wholesale channel through in-store refreshes, expansion into underpenetrated categories and increased marketing. 
Our inventories in the wholesale channel are clean and down on a year-over-year basis. We are driving a more favorable product mix, emphasizing core categories and testing targeted brand marketing for Lauren Women's. We continue to expect it will take some time for our wholesale business to start reflecting these strategic improvements, which have shown success in our direct-to-consumer channels. 
Moving on to Europe. Third quarter revenue was up 3% on a reported basis and 5% in constant currency. Adjusted operating margin expanded 300 basis points both on reported and constant currency basis. Operating margin expansion was driven by strong gross margins and SG&A leverage. 
In retail channels in Europe, comps were up 3%, driven by a 15% increase in our own digital commerce sites and a 2% increase in our brick-and-mortar stores. The increase in our directly operated European digital commerce business was above our expectations, driven by strong AUR growth, solid merchandising execution and traffic increases, along with the shift in seasonal product sales, similar to our North America site. 
Across our Europe direct-to-consumer channels, our ongoing efforts to elevate the brand and improve product mix continued in the third quarter, with AUR up 10% on top of an 11% increase last year. This is consistent with our long-term strategy to drive higher quality of sales and price harmonization in the marketplace. 
Wholesale revenue in Europe was up 5% in constant currency and also ahead of our expectations. Similar to Q2, the strong performance reflected solid sell out trends driving stronger reorders, particularly with our digital pure play partners. 
Turning to Asia. Revenue was up 5% on both a reported and constant currency basis in the third quarter. Excluding the impact of Hong Kong, where protest-related store closures and tourism declines were an ongoing headwind, Asia revenues were up 9%. This solid performance was driven by several markets in Asia, led by Chinese Mainland sales growth of over 30% in constant currency. Our product and marketing initiatives are resonating well in this region and we continue to drive our digital efforts, expand and elevate our store fleet and engage with local influencers and celebrities. 
Comps in Asia decreased 1%, with slight AUR declines. Excluding Hong Kong, Asia comps were up 2%. Store closures and traffic decline to Hong Kong remained a challenge in the third quarter, but we were able to partially mitigate some of this impact by pulling forward a friends-and-family event in our factory stores. We continue to expect Hong Kong to remain a near-term headwind, especially with the emerging impact of the coronavirus, as Patrice mentioned. 
Adjusted operating margin was down 50 basis points to last year on a reported basis and down 70 basis points in constant currency, driven by SG&A deleverage in Hong Kong. Excluding Hong Kong, margins were up 130 basis points in constant currency. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we continue to return capital to our shareholders. We ended the quarter with about $1.9 billion in cash and investments and $694 million in total debt, which compares to $2.1 billion in cash and investments and $687 million in debt at the end of last year's third quarter. 
We repurchased $98 million in shares in the third quarter for a total of $498 million in repurchases year-to-date. We will continue to opportunistically buy back stock and remain on track to complete our target of about $600 million in repurchases for full fiscal '20. 
Moving on to inventory. At the end of the third quarter, inventory was down 1% to last year and flat in constant currency. We still expect to end the year with inventories relatively aligned to our sales outlook. 
Now I'd like to turn to guidance for the full year and fourth quarter of fiscal '20. As a reminder, this guidance excludes restructuring and related charges and reflects our best assessment of the global retail landscape in the context of increased volatility from macroeconomic and geopolitical events. Specifically, our outlook still incorporates the impact of tariffs, Brexit and protest-related business disruption in Hong Kong. 
At this early stage, our guidance does not include potential impact from the coronavirus outbreak, given the dynamic nature of the situation. However, we are monitoring developments closely and will be transparent about the expected impact, providing updates if needed. 
For full year fiscal '20, we still expect revenues to be in the range of 2% to 3% growth in constant currency. Based on a better-than-expected holiday, revenue should be slightly better than the low end of the range we guided to last quarter. Foreign currency is expected to have about 110 to 130 basis points of negative impact on revenue growth based on currency shifts. 
We now expect operating margin expansion at the high end of our previous range of 40 to 60 basis points in constant currency, driven primarily by gross margin expansion and slight SG&A leverage. Foreign currency is estimated to have about 10 basis points of negative impact on operating margin in fiscal '20. 
Based on the timing of shipments, our guidance now assumes a little less than $10 million of negative tariff impact to our fiscal '20 cost of goods. We expect the majority of this impact in our fourth quarter. However, based on our supply chain diversification out of China and recent tariff reductions, we estimate tariffs will have about $12 million to $15 million of total impact in fiscal '21. We now expect our full year tax rate to be about 20%. 
For the fourth quarter of fiscal '20, we expect revenues to be up slightly, both on a constant currency and on a reported basis. Foreign currency is expected to negatively impact revenue growth by about 50 basis points in the quarter. We expect protest disruptions in Hong Kong to negatively impact our Asia comp by about 5 points in the quarter. 
Operating margin for the fourth quarter is expected to be up slightly in constant currency and on a reported basis, similar to Q3. This is primarily due to timing of SG&A investments, with our highest number of new store openings weighted to the back half of the year, largely offsetting gross margin expansion in the quarter. 
Fourth quarter tax rate is estimated at 26%, above our full year expected rate based on our expectation of discrete onetime items. We look forward to sharing the details of our fiscal '21 guidance when we report our fiscal year-end in May. 
In closing, we are proud of the focus, agility and passion our teams around the world demonstrated this holiday quarter. Guided by Ralph's vision, our teams elevated our brand, delivering comp, AUR and profit growth, all while maintaining disciplined on inventories and costs. 
While we are navigating and watching the challenges in the broader environment closely, we are, first and foremost, committed to the safety of our employees, partners and consumers. We believe we have the right strategy and team to deliver across our strategic priorities and create value for the long term. 
With that, let's open up the call for your questions."

Well, let me just step back a little bit to kind of give you the overall with how we're thinking about this. The first thing I would say is brand elevation is really at the core of our strategy, right, and AUR is obviou",419,"Great. Thank you for your question. Well, let me just step back a little bit to kind of give you the overall with how we're thinking about this. The first thing I would say is brand elevation is really at the core of our strategy, right, and AUR is obviously then a key component to that. The second point on AUR is we have 4 drivers for AUR that we're working on. One is pulling back on promotional support. And actually, in the last quarter, we reduced our promotional pressure. The second is leveraging product mix, and you saw us invest in categories that had higher AUR like outerwear and fleece. The third is obviously leveraging geographic and channel mix. And then the final point is, indeed, targeted pricing. Now we've actually started this journey of taking target pricing in the context of this broader AUR strategy in international, I'd say, past 18, 24 months, and we've been pleased with the results that we've achieved there. But it's really important to understand that it isn't just pricing in isolation. It's the result of work that we've done on elevating the brand across all the touch points, the work we've done on inventory, on product on brand from distribution that enables that. We are at a stage now where we think the conditions are set for us to execute that in North America. So as you mentioned, we now have about a quarter under our belt in the factory outlet channel, which is where we started. We're encouraged both by the way the teams have executed, they've done a terrific job. And the consumer response across the board because we saw significant AUR growth. Now AUR growth in isolation doesn't make any growth that needs to drive comps, and we're pleased with the 4% comp growth that we achieved in North America. In terms of then expanding this across the ecosystem for North America, the plan is actually to do that now. So literally, as we speak, we are implementing pricing for the consumer on the floors, both in our full-price stores that have wholesale, leveraging the learnings that we've picked up in our execution in factory outlets. And we're at the very beginning of this journey, we were quite encouraged by what we've seen so far. And to the point on your guidance long term relative to our expectations for AUR growth, we continue to expect AUR to grow low to mid-single digits throughout the lifetime of the plan."

So let me answer the AUR gross margin question first, and then I'll go to North America wholesale. So we're really encouraged with what we saw in North America in Q3 from a gross margin standpoint, led by the AUR increases with comp growth. Those AUR increases really reflected our ability to both continue our discount reduction journey. We are starting to see a nice contribution from product mix and the elevation of products, better assortments, better rebalancing in the core, the things we've been talking about. So early stages, but we're starting to see that in this quarter. And then the consumer response to the ticket increases were also very positive. So that's what's giving me confidence in continued gross margin expansion. Obviously, we've guided that for Q4, but I do think that the things that we've called out as durable. Reductions in promotions, targeted consumer value-oriented price increases, product mix benefits and then some tailwind benefits from geographic and channel shifts, those things are durable. And we're able to manage some of the cost inflation and tariff impact through the work -- through working those levers. So I continue to remain optimistic that gross margin is a driver for us today. Obviously, we have guided to for the future, but it's also durable to the plan. Now the magnitude will have -- we're pretty clear on our guidance. But I'm encouraged, and I think it's a strength for us. So good progress there. Then if I turn to your North America wholesale question, I would tell you that, again, off-price was down, I would say, meaningfully more than our full-price business. So double-digit decline last year, double-digit decline this year. And again, the flow of off-price is related to excess flow. Our inventory is clean. And so we're really, I think, looking at that channel from a strategic standpoint than where it should be, which is they're good partners to us. They're an opportunistic way for us to liquidate excess, and that's what you're seeing come through. In terms of the timing of North America wholesale covering, we know that, that will take some time, right. So what is encouraging to us is that we're on the right track, strong comp growth in DTC in North America this quarter. The underlying trend in comp is encouraging. While I still think quarter-by-quarter, there will be some choppiness, the underlying trend is encouraging. And we believe that we're taking the right actions wholesale, as Patrice called out, in terms of rebalancing assortments, focusing on sell-out, which we did see improve this quarter, and restarting some targeted marketing within the channel that's showing some very early signs of positive trends. So we're pleased with that. And we're overall pleased with our marketing investments and the way they're enabling our brand elevation and price increases. So still encourages how that will flow through on OI margin."

So if you'd ask me for a number, I'd probably say 2 out of 9. I think we see opportunities to actually, in the context of the brand elevation strategy, to increase our presence in higher-end wholesale where we see opportunities both in North America and actually around the world. We're also in kind of the current wholesale footprint, you know we've reduced it significantly already, right. We're down 25% from where we were about 3 years ago to make sure that the brand shows up in the right place. We continue to assess the locations on a very regular basis, working closely with our partners. So this is also a dynamic process. As far as DTC is concerned, we believe we have opportunities, obviously, to continue to fuel our dot-com operations, right, which is a very important factor of the DTC part of our business. And also, similar to our thinking internationally with the introduction of Polo boutiques, we believe there is an opportunity in North America to expand our DTC footprint, smaller format stores. So that won't happen tomorrow morning. But as we look at kind of the next few years and where we want to take the brand and how we want to drive interactions with consumers across the country, we do believe there are opportunities to expand the footprint so that the brand is better represented in a more dispersed way across the entire country, all guided by our brand elevation strategy, right. That's really the filter that we use to decide where we should be and then how do we ensure the differentiation is very clear by channel for the consumer, both online and brick-and-mortar, so that he or she knows exactly what to get in which location and how the brand will show up differently based on the different environments."

Why don't I why don't I unpack your question in terms of the guidance first and in terms of revenue upside. What we are seeing, and I think we called it out in the script is obviously, Hong Kong will have a more meaningful impact as we head into the fourth quarter. We've seen travel bookings deteriorate from the third to the fourth quarter, and this is obviously a big quarter for Hong Kong, given that it was a lunar new year. And so we called out that we had about a 3-point impact to Asia comp in the third quarter, that leads to about a 5-point impact in the fourth quarter. So that's one factor this going into that. And then we called out some digital commerce that we had a very big stronger-than-expected digital commerce. As we look at that and underneath the covers of that in both Europe and in North America, what we saw is that we sold out stronger at full price. We had less inventory seeding clearance in the fourth quarter. That's a good quality of sales move and we're pleased with this. And so you'll see some of that sitting on our digital comps in the fourth quarter as we move forward. We also have some -- given the shorter holiday season, we move to fulfill demand to make sure consumers had a good service experience. And we'll have slight -- we'll have some more process returns in the fourth quarter, and we were less promotional at the end of the third quarter. So those are some things that are sitting in digital. So those 2 things are the biggest things that are guiding our fourth quarter revenue call."

But if we take a snapshot, today, for us in China, we have about half of our fleets closed. So about -- we are about 110 stores, so roughly half of that is closed as we speak today. And obviously, we monitor that very closely. As far as supply chain is concerned, well, first, the other thing I would say relative to our business penetration in China, just for the benefit of the whole group is, while the China opportunity is a massive growth opportunity for us, to some extent, it's a blessing to be underpenetrated today because our business today, China represents less than 4% of the total company business. Now, we still are very bullish about our ability to win long term in that region and very excited about what we can do there. On the supply chain front, I'd say, same thing on a very dynamic situation. We have been working, as you know, over the past year, 2 years to diversify our supply chain so that we're less dependent on one market, less dependent on China. So we have a greater ability to leverage a footprint that's much broader and much more flexible. It's -- we're in the middle of the Lunar New Year vacation. We'll need to see and which has been extended by week, we'll need to see how employees return to the various factories post the vacation. So we're watching it. We are working on being as agile as possible, and we'll make sure we make the best of the situation that we're dealing with. The priority in all of this, right, because this is a human -- we can't lose sight of the human dimension of all this, obviously, is to make sure that our employees are safe, our consumers are safe and that we follow very closely the guidance, both from the local and the global authorities on this health crisis."

We're not going to move our entire supply chain to 16 days. What's key, our lens is to understand what is the timing required to be well positioned to win a specific category in a specific geography in a specific channel. So we still have kind of our 9-, 6-, 3-month lead times. And then there are some projects where we want to have this ability to react in the span of days. The specific project, Erinn, so sweatshirt, I believe, manufactured in Mainland China. And something that's replicable, which is why we shared it as an example. It's a pilot, but I think it's an indication also that our organization is becoming more agile, more aggressive in terms of how we manage time lines and also more creative.

So great progress by our supply chain in that area. And then to the second part of your question regarding what we're seeing -- what we saw on Polo and the Lauren brands. We did see across the company that the Polo brand really drove our And we -- and it's specifically in North America wholesale, we saw the Polo brand be stable and a driver for us. The Lauren brand, we're seeing some positive signs, but they're very early based on the marketing that Patrice called out and some targeted work that we're doing with our wholesale partners, that, one, makes us believe that the Lauren opportunity is an opportunity in North America wholesale, that our consumer is still there. And that when we assort into the right categories with the right product quality and right consumer value, that the consumer will respond. And so we saw some encouraging trends there. I'd say too early to call the turnaround. It will take some time, but it's an encouraging sign."

We're making good progress on wear to work. Probably the key thing to highlight here is the way we are complementing our line on -- particularly on Polo Women's and some of the work that's also underway on Lauren, to really make sure that we have the right offering to meet that kind of wear to work consumer need. So good progress there. And if you remember, this is an oversimplified, but we really want to shift to being a kind of 7-day brand solution as opposed to maybe 2 or 3 days a week both for men and women. So I'm encouraged by the progress we're making there. As far as footwear and accessories, so we had talked about the fact that Investor Day that footwear and accessories progress and impact would be more backloaded in the 5-year program, which is why you're seeing further acceleration on outerwear and denim first but we are making good progress on footwear and accessories. Job 1 first is really building capability, right, working with Ralph and having the right design talent both on bags and on shoes. We brought some extraordinary talent from key players in this space that have joined us over the past year, 1.5 years. So that we make sure we've got people that really understand fundamentally how these categories work. And then now working on bringing these products to life in the market. These things take a bit of time, so I expect the impact to be most visible in the outer years of the plan. But we're starting to see some encouraging signs on different parts of the portfolio that give us confidence that we're making the right progress and that we will see the benefits that we expect from those 2 categories as well."

Over the important holiday season, our teams consistently executed across each of our strategic priorities, enabling us to elevate our brand and deliver for our consumers across every touch point. The solid foundations we've put into place to reposition and elevate our brands helped to drive positive comp growth across all 3 regions, excluding the impact of Hong Kong this quarter. 
We were also encouraged by AUR growth of 6% and as we invest in brand elevation through our products, marketing, distribution and unique consumer experiences. At the same time, we continue to execute key initiatives to stabilize our North America business against an evolving retail landscape.
 
As I've shared before, the 3 principles underlying this work include: putting the consumer at the center of everything we do; elevating the brand across all consumer touch points; and balancing growth and productivity. And we are doing all of this while managing through volatile industry dynamics including the recent coronavirus outbreak, which we are actively monitoring. Our top priorities are to keep our employees and consumers safe and to heed the advice of local and international health authorities. The situation is a dynamic one, and we will continue to assess the implications for our business across retail, corporate and our supply base. Our thoughts are with the many impacted by this virus. 
During the third quarter, we drove our performance across the 5 strategic priorities that we laid out as part of our 5-year plan to deliver long-term sustainable growth and value creation. These include: first, win over a new generation of consumers; second, energize core products and accelerate high-potential underdeveloped categories; third, drive targeted expansion in our regions and channels; fourth, lead with digital across all activities; and fifth, operate with discipline to show growth. 
Starting with win over a new generation of consumers. We're investing in media channels that matter most to consumers today, namely digital and social, and remain on track towards our long-term marketing investment target of 5% of sales. In the third quarter, marketing increased 16% to last year as we shifted investments back into the key holiday selling period. 
We are encouraged by consumer engagement across generations through our campaigns and programs. Notably, our total social media followers surpassed 40 million in the third quarter, a double-digit increase to last year, led by a 30% organic increase on Instagram. 
Let me touch on some of the highlights from our holiday campaigns this quarter. First, we launched a fully integrated holiday campaign across social media, television, our own stores and digital sites and wholesale environments, which we called Every Moment is a Gift. Among the exciting activations online, we drove strong engagement through our Snapchat holiday shopping filter and our first ever global digital game, The Holiday Run, where our iconic Polo bear dash through the streets of New York City, Paris, London and Tokyo to collect festive bubbles and signature Ralph Lauren products. 
We also launched a digitally-targeted campaign for our Lauren women's ready-to-wear business in North America this season, featuring supermodel and mom, Lily Aldridge, along with her family. It was the first dedicated campaign for the brand in many years that had significant media support behind it. We were encouraged by the early consumer response as we work to get the Lauren women's business back on a positive trajectory. 
On our North American mobile app, we drove a successful 7 days 7 drops program, featuring limited edition releases and one-of-a-kind experiences.  The highlight of the week was our 5 Horseman rugby shirt, which sold out in just 15 minutes online. And congratulations to Ralph Lauren Golf Ambassador, Justin Thomas. He captured his 12th career win at the Century Tournament of Champions last month, wearing RLX to capture the #1 spot in the FedEx Cup standings. 
Moving on to our second key initiative, energize core products and accelerate high-potential underdeveloped categories. In the third quarter, Ralph and our design team drove excitement in core product categories while also expanding into our 5 high-potential underdeveloped categories. While we were pleased with the overall performance of these categories, our outerwear and fleece programs were the clear standouts this holiday, outperforming our total sales trends on both the sell-in and sell-out basis. Popular styles included heavyweight parkas, quilted car coats, light and mid-weight down jackets, wind breakers and sherpa styles. Other successes this season included woven shirts, sweaters and denim. 
In addition to the holiday drops in our mobile app, we released our limited edition Polo sports outdoors collection in November. The products retailed on our own digital commerce sites, North America app and select flagship stores around the world. We also partnered with influential specialty retailers, including Bodega, Fred Segal, Essence,  Browns in the U.K. and Beams in Asia. 
Other exciting projects this quarter included an exclusive holiday capsule with Zalando, the Polo Sport collaboration with Musinsa, one of the largest fashion online retailers in Korea, and the WeChat mini program for Singles Day in China. 
Moving on to our third key initiative, drive targeted expansion in our regions and channels. Our long-term expansion strategy remains focused on building a cohesive elevated Ralph Lauren experience across our retail, wholesale and digital commerce presence in key cities around the world. 
During the third quarter, we opened 48 new owned and operated stores and concessions globally and goes 31 locations. This included 37 openings in Asia. We also continue to invest in door refreshes across our own stores and wholesale partners in key markets as we work to elevate our fleet across every touch point. 
Our city-by-city ecosystem approach drove strong results in the quarter, with Chinese Mainland sales up more than 30% in constant currency, driven by comp growth and new stores. Total China sales were up 6% to last year in constant currency, despite headwinds in Hong Kong that we discussed last quarter. 
In Europe, we opened 6 owned and partnered full-price stores including Polo boutiques in Covent Garden in London, Torino, Aix-en-Provence and Lisbon. We're making good progress, but we still have significant expansion opportunities with only 46 full-price stores across Europe, with all of this complemented by our successful expansion into new specialty wholesale accounts and digital commerce growth.  Which brings me to our fourth key initiative, lead with digital. Our global digital ecosystem, including our directly operated flagship sites, departmentstore.com, pure players and social commerce, increased low double digits in the third quarter in constant currency. The strong performance exceeded our expectations across all 3 regions. This was driven by double-digit growth in Europe and Asia, with North America up high single digits, improving from flat performance in the first half. 
Starting with Europe. Digital sales were up high teens in the quarter, with solid performance across both owned and wholesale digital accounts led by digital pure-play retailers. We added 6 new partners, including LUISAVIAROMA in Italy, SOCKSHOP in the U.K. & Brown Hamburg in Germany. 
Our directly operated digital sites in Europe also saw further momentum, delivering 15% comp growth this quarter. Highlights included the November launch of Polo mobile app in the U.K., our first app launch outside of North America, and the new digital commerce flagship for Switzerland, as we expand our localization efforts by market. 
In Asia, digital ecosystem sales were also up double digits, led by the Chinese Mainland. We launched new partnerships this quarter with MYER in Australia as well as Tmall's luxury selected platform in China. Lastly, our digital growth in China accelerated on the launch of buy online, ship from store fulfillment to leverage our store inventories. These omni-channel orders contributed to roughly half of our digital growth in the quarter. 
Turning to North America. Third quarter comps on RalphLauren.com were up 6%, largely in line with our expectations. We saw softness from international consumers due to FX and import restrictions in Asia, similar to the first half of the year. However, sales to domestic shoppers grew single digits as we started to drive improvements in mobile, tight personalization and rebalancing our buys to emphasize stronger selling core and seasonal core products. 
Lastly, we continue to build partnerships with newer digital platforms in North America which are extending our reach to new and younger consumers. In the third quarter, we launched Women's Polo on Daily Look, a premium subscription-based personal styling service; and Men's Polo on Simmons, a specialty designer boutique online. We also added kids to Rent the Runway, joining our Lauren, Women's Polo and Club Monaco brands on the platform. 
Touching on our fifth key initiative, operate with discipline to show growth. In the third quarter, we focused on challenging every cost and improving our efficiencies. Adjusted operating margin expanded 10 basis points, slightly ahead of our expectations with stronger-than-expected top line growth, partly offset by the planned timing of higher investments around holiday marketing and new stores. 
One important margin driver for us and a central part of our Next Great Chapter strategy is raising AUR to elevate the brand globally and create value. We're using multiple levers to realize AUR increases, including lower discounts, elevated product mix geographic and channel shifts and strategic ticket price increases.  We began phasing in strategic ticket price increases in our North America factory outlet channel in late September, followed by our North America full price wholesale and direct-to-consumer doors in spring '20. Leveraging the success we've had implementing this strategy in Asia and Europe, these ticket increases reflect our competitive benchmarking analysis and our focus on providing a superior value proposition for our consumers. 
We were encouraged by the impact of these initial price increases this fall. While traffic was still a headwind for our factory business, we were able to drive positive comps in this channel through an 8% increase in AUR in the quarter. This was on top of 8% AUR growth last year and well above our expectations. Though it is still early in this journey, we are focused on elevating our brand positioning in the North American market and globally as part of our AUR-led strategy. 
And finally, I want to provide an update on our journey to further integrate citizenship and sustainability into our business. More than 50 years ago, Ralph built our company based on the idea of timelessness, creating products that are meant to be worn, love and passed on to the next generation. This continues to inspire everything we do as we build the business to deliver value for our shareholders and all of our stakeholders for the next 50 years.  As part of this work, in December, we announced a new commitment to power all of our globally-owned and operated offices, distribution centers and stores with 100% renewable electricity by 2025. We also took the Arctic shipping pledge, committing to reroute shipping to avoid the environmentally delicate Artic area. 
Driving diversity and inclusion across our business is another important piece of this work, and we are pleased to report that we have achieved our gender parity goal of equal representation in our leadership positions at the VP level and above more than 3 years ahead of our target. 
In closing, Ralph and I are energized by our team's execution over the important holiday quarter, and we are encouraged by the progress we are making on our Next Great Chapter plan across the business. While we are mindful of the challenges across our markets globally, we are intensely focused on delivering on the commitments we have made across every aspect of our business as we look to drive long-term sustainable growth and value creation for all of our stakeholders. 
And before I turn it over to Jane, sadly, I want to note the recent passing of our long-time board member and friend, Arnold Aronson. On behalf of Ralph and the entire organization, I want to express our deepest gratitude for his kindness, wisdom and service to our company over nearly 2 decades. 
Now over to Jane, and I'll join her at the end to answer your questions."

Our third quarter results demonstrates solid execution of our strategy through this holiday season and our team's agility in navigating a dynamic global geopolitical and retail environment. We delivered top",2197,"Thank you, Patrice, and good morning, everyone. Our third quarter results demonstrates solid execution of our strategy through this holiday season and our team's agility in navigating a dynamic global geopolitical and retail environment. We delivered top and bottom line growth and good progress across key metrics, including 6% AUR growth, double-digit growth in digital commerce and growth and operating margin expansion, coupled with solid inventory control. 
Third quarter revenues increased 1% on a reported basis and 2% in constant currency. Every region posted positive revenue growth driven by mid-single-digit constant currency growth in Europe and Asia, despite the ongoing headwinds in Hong Kong, as well as slight growth in North America. Excluding the impact of Hong Kong, total company top line grew 2.5% in constant currency and every region delivered positive comps as we work to elevate our brand across every consumer touch point, drive product quality, reduce promotional levels and enhance our digital presence. 
Adjusted gross margin was up 60 basis points in the third quarter, both on a reported and constant currency basis. Gross margins benefited from AUR growth of 6% on better pricing, lower promotions and elevated product mix, along with favorable channel and geographic mix. These more than offset investments in product elevation and sustainability and diversification of our supply chain. 
Looking ahead, we are encouraged by the early results of our fall pricing actions and expect our AUR strength to continue through the rest of the year, driving our full year expectation of low single-digit AUR growth for fiscal '20. 
Our inventory positions for both our direct-to-consumer and wholesale businesses are current and well controlled coming out of this holiday season. And we remain focused on managing our inventories with discipline and leveraging our supply chain agility and responsiveness. 
Adjusted operating margin in the third quarter was 14%, up 10 basis points on a reported basis and in constant currency. Adjusted operating profit dollars grew 3% to last year. Adjusted operating expense increased to 48.2% of sales, up 50 basis points to last year, both on a reported basis and in constant currency. 
Marketing was the key driver, with spending up 16% in the quarter as we shifted investments back into the key holiday selling period versus last year's focus on our 50th anniversary show and related events in the second quarter. We still expect marketing spend to grow ahead of sales for the full year fiscal '20 as we invest behind our brands with an emphasis on digital media. 
Excluding marketing, our adjusted operating expense leveraged 20 basis points to last year as our teams generated operating efficiencies across our business. Some key highlights from third quarter include: first, we continue to drive efficiencies across our end-to-end supply chain, including incremental savings across facilities, labor, airfreight and consolidation of materials, all contributing to mitigate the impact of tariffs. This work is also delivering an improved experience for our consumers, including faster delivery speeds on digital orders. 
Over the peak holiday period, for example, we more than doubled our penetration of orders delivered in 2 days or less over the prior year. We also piloted a new fast track model in the quarter, where we were able to meaningfully accelerate the development of special product concepts from design to shelf. Leveraging our investments in digital product development, we designed, produced and delivered an exclusive fleece sweater to a key wholesale customer in just 16 days, right in time for Black Friday. While just one early example, we expect this model to be a growing part of our supply chain as we continue our progress toward our 3-, 6- and 9-month lead time targets. 
Moving on to segment performance, starting with North America. Revenue increased slightly in the third quarter as strong growth in our retail business more than offset wholesale revenue declines. Adjusted operating margin was 22.3%, a 30 basis point decrease to last year, with operating margin expansion in our retail businesses more than offset by SG&A deleverage in our wholesale business on lower sales. 
In the retail channel in North America, comps were up 4% and ahead of our expectations, driven by 4% brick-and-mortar comps and 6% comps on our owned digital commerce site. Brick-and-mortar comps were driven by an 8% increase in AUR on top of 7% growth last year. This strong growth reflects our targeted price increases and a reduction in promotions, along with an improved product offering, new marketing activations and rebalanced assortments towards stronger selling core and underpenetrated categories.  We also made key operational improvements such as the roll out of RFID technology across our fleet to improve out-of-stock replenishment sales. In addition, new staffing optimization tools in our stores drove productivity and improved service in peak periods.  Our factory business led our AUR increase in North America with improved conversion. While traffic continued to be a headwind in the channel, we are focused on driving better traffic trends through enhanced digital marketing and refreshed and differentiated store experiences. 
Comps in our North America directly-operated digital commerce business were up 6%. Our investments in mobile, personalization and site navigation drove positive growth from domestic consumers in the third quarter. 
Our digital business also benefited from favorable product mix towards categories like outerwear and fleece, along with a timing shift into the third quarter as we saw higher sell-through in the holiday period versus clearance period in Q4. Excluding this shift, we still expect second half comps to improve incrementally compared to first half comps. 
Sales to international shoppers purchasing on our U.S. site and shipping to U.S. addresses remained soft in the third quarter and should remain a headwind through the rest of fiscal '20. 
Moving on to North America wholesale. Third quarter revenue declined 8%, in line with expectations. Excluding a decline in off price sales, our underlying North America wholesale business was also down high single digits. However, our full-price sellout improved from recent trends. In the near term, we are focused on improving the consumer experience in the wholesale channel through in-store refreshes, expansion into underpenetrated categories and increased marketing. 
Our inventories in the wholesale channel are clean and down on a year-over-year basis. We are driving a more favorable product mix, emphasizing core categories and testing targeted brand marketing for Lauren Women's. We continue to expect it will take some time for our wholesale business to start reflecting these strategic improvements, which have shown success in our direct-to-consumer channels. 
Moving on to Europe. Third quarter revenue was up 3% on a reported basis and 5% in constant currency. Adjusted operating margin expanded 300 basis points both on reported and constant currency basis. Operating margin expansion was driven by strong gross margins and SG&A leverage. 
In retail channels in Europe, comps were up 3%, driven by a 15% increase in our own digital commerce sites and a 2% increase in our brick-and-mortar stores. The increase in our directly operated European digital commerce business was above our expectations, driven by strong AUR growth, solid merchandising execution and traffic increases, along with the shift in seasonal product sales, similar to our North America site.  Across our Europe direct-to-consumer channels, our ongoing efforts to elevate the brand and improve product mix continued in the third quarter, with AUR up 10% on top of an 11% increase last year. This is consistent with our long-term strategy to drive higher quality of sales and price harmonization in the marketplace. 
Wholesale revenue in Europe was up 5% in constant currency and also ahead of our expectations. Similar to Q2, the strong performance reflected solid sell out trends driving stronger reorders, particularly with our digital pure play partners. 
Turning to Asia. Revenue was up 5% on both a reported and constant currency basis in the third quarter. Excluding the impact of Hong Kong, where protest-related store closures and tourism declines were an ongoing headwind, Asia revenues were up 9%. This solid performance was driven by several markets in Asia, led by Chinese Mainland sales growth of over 30% in constant currency. Our product and marketing initiatives are resonating well in this region and we continue to drive our digital efforts, expand and elevate our store fleet and engage with local influencers and celebrities. 
Comps in Asia decreased 1%, with slight AUR declines. Excluding Hong Kong, Asia comps were up 2%. Store closures and traffic decline to Hong Kong remained a challenge in the third quarter, but we were able to partially mitigate some of this impact by pulling forward a friends-and-family event in our factory stores. We continue to expect Hong Kong to remain a near-term headwind, especially with the emerging impact of the coronavirus, as Patrice mentioned. 
Adjusted operating margin was down 50 basis points to last year on a reported basis and down 70 basis points in constant currency, driven by SG&A deleverage in Hong Kong. Excluding Hong Kong, margins were up 130 basis points in constant currency. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we continue to return capital to our shareholders. We ended the quarter with about $1.9 billion in cash and investments and $694 million in total debt, which compares to $2.1 billion in cash and investments and $687 million in debt at the end of last year's third quarter. 
We repurchased $98 million in shares in the third quarter for a total of $498 million in repurchases year-to-date. We will continue to opportunistically buy back stock and remain on track to complete our target of about $600 million in repurchases for full fiscal '20. 
Moving on to inventory. At the end of the third quarter, inventory was down 1% to last year and flat in constant currency. We still expect to end the year with inventories relatively aligned to our sales outlook. 
Now I'd like to turn to guidance for the full year and fourth quarter of fiscal '20. As a reminder, this guidance excludes restructuring and related charges and reflects our best assessment of the global retail landscape in the context of increased volatility from macroeconomic and geopolitical events. Specifically, our outlook still incorporates the impact of tariffs, Brexit and protest-related business disruption in Hong Kong. 
At this early stage, our guidance does not include potential impact from the coronavirus outbreak, given the dynamic nature of the situation. However, we are monitoring developments closely and will be transparent about the expected impact, providing updates if needed. 
For full year fiscal '20, we still expect revenues to be in the range of 2% to 3% growth in constant currency. Based on a better-than-expected holiday, revenue should be slightly better than the low end of the range we guided to last quarter. Foreign currency is expected to have about 110 to 130 basis points of negative impact on revenue growth based on currency shifts. We now expect operating margin expansion at the high end of our previous range of 40 to 60 basis points in constant currency, driven primarily by gross margin expansion and slight SG&A leverage. Foreign currency is estimated to have about 10 basis points of negative impact on operating margin in fiscal '20. 
Based on the timing of shipments, our guidance now assumes a little less than $10 million of negative tariff impact to our fiscal '20 cost of goods. We expect the majority of this impact in our fourth quarter. However, based on our supply chain diversification out of China and recent tariff reductions, we estimate tariffs will have about $12 million to $15 million of total impact in fiscal '21. We now expect our full year tax rate to be about 20%.  For the fourth quarter of fiscal '20, we expect revenues to be up slightly, both on a constant currency and on a reported basis. Foreign currency is expected to negatively impact revenue growth by about 50 basis points in the quarter. We expect protest disruptions in Hong Kong to negatively impact our Asia comp by about 5 points in the quarter. 
Operating margin for the fourth quarter is expected to be up slightly in constant currency and on a reported basis, similar to Q3. This is primarily due to timing of SG&A investments, with our highest number of new store openings weighted to the back half of the year, largely offsetting gross margin expansion in the quarter. 
Fourth quarter tax rate is estimated at 26%, above our full year expected rate based on our expectation of discrete onetime items. We look forward to sharing the details of our fiscal '21 guidance when we report our fiscal year-end in May. 
In closing, we are proud of the focus, agility and passion our teams around the world demonstrated this holiday quarter. Guided by Ralph's vision, our teams elevated our brand, delivering comp, AUR and profit growth, all while maintaining disciplined on inventories and costs.  While we are navigating and watching the challenges in the broader environment closely, we are, first and foremost, committed to the safety of our employees, partners and consumers. We believe we have the right strategy and team to deliver across our strategic priorities and create value for the long term. 
With that, let's open up the call for your questions."

Well, let me just step back a little bit to kind of give you the overall with how we're thinking about this. The first thing I would say is brand elevation is really at the core of our strategy, right, and AUR is obviou",421,"Great. Thank you for your question. Well, let me just step back a little bit to kind of give you the overall with how we're thinking about this. The first thing I would say is brand elevation is really at the core of our strategy, right, and AUR is obviously have been a key component to that. The second point on AUR is we have 4 drivers for AUR that we're working on. One is pulling back on promotional support. And actually, in the last quarter, we reduced our promotional pressure. The second is leveraging product mix, and you saw us invest in categories that had higher AUR like outerwear and fleece. The third is obviously leveraging geographic and channel mix. And then the final point is, indeed, targeted pricing. 
Now we've actually started this journey of taking targeted pricing in the context of this broader AUR strategy in international, I'd say, past 18, 24 months, and we've been pleased with the results that we've achieved there. But it's really important to understand that it isn't just pricing in isolation, it's the result of work that we've done on elevating the brand across all the touch points, the work we've done on inventory, on product, on brand from distribution that enables that. We are at a stage now where we think the conditions are set for us to execute that in North America. So as you mentioned, we've now have about a quarter under our belt in the factory outlet channel, which is where we started. We're encouraged both by the way the teams have executed, they've done a terrific job. And the consumer response across the board because we saw significant AUR growth. Now AUR growth in isolation doesn't make any significant growth that needs to drive comps, and we're pleased with the 4% comp growth that we achieved in North America. 
In terms of then expanding this across the ecosystem for North America, the plan is actually to do that now. So literally, as we speak, we are implementing pricing for the consumer on the floors, both in our full-price stores that have wholesale, leveraging the learnings that we've picked up in our execution in factory outlets. And we're at the very beginning of this journey, we were quite encouraged by what we've seen so far. And to the point on your guidance long term relative to our expectations for AUR growth, we continue to expect AUR to grow low to mid-single digits throughout the lifetime of the plan."

I want to ask you, in North America, wholesale down 8% was a bigger decline than we've seen since maybe fourth quarter last year, and you were going against a big off-price correction in the fourth quarter last year, lapping a negative 10%. If I add this to some comments you just made on now starting to raise prices in wholesale, I'm trying to think how you guys think about the North America wholesale numbers going forward from here? Obviously, the compare gets easier. You've got some pricing, but then, do you think we're at a point where we can -- you can see turning a corner on North America wholesale turning positive yet at some point during the course of fiscal '21? 
And then I also want to ask you about how you're thinking through all the dynamics you just laid out about margins for next year. It sounds like you're happy with how the increased marketing is going. Obviously, the results are there on the top line. But I'm wondering how your thinking about gross margin as well for next year, which has been a nice contributor for several years now. I mean you did say AUR should keep moving in the right place, you're happy with tickets. So I'm wondering if we can -- if you still think that the gross margin and SG&A dynamics we've seen in the first 2 years, the plan should be similar next year?"

So let me answer the AUR gross margin question first, and then I'll go to North America wholesale. 
So we're really encouraged with what we saw in North America in Q3 from a gross margin standpoint, led by the AUR increases with comp growth. Those AUR increases really reflected our ability to both continue our discount reduction journey. We are starting to see a nice contribution from product mix and the elevation of products, better assortments, better rebalancing in the core, the things we've been talking about. So early stages, but we're starting to see that in this quarter. And then the consumer response to the ticket increases were also very positive. So that's what's giving me confidence in continued gross margin expansion. Obviously, we've guided that for Q4, but I do think that the things that we've called out as durable. Reductions in promotions, targeted consumer value-oriented price increases, product mix benefits and then some tailwind benefits from geographic and channel shifts, those things are durable. And we're able to manage some of the cost inflation and tariff impact through the work -- through working those levers. So I continue to remain optimistic that gross margin is a driver for us today. Obviously, what I've guided to for the future, but it's also durable to the plan. Now the magnitude will have -- we're pretty clear on our guidance. But I'm encouraged, and I think it's a strength for us. So good progress there. Then if I turn to your North America wholesale question, I would tell you that, again, off-price was down, I would say, meaningfully more than our full-price business. So double-digit decline last year, double-digit decline this year. And again, the flow of off-price is related to excess flow. Our inventory is clean. And so we're really, I think, looking at that channel from a strategic standpoint the way it should be, which is they're good partners to us. They're an opportunistic way for us to liquidate excess, and that's what you're seeing come through. 
In terms of the timing of North America wholesale covering, we know that, that will take some time, right. So what is encouraging to us is that we're on the right track, strong comp growth in DTC in North America this quarter. The underlying trend in comp is encouraging. While I still think quarter-by-quarter, there will be some choppiness, the underlying trend is encouraging. And we believe that we're taking the right actions in wholesale, as Patrice called out, in terms of rebalancing assortments, focusing on sell-out, which we did see improve this quarter, and restarting some targeted marketing within the channel that's showing some very early signs of positive trends. So we're pleased with that. And we're overall pleased with our marketing investments and the way they're enabling our brand elevation and price increases. So still encourages how that will flow through on OI margin."

So if you'd ask me for a number, I'd probably say 2 out of 9. I think we see opportunities to actually, in the context of the brand elevation strategy, to increase our presence in higher-end wholesale where we see opportunities both in North America and actually around the world. We're also in kind of the current wholesale footprint, you know we've reduced it significantly already, right. We're down 25% from where we were about 3 years ago to make sure that the brand shows up in the right place. We continue to assess the locations on a very regular basis, working closely with our partners. So this is also a dynamic process. 
As far as DTC is concerned, we believe we have opportunities, obviously, to continue to fuel our dot-com operations, right, which is a very important factor of the DTC part of our business. And also, similar to our thinking internationally with the introduction of Polo boutiques, we believe there is an opportunity in North America to expand our DTC footprint, smaller format stores. So that won't happen tomorrow morning. But as we look at kind of the next few years and where we want to take the brand and how we want to drive interactions with consumers across the country, we do believe there are opportunities to expand the footprint so that the brand is better represented in a more dispersed way across the entire country, all guided by our brand elevation strategy, right. That's really the filter that we use to decide where we should be and then how do we ensure the differentiation is very clear by channel for the consumer, both online and brick-and-mortar, so that he or she knows exactly what to get in which location and how the brand will show up differently based on the different environments."

Especially with all the AUR upticks, it feels like an easier comparison in the fiscal fourth quarter. It feels like there could be some opportunity for revenue upside there. Is there something I'm missing?  
And then a follow-up on the coronavirus and maybe it's related. We're hearing stories of double-digit million population cities that are a bit like ghost towns right now and some pretty significant comp declines. Wondering if you're seeing any meaningful impact in your business in real time? And is there anything on the supply chain side we should think about in terms of disruption there potentially?"

Why don't I  unpack your question in terms of the guidance first and in terms of revenue upside. What we are seeing, and I think we called it out in the script is obviously, Hong Kong will have a more meaningful impact as we head into the fourth quarter. We've seen travel bookings deteriorate from the third to the fourth quarter, and this is obviously a big quarter for Hong Kong, given that it was a Lunar New Year. And so we called out that we had about a 3-point impact to Asia comp in the third quarter, that leads to about a 5-point impact in the fourth quarter. So that's one factor that's going into that. And then we called out some digital commerce that we had a very big stronger-than-expected digital commerce. As we look at that and underneath the covers of that in both Europe and in North America, what we saw is that we sold out stronger at full price. We had less inventory seeding clearance in the fourth quarter. That's a good quality of sales move and we're pleased with this. And so you'll see some of that sitting on our digital comps in the fourth quarter as we move forward. We also have some -- given the shorter holiday season, we move to fulfill demand to make sure consumers had a good service experience. And we'll have slight -- we'll have some more process returns in the fourth quarter, and we were less promotional at the end of the third quarter. So those are some things that are sitting in digital. So those 2 things are the biggest things that are guiding our fourth quarter revenue call."

But if we take a snapshot, today, for us in China, we have about half of our fleets closed. So about -- we are about 110 stores, so roughly half of that is closed as we speak today. And obviously, we monitor that very closely. As far as supply chain is concerned, well, first, the other thing I would say relative to our business penetration in China, just for the benefit of the whole group is, while the China opportunity is a massive growth opportunity for us, to some extent, it's a blessing to be underpenetrated today because our business today -- China represents less than 4% of the total company business. Now, we still are very bullish about our ability to win long term in that region and very excited about what we can do there. 
On the supply chain front, I'd say, same thing on a very dynamic situation. We have been working, as you know, over the past year, 2 years, to diversify our supply chain so that we're less dependent on one market, less dependent on China. So we have a greater ability to leverage a footprint that's much broader and much more flexible. It's -- we're in the middle of the Lunar New Year vacation. We'll need to see, and which has been extended by a week, we'll need to see how employees return to the various factories post the vacation. So we're watching it. We are working on being as agile as possible, and we'll make sure we make the best of the situation that we're dealing with. The priority in all of this, right, because this is a human -- we can't lose sight of the human dimension of all this, obviously, is to make sure that our employees are safe, our consumers are safe and that we follow very closely the guidance, both from the local and the global authorities on this health crisis."

It was a sweatshirt that we developed with one of our wholesale partners. And we did execute it from ideas to delivery to the partner in 16 days. We're not going to move our entire supply chain to 16 days. What's key -- our lens is to understand what is the timing required to be well positioned to win a specific category, in a specific geography, in a specific channel. So we still have kind of our 9-, 6-, 3-month lead times. And then there are some projects where we want to have this ability to react in the span of days. The specific project, Erinn, was -- so sweatshirt, I believe, manufactured in Mainland China. And its' something that's replicable, which is why we shared it as an example. It's a pilot, but I think it's an indication also that our organization is becoming more agile, more aggressive in terms of how we manage time lines and also more creative. So I think you're going to continue to see from us faster lead times, but not just for the sake of lead times, also, just to understand what's required to win in the marketplace."

So great progress by our supply chain in that area. 
And then to the second part of your question regarding what we're seeing -- what we saw on Polo and the Lauren brands. We did see across the company that the Polo brand really drove our price. And we -- and it's specifically in North America wholesale, we saw the Polo brand be stable and a driver for us. The Lauren brand, we're seeing some positive signs, but they're very early based on the marketing that Patrice called out and some targeted work that we're doing with our wholesale partners, that, one, makes us believe that the Lauren opportunity is an opportunity in North America wholesale, that our consumer is still there. And that when we assort into the right categories with the right product quality and right consumer value, that the consumer will respond. And so we saw some encouraging trends there. I'd say too early to call the turnaround. It will take some time, but it's an encouraging sign."

On denim, also performed well for us, and that actually contributed to the solid trends on our men's business. I think the team is doing a very good job in terms of understanding the customer we want to serve, developing product that resonates and then finding a way to communicate and execute it in store in a way that really connects with the consumer. We're making good progress on wear to work. Probably the key thing to highlight here is the way we are complementing our line on -- particularly on Polo Women's and some of the work that's also underway on Lauren, to really make sure that we have the right offering to meet that kind of wear to work consumer need. So good progress there. And if you remember, this is an oversimplified, but we really want to shift to being a kind of 7-day brand solution as opposed to maybe 2 or 3 days a week, both for men and women. So I'm encouraged by the progress we're making there. 
As far as footwear and accessories, so we had talked about the fact at Investor Day that footwear and accessories progress and impact would be more backloaded in the 5-year program, which is why you're seeing further acceleration on outerwear and denim first but we are making good progress on footwear and accessories. Job 1 first is really building capability, right, working with Ralph and having the right design talent, both on bags and on shoes. We brought some extraordinary talent from key players in this space that have joined us over the past year, 1.5 years, so that we make sure we've got people that really understand fundamentally how these categories work. And then now working on bringing these products to life in the market. These things take a bit of time, so I expect the impact to be most visible in the outer years of the plan. But we're starting to see some encouraging signs on different parts of the portfolio that give us confidence that we're making the right progress and that we will see the benefits that we expect from those 2 categories as well."

We continue to make strong progress on our Next Great Chapter plan, with third quarter results ahead of our overall expectations, including better-than-expected revenues, operating margin and double-digit EPS growth. 
Over the important holiday season, our teams consistently executed across each of our strategic priorities, enabling us to elevate our brand and deliver for our consumers across every touch point. The solid foundations we've put into place to reposition and elevate our brands helped to drive positive comp growth across all 3 regions, excluding the impact of Hong Kong this quarter. 
We were also encouraged by AUR growth of 6% and as we invest in brand elevation through our products, marketing, distribution and unique consumer experiences. At the same time, we continue to execute key initiatives to stabilize our North America business against an evolving retail landscape.
 
As I've shared before, the 3 principles underlying this work include: putting the consumer at the center of everything we do; elevating the brand across all consumer touch points; and balancing growth and productivity. And we are doing all of this while managing through volatile industry dynamics including the recent coronavirus outbreak, which we are actively monitoring. Our top priorities are to keep our employees and consumers safe and to heed the advice of local and international health authorities. The situation is a dynamic one, and we will continue to assess the implications for our business across retail, corporate and our supply base. Our thoughts are with the many impacted by this virus. 
During the third quarter, we drove our performance across the 5 strategic priorities that we laid out as part of our 5-year plan to deliver long-term sustainable growth and value creation. These include: first, win over a new generation of consumers; second, energize core products and accelerate high-potential underdeveloped categories; third, drive targeted expansion in our regions and channels; fourth, lead with digital across all activities; and fifth, operate with discipline to show growth. 
Starting with win over a new generation of consumers. We're investing in media channels that matter most to consumers today, namely digital and social, and remain on track towards our long-term marketing investment target of 5% of sales. In the third quarter, marketing increased 16% to last year as we shifted investments back into the key holiday selling period. 
We are encouraged by consumer engagement across generations through our campaigns and programs. Notably, our total social media followers surpassed 40 million in the third quarter, a double-digit increase to last year, led by a 30% organic increase on Instagram. 
Let me touch on some of the highlights from our holiday campaigns this quarter. First, we launched a fully integrated holiday campaign across social media, television, our own stores and digital sites and wholesale environments, which we called Every Moment is a Gift. Among the exciting activations online, we drove strong engagement through our Snapchat holiday shopping filter and our first ever global digital game, The Holiday Run, where our iconic Polo bear dashed through the streets of New York City, Paris, London and Tokyo to collect festive bubbles and signature Ralph Lauren products. 
We also launched a digitally-targeted campaign for our Lauren women's ready-to-wear business in North America this season, featuring supermodel and mom, Lily Aldridge, along with her family. It was the first dedicated campaign for the brand in many years that had significant media support behind it. We were encouraged by the early consumer response as we work to get the Lauren women's business back on a positive trajectory. 
On our North American mobile app, we drove a successful 7 Days/7 Drops program, featuring limited edition releases and one-of-a-kind experiences.  The highlight of the week was our 5 Horsemen rugby shirt, which sold out in just 15 minutes online. And congratulations to Ralph Lauren Golf Ambassador, Justin Thomas. He captured his 12th career win at the Sentry Tournament of Champions last month, wearing RLX to capture the #1 spot in the FedEx Cup standings. 
Moving on to our second key initiative, energize core products and accelerate high-potential underdeveloped categories. In the third quarter, Ralph and our design team drove excitement in core product categories while also expanding into our 5 high-potential underdeveloped categories. While we were pleased with the overall performance of these categories, our outerwear and fleece programs were the clear standouts this holiday, outperforming our total sales trends on both the sell-in and sell-out basis. Popular styles included heavyweight parkas, quilted car coats, light and mid-weight down jackets, wind breakers and sherpa styles. Other successes this season included woven shirts, sweaters and denim. 
In addition to the holiday drops in our mobile app, we released our limited edition Polo sports outdoors collection in November. The products retailed on our own digital commerce sites, North America app and select flagship stores around the world. We also partnered with influential specialty retailers, including Bodega, Fred Segal, SSENSE, Brown's in the U.K. and Beams in Asia. 
Other exciting projects this quarter included an exclusive holiday capsule with Zalando, the Polo Sport collaboration with Musinsa, one of the largest fashion online retailers in Korea, and the WeChat mini program for Singles Day in China. 
Moving on to our third key initiative, drive targeted expansion in our regions and channels. Our long-term expansion strategy remains focused on building a cohesive, elevated Ralph Lauren experience across our retail, wholesale and digital commerce presence in key cities around the world. 
During the third quarter, we opened 48 new owned and operated stores and concessions globally and closed 31 locations. This included 37 openings in Asia. We also continue to invest in door refreshes across our own stores and wholesale partners in key markets as we work to elevate our fleet across every touch point. 
Our city-by-city ecosystem approach drove strong results in the quarter, with Chinese Mainland sales up more than 30% in constant currency, driven by comp growth and new stores. Total China sales were up 6% to last year in constant currency, despite headwinds in Hong Kong that we discussed last quarter. 
In Europe, we opened 6 owned and partnered full-price stores including Polo boutiques in Covent Garden in London, Torino, Aix-en-Provence and Lisbon. We're making good progress, but we still have significant expansion opportunities with only 46 full-price stores across Europe, with all of this complemented by our successful expansion into new specialty wholesale accounts and digital commerce growth. Which brings me to our fourth key initiative, lead with digital. Our global digital ecosystem, including our directly operated flagship sites, departmentstore.com, pure players and social commerce, increased low double digits in the third quarter in constant currency. The strong performance exceeded our expectations across all 3 regions. This was driven by double-digit growth in Europe and Asia, with North America up high single digits, improving from flat performance in the first half. 
Starting with Europe. Digital sales were up high teens in the quarter, with solid performance across both owned and wholesale digital accounts led by digital pure-play retailers. We added 6 new partners, including LuisaViaRoma in Italy, SOCKSHOP in the U.K. & BRAUN Hamburg in Germany. 
Our directly operated digital sites in Europe also saw further momentum, delivering 15% comp growth this quarter. Highlights included the November launch of Polo mobile app in the U.K., our first app launch outside of North America, and the new digital commerce flagship for Switzerland, as we expand our localization efforts by market. 
In Asia, digital ecosystem sales were also up double digits, led by the Chinese Mainland. We launched new partnerships this quarter with Myer in Australia as well as Tmall's luxury selected platform in China. Lastly, our digital growth in China accelerated on the launch of buy online, ship from store fulfillment to leverage our store inventories. These omni-channel orders contributed to roughly half of our digital growth in the quarter. 
Turning to North America. Third quarter comps on RalphLauren.com were up 6%, largely in line with our expectations. We saw softness from international consumers due to FX and import restrictions in Asia, similar to the first half of the year. However, sales to domestic shoppers grew single digits as we started to drive improvements in mobile, tight personalization and rebalancing our buys to emphasize stronger selling core and seasonal core products. 
Lastly, we continue to build partnerships with newer digital platforms in North America which are extending our reach to new and younger consumers. In the third quarter, we launched Women's Polo on Daily Look, a premium subscription-based personal styling service; and Men's Polo on Simmons, a specialty designer boutique online. We also added kids to Rent the Runway, joining our Lauren, Women's Polo and Club Monaco brands on the platform. 
Touching on our fifth key initiative, operate with discipline to show growth. In the third quarter, we focused on challenging every cost and improving our efficiencies. Adjusted operating margin expanded 10 basis points, slightly ahead of our expectations with stronger-than-expected top line growth, partly offset by the planned timing of higher investments around holiday marketing and new stores. 
One important margin driver for us and a central part of our Next Great Chapter strategy is raising AUR to elevate the brand globally and create value. We're using multiple levers to realize AUR increases, including lower discounts, elevated product mix, geographic and channel shifts and strategic ticket price increases.  We began phasing in strategic ticket price increases in our North America factory outlet channel in late September, followed by our North America full price wholesale and direct-to-consumer doors in spring '20. Leveraging the success we've had implementing this strategy in Asia and Europe, these ticket increases reflect our competitive benchmarking analysis and our focus on providing a superior value proposition for our consumers. 
We were encouraged by the impact of these initial price increases this fall. While traffic was still a headwind for our factory business, we were able to drive positive comps in this channel through an 8% increase in AUR in the quarter. This was on top of 8% AUR growth last year and well above our expectations. Though it is still early in this journey, we are focused on elevating our brand positioning in the North American market and globally as part of our AUR-led strategy. 
And finally, I want to provide an update on our journey to further integrate citizenship and sustainability into our business. More than 50 years ago, Ralph built our company based on the idea of timelessness, creating products that are meant to be worn, loved and passed on to the next generation. This continues to inspire everything we do as we build the business to deliver value for our shareholders and all of our stakeholders for the next 50 years. As part of this work, in December, we announced a new commitment to power all of our globally-owned and operated offices, distribution centers and stores with 100% renewable electricity by 2025. We also took the Arctic shipping pledge, committing to reroute shipping to avoid the environmentally delicate Artic area. 
Driving diversity and inclusion across our business is another important piece of this work, and we are pleased to report that we have achieved our gender parity goal of equal representation in our leadership positions at the VP level and above more than 3 years ahead of our target. 
In closing, Ralph and I are energized by our team's execution over the important holiday quarter, and we are encouraged by the progress we are making on our Next Great Chapter plan across the business. While we are mindful of the challenges across our markets globally, we are intensely focused on delivering on the commitments we have made across every aspect of our business as we look to drive long-term sustainable growth and value creation for all of our stakeholders. 
And before I turn it over to Jane, sadly, I want to note the recent passing of our long-time board member and friend, Arnold Aronson. On behalf of Ralph and the entire organization, I want to express our deepest gratitude for his kindness, wisdom and service to our company over nearly 2 decades. 
Now over to Jane, and I'll join her at the end to answer your questions."

Our third quarter results demonstrate solid execution of our strategy through this holiday season and our team's agility in navigating a dynamic global geopolitical and retail environment. We delivered top a",2196,"Thank you, Patrice, and good morning, everyone. Our third quarter results demonstrate solid execution of our strategy through this holiday season and our team's agility in navigating a dynamic global geopolitical and retail environment. We delivered top and bottom line growth and good progress across key metrics, including 6% AUR growth, double-digit growth in digital commerce and growth and operating margin expansion, coupled with solid inventory control. 
Third quarter revenues increased 1% on a reported basis and 2% in constant currency. Every region posted positive revenue growth, driven by mid-single-digit constant currency growth in Europe and Asia, despite the ongoing headwinds in Hong Kong, as well as slight growth in North America. Excluding the impact of Hong Kong, total company top line grew 2.5% in constant currency and every region delivered positive comps as we work to elevate our brand across every consumer touch point, drive product quality, reduce promotional levels and enhance our digital presence. 
Adjusted gross margin was up 60 basis points in the third quarter, both on a reported and constant currency basis. Gross margins benefited from AUR growth of 6% on better pricing, lower promotions and elevated product mix, along with favorable channel and geographic mix. These more than offset investments in product elevation and sustainability and diversification of our supply chain. 
Looking ahead, we are encouraged by the early results of our fall pricing actions and expect our AUR strength to continue through the rest of the year, driving our full year expectation of low single-digit AUR growth for fiscal '20. 
Our inventory positions for both our direct-to-consumer and wholesale businesses are current and well controlled coming out of this holiday season. And we remain focused on managing our inventories with discipline and leveraging our supply chain agility and responsiveness. 
Adjusted operating margin in the third quarter was 14%, up 10 basis points on a reported basis and in constant currency. Adjusted operating profit dollars grew 3% to last year. Adjusted operating expense increased to 48.2% of sales, up 50 basis points to last year, both on a reported basis and in constant currency. 
Marketing was the key driver, with spending up 16% in the quarter as we shifted investments back into the key holiday selling period versus last year's focus on our 50th anniversary show and related events in the second quarter. We still expect marketing spend to grow ahead of sales for the full year fiscal '20 as we invest behind our brands with an emphasis on digital media. 
Excluding marketing, our adjusted operating expense leveraged 20 basis points to last year as our teams generated operating efficiencies across our business. Some key highlights from third quarter include: first, we continue to drive efficiencies across our end-to-end supply chain, including incremental savings across facilities, labor, airfreight and consolidation of materials, all contributing to mitigate the impact of tariffs. This work is also delivering an improved experience for our consumers, including faster delivery speeds on digital orders. 
Over the peak holiday period, for example, we more than doubled our penetration of orders delivered in 2 days or less over the prior year. We also piloted a new fast track model in the quarter, where we were able to meaningfully accelerate the development of special product concepts from design to shelf. Leveraging our investments in digital product development, we designed, produced and delivered an exclusive fleece sweater to a key wholesale customer in just 16 days, right in time for Black Friday. While just one early example, we expect this model to be a growing part of our supply chain as we continue our progress toward our 3-, 6- and 9-month lead time targets. 
Moving on to segment performance, starting with North America. Revenue increased slightly in the third quarter as strong growth in our retail business more than offset wholesale revenue declines. Adjusted operating margin was 22.3%, a 30 basis point decrease to last year, with operating margin expansion in our retail businesses more than offset by SG&A deleverage in our wholesale business on lower sales. 
In the retail channel in North America, comps were up 4% and ahead of our expectations, driven by 4% brick-and-mortar comps and 6% comps on our owned digital commerce site. Brick-and-mortar comps were driven by an 8% increase in AUR on top of 7% growth last year. This strong growth reflects our targeted price increases and a reduction in promotions, along with an improved product offering, new marketing activations and rebalanced assortments towards stronger selling core and underpenetrated categories. We also made key operational improvements such as the roll out of RFID technology across our fleet to improve out-of-stock replenishment sales. In addition, new staffing optimization tools in our stores drove productivity and improved service in peak periods. Our factory business led our AUR increase in North America with improved conversion. While traffic continued to be a headwind in the channel, we are focused on driving better traffic trends through enhanced digital marketing and refreshed and differentiated store experiences. 
Comps in our North America directly-operated digital commerce business were up 6%. Our investments in mobile, personalization and site navigation drove positive growth from domestic consumers in the third quarter. 
Our digital business also benefited from favorable product mix towards categories like outerwear and fleece, along with a timing shift into the third quarter as we saw higher sell-through in the holiday period versus clearance period in Q4. Excluding this shift, we still expect second half comps to improve incrementally compared to first half comps. 
Sales to international shoppers purchasing on our U.S. site and shipping to U.S. addresses remained soft in the third quarter and should remain a headwind through the rest of fiscal '20. 
Moving on to North America wholesale. Third quarter revenue declined 8%, in line with expectations. Excluding a decline in off price sales, our underlying North America wholesale business was also down high single digits. However, our full-price sellout improved from recent trends. In the near term, we are focused on improving the consumer experience in the wholesale channel through in-store refreshes, expansion into underpenetrated categories and increased marketing. 
Our inventories in the wholesale channel are clean and down on a year-over-year basis. We are driving a more favorable product mix, emphasizing core categories and testing targeted brand marketing for Lauren Women's. We continue to expect it will take some time for our wholesale business to start reflecting these strategic improvements, which have shown success in our direct-to-consumer channels. 
Moving on to Europe. Third quarter revenue was up 3% on a reported basis and 5% in constant currency. Adjusted operating margin expanded 300 basis points both on reported and constant currency basis. Operating margin expansion was driven by strong gross margins and SG&A leverage. 
In retail channels in Europe, comps were up 3%, driven by a 15% increase in our own digital commerce sites and a 2% increase in our brick-and-mortar stores. The increase in our directly operated European digital commerce business was above our expectations, driven by strong AUR growth, solid merchandising execution and traffic increases, along with the shift in seasonal product sales, similar to our North America site.  Across our Europe direct-to-consumer channels, our ongoing efforts to elevate the brand and improve product mix continued in the third quarter, with AUR up 10% on top of an 11% increase last year. This is consistent with our long-term strategy to drive higher quality of sales and price harmonization in the marketplace. 
Wholesale revenue in Europe was up 5% in constant currency and also ahead of our expectations. Similar to Q2, the strong performance reflected solid sell-out trends driving stronger reorders, particularly with our digital pure play partners. 
Turning to Asia. Revenue was up 5% on both a reported and constant currency basis in the third quarter. Excluding the impact of Hong Kong, where protest-related store closures and tourism declines were an ongoing headwind, Asia revenues were up 9%. This solid performance was driven by several markets in Asia, led by Chinese Mainland sales growth of over 30% in constant currency. Our product and marketing initiatives are resonating well in this region and we continue to drive our digital efforts, expand and elevate our store fleet and engage with local influencers and celebrities. 
Comps in Asia decreased 1%, with slight AUR declines. Excluding Hong Kong, Asia comps were up 2%. Store closures and traffic declines to Hong Kong remained a challenge in the third quarter, but we were able to partially mitigate some of this impact by pulling forward a friends-and-family event in our factory stores. We continue to expect Hong Kong to remain a near-term headwind, especially with the emerging impact of the coronavirus, as Patrice mentioned. 
Adjusted operating margin was down 50 basis points to last year on a reported basis and down 70 basis points in constant currency, driven by SG&A deleverage in Hong Kong. Excluding Hong Kong, margins were up 130 basis points in constant currency. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we continue to return capital to our shareholders. We ended the quarter with about $1.9 billion in cash and investments and $694 million in total debt, which compares to $2.1 billion in cash and investments and $687 million in debt at the end of last year's third quarter. 
We repurchased $98 million in shares in the third quarter for a total of $498 million in repurchases year-to-date. We will continue to opportunistically buy back stock and remain on track to complete our target of about $600 million in repurchases for full fiscal '20. 
Moving on to inventory. At the end of the third quarter, inventory was down 1% to last year and flat in constant currency. We still expect to end the year with inventories relatively aligned to our sales outlook. 
Now I'd like to turn to guidance for the full year and fourth quarter of fiscal '20. As a reminder, this guidance excludes restructuring and related charges and reflects our best assessment of the global retail landscape in the context of increased volatility from macroeconomic and geopolitical events. Specifically, our outlook still incorporates the impact of tariffs, Brexit and protest-related business disruption in Hong Kong. 
At this early stage, our guidance does not include potential impact from the coronavirus outbreak, given the dynamic nature of the situation. However, we are monitoring developments closely and will be transparent about the expected impact, providing updates if needed. 
For full year fiscal '20, we still expect revenues to be in the range of 2% to 3% growth in constant currency. Based on a better-than-expected holiday, revenue should be slightly better than the low end of the range we guided to last quarter. Foreign currency is expected to have about 110 to 130 basis points of negative impact on revenue growth based on currency shifts. We now expect operating margin expansion at the high end of our previous range of 40 to 60 basis points in constant currency, driven primarily by gross margin expansion and slight SG&A leverage. Foreign currency is estimated to have about 10 basis points of negative impact on operating margin in fiscal '20. 
Based on the timing of shipments, our guidance now assumes a little less than $10 million of negative tariff impact to our fiscal '20 cost of goods. We expect the majority of this impact in our fourth quarter. However, based on our supply chain diversification out of China and recent tariff reductions, we estimate tariffs will have about $12 million to $15 million of total impact in fiscal '21. We now expect our full year tax rate to be about 20%. For the fourth quarter of fiscal '20, we expect revenues to be up slightly, both on a constant currency and on a reported basis. Foreign currency is expected to negatively impact revenue growth by about 50 basis points in the quarter. We expect protest disruptions in Hong Kong to negatively impact our Asia comp by about 5 points in the quarter. 
Operating margin for the fourth quarter is expected to be up slightly in constant currency and on a reported basis. Similar to Q3, this is primarily due to timing of SG&A investments, with our highest number of new store openings weighted to the back half of the year, largely offsetting gross margin expansion in the quarter. 
Fourth quarter tax rate is estimated at 26%, above our full year expected rate based on our expectation of discrete onetime items. We look forward to sharing the details of our fiscal '21 guidance when we report our fiscal year-end in May. 
In closing, we are proud of the focus, agility and passion our teams around the world demonstrated this holiday quarter. Guided by Ralph's vision, our teams elevated our brand, delivering comp, AUR and profit growth, all while maintaining discipline on inventories and costs.  While we are navigating and watching the challenges in the broader environment closely, we are, first and foremost, committed to the safety of our employees, partners and consumers. We believe we have the right strategy and team to deliver across our strategic priorities and create value for the long term. 
With that, let's open up the call for your questions."

So Patrice, I wanted to -- you gave such great color on sort of the AUR and what was driving the pricing increases. It's accelerated in the back half of the year from the first half despite the tougher compares. Obviously, you talked about where you were taking selective price increases. What have you learned about the price elasticity, particularly in North America? And does this give you confidence in your ability to continue to take pricing up over the next year or so?"

The first thing I would say is brand elevation is really at the core of our strategy, right? And AUR is obviously then a key component to that. The second point on AUR is we have 4 drivers for AUR that we're working on. One is pulling back on promotional support. And actually, in the last quarter, we reduced our promotional pressure. The second is leveraging product mix, and you saw us invest in categories that had a higher AUR like outerwear and fleece. The third is obviously leveraging geographic and channel mix. And then the final point is, indeed, targeted pricing. 
Now we've actually started this journey of taking targeted pricing in the context of this broader AUR strategy. In international, I'd say, past 18, 24 months, and we've been pleased with the results that we've achieved there. But it's really important to understand that it isn't just pricing in isolation, it's the result of work that we've done on elevating the brand across all the touch points, the work we've done on inventory, on product, on brand, on distribution that enables that. We are at a stage now where we think the conditions are set for us to execute that in North America. So as you mentioned, we now have about a quarter under our belt in the factory outlet channel, which is where we started. We're encouraged both by the way the teams have executed, they've done a terrific job, and the consumer response across the board because we saw significant AUR growth. Now AUR growth in isolation doesn't make any significant growth that needs to drive comps, and we're pleased with the 4% comp growth that we achieved in North America. 
In terms of then expanding this across the ecosystem for North America, the plan is actually to do that now. So literally, as we speak, we are implementing pricing for the consumer on the floors, both in our full-price stores that are wholesale, leveraging the learnings that we've picked up in our execution in factory outlets. And we're at the very beginning of this journey, we were quite encouraged by what we've seen so far. And to the point on your guidance long term relative to our expectations for AUR growth, we continue to expect AUR to grow low to mid-single digits throughout the lifetime of the plan."

I want to ask you, in North America, wholesale down 8% was a bigger decline than we've seen since maybe fourth quarter last year when you were going against a big off-price -- correction, in the fourth quarter last year, lapping a negative 10%. If I add this to some comments you just made on now starting to raise prices in wholesale, I'm trying to think how you guys think about the North America wholesale numbers going forward from here? Obviously, the compare gets easier. You've got some pricing, but then, do you think we're at a point where we can -- you can see turning a corner on North America wholesale turning positive yet at some point during the course of fiscal '21? 
And then I also want to ask you about how you're thinking through all the dynamics you just laid out about margins for next year. It sounds like you're happy with how the increased marketing is going. Obviously, the results are there on the top line. But I'm wondering how you're thinking about gross margin as well for next year, which has been a nice contributor for several years now. I mean you did say AUR should keep moving in the right place, you're happy with tickets. So I'm wondering if we can -- if you still think that the gross margin and SG&A dynamics we've seen in the first 2 years, the plan should be similar next year?"

So let me answer the AUR gross margin question first, and then I'll go to North America wholesale. 
So we're really encouraged with what we saw in North America in Q3 from a gross margin standpoint, led by the AUR increases with comp growth. Those AUR increases really reflected our ability to both continue our discount reduction journey. We are starting to see a nice contribution from product mix and the elevation of products, better assortments, better rebalancing in the core, the things we've been talking about. So early stages, but we're starting to see that in this quarter. And then the consumer response to the ticket increases were also very positive. So that's what's giving me confidence in continued gross margin expansion. Obviously, we've guided that for Q4, but I do think that the things that we've called out as durable, reductions in promotions, targeted consumer value-oriented price increases, product mix benefits and then some tailwind benefits from geographic and channel shifts, those things are durable. And we're able to manage some of the cost inflation and tariff impact through the work -- through working those levers. So I continue to remain optimistic that gross margin is a driver for us today. Obviously, we have guided to for the future, but is also durable to the plan. Now the magnitude will have -- we're pretty clear on our guidance. But I'm encouraged, and I think it's a strength for us. So good progress there. Then if I turn to your North America wholesale question, I would tell you that, again, off-price was down, I would say, meaningfully more than our full-price business. So double-digit decline last year, double-digit decline this year. And again, the flow of off-price is related to excess flow. Our inventory is clean. And so we're really, I think, looking at that channel from a strategic standpoint the way it should be, which is they're good partners to us, they're an opportunistic way for us to liquidate excess, and that's what you're seeing come through. 
In terms of the timing of North America wholesale covering, we know that, that will take some time, right? So what is encouraging to us is that we're on the right track, strong comp growth in DTC in North America this quarter. The underlying trend in comp is encouraging. While I still think quarter-by-quarter, there will be some choppiness, the underlying trend is encouraging. And we believe that we're taking the right actions in wholesale, as Patrice called out, in terms of rebalancing assortments, focusing on sell-out, which we did see improve this quarter, and restarting some targeted marketing within the channel that's showing some very early signs of positive trends. So we're pleased with that. And we're overall pleased with our marketing investments and the way they're enabling our brand elevation and price increases. So still encourages how that will flow through on OI margin."

So if you'd ask me for a number, I'd probably say 2 out of 9. I think we see opportunities to actually, in the context of the brand elevation strategy, to increase our presence in higher-end wholesale where we see opportunities both in North America and actually around the world. We're also in kind of the current wholesale footprint, you know we've reduced it significantly already, right? We're down 25% from where we were about 3 years ago to make sure that the brand shows up in the right place. We continue to assess the locations on a very regular basis, working closely with our partners. So this is also a dynamic process. 
As far as DTC is concerned, we believe we have opportunities, obviously, to continue to fuel our dot-com operations, right, which is a very important factor of the DTC part of our business. And also, similar to our thinking internationally with the introduction of Polo boutiques, we believe there is an opportunity in North America to expand our DTC footprint, smaller format stores. So that won't happen tomorrow morning. But as we look at kind of the next few years and where we want to take the brand and how we want to drive interactions with consumers across the country, we do believe there are opportunities to expand the footprint so that the brand is better represented in a more dispersed way across the entire country, all guided by our brand elevation strategy, right? That's really the filter that we use to decide where we should be and then how do we ensure the differentiation is very clear by channel for the consumer, both online and brick-and-mortar, so that he or she knows exactly what to get in which location and how the brand will show up differently based on the different environments."

What we are saying, and I think we called it out in the script is obviously, Hong Kong will have a more meaningful impact as we head into the fourth quarter. We've seen travel bookings deteriorate from the third to the fourth quarter, and this is obviously a big quarter for Hong Kong, given that it was a Lunar New Year. And so we called out that we had about a 3-point impact to Asia comp in the third quarter, that leads to about a 5-point impact in the fourth quarter. So that's one factor that's going into that. And then we called out some digital commerce that we had a very big stronger-than-expected digital commerce. As we look at that and underneath the covers of that in both Europe and in North America, what we saw is that we sold out stronger at full price. We had less inventory seeding clearance in the fourth quarter. That's a good quality of sales move. We're pleased with this. And so you'll see some of that sitting on our digital comps in the fourth quarter as we move forward. We also have some -- given the shorter holiday season, we move to fulfill demand to make sure consumers had a good service experience. And we'll have slight -- we'll have some more process returns in the fourth quarter, and we were less promotional at the end of the third quarter. So those are some things that are sitting in digital. So those 2 things are the biggest things that are guiding our fourth quarter revenue call."

And obviously, we monitor that very closely. As far as supply chain is concerned, well, first, the other thing I would say relative to our business penetration in China, just for the benefit of the whole group is, while with China, the opportunity is a massive growth opportunity for us, to some extent, it's a blessing to be underpenetrated today because our business today -- China represents less than 4% of the total company business. Now, we still are very bullish about our ability to win long term in that region and very excited about what we can do there. 
On the supply chain front, I'd say, same thing, Omar, a very dynamic situation. We have been working, as you know, over the past year, 2 years, to diversify our supply chain so that we're less dependent on one market, less dependent on China. So we have a greater ability to leverage a footprint that's much broader and much more flexible. It's -- we're in the middle of the Lunar New Year vacation. We'll need to see, and which has been extended by a week, we'll need to see how employees return to the various factories post the vacation. So we're watching it. We are working on being as agile as possible, and we'll make sure we make the best of the situation that we're dealing with. The priority in all of this, right, because this is a human -- we can't lose sight of the human dimension of all this, obviously, is to make sure that our employees are safe, our consumers are safe and that we follow very closely the guidance, both from the local and the global authorities on this health crisis."

It was a sweatshirt that we developed with one of our wholesale partners. And we did execute it from idea to delivery to the partner in 16 days. We're not going to move our entire supply chain to 16 days. What's key -- our lens is to understand what is the timing required to be well positioned to win a specific category, in a specific geography, in a specific channel. So we still have kind of our 9-, 6-, 3-month lead times. And then there are some projects where we want to have this ability to react in the span of days. The specific project, Erinn, was -- so sweatshirt, I believe, manufactured in Mainland China. And it's something that's replicable, which is why we shared it as an example. It's a pilot, but I think it's an indication also that our organization is becoming more agile, more aggressive in terms of how we manage time lines and also more creative. So I think you're going to continue to see from us faster lead times, but not just for the sake of lead times, also, just to understand what's required to win in the marketplace."

So great progress by our supply chain in that area. 
And then to the second part of your question regarding what we're seeing -- what we saw on Polo and the Lauren brands, we did see across the company that the Polo brand really drove our growth. And we saw -- and specifically in North America wholesale, we saw the Polo brand be stable and a driver for us. The Lauren brand, we're seeing some positive signs, but they're very early based on the marketing that Patrice called out and some targeted work that we're doing with our wholesale partners, that, one, makes us believe that the Lauren opportunity is an opportunity in North America wholesale, that our consumer is still there. And that when we assort into the right categories with the right product quality and right consumer value, that the consumer will respond. And so we saw some encouraging trends there. I'd say too early to call the turnaround. It will take some time, but it's an encouraging sign."

On -- denim also performed well for us, and that actually contributed to the solid trends on our men's business. I think the team is doing a very good job in terms of understanding the customer we want to serve, developing product that resonates and then finding a way to communicate and execute it in store in a way that really connects with the consumer. We're making good progress on Wear to Work. Probably the key thing to highlight here is the way we are complementing our line on -- particularly on Polo Women's and some of the work that's also underway on Lauren, to really make sure that we have the right offering to meet that kind of Wear to Work consumer need. So good progress there. And if you remember, this is an oversimplified, but we really want to shift to being a kind of 7-day brand solution as opposed to maybe 2 or 3 days a week, both for men and women. So I'm encouraged by the progress we're making there. 
As far as footwear and accessories, so we had talked about the fact at Investor Day that footwear and accessories progress and impact would be more backloaded in the 5-year program, which is why you're seeing further acceleration on outerwear and denim first but we are making good progress on footwear and accessories. Job 1 for us is really building capability, right, working with Ralph, having the right design talent, both on bags and on shoes. We brought some extraordinary talent from key players in this space that have joined us over the past year, 1.5 years, so that we make sure we've got people that really understand fundamentally how these categories work. And then now working on bringing these products to life in the market. These things take a bit of time, so I expect the impact to be most visible in the outer years of the plan. But we're starting to see some encouraging signs on different parts of the portfolio that give us confidence that we're making the right progress and that we will see the benefits that we expect from those 2 categories as well."

Over the important holiday season, our teams consistently executed across each of our strategic priorities, enabling us to elevate our brand and deliver for our consumers across every touch point. The solid foundations we've put into place to reposition and elevate our brands helped to drive positive comp growth across all 3 regions, excluding the impact of Hong Kong this quarter. 
We were also encouraged by AUR growth of 6% and as we invest in brand elevation through our products, marketing, distribution and unique consumer experiences. At the same time, we continue to execute key initiatives to stabilize our North America business against an evolving retail landscape.
 
As I've shared before, the 3 principles underlying this work include: putting the consumer at the center of everything we do; elevating the brand across all consumer touch points; and balancing growth and productivity. And we are doing all of this while managing through volatile industry dynamics including the recent coronavirus outbreak, which we are actively monitoring. Our top priorities are to keep our employees and consumers safe and to heed the advice of local and international health authorities. The situation is a dynamic one, and we will continue to assess the implications for our business across retail, corporate and our supply base. Our thoughts are with the many impacted by this virus. 
During the third quarter, we drove our performance across the 5 strategic priorities that we laid out as part of our 5-year plan to deliver long-term sustainable growth and value creation. These include: first, win over a new generation of consumers; second, energize core products and accelerate high-potential underdeveloped categories; third, drive targeted expansion in our regions and channels; fourth, lead with digital across all activities; and fifth, operate with discipline to show growth. 
Starting with win over a new generation of consumers. We're investing in media channels that matter most to consumers today, namely digital and social, and remain on track towards our long-term marketing investment target of 5% of sales. In the third quarter, marketing increased 16% to last year as we shifted investments back into the key holiday selling period. 
We are encouraged by consumer engagement across generations through our campaigns and programs. Notably, our total social media followers surpassed 40 million in the third quarter, a double-digit increase to last year, led by a 30% organic increase on Instagram. 
Let me touch on some of the highlights from our holiday campaigns this quarter. First, we launched a fully integrated holiday campaign across social media, television, our own stores and digital sites and wholesale environments, which we called Every Moment is a Gift. Among the exciting activations online, we drove strong engagement through our Snapchat holiday shopping filter and our first-ever global digital game, The Holiday Run, where our iconic Polo bear dashed through the streets of New York City, Paris, London and Tokyo to collect festive bubbles and signature Ralph Lauren products. 
We also launched a digitally-targeted campaign for our Lauren women's ready-to-wear business in North America this season, featuring supermodel and mom, Lily Aldridge, along with her family. It was the first dedicated campaign for the brand in many years that had significant media support behind it. We were encouraged by the early consumer response as we work to get the Lauren women's business back on a positive trajectory. 
On our North American mobile app, we drove a successful 7 Days/7 Drops program, featuring limited-edition releases and one-of-a-kind experiences.  The highlight of the week was our 5 Horsemen rugby shirt, which sold out in just 15 minutes online. And congratulations to Ralph Lauren Golf Ambassador, Justin Thomas. He captured his 12th career win at the Sentry Tournament of Champions last month, wearing RLX to capture the #1 spot in the FedEx Cup standings. 
Moving on to our second key initiative, energize core products and accelerate high-potential underdeveloped categories. In the third quarter, Ralph and our design team drove excitement in core product categories while also expanding into our 5 high-potential underdeveloped categories. While we were pleased with the overall performance of these categories, our outerwear and fleece programs were the clear standouts this holiday, outperforming our total sales trends on both the sell-in and sell-out basis. Popular styles included heavyweight parkas, quilted car coats, light and mid-weight down jackets, windbreakers and sherpa styles. Other successes this season included woven shirts, sweaters and denim. 
In addition to the holiday drops in our mobile app, we released our limited edition Polo sports outdoors collection in November. The products retailed on our own digital commerce sites, North America app and select flagship stores around the world. We also partnered with influential specialty retailers, including Bodega, Fred Segal, SSENSE, Brown's in the U.K. and Beams in Asia. 
Other exciting projects this quarter included an exclusive holiday capsule with Zalando, the Polo Sport collaboration with Musinsa, one of the largest fashion online retailers in Korea, and the WeChat mini program for Singles Day in China. 
Moving on to our third key initiative, drive targeted expansion in our regions and channels. Our long-term expansion strategy remains focused on building a cohesive, elevated Ralph Lauren experience across our retail, wholesale and digital commerce presence in key cities around the world. 
During the third quarter, we opened 48 new owned and operated stores and concessions globally and closed 31 locations. This included 37 openings in Asia. We also continue to invest in door refreshes across our own stores and wholesale partners in key markets as we work to elevate our fleet across every touch point. 
Our city-by-city ecosystem approach drove strong results in the quarter, with Chinese Mainland sales up more than 30% in constant currency, driven by comp growth and new stores. Total China sales were up 6% to last year in constant currency, despite headwinds in Hong Kong that we discussed last quarter. 
In Europe, we opened 6 owned and partnered full-price stores including Polo boutiques in Covent Garden in London, Torino, Aix-en-Provence and Lisbon. We're making good progress, but we still have significant expansion opportunities with only 46 full-price stores across Europe, with all of this complemented by our successful expansion into new specialty wholesale accounts and digital commerce growth. Which brings me to our fourth key initiative, lead with digital. Our global digital ecosystem, including our directly operated flagship sites, departmentstore.com, pure players and social commerce, increased low double digits in the third quarter in constant currency. The strong performance exceeded our expectations across all 3 regions. This was driven by double-digit growth in Europe and Asia, with North America up high single digits, improving from flat performance in the first half. 
Starting with Europe. Digital sales were up high teens in the quarter, with solid performance across both owned and wholesale digital accounts led by digital pure-play retailers. We added 6 new partners, including LuisaViaRoma in Italy, SOCKSHOP in the U.K. & BRAUN Hamburg in Germany. 
Our directly operated digital sites in Europe also saw further momentum, delivering 15% comp growth this quarter. Highlights included the November launch of Polo mobile app in the U.K., our first app launch outside of North America, and the new digital commerce flagship for Switzerland, as we expand our localization efforts by market. 
In Asia, digital ecosystem sales were also up double digits, led by the Chinese Mainland. We launched new partnerships this quarter with Myer in Australia as well as Tmall's luxury selected platform in China. Lastly, our digital growth in China accelerated on the launch of buy online, ship from store fulfillment to leverage our store inventories. These omnichannel orders contributed to roughly half of our digital growth in the quarter. 
Turning to North America. Third quarter comps on RalphLauren.com were up 6%, largely in line with our expectations. We saw softness from international consumers due to FX and import restrictions in Asia, similar to the first half of the year. However, sales to domestic shoppers grew single digits as we started to drive improvements in mobile, tight personalization and rebalancing our buys to emphasize stronger selling core and seasonal core products. 
Lastly, we continue to build partnerships with newer digital platforms in North America which are extending our reach to new and younger consumers. In the third quarter, we launched Women's Polo on Daily Look, a premium subscription-based personal styling service; and Men's Polo on Simmons, a specialty designer boutique online. We also added kids to Rent the Runway, joining our Lauren, Women's Polo and Club Monaco brands on the platform. 
Touching on our fifth key initiative, operate with discipline to show growth. In the third quarter, we focused on challenging every cost and improving our efficiencies. Adjusted operating margin expanded 10 basis points, slightly ahead of our expectations with stronger-than-expected top line growth, partly offset by the planned timing of higher investments around holiday marketing and new stores. 
One important margin driver for us and a central part of our Next Great Chapter strategy is raising AUR to elevate the brand globally and create value. We're using multiple levers to realize AUR increases, including lower discounts, elevated product mix, geographic and channel shifts and strategic ticket price increases.  We began phasing in strategic ticket price increases in our North America factory outlet channel in late September, followed by our North America full-price wholesale and direct-to-consumer doors in spring '20. Leveraging the success we've had implementing this strategy in Asia and Europe, these ticket increases reflect our competitive benchmarking analysis and our focus on providing a superior value proposition for our consumers. 
We were encouraged by the impact of these initial price increases this fall. While traffic was still a headwind for our factory business, we were able to drive positive comps in this channel through an 8% increase in AUR in the quarter. This was on top of 8% AUR growth last year and well above our expectations. Though it is still early in this journey, we are focused on elevating our brand positioning in the North American market and globally as part of our AUR-led strategy. 
And finally, I want to provide an update on our journey to further integrate citizenship and sustainability into our business. More than 50 years ago, Ralph built our company based on the idea of timelessness, creating products that are meant to be worn, loved and passed on to the next generation. This continues to inspire everything we do as we build the business to deliver value for our shareholders and all of our stakeholders for the next 50 years. As part of this work, in December, we announced a new commitment to power all of our globally-owned and operated offices, distribution centers and stores with 100% renewable electricity by 2025. We also took the Arctic shipping pledge, committing to reroute shipping to avoid the environmentally delicate Arctic area. 
Driving diversity and inclusion across our business is another important piece of this work, and we are pleased to report that we have achieved our gender parity goal of equal representation in our leadership positions at the VP level and above more than 3 years ahead of our target. 
In closing, Ralph and I are energized by our team's execution over the important holiday quarter, and we are encouraged by the progress we are making on our Next Great Chapter plan across the business. While we are mindful of the challenges across our markets globally, we are intensely focused on delivering on the commitments we have made across every aspect of our business as we look to drive long-term sustainable growth and value creation for all of our stakeholders. 
And before I turn it over to Jane, sadly, I want to note the recent passing of our long-time board member and friend, Arnold Aronson. On behalf of Ralph and the entire organization, I want to express our deepest gratitude for his kindness, wisdom and service to our company over nearly 2 decades. 
Now over to Jane, and I'll join her at the end to answer your questions."

Our third quarter results demonstrate solid execution of our strategy through this holiday season and our team's agility in navigating a dynamic global geopolitical and retail environment. We delivered top a",2193,"Thank you, Patrice, and good morning, everyone. Our third quarter results demonstrate solid execution of our strategy through this holiday season and our team's agility in navigating a dynamic global geopolitical and retail environment. We delivered top and bottom line growth and good progress across key metrics, including 6% AUR growth, double-digit growth in digital commerce and growth and operating margin expansion, coupled with solid inventory control. 
Third quarter revenues increased 1% on a reported basis and 2% in constant currency. Every region posted positive revenue growth, driven by mid-single-digit constant currency growth in Europe and Asia, despite the ongoing headwinds in Hong Kong, as well as slight growth in North America. Excluding the impact of Hong Kong, total company top line grew 2.5% in constant currency and every region delivered positive comps as we work to elevate our brand across every consumer touch point, drive product quality, reduce promotional levels and enhance our digital presence. 
Adjusted gross margin was up 60 basis points in the third quarter, both on a reported and constant currency basis. Gross margins benefited from AUR growth of 6% on better pricing, lower promotions and elevated product mix, along with favorable channel and geographic mix. These more than offset investments in product elevation and sustainability and diversification of our supply chain. 
Looking ahead, we are encouraged by the early results of our fall pricing actions and expect our AUR strength to continue through the rest of the year, driving our full year expectation of low single-digit AUR growth for fiscal '20. 
Our inventory positions for both our direct-to-consumer and wholesale businesses are current and well controlled coming out of this holiday season. And we remain focused on managing our inventories with discipline and leveraging our supply chain agility and responsiveness. 
Adjusted operating margin in the third quarter was 14%, up 10 basis points on a reported basis and in constant currency. Adjusted operating profit dollars grew 3% to last year. Adjusted operating expense increased to 48.2% of sales, up 50 basis points to last year, both on a reported basis and in constant currency. 
Marketing was the key driver, with spending up 16% in the quarter as we shifted investments back into the key holiday selling period versus last year's focus on our 50th anniversary show and related events in the second quarter. We still expect marketing spend to grow ahead of sales for the full year fiscal '20 as we invest behind our brands with an emphasis on digital media. 
Excluding marketing, our adjusted operating expense leveraged 20 basis points to last year as our teams generated operating efficiencies across our business. Some key highlights from third quarter include: first, we continue to drive efficiencies across our end-to-end supply chain, including incremental savings across facilities, labor, airfreight and consolidation of materials, all contributing to mitigate the impact of tariffs. This work is also delivering an improved experience for our consumers, including faster delivery speeds on digital orders. 
Over the peak holiday period, for example, we more than doubled our penetration of orders delivered in 2 days or less over the prior year. We also piloted a new fast track model in the quarter, where we were able to meaningfully accelerate the development of special product concepts from design to shelf. Leveraging our investments in digital product development, we designed, produced and delivered an exclusive fleece sweater to a key wholesale customer in just 16 days, right in time for Black Friday. While just one early example, we expect this model to be a growing part of our supply chain as we continue our progress toward our 3-, 6- and 9-month lead time targets. 
Moving on to segment performance, starting with North America. Revenue increased slightly in the third quarter as strong growth in our retail business more than offset wholesale revenue declines. Adjusted operating margin was 22.3%, a 30 basis point decrease to last year, with operating margin expansion in our retail businesses more than offset by SG&A deleverage in our wholesale business on lower sales. 
In the retail channel in North America, comps were up 4% and ahead of our expectations, driven by 4% brick-and-mortar comps and 6% comps on our owned digital commerce site. Brick-and-mortar comps were driven by an 8% increase in AUR on top of 7% growth last year. This strong growth reflects our targeted price increases and a reduction in promotions, along with an improved product offering, new marketing activations and rebalanced assortments towards stronger selling core and underpenetrated categories. We also made key operational improvements such as the roll-out of RFID technology across our fleet to improve out-of-stock replenishment sales. In addition, new staffing optimization tools in our stores drove productivity and improved service in peak periods. Our factory business led our AUR increase in North America with improved conversion. While traffic continued to be a headwind in the channel, we are focused on driving better traffic trends through enhanced digital marketing and refreshed and differentiated store experiences. 
Comps in our North America directly-operated digital commerce business were up 6%. Our investments in mobile, personalization and site navigation drove positive growth from domestic consumers in the third quarter. 
Our digital business also benefited from favorable product mix towards categories like outerwear and fleece, along with a timing shift into the third quarter as we saw higher sell-through in the holiday period versus clearance period in Q4. Excluding this shift, we still expect second half comps to improve incrementally compared to first half comps. 
Sales to international shoppers purchasing on our U.S. site and shipping to U.S. addresses remained soft in the third quarter and should remain a headwind through the rest of fiscal '20. 
Moving on to North America wholesale. Third quarter revenue declined 8%, in line with expectations. Excluding a decline in off-price sales, our underlying North America wholesale business was also down high single digits. However, our full-price sellout improved from recent trends. In the near term, we are focused on improving the consumer experience in the wholesale channel through in-store refreshes, expansion into underpenetrated categories and increased marketing. 
Our inventories in the wholesale channel are clean and down on a year-over-year basis. We are driving a more favorable product mix, emphasizing core categories and testing targeted brand marketing for Lauren Women's. We continue to expect it will take some time for our wholesale business to start reflecting these strategic improvements, which have shown success in our direct-to-consumer channels. 
Moving on to Europe. Third quarter revenue was up 3% on a reported basis and 5% in constant currency. Adjusted operating margin expanded 300 basis points both on reported and constant currency basis. Operating margin expansion was driven by strong gross margins and SG&A leverage. 
In retail channels in Europe, comps were up 3%, driven by a 15% increase in our own digital commerce sites and a 2% increase in our brick-and-mortar stores. The increase in our directly operated European digital commerce business was above our expectations, driven by strong AUR growth, solid merchandising execution and traffic increases, along with the shift in seasonal product sales, similar to our North America site.  Across our Europe direct-to-consumer channels, our ongoing efforts to elevate the brand and improve product mix continued in the third quarter, with AUR up 10% on top of an 11% increase last year. This is consistent with our long-term strategy to drive higher quality of sales and price harmonization in the marketplace. 
Wholesale revenue in Europe was up 5% in constant currency and also ahead of our expectations. Similar to Q2, the strong performance reflected solid sell-out trends driving stronger reorders, particularly with our digital pure-play partners. 
Turning to Asia. Revenue was up 5% on both a reported and constant currency basis in the third quarter. Excluding the impact of Hong Kong, where protest-related store closures and tourism declines were an ongoing headwind, Asia revenues were up 9%. This solid performance was driven by several markets in Asia, led by Chinese Mainland sales growth of over 30% in constant currency. Our product and marketing initiatives are resonating well in this region and we continue to drive our digital efforts, expand and elevate our store fleet and engage with local influencers and celebrities. 
Comps in Asia decreased 1%, with slight AUR declines. Excluding Hong Kong, Asia comps were up 2%. Store closures and traffic declines to Hong Kong remained a challenge in the third quarter, but we were able to partially mitigate some of this impact by pulling forward a friends-and-family event in our factory stores. We continue to expect Hong Kong to remain a near-term headwind, especially with the emerging impact of the coronavirus, as Patrice mentioned. 
Adjusted operating margin was down 50 basis points to last year on a reported basis and down 70 basis points in constant currency, driven by SG&A deleverage in Hong Kong. Excluding Hong Kong, margins were up 130 basis points in constant currency. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we continue to return capital to our shareholders. We ended the quarter with about $1.9 billion in cash and investments and $694 million in total debt, which compares to $2.1 billion in cash and investments and $687 million in debt at the end of last year's third quarter. 
We repurchased $98 million in shares in the third quarter for a total of $498 million in repurchases year-to-date. We will continue to opportunistically buy back stock and remain on track to complete our target of about $600 million in repurchases for full fiscal '20. 
Moving on to inventory. At the end of the third quarter, inventory was down 1% to last year and flat in constant currency. We still expect to end the year with inventories relatively aligned to our sales outlook. 
Now I'd like to turn to guidance for the full year and fourth quarter of fiscal '20. As a reminder, this guidance excludes restructuring and related charges and reflects our best assessment of the global retail landscape in the context of increased volatility from macroeconomic and geopolitical events. Specifically, our outlook still incorporates the impact of tariffs, Brexit and protest-related business disruption in Hong Kong. 
At this early stage, our guidance does not include potential impact from the coronavirus outbreak, given the dynamic nature of the situation. However, we are monitoring developments closely and will be transparent about the expected impact, providing updates if needed. 
For full year fiscal '20, we still expect revenues to be in the range of 2% to 3% growth in constant currency. Based on a better-than-expected holiday, revenue should be slightly better than the low end of the range we guided to last quarter. Foreign currency is expected to have about 110 to 130 basis points of negative impact on revenue growth based on currency shifts. We now expect operating margin expansion at the high end of our previous range of 40 to 60 basis points in constant currency, driven primarily by gross margin expansion and slight SG&A leverage. Foreign currency is estimated to have about 10 basis points of negative impact on operating margin in fiscal '20. 
Based on the timing of shipments, our guidance now assumes a little less than $10 million of negative tariff impact to our fiscal '20 cost of goods. We expect the majority of this impact in our fourth quarter. However, based on our supply chain diversification out of China and recent tariff reductions, we estimate tariffs will have about $12 million to $15 million of total impact in fiscal '21. We now expect our full year tax rate to be about 20%. For the fourth quarter of fiscal '20, we expect revenues to be up slightly, both on a constant currency and on a reported basis. Foreign currency is expected to negatively impact revenue growth by about 50 basis points in the quarter. We expect protest disruptions in Hong Kong to negatively impact our Asia comp by about 5 points in the quarter. 
Operating margin for the fourth quarter is expected to be up slightly in constant currency and on a reported basis. Similar to Q3, this is primarily due to timing of SG&A investments, with our highest number of new store openings weighted to the back half of the year, largely offsetting gross margin expansion in the quarter. 
Fourth quarter tax rate is estimated at 26%, above our full year expected rate based on our expectation of discrete onetime items. We look forward to sharing the details of our fiscal '21 guidance when we report our fiscal year-end in May. 
In closing, we are proud of the focus, agility and passion our teams around the world demonstrated this holiday quarter. Guided by Ralph's vision, our teams elevated our brand, delivering comp, AUR and profit growth, all while maintaining discipline on inventories and costs.  While we are navigating and watching the challenges in the broader environment closely, we are, first and foremost, committed to the safety of our employees, partners and consumers. We believe we have the right strategy and team to deliver across our strategic priorities and create value for the long term. 
With that, let's open up the call for your questions."

So Patrice, I wanted to -- you gave such great color on sort of the AUR and what was driving the pricing increases. It's accelerated in the back half of the year from the first half despite the tougher compares. Obviously, you talked about where you were taking selective price increases. What have you learned about the price elasticity, particularly in North America? And does this give you confidence in your ability to continue to take pricing up over the next year or so?"

The first thing I would say is brand elevation is really at the core of our strategy, right? And AUR is obviously then a key component to that. The second point on AUR is we have 4 drivers for AUR that we're working on. One is pulling back on promotional support. And actually, in the last quarter, we reduced our promotional pressure. The second is leveraging product mix, and you saw us invest in categories that had a higher AUR like outerwear and fleece. The third is obviously leveraging geographic and channel mix. And then the final point is, indeed, targeted pricing. 
Now we've actually started this journey of taking targeted pricing in the context of this broader AUR strategy. In international, I'd say, past 18, 24 months, and we've been pleased with the results that we've achieved there. But it's really important to understand that it isn't just pricing in isolation, it's the result of work that we've done on elevating the brand across all the touch points, the work we've done on inventory, on product, on brand, on distribution that enables that. We are at a stage now where we think the conditions are set for us to execute that in North America. So as you mentioned, we now have about a quarter under our belt in the factory outlet channel, which is where we started. We're encouraged both by the way the teams have executed, they've done a terrific job, and the consumer response across the board because we saw significant AUR growth. Now AUR growth in isolation doesn't make any significant growth that needs to drive comps, and we're pleased with the 4% comp growth that we achieved in North America. 
In terms of then expanding this across the ecosystem for North America, the plan is actually to do that now. So literally, as we speak, we are implementing pricing for the consumer on the floors, both in our full-price stores that are wholesale, leveraging the learnings that we've picked up in our execution in factory outlets. And we're at the very beginning of this journey, we were quite encouraged by what we've seen so far. And to the point on your guidance long term relative to our expectations for AUR growth, we continue to expect AUR to grow low to mid-single digits throughout the lifetime of the plan."

I want to ask you, in North America, wholesale down 8% was a bigger decline than we've seen since maybe fourth quarter last year when you were going against a big off-price -- correction, in the fourth quarter last year, lapping a negative 10%. If I add this to some comments you just made on now starting to raise prices in wholesale, I'm trying to think how you guys think about the North America wholesale numbers going forward from here? Obviously, the compare gets easier. You've got some pricing, but then, do you think we're at a point where we can -- you can see turning a corner on North America wholesale turning positive yet at some point during the course of fiscal '21? 
And then I also want to ask you about how you're thinking through all the dynamics you just laid out about margins for next year. It sounds like you're happy with how the increased marketing is going. Obviously, the results are there on the top line. But I'm wondering how you're thinking about gross margin as well for next year, which has been a nice contributor for several years now. I mean you did say AUR should keep moving in the right place, you're happy with tickets. So I'm wondering if we can -- if you still think that the gross margin and SG&A dynamics we've seen in the first 2 years, the plan should be similar next year?"

So let me answer the AUR gross margin question first, and then I'll go to North America wholesale. 
So we're really encouraged with what we saw in North America in Q3 from a gross margin standpoint, led by the AUR increases with comp growth. Those AUR increases really reflected our ability to both continue our discount reduction journey. We are starting to see a nice contribution from product mix and the elevation of products, better assortments, better rebalancing in the core, the things we've been talking about. So early stages, but we're starting to see that in this quarter. And then the consumer response to the ticket increases were also very positive. So that's what's giving me confidence in continued gross margin expansion. Obviously, we've guided that for Q4, but I do think that the things that we've called out as durable, reductions in promotions, targeted consumer value-oriented price increases, product mix benefits and then some tailwind benefits from geographic and channel shifts, those things are durable. And we're able to manage some of the cost inflation and tariff impact through the work -- through working those levers. So I continue to remain optimistic that gross margin is a driver for us today. Obviously, we have guided to for the future, but is also durable to the plan. Now the magnitude will have -- we're pretty clear on our guidance. But I'm encouraged, and I think it's a strength for us. So good progress there. Then if I turn to your North America wholesale question, I would tell you that, again, off-price was down, I would say, meaningfully more than our full-price business. So double-digit decline last year, double-digit decline this year. And again, the flow of off-price is related to excess flow. Our inventory is clean. And so we're really, I think, looking at that channel from a strategic standpoint the way it should be, which is they're good partners to us, they're an opportunistic way for us to liquidate excess, and that's what you're seeing come through. 
In terms of the timing of North America wholesale covering, we know that, that will take some time, right? So what is encouraging to us is that we're on the right track, strong comp growth in DTC in North America this quarter. The underlying trend in comp is encouraging. While I still think quarter-by-quarter, there will be some choppiness, the underlying trend is encouraging. And we believe that we're taking the right actions in wholesale, as Patrice called out, in terms of rebalancing assortments, focusing on sell-out, which we did see improve this quarter, and restarting some targeted marketing within the channel that's showing some very early signs of positive trends. So we're pleased with that. And we're overall pleased with our marketing investments and the way they're enabling our brand elevation and price increases. So still encourages how that will flow through on OI margin."

So if you'd ask me for a number, I'd probably say 2 out of 9. I think we see opportunities to actually, in the context of the brand elevation strategy, to increase our presence in higher-end wholesale where we see opportunities both in North America and actually around the world. We're also in kind of the current wholesale footprint, you know we've reduced it significantly already, right? We're down 25% from where we were about 3 years ago to make sure that the brand shows up in the right place. We continue to assess the locations on a very regular basis, working closely with our partners. So this is also a dynamic process. 
As far as DTC is concerned, we believe we have opportunities, obviously, to continue to fuel our dot-com operations, right, which is a very important factor of the DTC part of our business. And also, similar to our thinking internationally with the introduction of Polo boutiques, we believe there is an opportunity in North America to expand our DTC footprint, smaller format stores. So that won't happen tomorrow morning. But as we look at kind of the next few years and where we want to take the brand and how we want to drive interactions with consumers across the country, we do believe there are opportunities to expand the footprint so that the brand is better represented in a more dispersed way across the entire country, all guided by our brand elevation strategy, right? That's really the filter that we use to decide where we should be and then how do we ensure the differentiation is very clear by channel for the consumer, both online and brick-and-mortar, so that he or she knows exactly what to get in which location and how the brand will show up differently based on the different environments."

Why don't I unpack your question in terms of the guidance first and in terms of revenue upside. What we are saying, and I think we called it out in the script is obviously, Hong Kong will have a more meaningful impact as we head into the fourth quarter. We've seen travel bookings deteriorate from the third to the fourth quarter, and this is obviously a big quarter for Hong Kong, given that it was a Lunar New Year. And so we called out that we had about a 3-point impact to Asia comp in the third quarter, that leads to about a 5-point impact in the fourth quarter. So that's one factor that's going into that. And then we called out some digital commerce that we had a very big stronger-than-expected digital commerce. As we look at that and underneath the covers of that in both Europe and in North America, what we saw is that we sold out stronger at full price. We had less inventory seeding clearance in the fourth quarter. That's a good quality of sales move. We're pleased with this. And so you'll see some of that sitting on our digital comps in the fourth quarter as we move forward. We also have some -- given the shorter holiday season, we move to fulfill demand to make sure consumers had a good service experience. And we'll have slight -- we'll have some more process returns in the fourth quarter, and we were less promotional at the end of the third quarter. So those are some things that are sitting in digital. So those 2 things are the biggest things that are guiding our fourth quarter revenue call."

And obviously, we monitor that very closely. As far as supply chain is concerned, well, first, the other thing I would say relative to our business penetration in China, just for the benefit of the whole group is, while with China, the opportunity is a massive growth opportunity for us, to some extent, it's a blessing to be underpenetrated today because our business today -- China represents less than 4% of the total company business. Now, we still are very bullish about our ability to win long term in that region and very excited about what we can do there. 
On the supply chain front, I'd say, same thing, Omar, a very dynamic situation. We have been working, as you know, over the past year, 2 years, to diversify our supply chain so that we're less dependent on one market, less dependent on China. So we have a greater ability to leverage a footprint that's much broader and much more flexible. It's -- we're in the middle of the Lunar New Year vacation. We'll need to see, and which has been extended by a week, we'll need to see how employees return to the various factories post the vacation. So we're watching it. We are working on being as agile as possible, and we'll make sure we make the best of the situation that we're dealing with.

The Lauren brand, we're seeing some positive signs, but they're very early based on the marketing that Patrice called out and some targeted work that we're doing with our wholesale partners, that, one, makes us believe that the Lauren opportunity is an opportunity in North America wholesale, that our consumer is still there.

And frankly, I'm becoming even more bullish on the size of price on that part of the business as we build capabilities in-house. So good momentum on outerwear. On -- denim also performed well for us, and that actually contributed to the solid trends on our men's business. I think the team is doing a very good job in terms of understanding the customer we want to serve, developing product that resonates and then finding a way to communicate and execute it in store in a way that really connects with the consumer. We're making good progress on Wear to Work. Probably the key thing to highlight here is the way we are complementing our line on -- particularly on Polo Women's and some of the work that's also underway on Lauren, to really make sure that we have the right offering to meet that kind of Wear to Work consumer need. So good progress there. And if you remember, this is an oversimplified, but we really want to shift to being a kind of 7-day brand solution as opposed to maybe 2 or 3 days a week, both for men and women. So I'm encouraged by the progress we're making there. 
As far as footwear and accessories, so we had talked about the fact at Investor Day that footwear and accessories progress and impact would be more backloaded in the 5-year program, which is why you're seeing further acceleration on outerwear and denim first but we are making good progress on footwear and accessories. Job 1 for us is really building capability, right, working with Ralph, having the right design talent, both on bags and on shoes. We brought some extraordinary talent from key players in this space that have joined us over the past year, 1.5 years, so that we make sure we've got people that really understand fundamentally how these categories work. And then now working on bringing these products to life in the market. These things take a bit of time, so I expect the impact to be most visible in the outer years of the plan. But we're starting to see some encouraging signs on different parts of the portfolio that give us confidence that we're making the right progress and that we will see the benefits that we expect from those 2 categories as well."

So store -- same-store sales growth within those areas and some distribution expansion that we're seeing on a more regional basis with partners that we've had for a number of years. So that's very encouraging to us. I think we see this as durable growth, and we're encouraged by the progress that we're making and where the brand sits within the wholesale European ecosystem, I think, it's elevated. The pricing is accretive to our overall portfolio and our inventories are in good shape there. So we're very pleased with the progress in that business."

The spread of COVID-19 around the world has been devastating, and our thoughts are with the many impacted by the virus. The pandemic has not only affected our organization and recent financial performance but it has had unprecedented consequences on the communities we operate in around the world. 
Under these extraordinary circumstances, our teams have responded to the call with agility and resilience, working tirelessly from their living rooms and kitchen tables across time zones. Ralph and I want to recognize and thank them for their dedication and commitment. Our objective is to emerge from this period stronger than we came into it. And before we review our recent financial performance, I want to spend some time on the actions we are taking to ensure we not only endure through this crisis, but are positioned to thrive long term. 
From the start of the outbreak, we moved quickly to protect the safety and well-being of our employees, consumers and communities. This included widespread store and office closures, led by Asia in late January, followed by Europe and North America in March. Like many of you, we are working in new ways across the company, including working from home, and we have implemented new health and safety measures where that is not possible. 
We also took proactive steps to ensure the long-term financial health of our business, including expense reductions, further strengthening our balance sheet and liquidity and pivoting our supply chain to adjust inventories to changing demand. Meanwhile, we accelerated efforts to drive sales to our digital ecosystem as consumers stayed home. 
On the expense side, we've been addressing our most significant fixed cost around the world. This includes ongoing work with our landlords to negotiate rent relief and pausing all new store build-outs. We reduced corporate expenses, including a freeze on our global travel and hiring during the crisis. And in April, we announced pay cuts for our executives, Board and me, along with furloughing or flexing down a significant number of our employees across the company. Ralph is foregoing his bonus for fiscal '20 and his entire salary for fiscal '21. 
We have also focused on delivering on our purpose in the communities in which we operate. For example, in March, we donated $10 million toward emergency COVID relief through our Ralph Lauren Corporate Foundation. These funds will support the COVID-19 Solidarity Response fund, our long-standing partners in Cancer Care, our employee relief fund to support Ralph Lauren employees in need and the CFDA Vogue Fashion Fund for COVID-19 relief. 
We also mobilized our teams and supply chain to deliver 250,000 masks and 50,000 isolation gowns to support medical staff. And we are providing 1.5 million units of comfort apparel, hundreds of meals and even Ralph coffee for frontline workers across many of our key markets. 
Next, I want to share some perspective on our experience managing through COVID in Mainland China over the past few months. As we prepare to reopen markets around the world, we're applying learnings and strategies from China where the recent recovery gives us confidence that we are making the right decisions now to position our company for long-term sustainable growth and value creation. 
We started the quarter with strong, continued momentum in Mainland China, our fastest growing market, with sales up more than 35% in January, driven by all of our direct-to-consumer channels. By early February, we closed nearly all of our stores in the market due to COVID. We took early strategic actions across marketing and distribution in China, which we have applied in our other markets as the pandemic continued to spread. 
First, we quickly shifted our marketing to focus on optimistic messages around family, togetherness and giving, values that have always been an authentic part of who we are. We partnered with celebrities like J.J. Lin, Jim and [indiscernible] to amplify our messaging. This content resonated well with our consumers across Asia, driving over 124 million video views and a 33% increase in positive brand mentioned on social media in Q4 versus Q3. 
Second, we accelerated our digital and omnichannel capabilities in China in the fourth quarter to better serve our consumers during the store closures and beyond. We were excited to launch digital clienteling, with virtual appointments and customized filing recommendations based on Chaps previous purchases. This program helped to mitigate traffic declines and leverage store inventories while consumers stayed home. We expanded our Buy Online Ship From Store program to provide greater convenience and limit face-to-face interactions as stores reopen. These initiatives, combined with our digital marketing, drove a 76% increase in China digital sales in the fourth quarter, significantly outperforming the broader apparel industry in February and March. These programs are being tested and rolled out in North America and Europe. And over the coming weeks, we're exploring other contactless options like curbside pickup and self-checkout in many locations. 
As our China stores reopened in early March, we implemented new safety measures across our stores, offices and distribution centers to protect both our employees and consumers. Store measures include frequent deep cleanings, providing masks for employees and strongly encouraging them for shoppers and limiting capacity inside our stores to ensure social distancing. 
While our digital business led the recovery in Mainland China with a return to pre-COVID growth rates in March, we were encouraged by the recovery in our brick-and-mortar stores resulting from these omnichannel and in-store programs. We saw steady improvement in Mainland sales from high double-digit declines in February at the peak of our closures, ramping back to positive growth in early May. We expect Mainland China to return to pre-COVID growth trends by Q2. 
Although we expect the shape and timing of recovery curves to look different in each market, our experience and lessons from China are informing our actions across the rest of Asia, Europe and North America. Despite challenging conditions around the world, I strongly believe this crisis is creating opportunities for our business to emerge leaner, more agile and ultimately take market share. All of this is enabled by the strength of our balance sheet and our brands, coupled with the ingenuity and commitment of our diverse global teams. 
Turning now to fourth quarter and fiscal '20 results. While COVID-19 was clearly the biggest headwind we faced this year, we were encouraged by our underlying progress on our Next Great Chapter plan prior to the pandemic with our business on track to exceed top and bottom line targets. Our brand elevation work, inclusive of product, marketing and distribution, came together to deliver positive AUR growth across all 3 regions for both the quarter and the year. And while the future remains relatively uncertain, we are confident that the key strategic pillars of our Next Great Chapter plan still hold true. Let me touch briefly on a few of these areas. 
First, in our efforts to win over a new generation, we have created unique and lasting connections with consumers over the first 2 years of our plan. And we believe that now more than ever is the time to build on this momentum and solidify our iconic brand leadership. Globally, Ralph Lauren brand consideration accelerated through the fourth quarter and into April, outperforming our benchmark peers in each region. Our total social media followers surpassed 43 million in the fourth quarter, a double-digit increase to last year. 
This was led by very strong increases on TikTok, one of the fastest-growing social media platforms for Gen Z. While we only launched TikTok last summer, we are encouraged that we've already established ourselves as 1 of the top 3 luxury brands on the platform. Going forward, as markets reopen, we will continue to focus on the type of values-based messaging that is resonating with consumers across geographies. This work will be underpinned by the targeted personalized marketing that we started earlier this year to drive higher quality of sales. 
Our brands are defined by values like optimism, quality and togetherness, which are especially relevant in the current context. We will continue to tap into these authentic values to drive momentum across digital and social channels in fiscal '21. 
Second, we continue to energize our core products and accelerate our high-potential, underdeveloped categories this year, led by outerwear and denim. Starting with Ralph's original vision, it has never been just about 1 category or 1 item, but rather, it's about a lifestyle, which means we can credibly flex across our breadth of products and categories as consumer behaviors change. And with the emergence of COVID, we have seen consumers gravitate towards the simple and true luxuries in life: family, togetherness, the outdoors. Within our assortments, this has translated to stronger sales of comfort categories such as loungewear, athleisure and home. 
In addition, the competitive advantage of our well-established core is becoming even more evident. Over the course of this year, we had rebalanced our assortments towards core products, which have faster lead times and less markdown risk versus seasonal fashion items that only live for one season. As the industry grapples with excess spring inventory due to COVID, our increased penetration of core gives us more strategic flexibility to work through our inventories and drive AUR growth. 
With regards to our third key initiative, targeted expansion, we continue to build out our ecosystem approach of a cohesive, brand elevating Ralph Lauren experience across retail, wholesale and digital commerce around the world in fiscal '20. 
Prior to COVID, we opened 25 net new stores and concessions globally. This included 18 net openings in China, our fastest-growing market. While we are carefully evaluating our footprint across direct-to-consumer and wholesale channels in this rapidly evolving environment, we continue to see significant long-term opportunities for our brands in underpenetrated markets, led by China and parts of Europe. 
Our fourth key initiative is lead with digital. Earlier, I talked about how we accelerated digital and omnichannel initiatives in China this quarter, which are now being implemented in other parts of the world. In addition, we continue to expand our global digital commerce presence across new platforms and partnerships, including our April launch on Instagram Checkout, our first social commerce platform in North America. And we are launching our digital commerce site soon in Japan. We're also making meaningful strides in digitizing how we work, which is an important part of our journey to drive faster lead kinds, minimize physical waste and reduce costs. 
In fiscal '20, we launched our digital library and 3D design studio. This represents a major milestone for our company as it will eventually enable us to digitize our entire end-to-end process from product development all the way to how we communicate with our consumers. We started this process by digitizing all of our Polo core styles, raw materials and trims onto a digital library. Starting in fiscal '21, we will create 3D prototypes for all of our core Polo products, replacing traditional physical samples. We've already created thousands of 3D prototypes in fiscal '20, and it's only the beginning, especially as our teams learn to work in new ways from home. 
And lastly, touching on our initiatives of operating with discipline to fuel growth. A key element of our long-term plan has been to balance growth with productivity, which includes driving a culture of cost discipline across our organization. This has come into even greater focus in the context of COVID as we drive deeper near-term expense reductions and align our cost structure and inventories per shifting retail landscape. The pandemic has also highlighted the importance of continuing our journey to integrate citizenship and sustainability into our business. 
We started this fiscal year by launching our Design the Change strategy, outlining our commitments to create more sustainable products, reduce our overall environmental footprint across our operations, and support and empower our teams and partners around the world. 
Some key achievements this year included reaching our gender parity goal of equal representation in our leadership positions at the VP level and above more than 3 years ahead of our target; the launch of our Earth Polo shirt, made entirely from recycled plastic bottles; a new commitment to power all of our globally owned and operated offices, distribution centers and stores with 100% renewable electricity by 2025. And building upon that, we are now in the process of setting science-based greenhouse gas reduction targets, which we will detail in this June's annual Design to Change report. 
In addition, as suppliers around the world struggle with large-scale order cancellations in response to COVID, we reaffirmed our commitment to pay for all finished goods and goods already in production this spring. We are working with our partners to develop new sources of support and long-term job security for factory orders as we look to strengthen our supply chain partnerships, not just for the upcoming season, but for years to come. 
In closing, over the course of more than 50 years, 
our company has endured many challenging times, and the current crisis will certainly not be the last. Our purpose of inspiring the dream of a better life through authenticity and timeless style rings as true today as it did when Ralph started this business. And it will continue to guide us in these moments as we make tough decisions in the short term to protect the integrity and health of our brands so that we emerge from this challenging period in a position of strength. The foundational work that we have done to put the consumer at the center of everything we do, elevate our brands and balance growth and productivity, all while maintaining a strong balance sheet, has positioned us well to manage through the current environment. And we are privileged to have one of the greatest assets of all, the strength of our timeless global brand. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Jane, and I'll join her at the end to answer your questions."

This quarter's performance was a study in contrast. We started the spring season with strong continued momentum on our brand elevation journey, with AUR and margins exceeding our expectations as we delivered",1935,"Thank you, Patrice, and good morning, everyone. This quarter's performance was a study in contrast. We started the spring season with strong continued momentum on our brand elevation journey, with AUR and margins exceeding our expectations as we delivered improved merchandising, expanded digital capabilities and elevated marketing and continued the rollout of targeted pricing increases across channels. This was followed by a very sudden decline in sales as we closed stores across Asia, followed by Europe and North America in accordance with guidelines from government and local health authorities. While our teams remain committed to our long-term strategy centered around brand elevation and targeted expansion, we are focused on managing through the near term so that we can emerge from this crisis stronger than we came into it and pivot quickly back to growth. 
We started by leveraging some key strengths, a healthy balance sheet, strong liquidity, focused execution, all made possible by our passionate and agile teams. Now more than ever, our strong balance sheet is a source of competitive advantage, giving us resilience and flexibility to continue executing our plan and elevate our brand during challenging times. 
We ended fiscal '20 with $2.1 billion in cash and investments and $1.2 billion in total debt, which compares to $2 billion in cash and investments and $689 million in debt at the end of last year. Given the uncertain environment created by COVID-19, we announced several measures to preserve cash and strengthen liquidity. 
Building on what Patrice shared, these include: first, flexing our costs where possible to align to our top line and carefully managing ongoing expenses and investments to a variable demand outlook. We are currently evaluating what the right operating cost structure and distribution footprint should be across retail and wholesale as we enter a new normal. 
Second, a reduction in planned capital expenditures to approximately $175 million to $200 million in fiscal '21. 
Third, in order to maximize our liquidity, we have temporarily suspended share buybacks. We will also temporarily suspend our dividend following the April payment that was declared in early March. This is a proactive measure to preserve cash, and our Board will revisit this quarterly as we move through the pandemic. 
And lastly, we drew down $475 million from our revolver in the quarter and are considering additional capital measures to bolster our cash balance. 
Net inventory at the end of fiscal '20 was down 10% to last year. The decline largely reflected a significant increase in inventory reserves of about $160 million to keep our inventories aligned with demand and continue our brand elevation as we move forward. Our teams are managing an unprecedented situation, but we are confident that we are taking the right strategic approach to work down excess spring '20 product while also positioning the company for future growth. 
Similar to our previous practices, we will also take a targeted approach to clearing excess merchandise. First, with the majority of the traditional spring '20 selling season lost to COVID closures, our merchants are taking the opportunity to better align our assortments to consumer behavior. As stores reopen, we will extend the season to focus on wear now styles from June through August in order to maximize full price selling and mitigate markdown risk. This includes shifting some of this season's product to warmer weather markets. 
Second, we plan to reassort a portion of our finished products into upcoming seasonal collections, including full price and factory channels. A key benefit of our classic timeless aesthetic is that many of our iconic styles resonate with consumers season after season. This merchandise is in pristine condition in our warehouses and has not yet been seen by consumers. While requiring us to hold some inventories longer than usual, this should drive strong AURs and margins once these products are brought to market and enable us to drive our AUR growth trajectory as quickly as possible. 
Third, we will utilize the full range of our channels to clear product, including targeted markdowns where product is already on selling floors, our factory stores and off-price wholesale. We have also committed to 1.5 million units of product donations to support medical workers across our 3 regions. We anticipate this process will take longer than a broad strokes end-of-season liquidation. However, our inventory reserve process aligns our inventories to expected demand. This was evident in our reserve actions in the fourth quarter. This process allows our teams to move strategically through inventories while protecting the health of our brands. 
And lastly, as we look forward, our work to reduce lead times has been a benefit under the current circumstances, enabling our teams to cancel a substantial portion of our shipments for the fall season, about 2/3 of our seasonal buys. Our shorter lead times on core product and fast track capability launched last holiday will enable us to get quickly back into inventories as demand returns, while limiting our exposure to additional excess inventory risks. 
Moving on to our fourth quarter performance. Fourth quarter revenues declined 15% on a reported basis and 14% in constant currency. Prior to COVID, our business was on track to deliver positive revenue and comp growth for both the quarter and the full year. 
Our digital ecosystem, including our directly operated flagship sites, departmentstore.com, digital pure plays and social commerce, increased mid-single digits in the fourth quarter and high single digits for the full year in constant currency. This was driven by strong double-digit growth in Asia and Europe for both periods. Meanwhile, North America improved from flat performance in the first half to mid single-digit growth in the second half of the year, as planned, all despite COVID-related disruptions. 
Adjusted gross margin was 59.1% in the fourth quarter compared to 60.1% last year. Continued improvement in pricing and promotions was more than offset by foreign currency headwinds and unfavorable geographic mix due to lower sales in Asia and Europe. AUR growth of 8% continued to exceed our expectations. 
SG&A declined 2% to last year on lower selling expenses and marketing and a modest amount of rent relief achieved in the quarter, primarily from Asia. Adjusted operating loss for the fourth quarter was $43 million compared to operating income of $96 million last year. 
Marketing declined 8% in constant currency as we shifted the timing of investments back into the Q3 holiday period and reduced performance marketing while stores were closed. For the full year, marketing growth of 3% continued to outpace our top line growth as we work to win over a new generation of consumers. 
Moving on to segment performance, starting with North America. Revenue decreased 11% to last year. Retail comps declined 13%, driven by a 15% decline in bricks-and-mortar comps and a 7% decline in our own digital comps. Brick-and-mortar comps were impacted by significant traffic declines as foreign tourist traffic slowed and we closed all stores in March. Prior to the outbreak, however, the full price and factory comps were trending up mid- to high single digits in January and February, driven by AUR growth and improved product assortments. 
AUR for the quarter was up low double digits across our brick-and-mortar fleet, driven by our continued rollout of targeted ticket price increases, reduced promotional cadence and stronger product mix. Comps in our North America directly operated digital commerce business were down 7%. 
Traffic and conversion were negatively impacted by 2 proactive decisions on our part. First, with the onset of COVID in March, we suspended all promotional activity and performance-driven marketing to our site as our employees and consumers focused on their safety and well-being. 
Second, we temporarily closed our U.S. distribution center in late March for deep cleaning and new safety protocols. While our site was still technically operational, delayed order fulfillment negatively impacted our conversion rates. As we resumed our marketing activities and limited DC operations in April, we saw a meaningful improvement in both digital traffic and comps. 
In North America wholesale, fourth quarter revenue declined 12%. Prior to store closures in mid-March, our sell-out performance was improving slightly on  a year-over-year basis to down mid-single digits, driven by rebalanced assortments and improved product offering. The additional declines were driven by order cancellations in the last few weeks of March as our customers closed stores due to COVID. 
Moving on to Europe. Fourth quarter revenue declined 19% on a reported basis and 16% in constant currency. Europe retail comps declined 16%, driven by an 18% decrease in our brick-and-mortar stores and a 2% decrease in our owned digital commerce sites. 
Across our Europe direct-to-consumer channels, our ongoing effort to elevate the brand and improve product mix continued in the fourth quarter, with AUR up 10%. This is consistent with our long-term strategy to drive higher quality of sales and price harmonization in the marketplace. 
Digital commerce comps on our own site were pressured by a temporary closure of our distribution center and a pause on product-driven marketing due to COVID, similar to North America. Total digital ecosystem sales grew double digits in constant currency, driven by performance in both wholesale.com and digital pure plays. 
Europe wholesale revenue declined 18% in constant currency, driven by COVID-related pressures at bricks and mortar stores. These declines were partially offset by strong double-digit growth in our digital pure play and wholesale.com businesses. 
Turning to Asia. Revenue declined 22% on a reported basis and 21% in constant currency in the fourth quarter. AUR increased high single digits as our product and marketing initiatives continue to resonate well in the region. While performance varied by market, we saw the biggest percentage declines in Mainland China, the epicenter of the pandemic, where the majority of our stores were closed for about 5 weeks. Brick-and-mortar sales trends improved sequentially from trough levels in February turning positive in early May. 
Despite significant challenges from store closures across Asia, we were encouraged by continued momentum in our digital businesses in the quarter, with our digital ecosystem up high teens driven by strong momentum in China and Korea. Looking ahead, as we navigate the current environment, we remain, first and foremost, committed to the safety of our employees, partners and consumers. 
Due to the high level of uncertainty and the evolving situation surrounding COVID-19, we are suspending future guidance. We expect our financial results for the first quarter and full year fiscal '21 to be significantly negatively impacted by the pandemic. 
In the near term, we are focused on positioning the company to get back to sustainable growth and value creation as quickly as possible. This includes preserving balance sheet strength, aligning our cost base in inventories to the new normal and optimizing our distribution, all while protecting the health of our brands. 
Though the timing and path of recovery in each market presents many uncertainties, we have developed scenarios through which we plan to safely return our businesses to growth. As Patrice outlined, China was our first market to emerge from business closures, laying out a path to normalization, and we will leverage many of these key learnings as we reopen around the world. 
In closing, we are proud of the focus, agility and passion our teams have demonstrated through personally and professionally challenging times. We believe the Ralph Lauren brand has momentum. We have the right strategic priorities and the discipline to manage through this period and emerge in a position of strength. Now as ever, we are proud to have an iconic brand and to be led by Ralph's creative vision. This has endured the test of time.

So let me start by saying that, fortunately, we actually entered this crisis in a position of strength and with momentum, right? We have a solid balance sheet and cash position. We've been expanding our direct-to-consumer and digital presence. We've created a more flexible and diversified global supply chain. And we have a brand that credibly flexes across categories, underpinned by values that are really resonating in this moment. Think timelessness, optimism together is trust. We've also done a lot prior to the crisis to build agility and resilience in our teams, and this is obviously now more relevant than ever. So given the solid foundation, we believe we ultimately have an opportunity to gain market share as we emerge from this crisis. With respect to our Next Great Chapter strategy, the strategic pillars of our plan completely hold true today in the current environment, but there's a clear opportunity to accelerate some of the priorities. Let me give you 3 examples. There are many more, but the 3 I would highlight are: first, continuing to accelerate digital, right. We transformed our digital selling platforms over the last 3 years, new e-commerce platform, new OMS system, mobile personalization and connected retail streams. So we have a strong infrastructure in place when it comes to digital commerce and connected retail. We're fast tracking and scaling new digital capabilities like digital clienteling and other forms of virtual selling. And we're encouraged by our progress and early reads so far, including understanding what we've done in China recently. 
The second thing I'd call out is assessing our store footprint. So we still believe in the role of the store, and we're encouraged by the early connected retail interventions like curbside pickup, for example, but we're going to continue to review our store portfolio in the context of our omnichannel strategy. And especially within North America wholesale, this means continuing to concentrate on our most productive brick-and-mortar doors, which are generally the top doors of our wholesale partners anyhow, as we also grow select wholesale.com opportunities. 
And the third example I would call out, Dana, is around scaling new ways of working for us. And we've been able to do things in weeks and days that typically would have taken us months or years to do. This includes our ability to work remotely around the world, continuing to digitize our end-to-end value chain and also driving a culture of cost discipline, which is obviously critical in the current environment that we're in. So the strategic pillars of our strategic -- of our Next Great Chapter plan still hold true in this environment. We are feeling actually quite good about that. But there's a clear opportunity to accelerate some of the priorities, some of which I just called out for you. And then I think, Jane, you'll cover the Q1 question."

Dana, we're not giving guidance for Q1, but let me just give you some color and shape about how we're thinking about it. We expect right now that Q1 will be the quarter with the most significant impact from COVID as we see it now. On an order of magnitude basis, consider Q1 in contrast to Q4. In Q4, we had 2 weeks of closures approximately versus about 8 to 10 weeks of closures in Q1. And even after opening stores, we've seen a gradual and elongated recovery period. As you look across every region, we expect the impact of COVID to be most pronounced in Q1. I think that's probably very clear for North America and Europe, where we were closed almost the entirety of April and May, with stores just starting to come back online. Today, a little less than 50% of North America stores are now open. And in Europe, which is a bit further ahead, about 2/3 of the stores are now open. But all with -- operating with reduced hours, reduce traffic and with new social distancing requirements. Compared to our experience in Mainland China and Korea, we do expect a more prolonged recovery with improvement over time. And obviously, this is going to vary by market. In Asia, which was ahead of the curve and where we're 90% open, we still will see the biggest impact in Q1 where markets like Japan, Southeast Asia and Australia and even parts of China saw large COVID impacts in the first quarter. We are encouraged by the way that the digital sales are leading as infrastructure opens, and our teams are very clear that opening stores is the first step to getting back to comp growth. So we're all focused on that and prioritizing that. 
And just as you think about expenses in FY '21 from a cadence standpoint, from a cost perspective, as you saw in our 8-K, we took substantial actions as we closed out the fourth quarter. We furloughed about 80% of our workforce in April, and this will continue through June. And as we begin to ramp back up employees and infrastructure to support sales in late June, and we'll stage -- we'll stage that with -- as demand stabilizes. But our largest SG&A reductions will be in Q1 and at a little bit over 25%, and then it will moderate for -- the reductions will moderate for there as demand stabilizes. So a little bit of color on the quarter and our expectations in what we're seeing in the market for the year."

Our business is nonexistent at JCPenney's and relatively small at Neiman Marcus.

As far as e-commerce is concerned, we -- let me start east first. I guess, we're feeling very good about the performance in China. I think you heard us say February, March, up 76% while the overall sector was down, so we were gaining share in that environment. We can give you some color on the specific weeks for March and April, which Jane will give you. But I think overall, with all the new capabilities that we've put in place, whether that's digital clienteling, whether that's all the connected retail capabilities, we are encouraged by the progress we're making on .com.

Matt, let me give you some color on what we've seen on a quarter-to-date basis across the regions. APAC, as we said, we closed out Q4. Very strong across Asia on our e-commerce business, and that has only built. So April and into May, we've seen very strong and positive e-commerce trends closing out in the -- sometimes, we've seen rates of triple-digit growth in APAC, so very strong. In Europe, while we did see some -- we reported down 3% on our own platform in Q4. As we've come out and especially as we closed out April, and I think people saw the end of the crisis, we've been seeing very strong trends across Europe. So we've had double -- solid double-digit growth in Europe on a very high-quality of sales number where we're seeing double-digit growth in AUR on our e-commerce site in Europe. So strong quality of sales and strong momentum. North America, which is probably the furthest behind in regions in terms of store openings and recovery, we reported down 7% in the fourth quarter. And it's really been in May that we've started to see e-commerce back solid and double-digit growth, but it's been building on a week-over-week basis, so encouraging there. So we do see, as our stores open, digital leads and it starts to build over time. As we've gotten -- we're sort of in the early days, if you will, in terms of store opening productivity, 50% open in North America and really very early on that journey, 2/3 open in Europe. Still early days on that journey, which makes our experience anecdotal. I can tell you, in China, as stores reopened, traffic remained weak in the initial weeks but with strong conversion. So buyers who are coming to the store were motivated and ADTs, average daily transactions, average value transactions were up strongly. Conversion was up strongly and AUR has continued to be up strongly. I can give you some -- we're not -- it's early days, but I can tell you, as we think about our trajectory in overall in Asia, that it will be different in North America. But coming out of January, we saw -- if I think about the Asia, we were up strongly in January, up 40%. February saw the biggest declines, down well over 80%. March, we started to recover, digital sales started to come back. In April, sales were down high single digits. And so far in May, we're really encouraged by the improvements. Everything was turning positive in early May as Beijing and other larger cities restrictions lifted, and we expect to be strongly back to growth in Q2 of this year in Mainland China. So encouraged by that trajectory. Don't expect to be a cookie-cutter approach across the regions, but that's what we've seen so far."

You've mentioned it a lot of times today. Now the apparel world is about to go on a huge sale, given what we've heard around the space. I have no doubt you'll tell me the AUR story continues to be critical to the long term.

Let me step back and tell you why we decided to report both our NRV reserve and our bad debt as a non-GAAP item. We believe that it is entirely related to the experience of COVID, where we lost a selling season. So it's not a business as usual NRV reserve. It was significant. The process that we went through as a team was we took stock of all of our inventory flows, our commitments at suppliers on a fabric basis. And then went back to our strategy and said, what can we reasonably move through to continue our quality of sales journey with our own liquidation channels, with stretching seasons while moving into warmer weather channels and reassorting the line in coming seasons. And then what do we remain with? And how do we reserve appropriately to protect the AUR and gross margin progress that we've done to date. So we really looked at it, a complete life cycle view. That's not a different process. We've been doing that process for well over 2 years. The magnitude and the onetime impact was greater. So we -- that's why we reflected it. If our in our reserve is too small or too great, we will take that -- on what we reserved, we will take that also on a non-GAAP basis below the line so that you and our investors can track our true progress on gross margin as we move through this COVID environment. That's our rationale. We'll take -- if there is better selling, then you'll see an adjustment on a non-GAAP item in NRV. As a good vendor, I want to remind you that we know that we have made a commitment to pay for products that were perhaps cut but we did not have ownership of in Q1. There will be some reflection of that in Q1. The magnitude we'll disclose in Q1. As I look at overall the -- your question on the AUR story, you're exactly right. You know me well. We are continuing this AUR journey. And that is -- and that was really behind some of the actions you saw us take in the fourth quarter. We're committed to it. And so we took an inventory reserve that protects that. I think the good news is that the long-term drivers of AUR growth are still intact. We're elevating our product, we're elevating our marketing, and we're elevating our shopping experience. We have shown that we can take strategic -- designers are working on right now so that we have a cohesive line in spring and get full price sell-through on some of that product -- and this personalization is proving highly effective as a lever to drive AUR. North America in the fourth quarter had AURs up 10%. So really significant and positive growth there, so we have every intent to continue that journey. So we are excited about that. Know that there's some variability, but we feel our actions in the fourth quarter and our plans for this year are completely consistent with our continued AUR journey."

We've done a lot of work to increase the responsiveness of our supply chain. We have the digitization that I referred to earlier, has obviously been a key enabler to that. The other thing that I think really separates us from many of our peers is core is such an important part of our business, right? And we are known for the number of core iconic SKUs. Now the good news is the core SKUs are the easier and faster SKUs to chase into, right? And we've also platformed fabrics. The team has done a wonderful job platforming the fabrics and various trims and others. So we have the ability on core to go fast. And then finally, and I don't know if you remember when I referred to this, I think it was like 2 or 3 quarters ago. We've developed a fast -- what we've called the fast track capability internally. I think I gave you the example of the sweatshirt that we had developed with one of our wholesale partners from idea to shipment, 16 days, right, coming from Asia. And I think at Ralph Lauren, sometimes we're known for more longer lead times than days. Sometimes we've been talked about months rather than days. This capability, we've scaled up since we developed it. So this fast track capability is -- will be a fantastic platform for us to react to what we see in the market as we work with our wholesale partners. 
All right. Well listen, thanks to all of you for joining our call today. On behalf of all of us here at Ralph Lauren, we wish you and your families the best of health and safety. Take good care, and we'll talk to you in a few months. Have a great day. Thank you."

The spread of COVID-19 around the world has been devastating, and our thoughts are with the many impacted by the virus. The pandemic has not only affected our organization and recent financial performance, but it has had unprecedented consequences on the communities we operate in around the world.  
Under these extraordinary circumstances, our teams have responded to the call with agility and resilience. Working tirelessly from their living rooms and kitchen tables across time zones. Ralph and I want to recognize and thank them for their dedication and commitment. Our objective is to emerge from this period stronger than we came into it. And before we review our recent financial performance, I want to spend some time on the actions we are taking to ensure we not only endure through this crisis, but are positioned to thrive long term.  
From the start of the outbreak, we moved quickly to protect the safety and well-being of our employees, consumers and communities. This included widespread store and office closures, led by Asia in late January, followed by Europe and North America in March. Like many of you, we are working in new ways across the company, including working from home, and we've implemented new health and safety measures where that is not possible.  
We also took proactive steps to ensure the long-term financial health of our business, including expense reductions, further strengthening our balance sheet and liquidity and pivoting our supply chain to adjust inventories to changing demand. Meanwhile, we accelerated efforts to drive sales to our digital ecosystem as consumers stayed home.  
On the expense side, we've been addressing our most significant fixed cost around the world. This includes ongoing work with our landlords to negotiate rent relief and pausing all new store build-outs. We reduced corporate expenses, including a freeze on our global travel and hiring during the crisis. And in April, we announced pay cuts for our executives, Board and me, along with furloughing or flexing down a significant number of our employees across the company. Ralph is foregoing his bonus for fiscal '20 and his entire salary for fiscal '21.  
We have also focused on delivering on our purpose in the communities in which we operate. For example, in March, we donated $10 million toward emergency COVID relief through our Ralph Lauren Corporate Foundation. These funds will support the COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund, our long-standing partners in Cancer Care, our employee relief fund to support Ralph Lauren employees in need and the CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund for COVID-19 relief. We also mobilized our teams and supply chain to deliver 250,000 masks and 50,000 isolation gallons to support medical staff. And we are providing 1.5 million units of comfort apparel, hundreds of meals and even Ralph's Coffee for frontline workers across many of our key markets.  
Next, I want to share some perspective on our experience managing through COVID in Mainland China over the past few months. As we prepare to reopen markets around the world, we're applying learnings and strategies from China where the recent recovery gives us confidence that we are making the right decisions now to position our company for long-term sustainable growth and value creation. We started the quarter with strong, continued momentum in Mainland China, our fastest growing market, with sales up more than 35% in January, driven by all of our direct-to-consumer channels. By early February, we closed nearly all of our stores in the market due to COVID. We took early strategic actions across marketing and distribution in China, which we have applied in our other markets as the pandemic continued to spread.  
First, we quickly shifted our marketing to focus on optimistic messages around family, togetherness and giving, values that have always been an authentic part of who we are. We partnered with celebrities like JJ Lin, Jim and Wang Leehom to amplify our messaging. This content resonated well with our consumers across Asia, driving over 124 million video views and a 33% increase in positive brand mentions on social media in Q4 versus Q3.  
Second, we accelerated our digital and omnichannel capabilities in China in the fourth quarter to better serve our consumers during the store closures and beyond. We were excited to launch digital clienteling, with virtual appointments and customized filing recommendations based on shopper's previous purchases. This program helped to mitigate traffic declines and leverage store inventories while consumers stayed home. We expanded our Buy Online-Ship From Store program to provide greater convenience and limit face-to-face interactions as stores reopen. These initiatives, combined with our digital marketing, drove a 76% increase in China digital sales in the fourth quarter, significantly outperforming the broader apparel industry in February and March. These programs are being tested and rolled out in North America and Europe. And over the coming weeks, we're exploring other contactless options like curbside pickup and self-checkout in many locations.  
As our China stores reopened in early March, we implemented new safety measures across our stores, offices and distribution centers to protect both our employees and consumers. Store measures include frequent deep cleanings, providing masks for employees and strongly encouraging them for shoppers, and limiting capacity inside our stores to ensure social distancing.  
While our digital business led the recovery in Mainland China with a return to pre-COVID growth rates in March, we were encouraged by the recovery in our brick-and-mortar stores resulting from these omnichannel and in-store programs. We saw steady improvement in Mainland sales from high double-digit declines in February at the peak of our closures, ramping back to positive growth in early May. We expect Mainland China to return to pre-COVID growth trends by Q2.  
Although we expect the shape and timing of recovery curves to look different in each market, our experience and lessons from China are informing our actions across the rest of Asia, Europe and North America. Despite challenging conditions around the world, I strongly believe this crisis is creating opportunities for our business to emerge leaner, more agile and ultimately take market share. All of this is enabled by the strength of our balance sheet and our brands, coupled with the ingenuity and commitment of our diverse global teams.  
Turning now to fourth quarter and fiscal '20 results. While COVID-19 was clearly the biggest headwind we faced this year, we were encouraged by our underlying progress on our Next Great Chapter plan prior to the pandemic with our business on track to exceed top and bottom line targets. Our brand elevation work, inclusive of product, marketing and distribution, came together to deliver positive AUR growth across all 3 regions for both the quarter and the year. And while the future remains relatively uncertain, we are confident that the key strategic pillars of our Next Great Chapter plan still hold true. Let me touch briefly on a few of these areas.  
First, in our efforts to win over a new generation, we have created unique and lasting connections with consumers over the first 2 years of our plan. And we believe that now more than ever is the time to build on this momentum and solidify our iconic brand leadership. Globally, Ralph Lauren brand consideration accelerated through the fourth quarter and into April, outperforming our benchmark peers in each region. Our total social media followers surpassed 43 million in the fourth quarter, a double-digit increase to last year.  
This was led by very strong increases on TikTok, one of the fastest-growing social media platforms for Gen Z. While we only launched TikTok last summer, we were encouraged that we've already established ourselves as 1 of the top 3 luxury brands on the platform. Going forward, as markets reopen, we will continue to focus on the type of values-based messaging that is resonating with consumers across geographies. This work will be underpinned by the targeted personalized marketing that we started earlier this year to drive higher quality of sales. Our brands are defined by values like optimism, quality and togetherness, which are especially relevant in the current context. We will continue to tap into these authentic values to drive momentum across digital and social channels in fiscal '21.  
Second, we continue to energize our core products and accelerate our high-potential, underdeveloped categories this year, led by outerwear and denim. Starting with Ralph's original vision, it has never been just about one category or one item, but rather it's about a lifestyle, which means we can credibly flex across our breadth of products and categories as consumer behaviors change. And with the emergence of COVID, we have seen consumers gravitate towards the simple and true luxuries in life: family, togetherness, the outdoors. Within our assortments, this has translated to stronger sales of comfort categories such as loungewear, athleisure and home.  
In addition, the competitive advantage of our well-established core is becoming even more evident. Over the course of this year, we had rebalanced our assortments towards core products, which have faster lead times and less markdown risks versus seasonal fashion items that only live for one season. As the industry grapples with excess spring inventory due to COVID, our increased penetration of core gives us more strategic flexibility to work through our inventories and drive AUR growth. 
With regards to our third key initiative, targeted expansion, we continue to build out our ecosystem approach of a cohesive, brand-elevating Ralph Lauren experience across retail, wholesale and digital commerce around the world in fiscal '20. 
Prior to COVID, we opened 25 net new stores and concessions globally. This included 18 net openings in China, our fastest-growing market. While we are carefully evaluating our footprint across direct-to-consumer and wholesale channels in this rapidly evolving environment, we continue to see significant long-term opportunities for our brands in underpenetrated markets, led by China and parts of Europe. 
Our fourth key initiative is lead with digital. Earlier, I talked about how we accelerated digital and omnichannel initiatives in China this quarter, which are now being implemented in other parts of the world. In addition, we continue to expand our global digital commerce presence across new platforms and partnerships, including our April launch on Instagram Checkout, our first social commerce platform in North America, and we are launching our digital commerce site soon in Japan. We're also making meaningful strides in digitizing how we work, which is an important part of our journey to drive faster lead times, minimize physical waste and reduce costs. 
In fiscal '20, we launched our digital library and 3D design studio. This represents a major milestone for our company as it will eventually enable us to digitize our entire end-to-end process from product development all the way to how we communicate with our consumers. We started this process by digitizing all of our Polo core styles, raw materials and trims onto a digital library. Starting in fiscal '21, we will create 3D prototypes for all of our core Polo products, replacing traditional physical samples. We've already created thousands of 3D prototypes in fiscal '20, and it's only the beginning, especially as our teams learn to work in new ways from home. 
And lastly, touching on our initiatives of operating with discipline to fuel growth. A key element of our long-term plan has been to balance growth with productivity, which includes driving a culture of cost discipline across our organization. This has come into even greater focus in the context of COVID as we drive deeper near-term expense reductions and align our cost structure and inventories through a shifting retail landscape. The pandemic has also highlighted the importance of continuing our journey to integrate citizenship and sustainability into our business. 
We started this fiscal year by launching our Design the Change strategy, outlining our commitments to create more sustainable products, reduce our overall environmental footprint across our operations, and support and empower our teams and partners around the world. 
Some key achievements this year included reaching our gender parity goal of equal representation in our leadership positions at the VP level and above more than 3 years ahead of our target; the launch of our Earth Polo shirt made entirely from recycled plastic bottles; a new commitment to power all of our globally-owned and operated offices, distribution centers and stores with 100% renewable electricity by 2025. And building upon that, we are now in the process of setting science-based greenhouse gas reduction targets, which we will detail in this June's annual Design the Change report. 
In addition, as suppliers around the world struggle with large-scale order cancellations in response to COVID, we reaffirmed our commitment to pay for all finished goods and goods already in production this spring. We are working with our partners to develop new sources of support and long-term job security for factory workers as we look to strengthen our supply chain partnerships not just for the upcoming season, but for years to come. 
In closing, over the course of more than 50 years, our company has endured many challenging times, and the current crisis will certainly not be the last. Our purpose of inspiring the dream of a better life through authenticity and timeless style rings as true today as it did when Ralph started this business. And it will continue to guide us in these moments as we make tough decisions in the short term to protect the integrity and health of our brands, so that we emerge from this challenging period in a position of strength. The foundational work that we have done to put the consumer at the center of everything we do, elevate our brands and balance growth and productivity all while maintaining a strong balance sheet, has positioned us well to manage through the current environment. And we are privileged to have one of the greatest assets of all, the strength of our timeless global brand.  
With that, I'll turn it over to Jane, and I'll join her at the end to answer your questions."

This quarter's performance was a study in contrast. We started the spring season with strong continued momentum on our brand elevation journey, with AUR and margins exceeding our expectations as we delivered",1928,"Thank you, Patrice, and good morning, everyone. This quarter's performance was a study in contrast. We started the spring season with strong continued momentum on our brand elevation journey, with AUR and margins exceeding our expectations as we delivered improved merchandising, expanded digital capabilities and elevated marketing and continued the rollout of targeted pricing increases across channels. This was followed by a very sudden decline in sales as we closed stores across Asia, followed by Europe and North America in accordance with guidelines from government and local health authorities.  
While our teams remain committed to our long-term strategy centered around brand elevation and targeted expansion, we are focused on managing through the near term so that we can emerge from this crisis stronger than we came into it and pivot quickly back to growth.  
We started by leveraging some key strengths: a healthy balance sheet, strong liquidity, focused execution, all made possible by our passionate and agile teams. Now more than ever, our strong balance sheet is a source of competitive advantage, giving us resilience and flexibility to continue executing our plan and elevate our brand during challenging times.  
We ended fiscal '20 with $2.1 billion in cash and investments and $1.2 billion in total debt, which compares to $2 billion in cash and investments and $689 million in debt at the end of last year. Given the uncertain environment created by COVID-19, we announced several measures to preserve cash and strengthen liquidity. Building on what Patrice shared, these include: First, flexing our costs where possible to align to our top line and carefully managing ongoing expenses and investments to a variable demand outlook. We are currently evaluating what the right operating cost structure and distribution footprint should be across retail and wholesale as we enter a new normal. Second, a reduction in planned capital expenditures to approximately $175 million to $200 million in fiscal '21. Third, in order to maximize our liquidity, we have temporarily suspended share buybacks. We will also temporarily suspend our dividend following the April payment that was declared in early March. This is a proactive measure to preserve cash, and our Board will revisit this quarterly as we move through the pandemic. And lastly, we drew down $475 million from our revolver in the quarter and are considering additional capital measures to bolster our cash balance.  
Net inventory at the end of fiscal '20 was down 10% to last year. The decline largely reflected a significant increase in inventory reserves of about $160 million to keep our inventories aligned with demand and continue our brand elevation as we move forward. Our teams are managing an unprecedented situation, but we are confident that we are taking the right strategic approach to work down excess spring '20 product while also positioning the company for future growth.  
Similar to our previous practices, we will also take a targeted approach to clearing excess merchandise. First, with the majority of the traditional spring '20 selling season lost to COVID closures, our merchants are taking the opportunity to better align our assortments to consumer behavior. As stores reopen, we will extend the season to focus on Wear-Now Styles from June through August in order to maximize full price selling and mitigate markdown risk. This includes shifting some of this season's product to warmer weathers markets.  
Second, we plan to reassort a portion of our finished products into upcoming seasonal collections, including full price and factory channels. A key benefit of our classic timeless aesthetic is that many of our iconic styles resonate with consumers season-after-season. This merchandise is in pristine condition in our warehouses and has not yet been seen by consumers. While requiring us to hold some inventories longer than usual, this should drive strong AURs and margins once these products are brought to market and enable us to drive our AUR growth trajectory as quickly as possible.  
Third, we will utilize the full range of our channels to clear product, including targeted markdowns where product is already on selling floors, our factory stores and off-price wholesale. We have also committed to 1.5 million units of product donations to support medical workers across our 3 regions. We anticipate this process will take longer than a broad strokes end-of-season liquidation. However, our inventory reserve process aligns our inventories to expected demand. This was evident in our reserve actions in the fourth quarter. This process allows our teams to move strategically through inventories while protecting the health of our brands.  
And lastly, as we look forward, our work to reduce lead times has been a benefit under the current circumstances, enabling our teams to cancel a substantial portion of our shipments for the fall season, about 2/3 of our seasonal buys. Our shorter lead times on core product and fast-track capability launched last holiday will enable us to get quickly back into inventories as demand returns, while limiting our exposure to additional excess inventory risks.  
Moving on to our fourth quarter performance. Fourth quarter revenues declined 15% on a reported basis and 14% in constant currency. Prior to COVID, our business was on track to deliver positive revenue and comp growth for both the quarter and the full year.  
Our digital ecosystem, including our directly-operated flagship sites, department store dot-com, digital pure plays and social commerce, increased mid-single digits in the fourth quarter and high single digits for the full year in constant currency. This was driven by strong double-digit growth in Asia and Europe for both periods. Meanwhile, North America improved from flat performance in the first half to mid-single-digit growth in the second half of the year, as planned, all despite COVID-related disruptions.  
Adjusted gross margin was 59.1% in the fourth quarter compared to 60.1% last year. Continued improvement in pricing and promotions was more than offset by foreign currency headwinds and unfavorable geographic mix due to lower sales in Asia and Europe. AUR growth of 8% continued to exceed our expectations.  
SG&A declined 2% to last year on lower selling expenses and marketing and a modest amount of rent relief achieved in the quarter, primarily from Asia. Adjusted operating loss for the fourth quarter was $43 million compared to operating income of $96 million last year.  
Marketing declined 8% in constant currency as we shifted the timing of investments back into the Q3 holiday period and reduced performance marketing while stores were closed. For the full year, marketing growth of 3% continued to outpace our top line growth as we work to win over a new generation of consumers.  
Moving on to segment performance, starting with North America. Revenue decreased 11% to last year. Retail comps declined 13%, driven by a 15% decline in bricks-and-mortar comps and a 7% decline in our own digital comps. Brick-and-mortar comps were impacted by significant traffic declines as foreign tourist traffic slowed and we closed all stores in March. Prior to the outbreak, however, the full price and factory comps were trending up mid- to high single digits in January and February, driven by AUR growth and improved product assortments.  
AUR for the quarter was up low double digits across our brick-and-mortar fleet, driven by our continued rollout of targeted ticket price increases, reduced promotional cadence and stronger product mix. Comps in our North America directly-operated digital commerce business were down 7%. 
Traffic and conversion were negatively impacted by 2 proactive decisions on our part. First, with the onset of COVID in March, we suspended all promotional activity and performance-driven marketing to our site as our employees and consumers focused on their safety and well-being. Second, we temporarily closed our U.S. distribution center in late March for deep cleaning and new safety protocols. While our site was still technically operational, delayed order fulfillment negatively impacted our conversion rates. As we resumed our marketing activities and limited DC operations in April, we saw a meaningful improvement in both digital traffic and comps.  
In North America wholesale, fourth quarter revenue declined 12%. Prior to store closures in mid-March, our sell-out performance was improving slightly on  a year-over-year basis to down mid-single digits, driven by rebalanced assortments and improved product offering. The additional declines were driven by order cancellations in the last few weeks of March as our customers closed stores due to COVID.  
Moving on to Europe. Fourth quarter revenue declined 19% on a reported basis and 16% in constant currency. Europe retail comps declined 16%, driven by an 18% decrease in our brick-and-mortar stores and a 2% decrease in our owned digital commerce sites.  
Across our Europe direct-to-consumer channels, our ongoing effort to elevate the brand and improve product mix continued in the fourth quarter, with AUR up 10%. This is consistent with our long-term strategy to drive higher quality of sales and price harmonization in the marketplace.  
Digital commerce comps on our own site were pressured by a temporary closure of our distribution center and a pause on product-driven marketing due to COVID, similar to North America. Total digital ecosystem sales grew double digits in constant currency, driven by performance in both wholesale.com and digital pure plays.  
Europe wholesale revenue declined 18% in constant currency, driven by COVID-related pressures at bricks-and-mortar stores. These declines were partially offset by strong double-digit growth in our digital pure play and wholesale.com businesses.  
Turning to Asia. Revenue declined 22% on a reported basis and 21% in constant currency in the fourth quarter. AUR increased high single digits as our product and marketing initiatives continue to resonate well in the region. While performance varied by market, we saw the biggest percentage declines in Mainland China, the epicenter of the pandemic, where the majority of our stores were closed for about 5 weeks. Brick-and-mortar sales trends improved sequentially from trough levels in February turning positive in early May. Despite significant challenges from store closures across Asia, we were encouraged by continued momentum in our digital businesses in the quarter, with our digital ecosystem up high teens driven by strong momentum in China and Korea.  
Looking ahead, as we navigate the current environment, we remain, first and foremost, committed to the safety of our employees, partners and consumers. Due to the high level of uncertainty and the evolving situation surrounding COVID-19, we are suspending future guidance. We expect our financial results for the first quarter and full year fiscal '21 to be significantly negatively impacted by the pandemic.  
In the near term, we are focused on positioning the company to get back to sustainable growth and value creation as quickly as possible. This includes preserving balance sheet strength, aligning our cost base in inventories to the new normal and optimizing our distribution, all while protecting the health of our brands.  
Though the timing and path of recovery in each market presents many uncertainties, we have developed scenarios through which we plan to safely return our businesses to growth. As Patrice outlined, China was our first market to emerge from business closures, laying out a path to normalization, and we will leverage many of these key learnings as we reopen around the world.  
In closing, we are proud of the focus, agility and passion our teams have demonstrated through personally and professionally challenging times. We believe the Ralph Lauren brand has momentum. We have the right strategic priorities and the discipline to manage through this period and emerge in a position of strength. Now as ever, we are proud to have an iconic brand and to be led by Ralph's creative vision. This has endured the test of time.

So let me start by saying that, fortunately, we actually entered this crisis in a position of strength and with momentum, right? We have a solid balance sheet and cash position. We've been expanding our direct-to-",482,"Great. Dana, thank you for your question. So let me start by saying that, fortunately, we actually entered this crisis in a position of strength and with momentum, right? We have a solid balance sheet and cash position. We've been expanding our direct-to-consumer and digital presence. We've created a more flexible and diversified global supply chain. And we have a brand that credibly flexes across categories, underpinned by values that are really resonating in this moment. Think timelessness, optimism, togetherness, trust. We've also done a lot prior to the crisis to build agility and resilience in our teams, and this is obviously now more relevant than ever. So given the solid foundation, we believe we ultimately have an opportunity to gain market share as we emerge from this crisis. 
With respect to our Next Great Chapter strategy, the strategic pillars of our plan completely hold true today in the current environment, but there's a clear opportunity to accelerate some of the priorities. Let me give you 3 examples. There are many more, but the 3 I would highlight are: first, continuing to accelerate digital, right? We transformed our digital selling platforms over the last 3 years, new e-commerce platform, new OMS system, mobile personalization and connected retail streams. So we have a strong infrastructure in place when it comes to digital commerce and connected retail. We're fast tracking and scaling new digital capabilities like digital clienteling and other forms of virtual selling. And we're encouraged by our progress and early reads so far, including understanding what we've done in China recently. 
The second thing I'd call out is assessing our store footprint. So we still believe in the role of the store, and we're encouraged by the early connected retail interventions like curbside pickup, for example, but we're going to continue to review our store portfolio in the context of our omnichannel strategy. And especially within North America wholesale, this means continuing to concentrate on our most productive brick-and-mortar doors, which are generally the top doors of our wholesale partners anyhow, as we also grow select wholesale.com opportunities.  
And the third example I would call out, Dana, is around scaling new ways of working for us. And we've been able to do things in weeks and days that typically would have taken us months or years to do. This includes our ability to work remotely around the world, continuing to digitize our end-to-end value chain and also driving a culture of cost discipline, which is obviously critical in the current environment that we're in. So the strategic pillars of our strategic -- of our Next Great Chapter plan still hold true in this environment. We are feeling actually quite good about that. But there's a clear opportunity to accelerate some of the priorities, some of which I just called out for you. And then I think, Jane, you'll cover the Q1 question."

Dana, we're not giving guidance for Q1, but let me just give you some color and shape about how we're thinking about it. We expect right now that Q1 will be the quarter with the most significant impact from COVID as we see it now. On an order-of-magnitude basis, consider Q1 in contrast to Q4. In Q4, we had 2 weeks of closures approximately versus about 8 to 10 weeks of closures in Q1. And even after opening stores, we've seen a gradual and elongated recovery period. As you look across every region, we expect the impact of COVID to be most pronounced in Q1. I think that's probably very clear for North America and Europe, where we were closed almost the entirety of April and May, with stores just starting to come back online. Today, a little less than 50% of North America stores are now open. And in Europe, which is a bit further ahead, about 2/3 of the stores are now open. But all with -- operating with reduced hours, reduced traffic and with new social distancing requirements. Compared to our experience in Mainland China and Korea, we do expect a more prolonged recovery with improvement over time. And obviously, this is going to vary by market.  
In Asia, which was ahead of the curve and where we're 90% open, we still will see the biggest impact in Q1 where markets like Japan, Southeast Asia and Australia and even parts of China saw large COVID impacts in the first quarter. We are encouraged by the way that the digital sales are leading as infrastructure opens, and our teams are very clear that opening stores is the first step to getting back to comp growth. So we're all focused on that and prioritizing that. And just as you think about expenses in FY '21 from a cadence standpoint, from a cost perspective, as you saw in our 8-K, we took substantial actions as we closed out the fourth quarter. We furloughed about 80% of our workforce in April, and this will continue through June. And as we begin to ramp back up, employees and infrastructure to support sales in late June, and we'll stage -- we'll stage that with -- as demand stabilizes. But our largest SG&A reductions will be in Q1 and a little bit over 25%, and then it will moderate for -- the reductions will moderate there as demand stabilizes. So a little bit of color on the quarter and our expectations in what we're seeing in the market for the year."

Importantly, for all of you on the call, these recent bankruptcies from JCPenney's and Neiman Marcus actually don't impact us. Our business is nonexistent at JCPenney's and relatively small at Neiman Marcus.

We attribute that to all the work that we've done on values communication and also all the philanthropic work that we've done across the region. So feeling that we've got good tailwinds there. As far as e-commerce is concerned, we -- let me start east first. I guess, we're feeling very good about the performance in China. I think you heard us say February, March, up 76% while the overall sector was down, so we were gaining share in that environment. We can give you some color on the specific weeks for March and April, which Jane will give you. But I think overall, with all the new capabilities that we've put in place, whether that's digital clienteling, whether that's all the connected retail capabilities, we are encouraged by the progress we're making on dot-com.

Matt, let me give you some color on what we've seen on a quarter-to-date basis across the regions. APAC, as we said, we closed out Q4 very strong across Asia on our e-commerce business, and that has only built. So April and into May, we've seen very strong and positive e-commerce trends closing out in the -- sometimes, we've seen rates of triple-digit growth in APAC, so very strong. In Europe, while we did see some -- we reported down 3% on our own platform in Q4. As we've come out and especially as we closed out April, and I think people saw the end of the crisis, we've been seeing very strong trends across Europe. So we've had double -- solid double-digit growth in Europe on a very high quality of sales number where we're seeing double-digit growth in AUR on our e-commerce site in Europe. So strong quality of sales and strong momentum. 
North America, which is probably the furthest behind in regions in terms of store openings and recovery, we reported down 7% in the fourth quarter. And it's really been in May that we've started to see e-commerce back to solid and double-digit growth, but it's been building on a week-over-week basis, so encouraging there. So we do see, as our stores open, digital leads and it starts to build over time. 
As we've gotten -- we're sort of in the early days, if you will, in terms of store opening productivity, 50% open in North America and really very early on that journey, 2/3 open in Europe. Still early days on that journey, which makes our experience anecdotal. I can tell you, in China, as stores reopened, traffic remained weak in the initial weeks but with strong conversion. So buyers who are coming to the store were motivated and ADTs, average daily transactions, average value transactions were up strongly. Conversion was up strongly and AUR has continued to be up strongly. I can give you some -- we're not -- it's early days, but I can tell you, as we think about our trajectory in -- overall in Asia, that it will be different in North America. But coming out of January, we saw -- if I think about the Asia, we were up strongly in January, up 40%. February saw the biggest declines, down well over 80%. March, we started to recover, digital sales started to come back. In April, sales were down high single digits. And so far in May, we're really encouraged by the improvements. Everything was turning positive in early May as Beijing and other larger cities' restrictions lifted, and we expect to be strongly back to growth in Q2 of this year in Mainland China. So encouraged by that trajectory. Don't expect to be a cookie-cutter approach across the regions, but that's what we've seen so far."

You've mentioned it a lot of times today. Now the apparel world is about to go on a huge sale, given what we've heard around the space. I have no doubt you'll tell me the AUR story continues to be critical to the long term.

Let me step back and tell you why we decided to report both our NRV reserve and our bad debt as a non-GAAP item. We believe that it is entirely related to the experience of COVID, where we lost a selling season. So it's not a business as usual NRV reserve. It was significant. The process that we went through as a team was we took stock of all of our inventory flows, our commitments at suppliers on a fabric basis, and then went back to our strategy and said, what can we reasonably move through to continue our quality of sales journey with our own liquidation channels, with stretching the seasons while moving into warmer-weather channels and reassorting the line in coming seasons? And then what do we remain with? And how do we reserve appropriately to protect the AUR and gross margin progress that we've done to date. So we really looked at it, a complete life cycle view. That's not a different process. We've been doing that process for well over 2 years. The magnitude and the onetime impact was greater. So we -- that's why we reflected it. 
If our NRV reserve is too small or too great, we will take that on what we reserved, we will take that also on a non-GAAP basis below the line, so that you and our investors can track our true progress on gross margin as we move through this COVID environment. So that's our rationale. We'll take -- if there is better selling, then you'll see an adjustment on a non-GAAP item in NRV. 
As a good vendor, I want to remind you that we know that we have made a commitment to pay for products that were perhaps cut but we did not have ownership of in Q1. There will be some reflection of that in Q1. The magnitude we'll disclose in Q1. 
As I look at overall the -- your question on the AUR story, you're exactly right. You know me well. We are continuing this AUR journey. And that is -- and that was really behind some of the actions you saw us take in the fourth quarter. We're committed to it. And so we took an inventory reserve that protects that. I think the good news is that the long-term drivers of AUR growth are still intact. We're elevating our product, we're elevating our marketing, and we're elevating our shopping experience. We have shown that we can take strategic price increases and have a positive consumer reaction. That -- Q3, we posted 8% AUR. Q4, we were able to maintain 8% AUR. I'm not guiding, but I expect that our AUR journey that's consistent with our long-term guidance in FY '21, low single-digit to mid-single-digit, will continue through this year. Will it be more variable? Perhaps, but we have a clear idea of what we need to do to move through our inventory positions. Part of that will be that we are keeping inventory in our warehouses to reassort it into the line that our designers are working on right now, so that we have a cohesive line in spring and get full price sell-through on some of that product. And we're really having success in targeting promotion, targeting promotions more effectively and more efficiently. We've been able to reduce promotion days and this personalization is proving highly effective as a lever to drive AUR. 
North America in the fourth quarter had AURs up 10%. So really significant and positive growth there. So we have every intent to continue that journey. So we are excited about that. Know that there's some variability, but we feel our actions in the fourth quarter and our plans for this year are completely consistent with our continued AUR journey."

We've done a lot of work to increase the responsiveness of our supply chain. We have the digitization that I referred to earlier, has obviously been a key enabler to that. The other thing that I think really separates us from many of our peers is core is such an important part of our business, right? And we are known for the number of core iconic SKUs. Now the good news is the core SKUs are the easier and faster SKUs to chase into, right? And we've also platformed fabrics. The team has done a wonderful job platforming the fabrics and various trims and others. So we have the ability on core to go fast. And then finally -- and I don't know if you remember when I referred to this, I think it was like 2 or 3 quarters ago -- we've developed a fast -- what we've called the fast-track capability internally. I think I gave you the example of the sweatshirt that we had developed with one of our wholesale partners from idea to shipment, 16 days, right, coming from Asia. And I think at Ralph Lauren, sometimes we're known for more longer lead times than days. Sometimes we've been talked about months rather than days. This capability we've scaled up since we developed it. So this fast-track capability is -- will be a fantastic platform for us to react to what we see in the market as we work with our wholesale partners. 
All right. Well listen, thanks to all of you for joining our call today. On behalf of all of us here at Ralph Lauren, we wish you and your families the best of health and safety. Take good care, and we'll talk to you in a few months. Have a great day. Thank you."

The spread of COVID-19 around the world has been devastating, and our thoughts are with the many impacted by the virus. The pandemic has not only affected our organization and recent financial performance, but it has had unprecedented consequences on the communities we operate in around the world. 
Under these extraordinary circumstances, our teams have responded to the call with agility and resilience working tirelessly from their living rooms and kitchen tables across time zones. Ralph and I want to recognize and thank them for their dedication and commitment. Our objective is to emerge from this period stronger than we came into it. And before we review our recent financial performance, I want to spend some time on the actions we are taking to ensure we not only endure through this crisis, but are positioned to thrive long term.  
From the start of the outbreak, we moved quickly to protect the safety and well-being of our employees, consumers and communities. This included widespread store and office closures, led by Asia in late January, followed by Europe and North America in March. Like many of you, we are working in new ways across the company, including working from home, and we've implemented new health and safety measures where that is not possible.  
We also took proactive steps to ensure the long-term financial health of our business, including expense reductions, further strengthening our balance sheet and liquidity and pivoting our supply chain to adjust inventories to changing demand. Meanwhile, we accelerated efforts to drive sales to our digital ecosystem as consumers stayed home. 
On the expense side, we've been addressing our most significant fixed cost around the world. This includes ongoing work with our landlords to negotiate rent relief and pausing all new store build-outs. We reduced corporate expenses, including a freeze on all global travel and hiring during the crisis. And in April, we announced pay cuts for our executives, Board and me, along with furloughing or flexing down a significant number of our employees across the company. Ralph is foregoing his bonus for fiscal '20 and his entire salary for fiscal '21. 
We have also focused on delivering on our purpose in the communities in which we operate. For example, in March, we donated $10 million toward emergency COVID relief through our Ralph Lauren Corporate Foundation. These funds will support the COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund, our long-standing partners in Cancer Care, our Employee Relief Fund to support Ralph Lauren employees in need and the CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund for COVID-19 relief. We also mobilized our teams and supply chain to deliver 250,000 masks and 50,000 isolation gowns to support medical staff. And we are providing 1.5 million units of comfort apparel, hundreds of meals and even Ralph's Coffee for frontline workers across many of our key markets. 
Next, I want to share some perspective on our experience managing through COVID in Mainland China over the past few months. As we prepare to reopen markets around the world, we're applying learnings and strategies from China where the recent recovery gives us confidence that we are making the right decisions now to position our company for long-term sustainable growth and value creation. We started the quarter with strong, continued momentum in Mainland China, our fastest growing market, with sales up more than 35% in January, driven by all of our direct-to-consumer channels. By early February, we closed nearly all of our stores in the market due to COVID. We took early strategic actions across marketing and distribution in China, which we have applied in our other markets as the pandemic continued to spread. 
First, we quickly shifted our marketing to focus on optimistic messages around family, togetherness and giving, values that have always been an authentic part of who we are. We partnered with celebrities like JJ Lin, Jim and Wang Leehom to amplify our messaging. This content resonated well with our consumers across Asia, driving over 124 million video views and a 33% increase in positive brand mentions on social media in Q4 versus Q3. 
Second, we accelerated our digital and omnichannel capabilities in China in the fourth quarter to better serve our consumers during the store closures and beyond. We were excited to launch digital clienteling, with virtual appointments and customized filing recommendations based on shopper's previous purchases. This program helped to mitigate traffic declines and leverage store inventories while consumers stayed home. We expanded our Buy Online Ship From Store program to provide greater convenience and limit face-to-face interactions as stores reopen. These initiatives, combined with our digital marketing, drove a 76% increase in China digital sales in the fourth quarter, significantly outperforming the broader apparel industry in February and March. These programs are being tested and rolled out in North America and Europe. And over the coming weeks, we're exploring other contactless options like curbside pickup and self-checkout in many locations.  
As our China stores reopened in early March, we implemented new safety measures across our stores, offices and distribution centers to protect both our employees and consumers. Store measures include frequent deep cleanings, providing masks for employees and strongly encouraging them for shoppers, and limiting capacity inside our stores to ensure social distancing. 
While our digital business led the recovery in Mainland China with a return to pre-COVID growth rates in March, we were encouraged by the recovery in our brick and mortar stores resulting from these omnichannel and in-store programs. We saw steady improvement in Mainland sales from high double-digit declines in February at the peak of our closures, ramping back to positive growth in early May. We expect Mainland China to return to pre-COVID growth trends by Q2. 
Although we expect the shape and timing of recovery curves to look different in each market, our experience and lessons from China are informing our actions across the rest of Asia, Europe and North America. Despite challenging conditions around the world, I strongly believe this crisis is creating opportunities for our business to emerge leaner, more agile and ultimately take market share. All of this is enabled by the strength of our balance sheet and our brands, coupled with the ingenuity and commitment of our diverse global teams. 
Turning now to fourth quarter and fiscal '20 results. While COVID-19 was clearly the biggest headwind we faced this year, we were encouraged by our underlying progress on our Next Great Chapter Plan prior to the pandemic with our business on track to exceed top and bottom line targets. Our brand elevation work, inclusive of product, marketing and distribution, came together to deliver positive AUR growth across all 3 regions for both the quarter and the year. So while the future remains relatively uncertain, we are confident that the key strategic pillars of our Next Great Chapter Plan still hold true. Let me touch briefly on a few of these areas. 
First, in our efforts to win over a new generation, we have created unique and lasting connections with consumers over the first 2 years of our plan. And we believe that now more than ever, is the time to build on this momentum and solidify our iconic brand leadership. Globally, Ralph Lauren brand consideration accelerated through the fourth quarter and into April, outperforming our benchmark peers in each region. Our total social media followers surpassed 43 million in the fourth quarter, a double-digit increase to last year.  
This was led by very strong increases on TikTok, one of the fastest-growing social media platforms for Gen Z. While we only launched TikTok last summer, we are encouraged that we've already established ourselves as one of the top 3 luxury brands on the platform. Going forward, as markets reopen, we will continue to focus on the type of values-based messaging that is resonating with consumers across geographies. This work will be underpinned by the targeted personalized marketing that we started earlier this year to drive higher quality of sales. Our brands are defined by values like optimism, quality and togetherness, which are especially relevant in the current context. We will continue to tap into these authentic values to drive momentum across digital and social channels in fiscal '21.  
Second, we continue to energize our core products and accelerate our high-potential, underdeveloped categories this year, led by outerwear and denim. Starting with Ralph's original vision, it has never been just about one category or one item, but rather it's about the lifestyle, which means we can credibly flex across our breadth of products and categories as consumer behaviors change. And with the emergence of COVID, we have seen consumers gravitate towards the simple and true luxuries in life: family, togetherness, the outdoors. Within our assortments, this has translated to stronger sales of comfort categories such as loungewear, athleisure and home.  
In addition, the competitive advantage of our well-established core is becoming even more evident. Over the course of this year, we had rebalanced our assortments towards core products, which have faster lead times and less markdown risks versus seasonal fashion items that only live for one season. As the industry grapples with excess spring inventory due to COVID, our increased penetration of core gives us more strategic flexibility to work through our inventories and drive AUR growth.
With regards to our third key initiative, targeted expansion, we continue to build out our ecosystem approach of a cohesive, brand-elevating Ralph Lauren experience across retail, wholesale and digital commerce around the world in fiscal '20. 
Prior to COVID, we opened 25 net new stores and concessions globally. This included 18 net openings in China, our fastest-growing market. While we are carefully evaluating our footprint across direct-to-consumer and wholesale channels in this rapidly evolving environment, we continue to see significant long-term opportunities for our brand in underpenetrated markets led by China and parts of Europe. 
Our fourth key initiative is lead with digital. Earlier, I talked about how we accelerated digital and omnichannel initiatives in China this quarter, which are now being implemented in other parts of the world. In addition, we continue to expand our global digital commerce presence across new platforms and partnerships, including our April launch on Instagram Checkout, our first social commerce platform in North America, and we are launching our digital commerce site soon in Japan. We're also making meaningful strides in digitizing how we work, which is an important part of our journey to drive faster lead times, minimize physical waste and reduce costs. 
In fiscal '20, we launched our digital library and 3D design studio. This represents a major milestone for our company as it will eventually enable us to digitize our entire end-to-end process from product development all the way to how we communicate with our consumers. We started this process by digitizing all of our Polo core styles, raw materials and trims onto a digital library. Starting in fiscal '21, we will create 3D prototypes for all of our core Polo products, replacing traditional physical samples. We've already created thousands of 3D prototypes in fiscal '20 and it's only the beginning, especially as our teams learn to work in new ways from home. 
And lastly, touching on our initiatives of operating with discipline to fuel growth. A key element of our long-term plan has been to balance growth with productivity, which includes driving a culture of cost discipline across our organization. This has come into even greater focus in the context of COVID as we drive deeper near-term expense reductions and align our cost structure and inventories through a shifting retail landscape. The pandemic has also highlighted the importance of continuing our journey to integrate citizenship and sustainability into our business. 
We started this fiscal year by launching our Design the Change strategy, outlining our commitments to create more sustainable products, reduce our overall environmental footprint across our operations, and support and empower our teams and partners around the world. 
Some key achievements this year included reaching our gender parity goal of equal representation in our leadership positions at the VP level and above more than 3 years ahead of our target; the launch of our Earth Polo shirt made entirely from recycled plastic bottles; a new commitment to power all of our globally-owned and operated offices, distribution centers and stores with 100% renewable electricity by 2025. And building upon that, we are now in the process of setting science-based greenhouse gas reduction targets, which we will detail in this June's annual Design the Change report. 
In addition, as suppliers around the world struggle with large-scale order cancellations in response to COVID, we reaffirmed our commitment to pay for all finished goods and goods already in production this spring. We are working with our partners to develop new sources of support and long-term job security for factory workers as we look to strengthen our supply chain partnerships not just for the upcoming season, but for years to come. 
In closing, over the course of more than 50 years, our company has endured many challenging times, and the current crisis will certainly not be the last. Our purpose of inspiring the dream of a better life through authenticity and timeless style rings as true today as it did when Ralph started this business. And it will continue to guide us in these moments as we make tough decisions in the short term to protect the integrity and health of our brands, so that we emerge from this challenging period in a position of strength. The foundational work that we have done to put the consumer at the center of everything we do, elevate our brands and balance growth and productivity, all while maintaining a strong balance sheet, has positioned us well to manage through the current environment. And we are privileged to have one of the greatest assets of all, the strength of our timeless global brand.  
With that, I'll turn it over to Jane, and I'll join her at the end to answer your questions."

This quarter's performance was a study in contrast.

This quarter's performance was a study in contrast. We started the spring season with strong continued momentum on our brand elevation journey, with AUR and margins exceeding our expectations as we delivered improved merchandising, expanded digital capabilities and elevated marketing and continued the rollout of targeted pricing increases across channels. This was followed by a very sudden decline in sales as we closed stores across Asia, followed by Europe and North America in accordance with guidelines from government and local health authorities. 
While our teams remain committed to our long-term strategy centered around brand elevation and targeted expansion, we are focused on managing through the near term so that we can emerge from this crisis stronger than we came into it and pivot quickly back to growth. 
We started by leveraging some key strengths: a healthy balance sheet, strong liquidity, focused execution, all made possible by our passionate and agile teams. Now more than ever, our strong balance sheet is a source of competitive advantage, giving us resilience and flexibility to continue executing our plan and elevate our brand during challenging times. 
We ended fiscal '20 with $2.1 billion in cash and investments and $1.2 billion in total debt, which compares to $2 billion in cash and investments and $689 million in debt at the end of last year. Given the uncertain environment created by COVID-19, we announced several measures to preserve cash and strengthen liquidity. Building on what Patrice shared, these include: First, flexing our costs where possible to align to our top line and carefully managing ongoing expenses and investments to a variable demand outlook. We are currently evaluating what the right operating cost structure and distribution footprint should be across retail and wholesale as we enter a new normal. Second, a reduction in planned capital expenditures to approximately $175 million to $200 million in fiscal '21. Third, in order to maximize our liquidity, we have temporarily suspended share buybacks. We will also temporarily suspend our dividend following the April payment that was declared in early March. This is a proactive measure to preserve cash, and our Board will revisit this quarterly as we move through the pandemic. And lastly, we drew down $475 million from our revolver in the quarter and are considering additional capital measures to bolster our cash balance. 
Net inventory at the end of fiscal '20 was down 10% to last year. The decline largely reflected a significant increase in inventory reserves of about $160 million to keep our inventories aligned with demand and continue our brand elevation as we move forward. Our teams are managing an unprecedented situation, but we are confident that we are taking the right strategic approach to work down excess spring '20 product while also positioning the company for future growth. 
Similar to our previous practices, we will also take a targeted approach to clearing excess merchandise. First, with the majority of the traditional spring '20 selling season lost to COVID closures, our merchants are taking the opportunity to better align our assortments to consumer behavior. As stores reopen, we will extend the season to focus on Wear-Now Styles from June through August in order to maximize full price selling and mitigate markdown risk. This includes shifting some of this season's product to warmer weathers markets.  
Second, we plan to reassort a portion of our finished products into upcoming seasonal collections, including full price and factory channels. A key benefit of our classic timeless aesthetic is that many of our iconic styles resonate with consumers season-after-season. This merchandise is in pristine condition in our warehouses and has not yet been seen by consumers. While requiring us to hold some inventories longer than usual, this should drive strong AURs and margins once these products are brought to market and enable us to drive our AUR growth trajectory as quickly as possible.  
Third, we will utilize the full range of our channels to clear product, including targeted markdowns where product is already on selling floors, our factory stores and off-price wholesale. We have also committed to 1.5 million units of product donations to support medical workers across our 3 regions. We anticipate this process will take longer than a broad strokes end-of-season liquidation. However, our inventory reserve process aligns our inventories to expected demand. This was evident in our reserve actions in the fourth quarter. This process allows our teams to move strategically through inventories while protecting the health of our brands. 
And lastly, as we look forward, our work to reduce lead times has been a benefit under the current circumstances, enabling our teams to cancel a substantial portion of our shipments for the fall season, about 2/3 of our seasonal buys. Our shorter lead times on core product and fast-track capability launched last holiday will enable us to get quickly back into inventories as demand returns, while limiting our exposure to additional excess inventory risk. 
Moving on to our fourth quarter performance. Fourth quarter revenues declined 15% on a reported basis and 14% in constant currency. Prior to COVID, our business was on track to deliver positive revenue and comp growth for both the quarter and the full year.  
Our digital ecosystem, including our directly-operated flagship sites, department store dot-com, digital pure players and social commerce, increased mid-single digits in the fourth quarter and high single digits for the full year in constant currency. This was driven by strong double-digit growth in Asia and Europe for both periods. Meanwhile, North America improved from flat performance in the first half to mid-single-digit growth in the second half of the year, as planned, all despite COVID-related disruptions. 
Adjusted gross margin was 59.1% in the fourth quarter compared to 60.1% last year. Continued improvement in pricing and promotions was more than offset by foreign currency headwinds and unfavorable geographic mix due to lower sales in Asia and Europe. AUR growth of 8% continued to exceed our expectations. 
SG&A declined 2% to last year on lower selling expenses and marketing and a modest amount of rent relief achieved in the quarter, primarily from Asia. Adjusted operating loss for the fourth quarter was $43 million compared to operating income of $96 million last year. 
Marketing declined 8% in constant currency as we shifted the timing of investments back into the Q3 holiday period and reduced performance marketing while stores were closed. For the full year, marketing growth of 3% continued to outpace our top line growth as we work to win over a new generation of consumers.  
Moving on to segment performance, starting with North America. Revenue decreased 11% to last year. Retail comps declined 13%, driven by a 15% decline in bricks and mortar comps and a 7% decline in our own digital comps. Brick and mortar comps were impacted by significant traffic declines as foreign tourist traffic slowed and we closed all stores in March. Prior to the outbreak, however, the full price and factory comps were trending up mid- to high single digits in January and February, driven by AUR growth and improved product assortments. 
AUR for the quarter was up low double digits across our brick and mortar fleet, driven by our continued rollout of targeted ticket price increases, reduced promotional cadence and stronger product mix. Comps in our North America directly-operated digital commerce business were down 7%. 
Traffic and conversion were negatively impacted by 2 proactive decisions on our part. First, with the onset of COVID in March, we suspended all promotional activity and performance-driven marketing to our site as our employees and consumers focused on their safety and well-being. Second, we temporarily closed our U.S. distribution center in late March for deep cleaning and new safety protocols. While our site was still technically operational, delayed order fulfillment negatively impacted our conversion rates. As we resumed our marketing activities and limited DC operations in April, we saw a meaningful improvement in both digital traffic and comps. 
In North America wholesale, fourth quarter revenue declined 12%. Prior to store closures in mid-March, our sell-out performance was improving slightly on a year-over-year basis to down mid-single digits, driven by rebalanced assortments and improved product offering. The additional declines were driven by order cancellations in the last few weeks of March as our customers closed stores due to COVID. 
Moving on to Europe. Fourth quarter revenue declined 19% on a reported basis and 16% in constant currency. Europe retail comps declined 16%, driven by an 18% decrease in our brick and mortar stores and a 2% decrease in our own digital commerce sites. 
Across our Europe direct-to-consumer channels, our ongoing effort to elevate the brand and improve product mix continued in the fourth quarter, with AUR up 10%. This is consistent with our long-term strategy to drive higher quality of sales and price harmonization in the marketplace.  
Digital commerce comps on our own site were pressured by a temporary closure of our distribution center and a pause on product-driven marketing due to COVID, similar to North America. Total digital ecosystem sales grew double digits in constant currency, driven by performance in both Wholesale Dot Com and digital pure players.
Europe wholesale revenue declined 18% in constant currency, driven by COVID-related pressures at bricks and mortar stores. These declines were partially offset by strong double-digit growth in our digital pure play and Wholesale Dot Com businesses. 
Turning to Asia. Revenue declined 22% on a reported basis and 21% in constant currency in the fourth quarter. AUR increased high single digits as our product and marketing initiatives continue to resonate well in the region. While performance varied by market, we saw the biggest percentage declines in Mainland China, the epicenter of the pandemic, where the majority of our stores were closed for about 5 weeks. Brick and mortar sales trends improved sequentially from trough levels in February turning positive in early May. Despite significant challenges from store closures across Asia, we were encouraged by continued momentum in our digital businesses in the quarter, with our digital ecosystem up high teens driven by strong momentum in China and Korea. 
Looking ahead, as we navigate the current environment, we remain, first and foremost, committed to the safety of our employees, partners and consumers. Due to the high level of uncertainty and the evolving situation surrounding COVID-19, we are suspending future guidance. We expect our financial results for the first quarter and full year fiscal '21 to be significantly negatively impacted by the pandemic.  
In the near term, we are focused on positioning the company to get back to sustainable growth and value creation as quickly as possible. This includes preserving balance sheet strength, aligning our cost base in inventories to the new normal and optimizing our distribution, all while protecting the health of our brands. 
Though the timing and path of recovery in each market presents many uncertainties, we have developed scenarios through which we plan to safely return our businesses to growth. As Patrice outlined, China was our first market to emerge from business closures, laying out a path to normalization, and we will leverage many of these key learnings as we reopen around the world.  
In closing, we are proud of the focus, agility and passion our teams have demonstrated through personally and professionally challenging times. We believe the Ralph Lauren brand has momentum, we have the right strategic priorities and the discipline to manage through this period and emerge in a position of strength. Now as ever, we are proud to have an iconic brand and to be led by Ralph's creative vision. This has endured the test of time.

With respect to our Next Great Chapter strategy, the strategic pillars of our plan completely hold true today in the current environment, but there's a clear opportunity to accelerate some of the priorities. Let me give you 3 examples. There are many more, but the 3 I would highlight are: First, continuing to accelerate digital, right? We transformed our digital selling platforms over the last 3 years, new e-commerce platform, new OMS system, mobile personalization and connected retail streams. So we have a strong infrastructure in place when it comes to digital commerce and connected retail. We're fast tracking and scaling new digital capabilities like digital clienteling and other forms of virtual selling. And we're encouraged by our progress and early reads so far, including understanding what we've done in China recently.
The second thing I'd call out is assessing our store footprint. So we still believe in the role of the store, and we're encouraged by the early connected retail interventions like curbside pickup, for example, but we're going to continue to review our store portfolio in the context of our omnichannel strategy. And especially within North America wholesale, this means continuing to concentrate on our most productive brick and mortar doors, which are generally the top doors of our wholesale partners anyhow, as we also grow select Wholesale Dot Com opportunities.  
And the third example I would call out, Dana, is around scaling new ways of working for us. And we've been able to do things in weeks and days that typically would have taken us months or years to do. This includes our ability to work remotely around the world, continuing to digitize our end-to-end value chain and also driving a culture of cost discipline, which is obviously critical in the current environment that we're in. So the strategic pillars of our strategic -- of our Next Great Chapter Plan still hold true in this environment. And we are feeling actually quite good about that. But there's a clear opportunity to accelerate some of the priorities, some of which I just called out for you. And then I think, Jane, you'll cover the Q1 question."

Dana, we're not giving guidance for Q1, but let me just give you some color and shape about how we're thinking about it. We expect right now that Q1 will be the quarter with the most significant impact from COVID as we see it now. On an order of magnitude basis considered Q1 in contrast to Q4. In Q4, we had 2 weeks of closures approximately versus about 8 to 10 weeks of closures in Q1. And even after opening stores, we've seen a gradual and elongated recovery period. As you look across every region, we expect the impact of COVID to be most pronounced in Q1. I think that's probably very clear for North America and Europe where we were closed almost the entirety of April and May with stores just starting to come back online. Today, a little less than 50% of North America stores are now open. And in Europe, which is a bit further ahead, about 2/3 of the stores are now open. But all with -- operating with reduced hours, reduced traffic and with new social distancing requirements. Compared to our experience in Mainland China and Korea, we do expect a more prolonged recovery with improvement over time. And obviously, this is going to vary by market. 
In Asia, which was ahead of the curve and where we're 90% open, we still will see the biggest impact in Q1 where markets like Japan, Southeast Asia and Australia and even parts of China, saw large COVID impacts in the first quarter. We are encouraged by the way that the digital sales are leading as infrastructure opens, and our teams are very clear that opening stores is the first step to getting back to comp growth. So we're all focused on that and prioritizing that. And just as you think about expenses in FY '21 from a cadence standpoint, from a cost perspective, as you saw in our 8-K, we took substantial actions as we closed out the fourth quarter. We furloughed about 80% of our workforce in April and this will continue through June. And as we begin to ramp back up, employees and infrastructure to support sales in late June, and we'll stage that with -- as demand stabilizes. But our largest SG&A reductions will be in Q1 and a little bit over 25%, and then it will moderate for -- the reductions will moderate there as demand stabilizes. So a little bit of color on the quarter and our expectations in what we're seeing in the market for the year."

So this will likely mean that as we work through the year with our partners, we will be calling some of the smaller doors working with them. Importantly, for all of you on the call, the recent bankruptcies from JCPenney's and Neiman Marcus actually don't impact us. Our business is nonexistent at JCPenney's and relatively small at Neiman Marcus. But I'd say, Heather, our emphasis is really, when it comes to the wholesale space, JCPenney's and Neiman Marcus wholesale.com, Wholesale Dot Com, which has got a nice momentum over building capabilities with our partners and then making sure that we have the right footprint going forward in that space."

As far as e-commerce is concerned, we -- let me start east first. I guess, we're feeling very good about the performance in China. I think you heard us say February, March up 76% while the overall sector was down, so we were gaining share in that environment. We can give you some color on the specific weeks for March and April, which Jane will give you. But I think overall, with all the new capabilities that we've put in place, whether that's digital clienteling, whether that's all the connected retail capabilities, we are encouraged by the progress we're making on dot-com.

Matt, let me give you some color on what we've seen on a quarter-to-date basis across the regions. APAC, as we said, we closed out Q4 very strong across Asia on our e-commerce business and that has only built. So April and into May, we've seen very strong and positive e-commerce trends closing out in the -- sometimes, we've seen rates of triple-digit growth in APAC, so very strong. In Europe, while we did see some -- we reported down 3% on our own platform in Q4 as we've come out and especially as we closed out April, and I think people saw the end of the crisis, we've been seeing very strong trends across Europe. So we've had double -- solid double-digit growth in Europe on a very high quality of sales number where we're seeing double-digit growth in AUR on our e-commerce site in Europe. So strong quality of sales and strong momentum. 
North America, which is probably the furthest behind in regions in terms of store openings and recovery, we reported down 7% in the fourth quarter. And it's really been in May that we've started to see e-commerce back to solid and double-digit growth, but it's been building on a week-over-week basis, so encouraging there. So we do see, as our stores open, digital leads and it starts to build over time. 
As we've gotten -- we're sort of in the early days, if you will, in terms of store opening productivity, 50% open in North America and really very early on that journey, 2/3 open in Europe. Still early days on that journey, which makes our experience anecdotal. I can tell you, in China, as stores reopened, traffic remained weak in the initial weeks but with strong conversion. So buyers who are coming to the store were motivated and ADTs, average daily transactions, average value transactions were up strongly. Conversion was up strongly and AUR has continued to be up strongly. I can give you some -- we're not -- it's early days, but I can tell you, as we think about our trajectory in -- overall in Asia, that it will be different in North America. But coming out of January, we saw -- if I think about the Asia, we were up strongly in January, up 40%. February saw the biggest declines, down well over 80%. March, we started to recover, digital sales started to come back. In April, sales were down high single digits. And so far in May, we're really encouraged by the improvements. Everything was turning positive in early May as Beijing and other larger cities restrictions lifted, and we expect to be strongly back to growth in Q2 of this year in Mainland China. So encouraged by that trajectory, don't expect to be a cookie-cutter approach across the regions, but that's what we've seen so far."

And then separately, on the AUR, I guess, a longer-term question, because this has been the real engine behind your revenue and gross profit dollar growth for several years. You've mentioned it a lot of times today. Now the apparel world is about to go on a huge sale, given what we've heard around the space. I have no doubt you'll tell me the AUR story continues to be critical to long term. But maybe you could just help us think about what adjustments you need to think about in the near term given the state of inventory in the channel, the level of markdowns that seem like they're coming across the space, the store closures we know about in the brick and mortar world, et cetera?"

Let me step back and tell you why we decided to report both our NRV reserve and our bad debt as a non-GAAP item. We believe that it is entirely related to the experience of COVID, where we lost a selling season. So it's not a business as usual NRV reserve. It was significant. The process that we went through as a team was we took stock of all of our inventory flows, our commitments at suppliers on a fabric basis, and then went back to our strategy and said, what can we reasonably move through to continue our quality of sales journey with our own liquidation channels, with stretching the seasons while moving into warmer-weather channels and reassorting the line in coming seasons? And then what do we remain with? And how do we reserve appropriately to protect the AUR and gross margin progress that we've done to date. So we really looked at it, a complete life cycle view. That's not a different process. We've been doing that process for well over 2 years. The magnitude and the onetime impact was greater. So we -- that's why we reflected it. 
If our NRV reserve is too small or too great, we will take that on what we reserved, we will take that also on a non-GAAP basis below the line so that you and our investors can track our true progress on gross margin as we move through this COVID environment. So that's our rationale. We'll take -- if there is better selling, then you'll see an adjustment on a non-GAAP item in NRV. 
As a good vendor, I want to remind you that we know that we have made a commitment to pay for products that were perhaps cut but we did not have the ownership of in Q1. There will be some reflection of that in Q1. The magnitude we'll disclose in Q1. 
As I look at overall the -- your question on the AUR story, you're exactly right. You know me well. We are continuing this AUR journey. And that is -- and that was really behind some of the actions you saw us take in the fourth quarter. We're committed to it. And so we took an inventory reserve that protects that. I think the good news is that the long-term drivers of AUR growth are still intact. We're elevating our product, we're elevating our marketing, and we're elevating our shopping experience. We have shown that we can take strategic price increases and have a positive consumer reaction. That -- Q3, we posted 8% AUR. Q4, we were able to maintain 8% AUR. I'm not guiding, but I expect that our AUR journey that's consistent with our long-term guidance in FY '21, low single-digit to mid-single-digit, will continue through this year. Will it be more variable? Perhaps, but we have a clear idea of what we need to do to move through our inventory positions. Part of that will be that we are keeping inventory in our warehouses to reassort it into the line that our designers are working on right now, so that we have a cohesive line in spring and get full price sell-through on some of that product. And we're really having success in targeting promotion. Targeting promotions more effectively and more efficiently. We've been able to reduce promotion days and this personalization is proving highly effective as a lever to drive AUR. 
North America in the fourth quarter had AURs up 10%. So really significant and positive growth there. So we have every intent to continue that journey. So we are excited about that. Know that there's some variability, but we feel our actions in the fourth quarter and our plans for this year are completely consistent with our continued AUR journey."

We've done a lot of work to increase the responsiveness of our supply chain. We have the digitization that I referred to earlier, has obviously been a key enabler to that. The other thing that I think really separates us from many of our peers is core is such an important part of our business, right? And we are known for number of core iconic SKUs. Now the good news is the core SKUs are the easier and faster SKUs to chase into, right? And we've also platformed fabrics. The team has done a wonderful job platforming the fabrics and various trims and others. So we have the ability on core to go fast. And then finally -- and I don't know if you remember when I referred to this, I think it was like 2 or 3 quarters ago, we've developed a fast -- what we've called the fast-track capability internally. I think I gave you the example of the sweatshirt that we had developed with one of our wholesale partners from idea to shipment 16 days, right, coming from Asia. And I think at Ralph Lauren, sometimes we're known for more longer lead times than days. Sometimes we've been talked about months rather than days. This capability we've scaled up since we developed it. So this fast-track capability is -- will be a fantastic platform for us to react to what we see in the market as we work with our wholesale partners. 
All right. Well listen, thanks to all of you for joining our call today. On behalf of all of us here at Ralph Lauren, we wish you and your families the best of health and safety. Take good care, and we'll talk to you in a few months. Have a great day. Thank you."

The spread of COVID-19 around the world has been devastating, and our thoughts are with the many impacted by the virus. The pandemic has not only affected our organization and recent financial performance, but it has had unprecedented consequences on the communities we operate in around the world. 
Under these extraordinary circumstances, our teams have responded to the call with agility and resilience working tirelessly from their living rooms and kitchen tables across time zones. Ralph and I want to recognize and thank them for their dedication and commitment. Our objective is to emerge from this period stronger than we came into it. And before we review our recent financial performance, I want to spend some time on the actions we are taking to ensure we not only endure through this crisis, but are positioned to thrive long term.  
From the start of the outbreak, we moved quickly to protect the safety and well-being of our employees, consumers and communities. This included widespread store and office closures, led by Asia in late January, followed by Europe and North America in March. Like many of you, we are working in new ways across the company, including working from home, and we've implemented new health and safety measures where that is not possible.  
We also took proactive steps to ensure the long-term financial health of our business, including expense reductions, further strengthening our balance sheet and liquidity and pivoting our supply chain to adjust inventories to changing demand. Meanwhile, we accelerated efforts to drive sales to our digital ecosystem as consumers stayed home. 
On the expense side, we've been addressing our most significant fixed cost around the world. This includes ongoing work with our landlords to negotiate rent relief and pausing all new store build-outs. We reduced corporate expenses, including a freeze on all global travel and hiring during the crisis. And in April, we announced pay cuts for our executives, Board and me, along with furloughing or flexing down a significant number of our employees across the company. Ralph is foregoing his bonus for fiscal '20 and his entire salary for fiscal '21. 
We have also focused on delivering on our purpose in the communities in which we operate. For example, in March, we donated $10 million toward emergency COVID relief through our Ralph Lauren Corporate Foundation. These funds will support the COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund, our long-standing partners in Cancer Care, our Employee Relief Fund to support Ralph Lauren employees in need and the CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund for COVID-19 relief. We also mobilized our teams and supply chain to deliver 250,000 masks and 50,000 isolation gowns to support medical staff. And we are providing 1.5 million units of comfort apparel, hundreds of meals and even Ralph's Coffee for frontline workers across many of our key markets. 
Next, I want to share some perspective on our experience managing through COVID in Mainland China over the past few months. As we prepare to reopen markets around the world, we're applying learnings and strategies from China where the recent recovery gives us confidence that we are making the right decisions now to position our company for long-term sustainable growth and value creation. We started the quarter with strong, continued momentum in Mainland China, our fastest growing market, with sales up more than 35% in January, driven by all of our direct-to-consumer channels. By early February, we closed nearly all of our stores in the market due to COVID. We took early strategic actions across marketing and distribution in China, which we have applied in our other markets as the pandemic continued to spread. 
First, we quickly shifted our marketing to focus on optimistic messages around family, togetherness and giving, values that have always been an authentic part of who we are. We partnered with celebrities like JJ Lin, Jim and Wang Leehom to amplify our messaging. This content resonated well with our consumers across Asia, driving over 124 million video views and a 33% increase in positive brand mentions on social media in Q4 versus Q3. 
Second, we accelerated our digital and omnichannel capabilities in China in the fourth quarter to better serve our consumers during the store closures and beyond. We were excited to launch digital clienteling, with virtual appointments and customized filing recommendations based on shopper's previous purchases. This program helped to mitigate traffic declines and leverage store inventories while consumers stayed home. We expanded our Buy Online Ship From Store program to provide greater convenience and limit face-to-face interactions as stores reopen. These initiatives, combined with our digital marketing, drove a 76% increase in China digital sales in the fourth quarter, significantly outperforming the broader apparel industry in February and March. These programs are being tested and rolled out in North America and Europe. And over the coming weeks, we're exploring other contactless options like curbside pickup and self-checkout in many locations.  
As our China stores reopened in early March, we implemented new safety measures across our stores, offices and distribution centers to protect both our employees and consumers. Store measures include frequent deep cleanings, providing masks for employees and strongly encouraging them for shoppers, and limiting capacity inside our stores to ensure social distancing. 
While our digital business led the recovery in Mainland China with a return to pre-COVID growth rates in March, we were encouraged by the recovery in our brick and mortar stores resulting from these omnichannel and in-store programs. We saw steady improvement in Mainland sales from high double-digit declines in February at the peak of our closures, ramping back to positive growth in early May. We expect Mainland China to return to pre-COVID growth trends by Q2. 
Although we expect the shape and timing of recovery curves to look different in each market, our experience and lessons from China are informing our actions across the rest of Asia, Europe and North America. Despite challenging conditions around the world, I strongly believe this crisis is creating opportunities for our business to emerge leaner, more agile and ultimately take market share. All of this is enabled by the strength of our balance sheet and our brands, coupled with the ingenuity and commitment of our diverse global teams. 
Turning now to fourth quarter and fiscal '20 results. While COVID-19 was clearly the biggest headwind we faced this year, we were encouraged by our underlying progress on our Next Great Chapter Plan prior to the pandemic with our business on track to exceed top and bottom line targets. Our brand elevation work, inclusive of product, marketing and distribution, came together to deliver positive AUR growth across all 3 regions for both the quarter and the year. So while the future remains relatively uncertain, we are confident that the key strategic pillars of our Next Great Chapter Plan still hold true. Let me touch briefly on a few of these areas. 
First, in our efforts to win over a new generation, we have created unique and lasting connections with consumers over the first 2 years of our plan. And we believe that now more than ever, is the time to build on this momentum and solidify our iconic brand leadership. Globally, Ralph Lauren brand consideration accelerated through the fourth quarter and into April, outperforming our benchmark peers in each region. Our total social media followers surpassed 43 million in the fourth quarter, a double-digit increase to last year.  
This was led by very strong increases on TikTok, one of the fastest-growing social media platforms for Gen Z. While we only launched TikTok last summer, we are encouraged that we've already established ourselves as 1 of the top 3 luxury brands on the platform. Going forward, as markets reopen, we will continue to focus on the type of values-based messaging that is resonating with consumers across geographies. This work will be underpinned by the targeted personalized marketing that we started earlier this year to drive higher quality of sales. Our brands are defined by values like optimism, quality and togetherness, which are especially relevant in the current context. We will continue to tap into these authentic values to drive momentum across digital and social channels in fiscal '21.  
Second, we continue to energize our core products and accelerate our high-potential, underdeveloped categories this year, led by outerwear and denim. Starting with Ralph's original vision, it has never been just about one category or one item, but rather it's about the lifestyle, which means we can credibly flex across our breadth of products and categories as consumer behaviors change. And with the emergence of COVID, we have seen consumers gravitate towards the simple and true luxuries in life: family, togetherness, the outdoors. Within our assortments, this has translated to stronger sales of comfort categories such as loungewear, athleisure and home.  
In addition, the competitive advantage of our well-established core is becoming even more evident. Over the course of this year, we had rebalanced our assortments towards core products, which have faster lead times and less markdown risks versus seasonal fashion items that only live for one season. As the industry grapples with excess spring inventory due to COVID, our increased penetration of core gives us more strategic flexibility to work through our inventories and drive AUR growth.
With regards to our third key initiative, targeted expansion, we continue to build out our ecosystem approach of a cohesive, brand-elevating Ralph Lauren experience across retail, wholesale and digital commerce around the world in fiscal '20. 
Prior to COVID, we opened 25 net new stores and concessions globally. This included 18 net openings in China, our fastest-growing market. While we are carefully evaluating our footprint across direct-to-consumer and wholesale channels in this rapidly evolving environment, we continue to see significant long-term opportunities for our brand in underpenetrated markets led by China and parts of Europe. 
Our fourth key initiative is lead with digital. Earlier, I talked about how we accelerated digital and omnichannel initiatives in China this quarter, which are now being implemented in other parts of the world. In addition, we continue to expand our global digital commerce presence across new platforms and partnerships, including our April launch on Instagram Checkout, our first social commerce platform in North America, and we are launching our digital commerce site soon in Japan. We're also making meaningful strides in digitizing how we work, which is an important part of our journey to drive faster lead times, minimize physical waste and reduce costs. 
In fiscal '20, we launched our digital library and 3D design studio. This represents a major milestone for our company as it will eventually enable us to digitize our entire end-to-end process from product development all the way to how we communicate with our consumers. We started this process by digitizing all of our Polo core styles, raw materials and trims onto a digital library. Starting in fiscal '21, we will create 3D prototypes for all of our core Polo products, replacing traditional physical samples. We've already created thousands of 3D prototypes in fiscal '20 and it's only the beginning, especially as our teams learn to work in new ways from home. 
And lastly, touching on our initiatives of operating with discipline to fuel growth. A key element of our long-term plan has been to balance growth with productivity, which includes driving a culture of cost discipline across our organization. This has come into even greater focus in the context of COVID as we drive deeper near-term expense reductions and align our cost structure and inventories through a shifting retail landscape. The pandemic has also highlighted the importance of continuing our journey to integrate citizenship and sustainability into our business. 
We started this fiscal year by launching our Design the Change strategy, outlining our commitments to create more sustainable products, reduce our overall environmental footprint across our operations, and support and empower our teams and partners around the world. 
Some key achievements this year included reaching our gender parity goal of equal representation in our leadership positions at the VP level and above more than 3 years ahead of our target; the launch of our Earth Polo shirt made entirely from recycled plastic bottles; a new commitment to power all of our globally-owned and operated offices, distribution centers and stores with 100% renewable electricity by 2025. And building upon that, we are now in the process of setting science-based greenhouse gas reduction targets, which we will detail in this June's annual Design the Change report. 
In addition, as suppliers around the world struggle with large-scale order cancellations in response to COVID, we reaffirmed our commitment to pay for all finished goods and goods already in production this spring. We are working with our partners to develop new sources of support and long-term job security for factory workers as we look to strengthen our supply chain partnerships not just for the upcoming season, but for years to come. 
In closing, over the course of more than 50 years, our company has endured many challenging times, and the current crisis will certainly not be the last. Our purpose of inspiring the dream of a better life through authenticity and timeless style rings as true today as it did when Ralph started this business. And it will continue to guide us in these moments as we make tough decisions in the short term to protect the integrity and health of our brands, so that we emerge from this challenging period in a position of strength. The foundational work that we have done to put the consumer at the center of everything we do, elevate our brands and balance growth and productivity, all while maintaining a strong balance sheet, has positioned us well to manage through the current environment. And we are privileged to have one of the greatest assets of all, the strength of our timeless global brand.  
With that, I'll turn it over to Jane, and I'll join her at the end to answer your questions."

This quarter's performance was a study in contrast. We started the spring season with strong continued momentum on our brand elevation journey, with AUR and margins exceeding our expectations as we delivered",1944,"Thank you, Patrice, and good morning, everyone. This quarter's performance was a study in contrast. We started the spring season with strong continued momentum on our brand elevation journey, with AUR and margins exceeding our expectations as we delivered improved merchandising, expanded digital capabilities and elevated marketing and continued the rollout of targeted pricing increases across channels. This was followed by a very sudden decline in sales as we closed stores across Asia, followed by Europe and North America in accordance with guidelines from government and local health authorities. 
While our teams remain committed to our long-term strategy centered around brand elevation and targeted expansion, we are focused on managing through the near term so that we can emerge from this crisis stronger than we came into it and pivot quickly back to growth. 
We started by leveraging some key strengths: a healthy balance sheet, strong liquidity, focused execution, all made possible by our passionate and agile teams. Now more than ever, our strong balance sheet is a source of competitive advantage, giving us resilience and flexibility to continue executing our plan and elevate our brand during challenging times. 
We ended fiscal '20 with $2.1 billion in cash and investments and $1.2 billion in total debt, which compares to $2 billion in cash and investments and $689 million in debt at the end of last year. Given the uncertain environment created by COVID-19, we announced several measures to preserve cash and strengthen liquidity. Building on what Patrice shared, these include: First, flexing our costs where possible to align to our top line and carefully managing ongoing expenses and investments to a variable demand outlook. We are currently evaluating what the right operating cost structure and distribution footprint should be across retail and wholesale as we enter a new normal. Second, a reduction in planned capital expenditures to approximately $175 million to $200 million in fiscal '21. Third, in order to maximize our liquidity, we have temporarily suspended share buybacks. We will also temporarily suspend our dividend following the April payment that was declared in early March. This is a proactive measure to preserve cash, and our Board will revisit this quarterly as we move through the pandemic. And lastly, we drew down $475 million from our revolver in the quarter and are considering additional capital measures to bolster our cash balance. 
Net inventory at the end of fiscal '20 was down 10% to last year. The decline largely reflected a significant increase in inventory reserves of about $160 million to keep our inventories aligned with demand and continue our brand elevation as we move forward. Our teams are managing an unprecedented situation, but we are confident that we are taking the right strategic approach to work down excess spring '20 product while also positioning the company for future growth. 
Similar to our previous practices, we will also take a targeted approach to clearing excess merchandise. First, with the majority of the traditional spring '20 selling season lost to COVID closures, our merchants are taking the opportunity to better align our assortments to consumer behavior. As stores reopen, we will extend the season to focus on Wear-Now Styles from June through August in order to maximize full price selling and mitigate markdown risk. This includes shifting some of this season's product to warmer weathers markets.  
Second, we plan to reassort a portion of our finished products into upcoming seasonal collections, including full price and factory channels. A key benefit of our classic timeless aesthetic is that many of our iconic styles resonate with consumers season-after-season. This merchandise is in pristine condition in our warehouses and has not yet been seen by consumers. While requiring us to hold some inventories longer than usual, this should drive strong AURs and margins once these products are brought to market and enable us to drive our AUR growth trajectory as quickly as possible.  
Third, we will utilize the full range of our channels to clear product, including targeted markdowns where product is already on selling floors, our factory stores and off-price wholesale. We have also committed to 1.5 million units of product donations to support medical workers across our 3 regions. We anticipate this process will take longer than a broad strokes end-of-season liquidation. However, our inventory reserve process aligns our inventories to expected demand. This was evident in our reserve actions in the fourth quarter. This process allows our teams to move strategically through inventories while protecting the health of our brands. 
And lastly, as we look forward, our work to reduce lead times has been a benefit under the current circumstances, enabling our teams to cancel a substantial portion of our shipments for the fall season, about 2/3 of our seasonal buys. Our shorter lead times on core product and fast-track capability launched last holiday will enable us to get quickly back into inventories as demand returns, while limiting our exposure to additional excess inventory risk. 
Moving on to our fourth quarter performance. Fourth quarter revenues declined 15% on a reported basis and 14% in constant currency. Prior to COVID, our business was on track to deliver positive revenue and comp growth for both the quarter and the full year.  
Our digital ecosystem, including our directly-operated flagship sites, department store dot-com, digital pure players and social commerce, increased mid-single digits in the fourth quarter and high single digits for the full year in constant currency. This was driven by strong double-digit growth in Asia and Europe for both periods. Meanwhile, North America improved from flat performance in the first half to mid-single-digit growth in the second half of the year, as planned, all despite COVID-related disruptions. 
Adjusted gross margin was 59.1% in the fourth quarter compared to 60.1% last year. Continued improvement in pricing and promotions was more than offset by foreign currency headwinds and unfavorable geographic mix due to lower sales in Asia and Europe. AUR growth of 8% continued to exceed our expectations. 
SG&A declined 2% to last year on lower selling expenses and marketing and a modest amount of rent relief achieved in the quarter, primarily from Asia. Adjusted operating loss for the fourth quarter was $43 million compared to operating income of $96 million last year. 
Marketing declined 8% in constant currency as we shifted the timing of investments back into the Q3 holiday period and reduced performance marketing while stores were closed. For the full year, marketing growth of 3% continued to outpace our top line growth as we work to win over a new generation of consumers.  
Moving on to segment performance, starting with North America. Revenue decreased 11% to last year. Retail comps declined 13%, driven by a 15% decline in bricks and mortar comps and a 7% decline in our own digital comps. Brick and mortar comps were impacted by significant traffic declines as foreign tourist traffic slowed and we closed all stores in March. Prior to the outbreak, however, the full price and factory comps were trending up mid- to high single digits in January and February, driven by AUR growth and improved product assortments. 
AUR for the quarter was up low double digits across our brick and mortar fleet, driven by our continued rollout of targeted ticket price increases, reduced promotional cadence and stronger product mix. Comps in our North America directly-operated digital commerce business were down 7%. 
Traffic and conversion were negatively impacted by 2 proactive decisions on our part. First, with the onset of COVID in March, we suspended all promotional activity and performance-driven marketing to our site as our employees and consumers focused on their safety and well-being. Second, we temporarily closed our U.S. distribution center in late March for deep cleaning and new safety protocols. While our site was still technically operational, delayed order fulfillment negatively impacted our conversion rates. As we resumed our marketing activities and limited DC operations in April, we saw a meaningful improvement in both digital traffic and comps. 
In North America wholesale, fourth quarter revenue declined 12%. Prior to store closures in mid-March, our sell-out performance was improving slightly on a year-over-year basis to down mid-single digits, driven by rebalanced assortments and improved product offering. The additional declines were driven by order cancellations in the last few weeks of March as our customers closed stores due to COVID. 
Moving on to Europe. Fourth quarter revenue declined 19% on a reported basis and 16% in constant currency. Europe retail comps declined 16%, driven by an 18% decrease in our brick and mortar stores and a 2% decrease in our own digital commerce sites. 
Across our Europe direct-to-consumer channels, our ongoing effort to elevate the brand and improve product mix continued in the fourth quarter, with AUR up 10%. This is consistent with our long-term strategy to drive higher quality of sales and price harmonization in the marketplace.  
Digital commerce comps on our own site were pressured by a temporary closure of our distribution center and a pause on product-driven marketing due to COVID, similar to North America. Total digital ecosystem sales grew double digits in constant currency, driven by performance in both Wholesale Dot Com and digital pure players.
Europe wholesale revenue declined 18% in constant currency, driven by COVID-related pressures at bricks and mortar stores. These declines were partially offset by strong double-digit growth in our digital pure play and Wholesale Dot Com businesses. 
Turning to Asia. Revenue declined 22% on a reported basis and 21% in constant currency in the fourth quarter. AUR increased high single digits as our product and marketing initiatives continue to resonate well in the region. While performance varied by market, we saw the biggest percentage declines in Mainland China, the epicenter of the pandemic, where the majority of our stores were closed for about 5 weeks. Brick and mortar sales trends improved sequentially from trough levels in February turning positive in early May. Despite significant challenges from store closures across Asia, we were encouraged by continued momentum in our digital businesses in the quarter, with our digital ecosystem up high teens driven by strong momentum in China and Korea. 
Looking ahead, as we navigate the current environment, we remain, first and foremost, committed to the safety of our employees, partners and consumers. Due to the high level of uncertainty and the evolving situation surrounding COVID-19, we are suspending future guidance. We expect our financial results for the first quarter and full year fiscal '21 to be significantly negatively impacted by the pandemic.  
In the near term, we are focused on positioning the company to get back to sustainable growth and value creation as quickly as possible. This includes preserving balance sheet strength, aligning our cost base in inventories to the new normal and optimizing our distribution, all while protecting the health of our brands. 
Though the timing and path of recovery in each market presents many uncertainties, we have developed scenarios through which we plan to safely return our businesses to growth. As Patrice outlined, China was our first market to emerge from business closures, laying out a path to normalization, and we will leverage many of these key learnings as we reopen around the world.  
In closing, we are proud of the focus, agility and passion our teams have demonstrated through personally and professionally challenging times. We believe the Ralph Lauren brand has momentum, we have the right strategic priorities and the discipline to manage through this period and emerge in a position of strength. Now as ever, we are proud to have an iconic brand and to be led by Ralph's creative vision. This has endured the test of time.

So we have a strong infrastructure in place when it comes to digital commerce and connected retail. We're fast tracking and scaling new digital capabilities like digital clienteling and other forms of virtual selling. And we're encouraged by our progress and early reads so far, including understanding what we've done in China recently.
The second thing I'd call out is assessing our store footprint. So we still believe in the role of the store, and we're encouraged by the early connected retail interventions like curbside pickup, for example, but we're going to continue to review our store portfolio in the context of our omnichannel strategy. And especially within North America wholesale, this means continuing to concentrate on our most productive brick and mortar doors, which are generally the top doors of our wholesale partners anyhow, as we also grow select Wholesale Dot Com opportunities.  
And the third example I would call out, Dana, is around scaling new ways of working for us. And we've been able to do things in weeks and days that typically would have taken us months or years to do. This includes our ability to work remotely around the world, continuing to digitize our end-to-end value chain and also driving a culture of cost discipline, which is obviously critical in the current environment that we're in. So the strategic pillars of our strategic -- of our Next Great Chapter Plan still hold true in this environment. And we are feeling actually quite good about that. But there's a clear opportunity to accelerate some of the priorities, some of which I just called out for you. And then I think, Jane, you'll cover the Q1 question."

Dana, we're not giving guidance for Q1, but let me just give you some color and shape about how we're thinking about it. We expect right now that Q1 will be the quarter with the most significant impact from COVID as we see it now. On an order of magnitude basis considered Q1 in contrast to Q4. In Q4, we had 2 weeks of closures approximately versus about 8 to 10 weeks of closures in Q1. And even after opening stores, we've seen a gradual and elongated recovery period. As you look across every region, we expect the impact of COVID to be most pronounced in Q1. I think that's probably very clear for North America and Europe where we were closed almost the entirety of April and May with stores just starting to come back online. Today, a little less than 50% of North America stores are now open. And in Europe, which is a bit further ahead, about 2/3 of the stores are now open. But all with -- operating with reduced hours, reduced traffic and with new social distancing requirements. Compared to our experience in Mainland China and Korea, we do expect a more prolonged recovery with improvement over time. And obviously, this is going to vary by market. 
In Asia, which was ahead of the curve and where we're 90% open, we still will see the biggest impact in Q1 where markets like Japan, Southeast Asia and Australia and even parts of China, saw large COVID impacts in the first quarter. We are encouraged by the way that the digital sales are leading as infrastructure opens, and our teams are very clear that opening stores is the first step to getting back to comp growth. So we're all focused on that and prioritizing that. And just as you think about expenses in FY '21 from a cadence standpoint, from a cost perspective, as you saw in our 8-K, we took substantial actions as we closed out the fourth quarter. We furloughed about 80% of our workforce in April and this will continue through June. And as we begin to ramp back up, employees and infrastructure to support sales in late June, and we'll stage that with -- as demand stabilizes. But our largest SG&A reductions will be in Q1 and a little bit over 25%, and then it will moderate for -- the reductions will moderate there as demand stabilizes. So a little bit of color on the quarter and our expectations in what we're seeing in the market for the year."

Importantly, for all of you on the call, the recent bankruptcies from JCPenney's and Neiman Marcus actually don't impact us. Our business is nonexistent at JCPenney's and relatively small at Neiman Marcus. But I'd say, Heather, our emphasis is really, when it comes to the wholesale space, JCPenney's and Neiman Marcus wholesale.com, Wholesale Dot Com, which has got a nice momentum over building capabilities with our partners and then making sure that we have the right footprint going forward in that space."

As far as e-commerce is concerned, we -- let me start east first. I guess, we're feeling very good about the performance in China. I think you heard us say February, March up 76% while the overall sector was down, so we were gaining share in that environment. We can give you some color on the specific weeks for March and April, which Jane will give you.

Matt, let me give you some color on what we've seen on a quarter-to-date basis across the regions. APAC, as we said, we closed out Q4 very strong across Asia on our e-commerce business and that has only built. So April and into May, we've seen very strong and positive e-commerce trends closing out in the -- sometimes, we've seen rates of triple-digit growth in APAC, so very strong. In Europe, while we did see some -- we reported down 3% on our own platform in Q4 as we've come out and especially as we closed out April, and I think people saw the end of the crisis, we've been seeing very strong trends across Europe. So we've had double -- solid double-digit growth in Europe on a very high quality of sales number where we're seeing double-digit growth in AUR on our e-commerce site in Europe. So strong quality of sales and strong momentum. 
North America, which is probably the furthest behind in regions in terms of store openings and recovery, we reported down 7% in the fourth quarter. And it's really been in May that we've started to see e-commerce back to solid and double-digit growth, but it's been building on a week-over-week basis, so encouraging there. So we do see, as our stores open, digital leads and it starts to build over time. 
As we've gotten -- we're sort of in the early days, if you will, in terms of store opening productivity, 50% open in North America and really very early on that journey, 2/3 open in Europe. Still early days on that journey, which makes our experience anecdotal. I can tell you, in China, as stores reopened, traffic remained weak in the initial weeks but with strong conversion. So buyers who are coming to the store were motivated and ADTs, average daily transactions, average value transactions were up strongly. Conversion was up strongly and AUR has continued to be up strongly. I can give you some -- we're not -- it's early days, but I can tell you, as we think about our trajectory in -- overall in Asia, that it will be different in North America. But coming out of January, we saw -- if I think about the Asia, we were up strongly in January, up 40%. February saw the biggest declines, down well over 80%. March, we started to recover, digital sales started to come back. In April, sales were down high single digits. And so far in May, we're really encouraged by the improvements. Everything was turning positive in early May as Beijing and other larger cities restrictions lifted, and we expect to be strongly back to growth in Q2 of this year in Mainland China. So encouraged by that trajectory, don't expect to be a cookie-cutter approach across the regions, but that's what we've seen so far."

You've mentioned it a lot of times today. Now the apparel world is about to go on a huge sale, given what we've heard around the space. I have no doubt you'll tell me the AUR story continues to be critical to long term.

Let me step back and tell you why we decided to report both our NRV reserve and our bad debt as a non-GAAP item. We believe that it is entirely related to the experience of COVID, where we lost a selling season. So it's not a business as usual NRV reserve. It was significant. The process that we went through as a team was we took stock of all of our inventory flows, our commitments at suppliers on a fabric basis, and then went back to our strategy and said, what can we reasonably move through to continue our quality of sales journey with our own liquidation channels, with stretching the seasons while moving into warmer-weather channels and reassorting the line in coming seasons? And then what do we remain with? And how do we reserve appropriately to protect the AUR and gross margin progress that we've done to date. So we really looked at it, a complete life cycle view. That's not a different process. We've been doing that process for well over 2 years. The magnitude and the onetime impact was greater. So we -- that's why we reflected it. 
If our NRV reserve is too small or too great, we will take that on what we reserved, we will take that also on a non-GAAP basis below the line so that you and our investors can track our true progress on gross margin as we move through this COVID environment. So that's our rationale. We'll take -- if there is better selling, then you'll see an adjustment on a non-GAAP item in NRV. 
As a good vendor, I want to remind you that we know that we have made a commitment to pay for products that were perhaps cut but we did not have the ownership of in Q1. There will be some reflection of that in Q1. The magnitude we'll disclose in Q1. 
As I look at overall the -- your question on the AUR story, you're exactly right. You know me well. We are continuing this AUR journey. And that is -- and that was really behind some of the actions you saw us take in the fourth quarter. We're committed to it. And so we took an inventory reserve that protects that. I think the good news is that the long-term drivers of AUR growth are still intact. We're elevating our product, we're elevating our marketing, and we're elevating our shopping experience. We have shown that we can take strategic price increases and have a positive consumer reaction. That -- Q3, we posted 8% AUR. Q4, we were able to maintain 8% AUR. I'm not guiding, but I expect that our AUR journey that's consistent with our long-term guidance in FY '21, low single-digit to mid-single-digit, will continue through this year. Will it be more variable? Perhaps, but we have a clear idea of what we need to do to move through our inventory positions. Part of that will be that we are keeping inventory in our warehouses to reassort it into the line that our designers are working on right now, so that we have a cohesive line in spring and get full price sell-through on some of that product. And we're really having success in targeting promotion. Targeting promotions more effectively and more efficiently. We've been able to reduce promotion days and this personalization is proving highly effective as a lever to drive AUR. 
North America in the fourth quarter had AURs up 10%. So really significant and positive growth there. So we have every intent to continue that journey. So we are excited about that. Know that there's some variability, but we feel our actions in the fourth quarter and our plans for this year are completely consistent with our continued AUR journey."

We've done a lot of work to increase the responsiveness of our supply chain. We have the digitization that I referred to earlier, has obviously been a key enabler to that. The other thing that I think really separates us from many of our peers is core is such an important part of our business, right? And we are known for number of core iconic SKUs. Now the good news is the core SKUs are the easier and faster SKUs to chase into, right? And we've also platformed fabrics. The team has done a wonderful job platforming the fabrics and various trims and others. So we have the ability on core to go fast. And then finally -- and I don't know if you remember when I referred to this, I think it was like 2 or 3 quarters ago, we've developed a fast -- what we've called the fast-track capability internally. I think I gave you the example of the sweatshirt that we had developed with one of our wholesale partners from idea to shipment 16 days, right, coming from Asia. And I think at Ralph Lauren, sometimes we're known for more longer lead times than days. Sometimes we've been talked about months rather than days. This capability we've scaled up since we developed it. So this fast-track capability is -- will be a fantastic platform for us to react to what we see in the market as we work with our wholesale partners. 
All right. Well listen, thanks to all of you for joining our call today. On behalf of all of us here at Ralph Lauren, we wish you and your families the best of health and safety. Take good care, and we'll talk to you in a few months. Have a great day. Thank you."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. The past few months have marked a period of extraordinary challenge, but also resilience, agility and hope.

The past few months have marked a period of extraordinary challenge, but also resilience, agility and hope. Our financial performance this quarter reflects an unprecedented 3 months of COVID-19-related impact around the world. We're taking the opportunity to leverage this period of disruption to accelerate our core strategic focus areas, drive new areas of growth and realign our resources accordingly. 
Building on the strong foundational work our teams had done prior to COVID, over the past 3 months, they have executed with incredible agility and speed to strengthen our connected retail capabilities, further rationalize our North America brick-and-mortar wholesale presence and continue to build our brand through personalized consumer engagement and more values-based messaging, all while pursuing our brand elevation journey, as evidenced by our strong AUR and gross margin progress. 
Since Ralph started our company more than 50 years ago, his focus on the long term, on the spirit of timelessness, has enabled us to not only survive times of uncertainty but drive lasting, authentic connections with our consumers. To that end, we have a responsibility that goes well beyond the products we sell. 
And I first want to take a moment to address the persistent systemic racial injustice in the U.S. and around the world. We've been listening to our teams and a few of the many actions we've taken over the past couple of months include: One, we committed to elevate more black and African-American talent into our leadership ranks. We will interview 2 underrepresented candidates for every open leadership role. And we are committing to ensure that people of color represent at least 20% of our global leadership team by 2023. 
Two, we're examining how we portray the American dream in the stories we tell, the creators we champion and the faces we elevate. And we've also undertaken a review of our marketing and media partners to ensure that these channels operate in a way that aligns with our values. 
And three, we're instituting a set of diversity expectations for our partners and vendors to hold our network accountable as well. This is only the beginning. And on behalf of our entire leadership team, Ralph and I want to be clear to our Black and African-American colleagues and people of color, both in our company and in our communities. We hear you, we stand with you, and we commit to do better by you. 
Moving to COVID. We experienced our first full quarter of impact from the pandemic in Q1 with widespread store closures across all 3 regions. In this difficult environment, our teams launched several new digital initiatives, accelerated new customer acquisition and delivered compelling engagement and product categories that resonate with consumers today, all while meaningfully reducing our expenses. As I've said before, our objective is to emerge from this period stronger than we came into it. We are constantly learning and taking action to ensure we not only endure through this crisis, but are positioned to thrive long term. 
I'll start with an update on our path to recovery in each region. Following our store closures late in the fourth quarter of fiscal '20, our doors were closed an additional 8 to 10 weeks across many of our largest markets in Q1. This drove a 57% comp decline in the first quarter, slightly better than our expectations. 
By region, the largest declines were in North America and Europe, where stores were closed the longest on average with brick-and-mortar comps down more than 70% in each region. Asia comps were down 33%. Earlier recovery in Korea and Mainland China was more than offset by closures in Japan, our largest market in Asia, where the government drove shutdowns in early April. 
By channel, the path to recovery in each region has been led by our digital businesses, where we resume targeted consumer marketing and accelerated our online capabilities while stores were closed. Owned visual comps were positive in all regions this quarter, led by 68% growth in Asia and 44% growth in Europe. North America also returned to positive digital comps. 
Global momentum in our digital channels was followed by our store openings across geographies. As of today, we are pleased to report that nearly all of our stores are open in Asia, Europe and North America. But we are watching resurgences closely, and our priority remains the health and safety of our teams and our consumers. 
As stores reopened, we experienced significant traffic and comp declines initially, but strong growth in conversion rates and average basket size. In the weeks that followed, we saw sequential improvement in brick-and-mortar traffic and comps, although both metrics were still negative as we exited the quarter. Our Europe and North America comp declines in June were roughly half the rate we experienced in April. And Asia comps improved from more than 50% declines in April to a single-digit decline in June. 
While we remain cautious on the pace of recovery as COVID continues to develop around the world, we are encouraged by our progress this quarter on our long-term journey of brand elevation. Enabled by our inventory discipline pre-COVID and early actions taken since the start of the pandemic, we generated double-digit AUR growth and significantly lower discount rates in our own retail channels in Q1. We also drove lower markdown allowances at wholesale, which brings me to our wholesale performance through COVID. 
We have experienced a similar trajectory to our own stores, with our wholesale brick-and-mortar partners closed for a comparable period in the quarter. On a sell-out basis, we've seen encouraging sequential improvement led again by strong growth in digital. At brick-and-mortar wholesale, our sell-out declines have moderated on a month-by-month basis, though we're still down double digits in June. 
As we noted on our last call, we're taking a number of key actions to ensure that this channel is well positioned as we emerge from the crisis. First, on a sell-in basis, we stopped shipping spring/summer products to nearly all wholesale accounts in March. This enabled our partners to continue selling through products received prior to closures, while preventing the buildup of excess inventories in the channel. 
Second, we also proactively reduced our fall holiday orders by 2/3 at the start of COVID in order to reintegrate existing product into upcoming collections. While we continue to diligently manage our inventories through the pandemic, we've selectively filled in key programs to ensure appropriate seasonal assortments. And as of June, we resume shipping of very limited quantities of replenishment product and are working with our partners to take a carefully monitored approach to fall holiday. While these reductions are driving significant declines in our first half sell-in to wholesale, they are a critical step to realign our inventories to expected demand and continue enabling our strategy of brand elevation. 
And third, we're utilizing this period to accelerate shifts in our wholesale distribution, particularly in North America brick-and-mortar. Working with our partners, we exited more than 200 lower-performing wholesale doors this spring in order to focus on our most productive locations. While these closures represent less than 5% of our sales to the channel, we are working to not only recapture these sales, but also grow share in our remaining businesses. This is a two-pronged approach focused on increasing productivity in the brick-and-mortar doors we are moving forward with and deliberately shifting sales towards digital. To this end, we are activating highly targeted marketing aimed at relevant wholesale consumers, a program we successfully tested prior to COVID. 
That takes us to my next update, leading with digital. Through the pandemic, we have accelerated the rollout of connected retail programs and leveraged high-impact digital marketing as we shift toward a true omnichannel model. New connected retail capabilities in the quarter included Find In Store, virtual selling appointments, live stream selling, digital catalogs and expanded Buy Online Ship From Store. Consumer response to these initiatives has been encouraging so far. In North America factory stores, for example, virtual appointments have driven double the spend versus our average consumer transaction. We also continued to roll out targeted personalized consumer engagement including tailored marketing and promotional offers. This will enable us to drive more effective marketing, along with a lower level of overall promotions and better product recommendations over time. 
While I'm energized by the successful rollouts in the midst of COVID, there remains a lot of opportunity to deepen and expand our digital connectivity and omnichannel capabilities. We will also continue to digitize how we work. This includes the adoption of virtual showrooms, which we successfully rolled out for men's Purple Label last month and continuing to expand our digital product creation. 
Turning now to our marketing and brand elevation journey through COVID. Since the start of our Next Great Chapter plan in fiscal '19, we've added an average of more than 5 million new consumers per year to our brands to our direct-to-consumer channels alone. This is consistent with our plan to win over a new generation, and we believe we have an opportunity to take share in this environment. 
In the first quarter, we resumed marketing activities these included targeted e-mail campaigns with predictive AI and high-reach paid social media aimed at acquiring new consumers, driving traffic and conversion to our channels. And through our campaigns like RL@Home and Pride, we continue to tap into our authentic values like optimism, quality and togetherness, which are especially relevant in the current context. 
These initiatives have resonated well with consumers. Globally, our brand awareness and purchase intent have accelerated since the start of the pandemic. And our total social media followers reached nearly 44 million in the first quarter, a 9% increase to last year, led by double-digit growth on Instagram and TikTok. 
Critically, we have also continued our work to both elevate and protect the health and integrity of our brands through the current crisis, consistent with our long-term strategy. These actions include: one, reducing our total penetration in off-price and bottom wholesale brick-and-mortar doors while driving faster growth in our direct-to-consumer and wholesale.com businesses; two, staying disciplined on inventories to reduce the need for discounting and heavy promotions. And three, we've continued improving our product offering and resetting our price value proposition across each channel in the marketplace. We were encouraged that underlying AUR growth outperformed our expectations this quarter, reflecting our continued brand elevation efforts, reductions in promotional activity and strategic price increases. 
Moving on to our initiative to operate with discipline to fuel growth. A key element of our long-term plan has been to balance growth with productivity, which includes driving a culture of cost discipline and working in new ways across our organization. Since the start of the pandemic, we have made hard choices to reduce near-term expenses so we can emerge from this crisis stronger than we came into it and pivot quickly back to growth. We're also in the process of reassessing our long-term operating structure to align our resourcing and investments to our strategic priorities and the shifting retail landscape. While also building more flexibility into our cost structure. Jane will discuss this in more detail in a moment. 
And lastly, I want to highlight the continued importance of our journey to integrate citizenship and sustainability across our business. We were proud that parity.org recently named us among the best companies for women to advance. And I hope you've all had a chance to check out our annual Design the Change report published this June. The report delineates clear target dates around our commitments, new science-based greenhouse gas reduction targets and our new commitments to reducing water consumption across our value chain, in partnership with the worldwide life fund. 
In closing, Ralph and I are proud of and grateful for the dedication, commitment and agility our teams are demonstrating as we navigate through highly challenging conditions around the world. I've said this before, but I still strongly believe this crisis is creating opportunities for our business to emerge leaner, more nimble and ultimately take market share. We are using this time to proactively deliver the products, channels and authentic brand connections that consumers crave in this rapidly evolving environment. 
And while the effects of the pandemic appear to be far from over, we have strong foundations in place to manage through the continued uncertainty including remote and flexible working, new connected retailing capabilities, a strong digital marketing proposition and a clear inventory management strategy. And we are privileged to have one of the greatest assets of all, the strength of our timeless global brand, which we will steadfastly protect and build through this period and beyond. 
And before I hand it off to Jane, I'd like to extend a warm welcome to Darren Walker who joined our Board of Directors last week. Currently the President and CEO of the Ford Foundation, we believe Darren's experience in philanthropy and business will not only complement our Board's existing expertise but will bring important new perspective. I'd also like to thank departing directors, George Brown and Robert Wright for their leadership and valued contributions to the company over many years. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Jane to discuss our financial results, and I'll join her at the end to answer your questions."

This quarter was undoubtedly one of the most challenging periods in our company's history. All of our reportable regions and physical channels faced retail closures and consumer self-distancing on a mass scale. As we started reopening stores with new safety protocols, reduced hours and capacity restrictions consumers remained cautious as expected, but we were encouraged by the sequential improvements across each region. 
During the quarter, we continued to leverage our key strengths. Starting with our balance sheet, which is the real competitive advantage through this crisis and gives us the flexibility to continue to execute our plan and elevate our brands. 
We ended the first quarter with $2.7 billion in cash and investments and $1.9 billion in total debt, which compared to $2 billion in cash and investments and $692 million in debt at the end of last year's first quarter. Building on our actions in Q4, we took additional precautionary measures to preserve cash and strengthen liquidity in the first quarter. These actions included: first, the issuance of $1.25 billion in debt in June, with proceeds going towards the paydown of our revolver, August 2020 notes and the remainder held for general corporate purposes as we continue to manage through COVID. 
Second, we continue to reduce our costs to align to our top line and better align with our long-term strategy with first quarter SG&A down 30% to last year. 
Third, we reduced our wholesale footprint by more than 200 doors this quarter, and we'll continue evaluating our presence as we move forward. We also worked closely with our wholesale partners to reduce our outstanding receivables by more than half since the start of the crisis. 
In addition, we have improved our working capital and cash conversion cycle from the start of the crisis through a combination of lower accounts receivable and extended days payable, despite the challenging global retail conditions. 
Second, we are aligning our resources to support future growth and profitability as we accelerate our core strategic focus areas. As a part of this, we are in the process of determining the right organizational and operating structures to support this growth. 
Our work will focus on 6 key areas: team organizational structures and capabilities; enterprise-wide processes and new ways of working; our distribution center and corporate office footprint; our own DTC and wholesale door presence as we assess the role of each store within the ecosystem; all discretionary expenses such as travel and sample costs; and lastly, our brand portfolio. 
These plans are beginning to take shape, informed by both our growth objectives and the constantly evolving consumer context. And we will share more with you in the coming months. 
Net inventory at the end of the first quarter was down 22% to last year, with double-digit declines across all regions. Our strong AUR and gross margin performance this quarter gives us confidence that we are taking the right strategic approach to move through excess spring '20 product while also positioning the company for future growth. 
Moving on to our first quarter performance. First quarter revenues declined 66% and on a reported basis and 65% in constant currency. Total direct-to-consumer comps were down 57%, as Patrice mentioned, driven by COVID-related store closures across all regions and gradual recovery rates as doors reopened. The brick-and-mortar comp decline was partially offset by a 13% comp increase in our owned Ralph Lauren digital commerce business, led by strong double-digit growth in Asia and Europe. 
And more importantly, we accelerated digital profitability with Q1 digital operating margins expanding more than 1,000 basis points in all 3 regions through a combination of higher quality sales and SG&A leverage. With digital representing our fastest-growing channel in the company, driving profitability in this business is not only critical to our long-term margin accretion but also for our strategy of repositioning RalphLauren.com as our digital flagship or the best expression of our brand online. 
Adjusted gross margin was 71.8% in the first quarter compared to 64.5% last year. Approximately 1/3 of this expansion was driven by our continued improvement in pricing and promotions, while about 2/3 was driven by unusual geographic and channel mix shifts due to COVID. The COVID factors were: first, we reported significantly better top line results in Asia this quarter compared to Europe and North America, which were largely closed during the period. In addition to being the earliest region on the path to recovery from COVID-related impacts, Asia is also our highest gross margin and AUR market across the 3 geographies. 
Second, our gross margin mix benefited from a lower contribution from factory stores and off price due to physical store closures, combined with a higher relative contribution from full price digital commerce in the period. We expect these mixed distortions to moderate significantly beyond Q1 as our other regions and factory stores have gradually returned to operations. However, we still expect to expand gross margins going forward with improved pricing and promotion continuing to be the most durable driver, along with a more normalized level of geographic and channel mix benefit. 
First quarter AUR growth of 25% exceeded our expectations in a promotional competitive environment, led by double-digit increases in North America and Europe. Excluding the COVID-related mix impacts just noted, underlying AUR still grew high single digits to last year. This is consistent with our recent trajectory and above the low to mid single-digit growth we guided for fiscal '21 as we continue to elevate our brands across every touch point, significantly reduce promotional depth and breadth and take targeted pricing increases, particularly in North America. 
SG&A expenses declined 30% to last year, on savings from employee furloughs and store rents as well as lower selling and marketing expenses. Adjusted operating loss for the first quarter was $174 million compared to operating income of $175 million last year. Marketing declined 34% as we shifted some activities later in the year. We also pivoted investment from in-store and event-based engagements toward longer-term brand-building activities focused on digital and our values-based messaging. We still anticipate that SG&A declines will moderate as we move through the year as we bring an appropriate level of infrastructure and staffing back to support reopened businesses. 
Moving on to segment performance, starting with North America. Revenue decreased 77% to last year. Retail comps declined 64%, driven by a 77% decline in bricks-and-mortar comps while our own digital comps increased 3%. Brick-and-mortar comps were primarily impacted by store closures for a majority of the quarter across the region and in absence of foreign tourist traffic in quarter. In addition, as stores have reopened, we have seen moderate sequential improvement as reduced mall opening hours and restrictions on customer capacity further impact performance. Beyond Q1, we continue to plan cautiously, given a high level of uncertainty around broader macro trends as well as evolving consumer behavior. 
AUR for the quarter was up double digits in both our full price and factory stores, driven by reduced promotions and our continued rollout of targeted ticketed price increases. Comps in our North America directly operated digital commerce business grew 3% compared to 7% decline in the fourth quarter. Underlying sales to domestic consumers accelerated to high-teens growth in the quarter, while sales to international and Daido customers declined double digits to last year as planned. 
Growth in our domestic traffic and comps improved as we turned performance driven marketing back on in mid-April, following an initial quiet period due to COVID. Our digital marketing work generated a 65% increase in high-quality new consumers this quarter, driving our full price sales penetration higher. 
These comp gains were tempered by a significant planned reduction in promotions aimed at reducing our lower-margin sales to international customers and driving higher quality of sales overall. As a result, gross margins for our North America digital commerce expanded 500 basis points to last year. Going forward, our plan is to continue driving stronger profitability in this channel, while on the revenue side, balancing strong domestic growth with a steady reduction in sales to international shoppers. 
In North America wholesale, first quarter revenue declined 93% as we [indiscernible] all shipments to North American wholesale partners, starting in the fourth quarter due to COVID. However, we were encouraged by wholesale.com sell-out trends up mid teens. Our sellout rates in both wholesale.com and brick-and-mortar wholesale are significantly outperforming our sell-in as stores reopen. However, we expect further pressure on reported sell-in over the next several quarters as we continue to realign inventories to demand and carefully monitor regional resurgence of the virus. We also continued reducing our penetration to the off price channel in the quarter. 
Moving on to Europe. First quarter revenue declined 67% on a reported basis and 64% in constant currency. Europe retail comps were down 62% with a 75% decline in our brick-and-mortar stores comp, partly offset by a strong 44% increase in owned digital commerce. Across Europe, our brick-and-mortar comps were impacted by COVID-related store closures for about 2/3 of the quarter, similar to North America. However, AUR was up 15% to last year, led by our ongoing efforts to elevate our factory channel. Like North America, we continue to be cautious on the pace of bricks-and-mortar recovery in Europe based on a number of uncertainties. Our own digital commerce comps were up 44% in the quarter as we quickly pivoted our marketing, focused on new consumer acquisition and accelerated Buy Online Ship From Store to leverage store inventories. 
Europe wholesale revenue declined 68% in constant currency, driven by our plan to reduce shipments during COVID to rightsize inventories in the marketplace. However, similar to North America, we saw continued momentum in wholesale.com and digital pure play sellout performance through the period with strong double-digit growth to last year. 
Turning to Asia. Revenue declined 34% on a reported basis and 32% in constant currency in the first quarter. Asia retail comps were down 33% to last year, with a 35% decline in our brick-and-mortar stores, partly offset by digital comps of 68%. And our performance in Korea and the Chinese Mainland continue to improve throughout the period, with Q1 sales up high single digits and mid-teens to last year, respectively. Japan was the biggest headwind in the quarter, with Q1 sales down nearly 60% on government-mandated store closures in April and May. Since reopening all of our stores in early June, the market appears to be recovering relatively well due to a loyal existing consumer base, largely mitigating pressure from weaker tourism. Other key markets especially those with high levels of tourism like Hong Kong are on a more prolonged and variable recovery. 
Overall momentum in our Asia digital businesses continued through the quarter even as stores reopened, driven by strong performance across all key markets and channels, including our own sites, digital pure plays and wholesale.com. We drove a successful 6/18 campaign in Mainland China, including our first brand live stream event on Tmall. 
Looking ahead, as we navigate the current environment, we remain first and foremost committed to the safety of our employees, partners and consumers. We continue to suspend guidance due to the high level of uncertainty and evolving situations surrounding COVID-19, including possible resurgences and additional economic shutdowns. Based on the current trends, however, we still expect Q1 to be the most significantly challenged quarter of the year on both the top and bottom line basis. While revenue decline should moderate gradually as we move through the year, we continue to expect second quarter revenues and operating profit to be down meaningfully as well as full year fiscal '21 due to the pandemic and prolonged demand recovery. As Patrice mentioned, as we move through the pandemic, we are continuing our strategic focus on elevating our brands and driving profitability as we reposition the company to return to sustainable, long-term growth and value creation. 
In closing, we are operating in an incredibly dynamic environment, and our teams are facing the challenge with real agility. We will continue to face headwinds, but our purpose, strategy and objectives are clear. And led by Ralph's enduring vision, we believe our discipline, alongside a clear focus on continuing to elevate our iconic brand, will enable us to emerge from this time in a position of strength. 
With that, let's open up the call for your questions."

So listen, we are determined to win in this very dynamic environment. And as I look at our core strategic choices, which you know well, we believe they're broadly still relevant today.

And as I look at our core strategic choices, which you know well, we believe they're broadly still relevant today. But obviously, the landscape is shifting rapidly and we're proactively evolving our strategy to remain on offense, which includes accelerating certain strategic choices over others. So I thought I'd share a few examples of how our teams are working with agility and resilience to bring all this to life. First, on winning over a new generation. We're putting even more emphasis on purpose and values-based communication, and you saw some of that with our Pride campaign recently, coupled with targeted personalized digital marketing which -- both of which are actually resonating quite well with current consumers and new consumers. And you'll remember, our ambition is to get to one-to-one marketing ultimately. Within our product assortment, one of the things, I think, that really stands out for Ralph Lauren relative to a number of players in our peer group is the fact that we are a lifestyle brand. We're not attached specifically to 1 product category or another. We truly have this incredible ability to flex across categories. And so we're leveraging this to put more emphasis on areas that are resonating most with consumers right now. So for example, that is both our focus on the core and also new underdeveloped categories that we're focusing on now like home or loungewear, for example. Within our ecosystems, you remember, we're looking to build holistic omnichannel ecosystems in a limited number of big cities around the world. That's our go-to-market strategy. We're putting more emphasis on connected retail and refining how we integrate these capabilities within this ecosystem strategy. So connected retail, if you're familiar with all the capabilities that are available in this space. And I'm actually really pleased with the work our teams have done over the past few weeks and months to ramp up Buy Online Pick Up In Store, Buy Online Ship From Store, Curbside, digital clients have virtual appointments, book appointments online and so on. And I think probably the Chinese Mainland situation is probably our best example of bringing all that to life, but it's actually been very energizing to see how this has been expanded across all of our regions. Fourth thing I would call out is related to this, actually, is really taking a digital-first lens to everything that we do, whether that applies to how we interact with consumers, how we interact within our teams, virtual showrooms. We had our first Purple Label virtual showrooms a few weeks ago, that was very successful or 3D design. And then finally, our work to operate with discipline to fuel growth, which is our fifth pillar, obviously doesn't stop here. With the changing environment, we're actively looking at our complete operating structure where we are allocating resources and where we can drive more flexibility, as Jane mentioned in her prepared remarks. Now of course, all of this work will require reshaping of our organization and footprint to align with these updated and accelerated strategic choices, which we look forward to talking to you more about in the coming months."

Like many competitors, we're watching changing regional dynamics and resurgences very care",362,"Yes, Laurent, I'll take the second part of your question, and we're glad you're back. Let me try to give you some comments as you think about the next few quarters. Like many competitors, we're watching changing regional dynamics and resurgences very carefully. But I think there's a second dynamic at play, which is the cadence of our business recovery, which really ties into our continued strategic focus on elevating our brands and driving quality of sales even during this pandemic. The way we're thinking about it, based on what we know today is, I think it's reasonable to expect that Q2 revenue will continue to see an improvement, but that our recovery will proceed at a more moderate pace than our Q1 exit rate, where we have the initial benefit of store reopenings. I think the most significant uncontrollable is traffic, where we still expect it to be a pressure point as we move forward, along with the broader macroeconomic environment. However, what we can control are the proactive decisions that we are making to elevate our brands and position them to return to healthy and sustainable growth. Now that will play out on the wholesale side in that we expect our reported sell-in to continue to be heavily pressured as we prioritize healthier sell-out and healthy inventory levels. Our sell-out trends are encouraging thus far, and our inventories were down meaningfully at the end of Q1 but we intend to continue this journey, especially through Q2. And on the DTC side, while nearly all of our stores are open, we expect the pace of recovery to be more gradual as we leverage this period to prioritize quality of sales and meaningfully improve profitability in our DTC channels, especially our digital channel where our operating margins expanded by 1,000 basis points in every region in Q1. I know that these decisions in the short term will temper the speed of recovery in our reported sales in both DTC and wholesale, but it will better position our brands to return to more normalized trajectory as we move beyond this period. But we're analyzing this day-by-day and really leaning into our strategic choices."

We are, as I said, encouraged by the week-on-week improvements that we saw in Q1, although our trends were still negative as we exited the quarter. And we do expect that indoor and mall environment could remain challenged through the coming quarter. But as we move into fall holiday, we're very clear that we're going to continue to prioritize inventory management, which could be a headwind to sell-out if demand picks up but is really important for our long-term strategy. But as we expect trends to improve as we move into fall and we expect to start to close the gap to get to more normalized levels that were pre-COVID as we enter into spring '21, we're still taking a cautious approach. But I think that, that spring '21 starts get to start -- all things holding, start to get us back to that exit rate that we saw before we went into COVID. That said, there's a lot of uncertainty in the market but we feel good about our position today, Matt. Our inventories are clean, we're keeping them that way. We're happy with our sellout that we're seeing in the environment. But obviously, the environment has some uncertainty that we're watching."

First, we want to focus on key cities, right? And actually, what you'll find in the U.S. is we have a lot of white space opportunities from a key city standpoint. Second is within each of these key cities, we want to make sure we have a balanced omnichannel ecosystem. And likewise here, we believe there are opportunities to rebalance it. So what are the key components of it? First is our DTC. Second is digital commerce, right. And digital commerce is 4 components in our minds. It's RalphLauren.com site. And you've heard Jane talk about all the work we're doing to elevate AUR, strengthen profitability, better connect with consumers moving forward. There are pure players, those -- the presence is more limited in the U.S., but that business is developing, obviously, much stronger in Europe and in Asia. The third area is wholesale.com, which is very good momentum in the U.S. We're actually very pleased with the progress that we're making with our partners there. We're investing disproportionately additional capabilities with them to further accelerate our performance and enhance our brand presence. And fourth is social commerce, which is still nascent. So think of this as Instagram Checkout, for example. We are now available on Instagram Checkout. I think a little anecdote is we're the first home business actually on Instagram Checkout. We expect to see significant growth from these 4 components of digital commerce and then the third element of this plan is the top doors of our wholesale partners. And you've seen for the recent announcement that we have further reduced our footprint in wholesale to really focus even more on those top-performing doors where we can both project the brand in a way that's consistent with the image we want to build and also drive the type of profitability that we need to achieve within this space. So that's how we're thinking about it. We're going to leverage targeted marketing in order to guide consumers from those parts of the business that we are exiting to bring them into the parts of the business that represent the future of the company. And I have to say, over the past few months, we've ramped up our capabilities in terms of CRM consumer segmentation, consumer targeting. And we feel quite good about our ability to leverage this as a way to build our business and get back to growth and value creation in the long term."

But I think as you can think about the underlying gross margin expansion, if you look at Q1 in terms of gross margin, about 2/3 of the 730 basis points was almost entirely channel and geography related due to COVID impacts. So 1/3 was really driven by pricing and promotions. And underneath the covers, if you looked at AUR growth, we had -- our AUR growth in Q3, Q4 and into Q1 was exactly the same. So it's sort of the 8 points that we called out in Q4 -- continued Q3, Q4, Q1 continued. So we expect gross margin expansion for the year. I do expect there to be some volatility in underlying gross margin as we move through and we move through some inventory management as we cycle through the year, but we are still calling for gross margin expansion for the year. With the benefits going to -- the major benefit going to be pricing and promotion work that we continue to do, the elevation work that we're doing and continued benefits from geography, but they're going to be much less significant than what you saw in Q1. Q1, obviously, because of the impact of COVID was outstated. There are some offsets in terms of FX was a pressure, and I expect that to continue through the year because of our hedge positions. And some of the liquidation and excess that we move to factory has a higher cost, and that has some pressure on gross margin as we move through as well. But those are the dynamics at play. We're very encouraged by our gross margin progress and expect to see it continue."

We had extremely strong AUR, double-digit growth, AUR growth in Q1, led by AUR growth, very strong in North America and across Europe. So very, very positive and the largest driver. Obviously, with the digital momentum we saw, we also saw SG's nice SG&A leverage, especially on our digital commerce sites in EMEA and Asia, where, as we called out, the comps were up in the 40s and over 50% in Asia, so very strong growth, leveraging SG&A. We really work to drive AUR by significantly reducing site-wide promotions. We were down 43 days on -- to the quarter last year. And the work that we're doing that Patrice called out in terms of personalization and specific consumer targeting and personalization, we're very encouraged by that. And I think that those results are most notable as you look into our EMEA results. As you called out, the pressure point in North America for us is our continued work on quality of sales, which has pressured our international or daigou consumers. They were down over very strong double digits, and that was counterbalanced by high-teens growth in our domestic consumers. But as I pull apart the performance differences across region, really, it is that international consumer that is the challenge point in North America.

This year, based on our forecast, you will see a continued progression of marketing investment relative to sales compared to the prior year. When we look at how to structure the marketing activities, I think we're becoming even clearer now based on what we're seeing with consumers and what they're responding to, that this two-pronged approach is really working well for us. First element of the plan is really the storytelling around purpose, values-based communication, whether that's Earth Polo, Pride, [indiscernible] activities that we did recently the support on diversity and inclusion. We're going to continue to drive that. And then coupled with very targeted TRM digital marketing. And again, the ambition here is to be able to do ultimately one-to-one marketing so that the message you get, the way the site looks when you get on it, is perfectly tailored to you, your profile, your history with us, your centers of interest, and I think we're making good progress there. In terms of measurement, which is near and dear to my heart, we've made good progress on a few capabilities. First of all, ROI, obviously, is the first lens that we look at, right. And on some activities, it's easy to calculate on others, it's a little more complicated. So we couple that with new measurement that we have now on awareness, brand consideration and purchase intent scores, which we're able to track in all of our core markets for ourselves versus the past and versus our competitive set.

362220,675701597,2058460,"Ralph Lauren Corporation, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2020",2020-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Ralph Lauren Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Cory. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. The past few months have marked a period of extraordinary challenge, but also resilience, agility and hope. Our financial performance this quarter reflects an unprecedented 3",2220,"Thank you, Cory. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. The past few months have marked a period of extraordinary challenge, but also resilience, agility and hope. Our financial performance this quarter reflects an unprecedented 3 months of COVID-19-related impact around the world. We're taking the opportunity to leverage this period of disruption to accelerate our core strategic focus areas, drive new areas of growth and realign our resources accordingly.  
Building on the strong foundational work our teams had done prior to COVID, over the past 3 months, they have executed with incredible agility and speed to strengthen our connected retail capabilities, further rationalize our North America brick-and-mortar wholesale presence and continue to build our brand through personalized consumer engagement and more values-based messaging, all while pursuing our brand elevation journey, as evidenced by our strong AUR and gross margin progress.  
Since Ralph started our company more than 50 years ago, his focus on the long term, on the spirit of timelessness, has enabled us to not only survive times of uncertainty but drive lasting, authentic connections with our consumers. To that end, we have a responsibility that goes well beyond the products we sell. And I first want to take a moment to address the persistent systemic racial injustice in the U.S. and around the world. We've been listening to our teams and a few of the many actions we've taken over the past couple of months include: One, we committed to elevate more Black and African-American talent into our leadership ranks. We will interview 2 underrepresented candidates for every open leadership role, and we are committing to ensure that people of color represent at least 20% of our global leadership team by 2023.  
Two, we're examining how we portray the American dream in the stories we tell, the creators we champion and the faces we elevate. And we've also undertaken a review of our marketing and media partners to ensure that these channels operate in a way that aligns with our values.  
And three, we're instituting a set of diversity expectations for our partners and vendors to hold our network accountable as well. This is only the beginning. And on behalf of our entire leadership team, Ralph and I want to be clear to our Black and African-American colleagues and people of color both in our company and in our communities, we hear you, we stand with you, and we commit to do better by you.  
Moving to COVID. We experienced our first full quarter of impact from the pandemic in Q1, with widespread store closures across all 3 regions. In this difficult environment, our teams launched several new digital initiatives, accelerated new customer acquisition and delivered compelling engagement and product categories that resonate with consumers today, all while meaningfully reducing our expenses. As I've said before, our objective is to emerge from this period stronger than we came into it. We are constantly learning and taking action to ensure we not only endure through this crisis, but are positioned to thrive long term.  
I'll start with an update on our path to recovery in each region. Following our store closures late in the fourth quarter of fiscal '20, our doors were closed an additional 8 to 10 weeks across many of our largest markets in Q1. This drove a 57% comp decline in the first quarter, slightly better than our expectations.  
By region, the largest declines were in North America and Europe, where stores were closed the longest on average with brick-and-mortar comps down more than 70% in each region. Asia comps were down 33%. Earlier recovery in Korea and Mainland China was more than offset by closures in Japan, our largest market in Asia, where the government drove shutdowns in early April.  
By channel, the path to recovery in each region has been led by our digital businesses, where we resumed targeted consumer marketing and accelerated our online capabilities while stores were closed. Own digital comps were positive in all regions this quarter, led by 68% growth in Asia and 44% growth in Europe. North America also returned to positive digital comps.  
Global momentum in our digital channels was followed by our store reopenings across geographies. As of today, we are pleased to report that nearly all of our stores are open in Asia, Europe and North America. But we are watching resurgences closely, and our priority remains the health and safety of our teams and our consumers.  
As stores reopened, we experienced significant traffic and comp declines initially, but strong growth in conversion rates and average basket size. In the weeks that followed, we saw sequential improvement in brick-and-mortar traffic and comps, although both metrics were still negative as we exited the quarter. Our Europe and North America comp declines in June were roughly half the rate we experienced in April. And Asia comps improved for more than 50% declines in April to a single-digit decline in June.  
While we remain cautious on the pace of recovery as COVID continues to develop around the world, we are encouraged by our progress this quarter on our long-term journey of brand elevation. Enabled by our inventory discipline pre-COVID and early actions taken since the start of the pandemic, we generated double-digit AUR growth and significantly lower discount rates in our own retail channels in Q1. We also drove lower markdown allowances at wholesale, which brings me to our wholesale performance through COVID.  
We have experienced a similar trajectory to our own stores, with our wholesale brick-and-mortar partners closed for a comparable period in the quarter. On a sell-out basis, we've seen encouraging sequential improvement led again by strong growth in digital. At brick-and-mortar wholesale, our sell-out declines have moderated on a month-by-month basis, though we're still down double digits in June.  
As we noted on our last call, we're taking a number of key actions to ensure that this channel is well positioned as we emerge from the crisis. First, on a sell-in basis, we stopped shipping Spring/Summer products to nearly all wholesale accounts in March. This enabled our partners to continue selling through products received prior to closures, while preventing the buildup of excess inventories in the channel.  
Second, we also proactively reduced our Fall/Holiday orders by 2/3 at the start of COVID in order to reintegrate existing product into upcoming collections. While we continue to diligently manage our inventories through the pandemic, we've selectively filled in key programs to ensure appropriate seasonal assortments. And as of June, we resumed shipping of very limited quantities of replenishment product and are working with our partners to take a carefully monitored approach to Fall/Holiday. While these reductions are driving significant declines in our first half sell-in to wholesale, they are a critical step to realign our inventories to expected demand and continue enabling our strategy of brand elevation.  
And third, we're utilizing this period to accelerate shifts in our wholesale distribution, particularly in North America brick-and-mortar. Working with our partners, we exited more than 200 lower-performing wholesale doors this spring in order to focus on our most productive locations. While these closures represent less than 5% of our sales to the channel, we are working to not only recapture these sales, but also grow share in our remaining businesses. This is a two-pronged approach focused on increasing productivity in the brick-and-mortar doors we are moving forward with and deliberately shifting sales towards digital. To this end, we are activating highly targeted marketing aimed at relevant wholesale consumers, a program we successfully tested prior to COVID.  
That takes us to my next update, leading with digital. Through the pandemic, we have accelerated the rollout of connected retail programs and leveraged high-impact digital marketing as we shift toward a true omnichannel model. New connected retail capabilities in the quarter included Find In Store, virtual selling appointments, live stream selling, digital catalogs and expanded Buy Online-Ship From Store. Consumer response to these initiatives has been encouraging so far. In North America factory stores, for example, virtual appointments have driven double the spend versus our average consumer transaction.  
We also continued to roll out targeted personalized consumer engagement including tailored marketing and promotional offers. This will enable us to drive more effective marketing, along with a lower level of overall promotions and better product recommendations over time.  
While I'm energized by these successful rollouts in the midst of COVID, there remains a lot of opportunity to deepen and expand our digital connectivity and omnichannel capabilities. We will also continue to digitize how we work. This includes the adoption of virtual showrooms, which we successfully rolled out for men's Purple Label last month, and continuing to expand our digital product creation.  
Turning now to our marketing and brand-elevation journey through COVID. Since the start of our Next Great Chapter plan in fiscal '19, we've added an average of more than 5 million new consumers per year to our brands through our direct-to-consumer channels alone. This is consistent with our plan to win over a new generation, and we believe we have an opportunity to take share in this environment.  
In the first quarter, we resumed marketing activities. These included targeted e-mail campaigns with predictive AI and high-reach paid social media aimed at acquiring new consumers, driving traffic and conversion to our channels. And through our campaigns like RL @ Home and Pride, we continue to tap into our authentic values like optimism, quality and togetherness, which are especially relevant in the current context. These initiatives have resonated well with consumers. Globally, our brand awareness and purchase intent have accelerated since the start of the pandemic. And our total social media followers reached nearly 44 million in the first quarter, a 9% increase to last year, led by double-digit growth on Instagram and TikTok.  
Critically, we have also continued our work to both elevate and protect the health and integrity of our brands through the current crisis, consistent with our long-term strategy. These actions include: one, reducing our total penetration in off-price and bottom wholesale brick-and-mortar doors while driving faster growth in our direct-to-consumer and Wholesale Dot Com businesses; two, staying disciplined on inventories to reduce the need for discounting and heavy promotions; and three, we've continued improving our product offering and resetting our price value proposition across each channel in the marketplace. We were encouraged that underlying AUR growth outperformed our expectations this quarter, reflecting our continued brand elevation efforts, reductions in promotional activity and strategic price increases.  
Moving on to our initiative to operate with discipline to fuel growth. A key element of our long-term plan has been to balance growth with productivity, which includes driving a culture of cost discipline and working in new ways across our organization. Since the start of the pandemic, we have made hard choices to reduce near-term expenses so we can emerge from this crisis stronger than we came into it, and pivot quickly back to growth. We're also in the process of reassessing our long-term operating structure to align our resourcing and investments to our strategic priorities and the shifting retail landscape, while also building more flexibility into our cost structure. Jane will discuss this in more detail in a moment.  
And lastly, I want to highlight the continued importance of our journey to integrate citizenship and sustainability across our business. We were proud that Parity.org recently named us among the best companies for women to advance. And I hope you've all had a chance to check out our annual Design the Change report published this June. The report delineates clear target dates around our commitments, new science-based greenhouse gas-reduction targets and our new commitments to reducing water consumption across our value chain, in partnership with the World Wildlife Fund.  
In closing, Ralph and I are proud of and grateful for the dedication, commitment and agility our teams are demonstrating as we navigate through highly challenging conditions around the world. I've said this before, but I still strongly believe this crisis is creating opportunities for our business to emerge leaner, more nimble and ultimately take market share. We are using this time to proactively deliver the products, channels and authentic brand connections that consumers crave in this rapidly evolving environment.  
And while the effects of the pandemic appear to be far from over, we have strong foundations in place to manage through the continued uncertainty, including remote and flexible working, new connected retailing capabilities, a strong digital marketing proposition and a clear inventory management strategy. And we are privileged to have one of the greatest assets of all, the strength of our timeless global brand, which we will steadfastly protect and build through this period and beyond.  
And before I hand it off to Jane, I'd like to extend a warm welcome to Darren Walker, who joined our Board of Directors last week. Currently the President and CEO of the Ford Foundation, we believe Darren's experience in philanthropy and business will not only complement our Board's existing expertise, but will bring important new perspective. I'd also like to thank departing directors Joyce Brown and Robert Wright for their leadership and valued contributions to the company over many years.  
With that, I'll turn it over to Jane to discuss our financial results, and I'll join her at the end to answer your questions."

This quarter was undoubtedly one of the most challenging periods in our company's history. All of our reportable regions and physical channels faced retail closures and consumer self-distancing on a mass scale. As we started reopening stores with new safety protocols, reduced hours and capacity restrictions, consumers remained cautious as expected, but we were encouraged by the sequential improvements across each region.  
During the quarter, we continued to leverage our key strengths starting with our balance sheet, which is a real competitive advantage through this crisis and gives us the flexibility to continue to execute our plan and elevate our brand.  
We ended the first quarter with $2.7 billion in cash and investments and $1.9 billion in total debt, which compared to $2 billion in cash and investments and $692 million in debt at the end of last year's first quarter. Building on our actions in Q4, we took additional precautionary measures to preserve cash and strengthen liquidity in the first quarter. These actions included: first, the issuance of $1.25 billion in debt in June, with proceeds going towards the paydown of our revolver, August 2020 notes and the remainder held for general corporate purposes as we continue to manage through COVID; second, we continue to reduce our costs to align to our top line and better align with our long-term strategy, with first quarter SG&A down 30% to last year; third, we reduced our wholesale footprint by more than 200 doors this quarter, and we'll continue evaluating our presence as we move forward. We also worked closely with our wholesale partners to reduce our outstanding receivables by more than half since the start of the crisis.  
In addition, we have improved our working capital and cash conversion cycle from the start of the crisis through a combination of lower accounts receivable and extended days payable, despite the challenging global retail conditions.  
Second, we are aligning our resources to support future growth and profitability as we accelerate our core strategic focus areas. As a part of this, we are in the process of determining the right organizational and operating structures to support this growth.  
Our work will focus on 6 key areas: team organizational structures and capabilities; enterprise-wide processes and new ways of working; our distribution center and corporate office footprint; our own DTC and wholesale door presence as we assess the role of each store within the ecosystem; all discretionary expenses such as travel and sample costs; and lastly, our brand portfolio. These plans are beginning to take shape, informed by both our growth objectives and the constantly evolving consumer context. And we will share more with you in the coming months.  
Net inventory at the end of the first quarter was down 22% to last year, with double-digit declines across all regions. Our strong AUR and gross margin performance this quarter gives us confidence that we are taking the right strategic approach to move through excess spring '20 product while also positioning the company for future growth.  
Moving on to our first quarter performance. First quarter revenues declined 66% and on a reported basis and 65% in constant currency. Total direct-to-consumer comps were down 57%, as Patrice mentioned, driven by COVID-related store closures across all regions and gradual recovery rates as doors reopened. The brick-and-mortar comp decline was partially offset by a 13% comp increase in our owned Ralph Lauren digital commerce business, led by strong double-digit growth in Asia and Europe. And more importantly, we accelerated digital profitability with Q1 digital operating margins expanding more than 1,000 basis points in all 3 regions through a combination of higher-quality sales and SG&A leverage.  
With digital representing our fastest-growing channel in the company, driving profitability in this business is not only critical to our long-term margin accretion, but also for our strategy of repositioning RalphLauren.com as our digital flagship or the best expression of our brand online.  
Adjusted gross margin was 71.8% in the first quarter compared to 64.5% last year. Approximately 1/3 of this expansion was driven by our continued improvement in pricing and promotions, while about 2/3 was driven by unusual geographic and channel mix shifts due to COVID. The COVID factors were: First, we reported significantly better top line results in Asia this quarter compared to Europe and North America, which were largely closed during the period. In addition to being the earliest region on the path to recovery from COVID-related impacts, Asia is also our highest gross margin and AUR market across the 3 geographies.  
Second, our gross margin mix benefited from a lower contribution from factory stores and off-price due to physical store closures, combined with a higher relative contribution from full price digital commerce in the period. We expect these mixed distortions to moderate significantly beyond Q1 as our other regions and factory stores have gradually returned to operations. However, we still expect to expand gross margins going forward with improved pricing and promotion continuing to be the most durable driver, along with a more normalized level of geographic and channel mix benefit.  
First quarter AUR growth of 25% exceeded our expectations in a promotional, competitive environment, led by double-digit increases in North America and Europe. Excluding the COVID-related mix impacts just noted, underlying AUR still grew high single digits to last year. This is consistent with our recent trajectory and above the low to mid-single-digit growth we guided for fiscal '21 as we continue to elevate our brands across every touch point, significantly reduced promotional depth and breadth and take targeted pricing increases, particularly in North America.  
SG&A expenses declined 30% to last year, on savings from employee furloughs and store rents as well as lower selling and marketing expenses. Adjusted operating loss for the first quarter was $174 million compared to operating income of $175 million last year. Marketing declined 34% as we shifted some activities later in the year. We also pivoted investment from in-store and event-based engagements toward longer-term brand-building activities focused on digital and our values-based messaging. We still anticipate that SG&A declines will moderate as we move through the year, as we bring an appropriate level of infrastructure and staffing back to support reopened businesses.  
Moving on to segment performance, starting with North America. Revenue decreased 77% to last year. Retail comps declined 64%, driven by a 77% decline in bricks-and-mortar comps while our own digital comps increased 3%. Brick-and-mortar comps were primarily impacted by store closures for a majority of the quarter across the region and in absence of foreign tourist traffic in quarter. In addition, as stores have reopened, we have seen moderate sequential improvement as reduced mall opening hours and restrictions on customer capacity further impact performance.  
Beyond Q1, we continue to plan cautiously, given a high level of uncertainty around broader macro trends as well as evolving consumer behavior. 
AUR for the quarter was up double digits in both our full price and factory stores, driven by reduced promotions and our continued rollout of targeted ticket price increases. Comps in our North America directly operated digital commerce business grew 3% compared to 7% decline in the fourth quarter. Underlying sales to domestic consumers accelerated to high-teens growth in the quarter, while sales to international and daigou customers declined double digits to last year as planned. 
Growth in our domestic traffic and comps improved as we turned performance-driven marketing back on in mid-April, following an initial quiet period due to COVID. Our digital marketing work generated a 65% increase in high-quality new consumers this quarter, driving our full price sales penetration higher.  
These comp gains were tempered by a significant planned reduction in promotions aimed at reducing our lower-margin sales to international customers and driving higher quality of sales overall. As a result, gross margins for our North America digital commerce expanded 500 basis points to last year. Going forward, our plan is to continue driving stronger profitability in this channel, while on the revenue side, balancing strong domestic growth with a steady reduction in sales to international shoppers.  
In North America wholesale, first quarter revenue declined 93% as we paused nearly all shipments to North American wholesale partners, starting in the fourth quarter due to COVID. However, we were encouraged by Wholesale Dot Com's sell-out trends, up mid-teens. Our sellout rates in both Wholesale Dot Com and brick-and-mortar wholesale are significantly outperforming our sell-in as stores reopen. However, we expect further pressure on reported sell-in over the next several quarters as we continue to realign inventories to demand and carefully monitor regional resurgence of the virus. We also continued reducing our penetration to the off-price channel in the quarter.  
Moving on to Europe. First quarter revenue declined 67% on a reported basis and 64% in constant currency. Europe retail comps were down 62% with a 75% decline in our brick-and-mortar stores comp, partly offset by a strong 44% increase in own digital commerce. Across Europe, our brick-and-mortar comps were impacted by COVID-related store closures for about 2/3 of the quarter, similar to North America. However, AUR was up 15% to last year, led by our ongoing efforts to elevate our factory channel. Like North America, we continue to be cautious on the pace of bricks-and-mortar recovery in Europe based on a number of uncertainties.  
Our own digital commerce comps were up 44% in the quarter as we quickly pivoted our marketing, focused on new consumer acquisition and accelerated Buy Online-Ship From Store to leverage store inventories.  
Europe wholesale revenue declined 68% in constant currency, driven by our plan to reduce shipments during COVID to rightsize inventories in the marketplace. However, similar to North America, we saw continued momentum in Wholesale Dot Com and digital pure play sell-out performance through the period, with strong double-digit growth to last year.  
Turning to Asia. Revenue declined 34% on a reported basis and 32% in constant currency in the first quarter. Asia retail comps were down 33% to last year, with a 35% decline in our brick-and-mortar stores, partly offset by digital comps of 68%. Our performance in Korea and the Chinese Mainland continue to improve throughout the period, with Q1 sales up high single digits and mid-teens to last year, respectively. Japan was the biggest headwind in the quarter, with Q1 sales down nearly 60% on government-mandated store closures in April and May. Since reopening all of our stores in early June, the market appears to be recovering relatively well due to a loyal existing consumer base, largely mitigating pressure from weaker tourism. Other key markets, especially those with high levels of tourism like Hong Kong, are on a more prolonged and variable recovery.  
Overall momentum in our Asia digital businesses continued through the quarter even as stores reopened, driven by strong performance across all key markets and channels, including our own sites, digital pure plays and Wholesale Dot Com. We drove a successful 618 campaign in Mainland China, including our first brand live stream event on Tmall.  
Looking ahead, as we navigate the current environment, we remain first and foremost committed to the safety of our employees, partners and consumers. We continue to suspend guidance due to the high level of uncertainty and evolving situations surrounding COVID-19, including possible resurgences and additional economic shutdowns. Based on the current trends, however, we still expect Q1 to be the most significantly challenged quarter of the year on both the top and bottom line basis. While revenue decline should moderate gradually as we move through the year, we continue to expect second quarter revenues and operating profit to be down meaningfully as well as full year fiscal '21 due to the pandemic and prolonged demand recovery.  
As Patrice mentioned, as we move through the pandemic, we are continuing our strategic focus on elevating our brands and driving profitability as we reposition the company to return to sustainable long-term growth and value creation.  
In closing, we are operating in an incredibly dynamic environment, and our teams are facing the challenge with real agility. We will continue to face headwinds, but our purpose, strategy and objectives are clear. And led by Ralph's enduring vision, we believe our discipline, alongside a clear focus on continuing to elevate our iconic brand, will enable us to emerge from this time in a position of strength.

So listen, we are determined to win in this very dynamic environment. And as I look at our core strategic choices, which you know well, we believe they're broadly still relevant today. But obviously,",545,"Laurent, welcome back and thank you for your question. So listen, we are determined to win in this very dynamic environment. And as I look at our core strategic choices, which you know well, we believe they're broadly still relevant today. But obviously, the landscape is shifting rapidly, and we're proactively evolving our strategy to remain on offense, which includes accelerating certain strategic choices over others. So I thought I'd share a few examples of how our teams are working with agility and resilience to bring all this to life. 
First, on winning over a new generation. We're putting even more emphasis on purpose and values-based communication, and you saw some of that with our Pride campaign recently, coupled with targeted personalized digital marketing which -- both of which are actually resonating quite well with current consumers and new consumers. And you'll remember, our ambition is to get to one-to-one marketing ultimately. 
Within our product assortment, one of the things, I think, that really stands out for Ralph Lauren relative to the number of players in our peer group is the fact that we are a lifestyle brand. We're not attached specifically to one product category or another. We truly have this incredible ability to flex across categories. And so we're leveraging this to put more emphasis on areas that are resonating most with consumers right now. So for example, that is both our focus on the core and also new underdeveloped categories that we're focusing on now like home or loungewear, for example. 
Within our ecosystems, you remember, we're looking to build holistic omnichannel ecosystems in a limited number of big cities around the world. That's our go-to-market strategy. We're putting more emphasis on connected retail and refining how we integrate these capabilities within this ecosystem strategy. So connected retail, if you're familiar with all the capabilities that are available in this space, and I'm actually really pleased with the work our teams have done over the past few weeks and months to ramp up buy online, pick up in store -- Buy Online-Ship From Store, curbside, digital clienteling, virtual appointments, book appointments online and so on. And I think probably the Chinese Mainland situation is probably our best example of bringing all that to life, but it's actually been very energizing to see how this has been expanded across all of our regions. 
Fourth thing I would call out is related to this, actually, is really taking a digital-first lens to everything that we do, whether that applies to how we interact with consumers, how we interact within our teams, virtual showrooms -- we had our first Purple Label virtual showrooms a few weeks ago that was very successful -- or 3D design. 
And then finally, our work to operate with discipline to fuel growth, which is our fifth pillar, obviously doesn't stop here. With the changing environment, we're actively looking at our complete operating structure, where we are allocating resources and where we can drive more flexibility, as Jane mentioned in her prepared remarks. Now of course, all of this work will require reshaping of our organization and footprint to align with these updated and accelerated strategic choices, which we look forward to talking to you more about in the coming months."

Let me try to give you some comments as you think about the next few quarters. 
Like many competitors, we're watching changing regional dynamics and resurgences very carefully. But I think there's a second dynamic at play, which is the cadence of our business recovery, which really ties into our continued strategic focus on elevating our brands and driving quality of sales even during this pandemic. The way we're thinking about it based on what we know today is I think it's reasonable to expect that Q2 revenue will continue to see an improvement, but that our recovery will proceed at a more moderate pace than our Q1 exit rate, where we have the initial benefit of store reopenings. I think the most significant uncontrollable is traffic, where we still expect it to be a pressure point as we move forward, along with the broader macroeconomic environment. However, what we can control are the proactive decisions that we are making to elevate our brands and position them to return to healthy and sustainable growth. Now that will play out on the wholesale side in that we expect our reported sell-in to continue to be heavily pressured as we prioritize healthier sell-out and healthy inventory levels. Our sell-out trends are encouraging thus far, and our inventories were down meaningfully at the end of Q1, but we intend to continue this journey, especially through Q2. 
And on the DTC side, while nearly all of our stores are open, we expect the pace of recovery to be more gradual as we leverage this period to prioritize quality of sales and meaningfully improve profitability in our DTC channels, especially our digital channel where our operating margins expanded by 1,000 basis points in every region in Q1. 
I know that these decisions in the short term will temper the speed of recovery in our reported sales in both DTC and wholesale, but it will better position our brands to return to more normalized trajectory as we move beyond this period. But we're analyzing this day-by-day and really leaning into our strategic choices."

Why don't I give you a little bit of color on how we're thinking about North America wholesale, at least in the coming few months. 
We are, as I said, encouraged by the week-on-week improvements that we saw in Q1, although our trends were still negative as we exited the quarter. And we do expect that indoor and mall environment could remain challenged through the coming quarter. But as we move into Fall/Holiday, we're very clear that we're going to continue to prioritize inventory management, which could be a headwind to sell-out if demand picks up, but is really important for our long-term strategy. But as we expect trends to improve as we move into fall and that we expect to start to close the gap to get to more normalized levels that were pre-COVID as we enter into spring '21, we're still taking a cautious approach. But I think that, that spring '21 starts to get to -- start -- with all things holding, start to get us back to that exit rate that we saw before we went into COVID. That said, there's a lot of uncertainty in the market, but we feel good about our position today, Matt. Our inventories are clean, we're keeping them that way. We're happy with our sell-out that we're seeing in the environment. But obviously, the environment has some uncertainty that we're watching."

If you look at our go-to-market strategy going forward, it has a few components. First, we want to focus on key cities, right? And actually, what you'll find in the U.S. is we have a lot of white space opportunities from a key city standpoint. Second is within each of these key cities, we want to make sure we have a balanced omnichannel ecosystem. And likewise here, we believe there are opportunities to rebalance it. So what are the key components of it? First is our DTC. Second is digital commerce, right? And digital commerce is 4 components in our minds. It's RalphLauren.com site, and you've heard Jane talk about all the work we're doing to elevate AUR, strengthen profitability, better connect with consumers moving forward. 
There are pure players, those -- the presence is more limited in the U.S., but that business is developing, obviously, much stronger in Europe and in Asia.
The third area is Wholesale Dot Com, which has very good momentum in the U.S. We're actually very pleased with the progress that we're making with our partners there. We're investing disproportionately additional capabilities with them to further accelerate our performance and enhance our brand presence. 
And fourth is social commerce, which is still nascent. So think of this as Instagram Checkout, for example. We are now available on Instagram Checkout. I think a little anecdote is we're the first home business actually on Instagram Checkout. We expect to see significant growth from these 4 components of digital commerce. 
And then the third element of this plan is the top doors of our wholesale partners. And you've seen further recent announcement that we have further reduced our footprint in wholesale to really focus even more on those top-performing doors where we can both project the brand in a way that's consistent with the image we want to build and also drive the type of profitability that we need to achieve within this space. 
So that's how we're thinking about it. We're going to leverage targeted marketing in order to guide consumers from those parts of the business that we are exiting to bring them into the parts of the business that represent the future of the company. And I have to say, over the past few months, we've ramped up our capabilities in terms of CRM, consumer segmentation, consumer targeting, and we feel quite good about our ability to leverage this as a way to build our business and get back to growth and value creation in the long term."

But I think as you can think about the underlying gross margin expansion, if you look at Q1 in terms of gross margin, about 2/3 of the 730 basis points was almost entirely channel- and geography-related due to COVID impacts. So 1/3 was really driven by pricing and promotions. 
And underneath the covers, if you looked at AUR growth, we had -- our AUR growth in Q3, Q4 and into Q1 was exactly the same. So it's sort of the 8 points that we called out in Q4, continued in -- Q3, Q4, Q1 continued. So we expect gross margin expansion for the year. I do expect there to be some volatility in underlying gross margin as we move through and we move through some inventory management as we cycle through the year, but we are still calling for gross margin expansion for the year, with the benefits going to -- the major benefit going to be pricing and promotion work that we continue to do, the elevation work that we're doing and continued benefits from geography, but they're going to be much less significant than what you saw in Q1. Q1, obviously, because of the impact of COVID, was outstated. 
There are some offsets in terms of FX was a pressure, and I expect that to continue through the year because of our hedge positions. And some of the liquidation and excess that we move to factory has a higher cost, and that has some pressure on gross margin as we move through as well. But those are the dynamics at play. We're very encouraged by our gross margin progress and expect to see it continue."

We had extremely strong AUR, double-digit growth -- AUR growth in Q1, led by AUR growth, very strong in North America and across Europe. So very, very positive and the largest driver. Obviously, with the digital momentum we saw, we also saw SGs -- nice SG&A leverage, especially on our digital commerce sites in EMEA and Asia, where, as we called out, the comps were up in the 40s and over 50% in Asia, so very strong growth, leveraging SG&A. 
We really worked to drive AUR by significantly reducing site-wide promotions. We were down 43 days on the -- to the quarter last year. And the work that we're doing that Patrice called out in terms of personalization and specific consumer targeting and personalization, we're very encouraged by that. And I think that those results are most notable as you look into our EMEA results. 
As you called out, the pressure point in North America for us is our continued work on quality of sales, which has pressured our international or daigou consumers. They were down over very strong double digits, and that was counterbalanced by high-teens growth in our domestic consumers. But as I pull apart the performance differences across region, really, it is that international consumer that is the challenge point in North America. But very encouraged, over 1,000 basis points of profitability improvement, led by gross margin and SG&A improvement across all the channels."

This year, based on our forecast, you will see a continued progression of marketing investment relative to sales compared to the prior year. When we look at how to structure the marketing activities, I think we're becoming even clearer now based on what we're seeing with consumers and what they're responding to, that this two-pronged approach is really working well for us. First element of the plan is really the storytelling around purpose, values-based communication, whether that's Earth Polo, Pride, philanthropic activities that we did recently to support on diversity and inclusions, we're going to continue to drive that. And then coupled with very targeted TRM digital marketing -- and again, the ambition here is to be able to do ultimately one-to-one marketing so that the message you get, the way the site looks when you get on it, is perfectly tailored to you, your profile, your history with us, your centers of interest, and I think we're making good progress there. 
In terms of measurement, which is near and dear to my heart, we've made good progress on a few capabilities. First of all, ROI, obviously, is the first lens that we look at, right? And on some activities, it's easy to calculate, on others, it's a little more complicated. So we couple that with new measurement that we have now on awareness, brand consideration and purchase intent scores, which we're able to track in all of our core markets for ourselves versus the past and versus our competitive set. And I actually feel very good, one, about our ability to measure; and two, about the progress that we are making based on what we saw this past quarter on all 3 of those metrics."

The past few months have marked a period of extraordinary challenge, but also resilience, agility and hope. Our financial performance this quarter reflects an unprecedented 3 months of COVID-19-related impact around the world. We're taking the opportunity to leverage this period of disruption to accelerate our core strategic focus areas, drive new areas of growth and realign our resources accordingly.  
Building on the strong foundational work our teams had done prior to COVID, over the past 3 months, they have executed with incredible agility and speed to strengthen our connected retail capabilities, further rationalize our North America brick-and-mortar wholesale presence and continue to build our brand through personalized consumer engagement and more values-based messaging, all while pursuing our brand elevation journey, as evidenced by our strong AUR and gross margin progress.  
Since Ralph started our company more than 50 years ago, his focus on the long term, on the spirit of timelessness, has enabled us to not only survive times of uncertainty but drive lasting, authentic connections with our consumers. To that end, we have a responsibility that goes well beyond the products we sell. And I first want to take a moment to address the persistent systemic racial injustice in the U.S. and around the world. We've been listening to our teams and a few of the many actions we've taken over the past couple of months include: One, we committed to elevate more Black and African-American talent into our leadership ranks. We will interview 2 underrepresented candidates for every open leadership role, and we are committing to ensure that people of color represent at least 20% of our global leadership team by 2023.  
Two, we're examining how we portray the American dream in the stories we tell, the creators we champion and the faces we elevate. And we've also undertaken a review of our marketing and media partners to ensure that these channels operate in a way that aligns with our values.  
And three, we're instituting a set of diversity expectations for our partners and vendors to hold our network accountable as well. This is only the beginning. And on behalf of our entire leadership team, Ralph and I want to be clear to our Black and African-American colleagues and people of color both in our company and in our communities, we hear you, we stand with you, and we commit to do better by you.  
Moving to COVID. We experienced our first full quarter of impact from the pandemic in Q1, with widespread store closures across all 3 regions. In this difficult environment, our teams launched several new digital initiatives, accelerated new customer acquisition and delivered compelling engagement and product categories that resonate with consumers today, all while meaningfully reducing our expenses. As I've said before, our objective is to emerge from this period stronger than we came into it. We are constantly learning and taking action to ensure we not only endure through this crisis but are positioned to thrive long term.  
I'll start with an update on our path to recovery in each region. Following our store closures late in the fourth quarter of fiscal '20, our doors were closed an additional 8 to 10 weeks across many of our largest markets in Q1. This drove a 57% comp decline in the first quarter, slightly better than our expectations.  
By region, the largest declines were in North America and Europe, where stores were closed the longest on average with brick-and-mortar comps down more than 70% in each region. Asia comps were down 33%. Earlier recovery in Korea and Mainland China was more than offset by closures in Japan, our largest market in Asia, where the government drove shutdowns in early April.  
By channel, the path to recovery in each region has been led by our digital businesses, where we resumed targeted consumer marketing and accelerated our online capabilities while stores were closed. Own digital comps were positive in all regions this quarter, led by 68% growth in Asia and 44% growth in Europe. North America also returned to positive digital comps.  
Global momentum in our digital channels was followed by our store reopenings across geographies. As of today, we are pleased to report that nearly all of our stores are open in Asia, Europe and North America. But we are watching resurgences closely, and our priority remains the health and safety of our teams and our consumers.  
As stores reopened, we experienced significant traffic and comp declines initially, but strong growth in conversion rates and average basket size. In the weeks that followed, we saw sequential improvement in brick-and-mortar traffic and comps, although both metrics were still negative as we exited the quarter. Our Europe and North America comp declines in June were roughly half the rate we experienced in April. And Asia comps improved for more than 50% declines in April to a single-digit decline in June.  
While we remain cautious on the pace of recovery as COVID continues to develop around the world, we are encouraged by our progress this quarter on our long-term journey of brand elevation. Enabled by our inventory discipline pre-COVID and early actions taken since the start of the pandemic, we generated double-digit AUR growth and significantly lower discount rates in our own retail channels in Q1. We also drove lower markdown allowances at wholesale, which brings me to our wholesale performance through COVID.  
We have experienced a similar trajectory to our own stores, with our wholesale brick-and-mortar partners closed for a comparable period in the quarter. On a sell-out basis, we've seen encouraging sequential improvement led again by strong growth in digital. At brick-and-mortar wholesale, our sell-out declines have moderated on a month-by-month basis, though we're still down double digits in June.  
As we noted on our last call, we're taking a number of key actions to ensure that this channel is well positioned as we emerge from the crisis. First, on a sell-in basis, we stopped shipping Spring/Summer products to nearly all wholesale accounts in March. This enabled our partners to continue selling through products received prior to closures, while preventing the buildup of excess inventories in the channel.  
Second, we also proactively reduced our Fall/Holiday orders by 2/3 at the start of COVID in order to reintegrate existing product into upcoming collections. While we continue to diligently manage our inventories through the pandemic, we've selectively filled in key programs to ensure appropriate seasonal assortments. And as of June, we resumed shipping of very limited quantities of replenishment product and are working with our partners to take a carefully monitored approach to Fall/Holiday. While these reductions are driving significant declines in our first half sell-in to wholesale, they are a critical step to realign our inventories to expected demand and continue enabling our strategy of brand elevation.  
And third, we're utilizing this period to accelerate shifts in our wholesale distribution, particularly in North America brick-and-mortar. Working with our partners, we exited more than 200 lower-performing wholesale doors this spring in order to focus on our most productive locations. While these closures represent less than 5% of our sales to the channel, we are working to not only recapture these sales but also grow share in our remaining businesses. This is a two-pronged approach focused on increasing productivity in the brick-and-mortar doors we are moving forward with and deliberately shifting sales towards digital. To this end, we are activating highly targeted marketing aimed at relevant wholesale consumers, a program we successfully tested prior to COVID.  
That takes us to my next update, leading with digital. Through the pandemic, we have accelerated the rollout of connected retail programs and leveraged high-impact digital marketing as we shift toward a true omnichannel model. New connected retail capabilities in the quarter included Find In Store, virtual selling appointments, live stream selling, digital catalogs and expanded Buy Online-Ship From Store. Consumer response to these initiatives has been encouraging so far. In North America factory stores, for example, virtual appointments have driven double the spend versus our average consumer transaction.  
We also continued to roll out targeted personalized consumer engagement including tailored marketing and promotional offers. This will enable us to drive more effective marketing, along with a lower level of overall promotions and better product recommendations over time.  
While I'm energized by these successful rollouts in the midst of COVID, there remains a lot of opportunity to deepen and expand our digital connectivity and omnichannel capabilities. We will also continue to digitize how we work. This includes the adoption of virtual showrooms, which we successfully rolled out for men's Purple Label last month, and continuing to expand our digital product creation.  
Turning now to our marketing and brand-elevation journey through COVID. Since the start of our Next Great Chapter plan in fiscal '19, we've added an average of more than 5 million new consumers per year to our brands through our direct-to-consumer channels alone. This is consistent with our plan to win over a new generation, and we believe we have an opportunity to take share in this environment.  
In the first quarter, we resumed marketing activities. These included targeted e-mail campaigns with predictive AI and high-reach paid social media aimed at acquiring new consumers, driving traffic and conversion to our channels. And through our campaigns like RL @ Home and Pride, we continue to tap into our authentic values like optimism, quality and togetherness, which are especially relevant in the current context. These initiatives have resonated well with consumers. Globally, our brand awareness and purchase intent have accelerated since the start of the pandemic. And our total social media followers reached nearly 44 million in the first quarter, a 9% increase to last year, led by double-digit growth on Instagram and TikTok.  
Critically, we have also continued our work to both elevate and protect the health and integrity of our brands through the current crisis, consistent with our long-term strategy. These actions include: one, reducing our total penetration in off-price and bottom wholesale brick-and-mortar doors while driving faster growth in our direct-to-consumer and Wholesale Dot Com businesses; two, staying disciplined on inventories to reduce the need for discounting and heavy promotions; and three, we've continued improving our product offering and resetting our price value proposition across each channel in the marketplace. We were encouraged that underlying AUR growth outperformed our expectations this quarter, reflecting our continued brand elevation efforts, reductions in promotional activity and strategic price increases.  
Moving on to our initiative to operate with discipline to fuel growth. A key element of our long-term plan has been to balance growth with productivity, which includes driving a culture of cost discipline and working in new ways across our organization. Since the start of the pandemic, we have made hard choices to reduce near-term expenses so we can emerge from this crisis stronger than we came into it, and pivot quickly back to growth. We're also in the process of reassessing our long-term operating structure to align our resourcing and investments to our strategic priorities and the shifting retail landscape, while also building more flexibility into our cost structure. Jane will discuss this in more detail in a moment.  
And lastly, I want to highlight the continued importance of our journey to integrate citizenship and sustainability across our business. We were proud that Parity.org recently named us among the best companies for women to advance. And I hope you've all had a chance to check out our annual Design the Change report published this June. The report delineates clear target dates around our commitments, new science-based greenhouse gas-reduction targets and our new commitments to reducing water consumption across our value chain, in partnership with the World Wildlife Fund.  
In closing, Ralph and I are proud of and grateful for the dedication, commitment and agility our teams are demonstrating as we navigate through highly challenging conditions around the world. I've said this before, but I still strongly believe this crisis is creating opportunities for our business to emerge leaner, more nimble and ultimately take market share. We are using this time to proactively deliver the products, channels and authentic brand connections that consumers crave in this rapidly evolving environment.  
And while the effects of the pandemic appear to be far from over, we have strong foundations in place to manage through the continued uncertainty, including remote and flexible working, new connected retailing capabilities, a strong digital marketing proposition and a clear inventory management strategy. And we are privileged to have one of the greatest assets of all, the strength of our timeless global brand, which we will steadfastly protect and build through this period and beyond.  
And before I hand it off to Jane, I'd like to extend a warm welcome to Darren Walker, who joined our Board of Directors last week. Currently the President and CEO of the Ford Foundation, we believe Darren's experience in philanthropy and business will not only complement our Board's existing expertise but will bring important new perspective. I'd also like to thank departing directors Joyce Brown and Robert Wright for their leadership and valued contributions to the company over many years.  
With that, I'll turn it over to Jane to discuss our financial results, and I'll join her at the end to answer your questions."

This quarter was undoubtedly one of the most challenging periods in our company's history. All of our reportable regions and physical channels faced retail closures and consumer self-distancing on a mass scale. As we started reopening stores with new safety protocols, reduced hours and capacity restrictions, consumers remained cautious as expected, but we were encouraged by the sequential improvements across each region.  
During the quarter, we continued to leverage our key strengths starting with our balance sheet, which is a real competitive advantage through this crisis and gives us the flexibility to continue to execute our plan and elevate our brand.  
We ended the first quarter with $2.7 billion in cash and investments and $1.9 billion in total debt, which compared to $2 billion in cash and investments and $692 million in debt at the end of last year's first quarter. Building on our actions in Q4, we took additional precautionary measures to preserve cash and strengthen liquidity in the first quarter. These actions included: first, the issuance of $1.25 billion in debt in June, with proceeds going towards the paydown of our revolver, August 2020 notes and the remainder held for general corporate purposes as we continue to manage through COVID; second, we continue to reduce our costs to align to our top line and better align with our long-term strategy, with first quarter SG&A down 30% to last year; third, we reduced our wholesale footprint by more than 200 doors this quarter, and we'll continue evaluating our presence as we move forward. We also worked closely with our wholesale partners to reduce our outstanding receivables by more than half since the start of the crisis.  
In addition, we have improved our working capital and cash conversion cycle from the start of the crisis through a combination of lower accounts receivable and extended days payable, despite the challenging global retail conditions.  
Second, we are aligning our resources to support future growth and profitability as we accelerate our core strategic focus areas. As a part of this, we are in the process of determining the right organizational and operating structures to support this growth.  
Our work will focus on 6 key areas: team organizational structures and capabilities; enterprise-wide processes and new ways of working; our distribution center and corporate office footprint; our own DTC and wholesale door presence as we assess the role of each store within the ecosystem; all discretionary expenses such as travel and sample costs; and lastly, our brand portfolio. These plans are beginning to take shape, informed by both our growth objectives and the constantly evolving consumer context. And we will share more with you in the coming months.  
Net inventory at the end of the first quarter was down 22% to last year, with double-digit declines across all regions. Our strong AUR and gross margin performance this quarter gives us confidence that we are taking the right strategic approach to move through excess spring '20 product while also positioning the company for future growth.  
Moving on to our first quarter performance. First quarter revenues declined 66% and on a reported basis and 65% in constant currency. Total direct-to-consumer comps were down 57%, as Patrice mentioned, driven by COVID-related store closures across all regions and gradual recovery rates as doors reopened. The brick-and-mortar comp decline was partially offset by a 13% comp increase in our owned Ralph Lauren digital commerce business, led by strong double-digit growth in Asia and Europe. And more importantly, we accelerated digital profitability with Q1 digital operating margins expanding more than 1,000 basis points in all 3 regions through a combination of higher-quality sales and SG&A leverage.  
With digital representing our fastest-growing channel in the company, driving profitability in this business is not only critical to our long-term margin accretion, but also for our strategy of repositioning RalphLauren.com as our digital flagship or the best expression of our brand online.  
Adjusted gross margin was 71.8% in the first quarter compared to 64.5% last year. Approximately 1/3 of this expansion was driven by our continued improvement in pricing and promotions, while about 2/3 was driven by unusual geographic and channel mix shifts due to COVID. The COVID factors were: First, we reported significantly better top line results in Asia this quarter compared to Europe and North America, which were largely closed during the period. In addition to being the earliest region on the path to recovery from COVID-related impacts, Asia is also our highest gross margin and AUR market across the 3 geographies.  
Second, our gross margin mix benefited from a lower contribution from factory stores and off-price due to physical store closures, combined with a higher relative contribution from full price digital commerce in the period. We expect these mixed distortions to moderate significantly beyond Q1 as our other regions and factory stores have gradually returned to operations. However, we still expect to expand gross margins going forward with improved pricing and promotion continuing to be the most durable driver, along with a more normalized level of geographic and channel mix benefit.  
First quarter AUR growth of 25% exceeded our expectations in a promotional, competitive environment, led by double-digit increases in North America and Europe. Excluding the COVID-related mix impacts just noted, underlying AUR still grew high single digits to last year. This is consistent with our recent trajectory and above the low to mid-single-digit growth we guided for fiscal '21 as we continue to elevate our brands across every touch point, significantly reduced promotional depth and breadth and take targeted pricing increases, particularly in North America.  
SG&A expenses declined 30% to last year, on savings from employee furloughs and store rents as well as lower selling and marketing expenses. Adjusted operating loss for the first quarter was $174 million compared to operating income of $175 million last year. Marketing declined 34% as we shifted some activities later in the year. We also pivoted investment from in-store and event-based engagements toward longer-term brand-building activities focused on digital and our values-based messaging. We still anticipate that SG&A declines will moderate as we move through the year, as we bring an appropriate level of infrastructure and staffing back to support reopened businesses.  
Moving on to segment performance, starting with North America. Revenue decreased 77% to last year. Retail comps declined 64%, driven by a 77% decline in bricks-and-mortar comps while our own digital comps increased 3%. Brick-and-mortar comps were primarily impacted by store closures for a majority of the quarter across the region and in absence of foreign tourist traffic in quarter. In addition, as stores have reopened, we have seen moderate sequential improvement as reduced mall opening hours and restrictions on customer capacity further impact performance.  
Beyond Q1, we continue to plan cautiously, given a high level of uncertainty around broader macro trends as well as evolving consumer behavior. 
AUR for the quarter was up double digits in both our full price and factory stores, driven by reduced promotions and our continued rollout of targeted ticket price increases. Comps in our North America directly operated digital commerce business grew 3% compared to 7% decline in the fourth quarter. Underlying sales to domestic consumers accelerated to high-teens growth in the quarter, while sales to international and daigou customers declined double digits to last year as planned. 
Growth in our domestic traffic and comps improved as we turned performance-driven marketing back on in mid-April, following an initial quiet period due to COVID. Our digital marketing work generated a 65% increase in high-quality new consumers this quarter, driving our full price sales penetration higher.  
These comp gains were tempered by a significant planned reduction in promotions aimed at reducing our lower-margin sales to international customers and driving higher quality of sales overall. As a result, gross margins for our North America digital commerce expanded 500 basis points to last year. Going forward, our plan is to continue driving stronger profitability in this channel, while on the revenue side, balancing strong domestic growth with a steady reduction in sales to international shoppers.  
In North America wholesale, first quarter revenue declined 93% as we paused nearly all shipments to North American wholesale partners, starting in the fourth quarter due to COVID. However, we were encouraged by Wholesale Dot Com's sell-out trends, up mid-teens. Our sellout rates in both Wholesale Dot Com and brick-and-mortar wholesale are significantly outperforming our sell-in as stores reopen. However, we expect further pressure on reported sell-in over the next several quarters as we continue to realign inventories to demand and carefully monitor regional resurgence of the virus. We also continued reducing our penetration to the off-price channel in the quarter.  
Moving on to Europe. First quarter revenue declined 67% on a reported basis and 64% in constant currency. Europe retail comps were down 62% with a 75% decline in our brick-and-mortar stores comp, partly offset by a strong 44% increase in own digital commerce. Across Europe, our brick-and-mortar comps were impacted by COVID-related store closures for about 2/3 of the quarter, similar to North America. However, AUR was up 15% to last year, led by our ongoing efforts to elevate our factory channel. Like North America, we continue to be cautious on the pace of bricks-and-mortar recovery in Europe based on a number of uncertainties.  
Our own digital commerce comps were up 44% in the quarter as we quickly pivoted our marketing, focused on new consumer acquisition and accelerated Buy Online-Ship From Store to leverage store inventories.  
Europe wholesale revenue declined 68% in constant currency, driven by our plan to reduce shipments during COVID to rightsize inventories in the marketplace. However, similar to North America, we saw continued momentum in Wholesale Dot Com and digital pure-play sell-out performance through the period, with strong double-digit growth to last year.  
Turning to Asia. Revenue declined 34% on a reported basis and 32% in constant currency in the first quarter. Asia retail comps were down 33% to last year, with a 35% decline in our brick-and-mortar stores, partly offset by digital comps of 68%. Our performance in Korea and the Chinese Mainland continue to improve throughout the period, with Q1 sales up high single digits and mid-teens to last year, respectively. Japan was the biggest headwind in the quarter, with Q1 sales down nearly 60% on government-mandated store closures in April and May. Since reopening all of our stores in early June, the market appears to be recovering relatively well due to a loyal existing consumer base, largely mitigating pressure from weaker tourism. Other key markets, especially those with high levels of tourism like Hong Kong, are on a more prolonged and variable recovery.  
Overall momentum in our Asia digital businesses continued through the quarter even as stores reopened, driven by strong performance across all key markets and channels, including our own sites, digital pure plays and Wholesale Dot Com. We drove a successful 618 campaign in Mainland China, including our first brand live stream event on Tmall.  
Looking ahead, as we navigate the current environment, we remain first and foremost committed to the safety of our employees, partners and consumers. We continue to suspend guidance due to the high level of uncertainty and evolving situations surrounding COVID-19, including possible resurgences and additional economic shutdowns. Based on the current trends, however, we still expect Q1 to be the most significantly challenged quarter of the year on both the top and bottom line basis. While revenue decline should moderate gradually as we move through the year, we continue to expect second quarter revenues and operating profit to be down meaningfully as well as full year fiscal '21 due to the pandemic and prolonged demand recovery.  
As Patrice mentioned, as we move through the pandemic, we are continuing our strategic focus on elevating our brands and driving profitability as we reposition the company to return to sustainable long-term growth and value creation.  
In closing, we are operating in an incredibly dynamic environment, and our teams are facing the challenge with real agility. We will continue to face headwinds, but our purpose, strategy and objectives are clear. And led by Ralph's enduring vision, we believe our discipline, alongside a clear focus on continuing to elevate our iconic brand, will enable us to emerge from this time in a position of strength.

So listen, we are determined to win in this very dynamic environment. And as I look at our core strategic choices, which you know well, we believe they're broadly still relevant today. But obviously,",545,"Laurent, welcome back and thank you for your question. So listen, we are determined to win in this very dynamic environment. And as I look at our core strategic choices, which you know well, we believe they're broadly still relevant today. But obviously, the landscape is shifting rapidly, and we're proactively evolving our strategy to remain on offense, which includes accelerating certain strategic choices over others. So I thought I'd share a few examples of how our teams are working with agility and resilience to bring all this to life. 
First, on winning over a new generation. We're putting even more emphasis on purpose and values-based communication, and you saw some of that with our Pride campaign recently, coupled with targeted personalized digital marketing which -- both of which are actually resonating quite well with current consumers and new consumers. And you'll remember, our ambition is to get to one-to-one marketing ultimately. 
Within our product assortment, one of the things, I think, that really stands out for Ralph Lauren relative to the number of players in our peer group is the fact that we are a lifestyle brand. We're not attached specifically to one product category or another. We truly have this incredible ability to flex across categories. And so we're leveraging this to put more emphasis on areas that are resonating most with consumers right now. So for example, that is both our focus on the core and also new underdeveloped categories that we're focusing on now like home or loungewear, for example. 
Within our ecosystems, you remember, we're looking to build holistic omnichannel ecosystems in a limited number of big cities around the world. That's our go-to-market strategy. We're putting more emphasis on connected retail and refining how we integrate these capabilities within this ecosystem strategy. So connected retail, if you're familiar with all the capabilities that are available in this space, and I'm actually really pleased with the work our teams have done over the past few weeks and months to ramp up buy online, pick up in store -- Buy Online-Ship From Store, curbside, digital clienteling, virtual appointments, book appointments online and so on. And I think probably the Chinese Mainland situation is probably our best example of bringing all that to life, but it's actually been very energizing to see how this has been expanded across all of our regions. 
Fourth thing I would call out is related to this, actually, is really taking a digital-first lens to everything that we do, whether that applies to how we interact with consumers, how we interact within our teams, virtual showrooms -- we had our first Purple Label virtual showrooms a few weeks ago that was very successful -- or 3D design. 
And then finally, our work to operate with discipline to fuel growth, which is our fifth pillar, obviously doesn't stop here. With the changing environment, we're actively looking at our complete operating structure, where we are allocating resources and where we can drive more flexibility, as Jane mentioned in her prepared remarks. Now of course, all of this work will require reshaping of our organization and footprint to align with these updated and accelerated strategic choices, which we look forward to talking to you more about in the coming months."

Let me try to give you some comments as you think about the next few quarters. 
Like many competitors, we're watching changing regional dynamics and resurgences very carefully. But I think there's a second dynamic at play, which is the cadence of our business recovery, which really ties into our continued strategic focus on elevating our brands and driving quality of sales even during this pandemic. The way we're thinking about it based on what we know today is I think it's reasonable to expect that Q2 revenue will continue to see an improvement, but that our recovery will proceed at a more moderate pace than our Q1 exit rate, where we have the initial benefit of store reopenings. I think the most significant uncontrollable is traffic, where we still expect it to be a pressure point as we move forward, along with the broader macroeconomic environment. However, what we can control are the proactive decisions that we are making to elevate our brands and position them to return to healthy and sustainable growth. Now that will play out on the wholesale side in that we expect our reported sell-in to continue to be heavily pressured as we prioritize healthier sell-out and healthy inventory levels. Our sell-out trends are encouraging thus far, and our inventories were down meaningfully at the end of Q1, but we intend to continue this journey, especially through Q2. 
And on the DTC side, while nearly all of our stores are open, we expect the pace of recovery to be more gradual as we leverage this period to prioritize quality of sales and meaningfully improve profitability in our DTC channels, especially our digital channel where our operating margins expanded by 1,000 basis points in every region in Q1. 
I know that these decisions in the short term will temper the speed of recovery in our reported sales in both DTC and wholesale, but it will better position our brands to return to more normalized trajectory as we move beyond this period. But we're analyzing this day-by-day and really leaning into our strategic choices."

We are, as I said, encouraged by the week-on-week improvements that we saw in Q1, although our trends were still negative as we exited the quarter. And we do expect that indoor and mall environment could remain challenged through the coming quarter. But as we move into Fall/Holiday, we're very clear that we're going to continue to prioritize inventory management, which could be a headwind to sell-out if demand picks up, but is really important for our long-term strategy. But as we expect trends to improve as we move into fall and that we expect to start to close the gap to get to more normalized levels that were pre-COVID as we enter into spring '21, we're still taking a cautious approach. But I think that, that spring '21 starts to get to -- start -- with all things holding, start to get us back to that exit rate that we saw before we went into COVID. That said, there's a lot of uncertainty in the market, but we feel good about our position today, Matt. Our inventories are clean, we're keeping them that way. We're happy with our sell-out that we're seeing in the environment. But obviously, the environment has some uncertainty that we're watching."

If you look at our go-to-market strategy going forward, it has a few components. First, we want to focus on key cities, right? And actually, what you'll find in the U.S. is we have a lot of white space opportunities from a key city standpoint. Second is within each of these key cities, we want to make sure we have a balanced omnichannel ecosystem. And likewise here, we believe there are opportunities to rebalance it. So what are the key components of it? First is our DTC. Second is digital commerce, right? And digital commerce is 4 components in our minds. It's RalphLauren.com site, and you've heard Jane talk about all the work we're doing to elevate AUR, strengthen profitability, better connect with consumers moving forward. 
There are pure players, those -- the presence is more limited in the U.S., but that business is developing, obviously, much stronger in Europe and in Asia.
The third area is Wholesale Dot Com, which has very good momentum in the U.S. We're actually very pleased with the progress that we're making with our partners there. We're investing disproportionately additional capabilities with them to further accelerate our performance and enhance our brand presence. 
And fourth is social commerce, which is still nascent. So think of this as Instagram Checkout, for example. We are now available on Instagram Checkout. I think a little anecdote is we're the first home business actually on Instagram Checkout. We expect to see significant growth from these 4 components of digital commerce. 
And then the third element of this plan is the top doors of our wholesale partners. And you've seen further recent announcement that we have further reduced our footprint in wholesale to really focus even more on those top-performing doors where we can both project the brand in a way that's consistent with the image we want to build and also drive the type of profitability that we need to achieve within this space. 
So that's how we're thinking about it. We're going to leverage targeted marketing in order to guide consumers from those parts of the business that we are exiting to bring them into the parts of the business that represent the future of the company. And I have to say, over the past few months, we've ramped up our capabilities in terms of CRM, consumer segmentation, consumer targeting, and we feel quite good about our ability to leverage this as a way to build our business and get back to growth and value creation in the long term."

But I think as you can think about the underlying gross margin expansion, if you look at Q1 in terms of gross margin, about 2/3 of the 730 basis points was almost entirely channel- and geography-related due to COVID impacts. So 1/3 was really driven by pricing and promotions. 
And underneath the covers, if you looked at AUR growth, we had -- our AUR growth in Q3, Q4 and into Q1 was exactly the same. So it's sort of the 8 points that we called out in Q4, continued in -- Q3, Q4, Q1 continued. So we expect gross margin expansion for the year. I do expect there to be some volatility in underlying gross margin as we move through and we move through some inventory management as we cycle through the year, but we are still calling for gross margin expansion for the year, with the benefits going to -- the major benefit going to be pricing and promotion work that we continue to do, the elevation work that we're doing and continued benefits from geography, but they're going to be much less significant than what you saw in Q1. Q1, obviously, because of the impact of COVID, was outstated. 
There are some offsets in terms of FX was a pressure, and I expect that to continue through the year because of our hedge positions. And some of the liquidation and excess that we move to factory has a higher cost, and that has some pressure on gross margin as we move through as well. But those are the dynamics at play. We're very encouraged by our gross margin progress and expect to see it continue."

Obviously, with the digital momentum we saw, we also saw SGs -- nice SG&A leverage, especially on our digital commerce sites in EMEA and Asia, where, as we called out, the comps were up in the 40s and over 50% in Asia, so very strong growth, leveraging SG&A. 
We really worked to drive AUR by significantly reducing site-wide promotions. We were down 43 days on the -- to the quarter last year. And the work that we're doing that Patrice called out in terms of personalization and specific consumer targeting and personalization, we're very encouraged by that. And I think that those results are most notable as you look into our EMEA results. 
As you called out, the pressure point in North America for us is our continued work on quality of sales, which has pressured our international or daigou consumers. They were down over very strong double digits, and that was counterbalanced by high-teens growth in our domestic consumers. But as I pull apart the performance differences across region, really, it is that international consumer that is the challenge point in North America. But very encouraged, over 1,000 basis points of profitability improvement, led by gross margin and SG&A improvement across all the channels."

This year, based on our forecast, you will see a continued progression of marketing investment relative to sales compared to the prior year. When we look at how to structure the marketing activities, I think we're becoming even clearer now based on what we're seeing with consumers and what they're responding to, that this two-pronged approach is really working well for us. First element of the plan is really the storytelling around purpose, values-based communication, whether that's Earth Polo, Pride, philanthropic activities that we did recently to support on diversity and inclusions, we're going to continue to drive that. And then coupled with very targeted TRM digital marketing -- and again, the ambition here is to be able to do ultimately one-to-one marketing so that the message you get, the way the site looks when you get on it, is perfectly tailored to you, your profile, your history with us, your centers of interest, and I think we're making good progress there. 
In terms of measurement, which is near and dear to my heart, we've made good progress on a few capabilities. First of all, ROI, obviously, is the first lens that we look at, right? And on some activities, it's easy to calculate, on others, it's a little more complicated. So we couple that with new measurement that we have now on awareness, brand consideration and purchase intent scores, which we're able to track in all of our core markets for ourselves versus the past and versus our competitive set. And I actually feel very good, one, about our ability to measure; and two, about the progress that we are making based on what we saw this past quarter on all 3 of those metrics."

The past few months have marked a period of extraordinary challenge, but also resilience, agility and hope. Our financial performance this quarter reflects an unprecedented 3 months of COVID-19-related impact around the world. We're taking the opportunity to leverage this period of disruption to accelerate our core strategic focus areas, drive new areas of growth and realign our resources accordingly.  
Building on the strong foundational work our teams had done prior to COVID, over the past 3 months, they have executed with incredible agility and speed to strengthen our connected retail capabilities, further rationalize our North America brick-and-mortar wholesale presence and continue to build our brand through personalized consumer engagement and more values-based messaging, all while pursuing our brand elevation journey, as evidenced by our strong AUR and gross margin progress.  
Since Ralph started our company more than 50 years ago, his focus on the long term, on the spirit of timelessness, has enabled us to not only survive times of uncertainty but drive lasting, authentic connections with our consumers. To that end, we have a responsibility that goes well beyond the products we sell. And I first want to take a moment to address the persistent systemic racial injustice in the U.S. and around the world. We've been listening to our teams and a few of the many actions we've taken over the past couple of months include: One, we committed to elevate more Black and African-American talent into our leadership ranks. We will interview 2 underrepresented candidates for every open leadership role, and we are committing to ensure that people of color represent at least 20% of our global leadership team by 2023.  
Two, we're examining how we portray the American dream in the stories we tell, the creators we champion and the faces we elevate. And we've also undertaken a review of our marketing and media partners to ensure that these channels operate in a way that aligns with our values.  
And three, we're instituting a set of diversity expectations for our partners and vendors to hold our network accountable as well. This is only the beginning. And on behalf of our entire leadership team, Ralph and I want to be clear to our Black and African-American colleagues and people of color both in our company and in our communities, we hear you, we stand with you, and we commit to do better by you.  
Moving to COVID. We experienced our first full quarter of impact from the pandemic in Q1, with widespread store closures across all 3 regions. In this difficult environment, our teams launched several new digital initiatives, accelerated new customer acquisition and delivered compelling engagement and product categories that resonate with consumers today, all while meaningfully reducing our expenses. As I've said before, our objective is to emerge from this period stronger than we came into it. We are constantly learning and taking action to ensure we not only endure through this crisis but are positioned to thrive long term.  
I'll start with an update on our path to recovery in each region. Following our store closures late in the fourth quarter of fiscal '20, our doors were closed an additional 8 to 10 weeks across many of our largest markets in Q1. This drove a 57% comp decline in the first quarter, slightly better than our expectations.  
By region, the largest declines were in North America and Europe, where stores were closed the longest on average with brick-and-mortar comps down more than 70% in each region. Asia comps were down 33%. Earlier recovery in Korea and Mainland China was more than offset by closures in Japan, our largest market in Asia, where the government drove shutdowns in early April.  
By channel, the path to recovery in each region has been led by our digital businesses, where we resumed targeted consumer marketing and accelerated our online capabilities while stores were closed. Own digital comps were positive in all regions this quarter, led by 68% growth in Asia and 44% growth in Europe. North America also returned to positive digital comps.  
Global momentum in our digital channels was followed by our store reopenings across geographies. As of today, we are pleased to report that nearly all of our stores are open in Asia, Europe and North America. But we are watching resurgences closely, and our priority remains the health and safety of our teams and our consumers.  
As stores reopened, we experienced significant traffic and comp declines initially, but strong growth in conversion rates and average basket size. In the weeks that followed, we saw sequential improvement in brick-and-mortar traffic and comps, although both metrics were still negative as we exited the quarter. Our Europe and North America comp declines in June were roughly half the rate we experienced in April. And Asia comps improved for more than 50% declines in April to a single-digit decline in June.  
While we remain cautious on the pace of recovery as COVID continues to develop around the world, we are encouraged by our progress this quarter on our long-term journey of brand elevation. Enabled by our inventory discipline pre-COVID and early actions taken since the start of the pandemic, we generated double-digit AUR growth and significantly lower discount rates in our own retail channels in Q1. We also drove lower markdown allowances at wholesale, which brings me to our wholesale performance through COVID.  
We have experienced a similar trajectory to our own stores, with our wholesale brick-and-mortar partners closed for a comparable period in the quarter. On a sell-out basis, we've seen encouraging sequential improvement led again by strong growth in digital. At brick-and-mortar wholesale, our sell-out declines have moderated on a month-by-month basis, though we're still down double digits in June.  
As we noted on our last call, we're taking a number of key actions to ensure that this channel is well positioned as we emerge from the crisis. First, on a sell-in basis, we stopped shipping Spring/Summer products to nearly all wholesale accounts in March. This enabled our partners to continue selling through products received prior to closures, while preventing the buildup of excess inventories in the channel.  
Second, we also proactively reduced our Fall/Holiday orders by 2/3 at the start of COVID in order to reintegrate existing product into upcoming collections. While we continue to diligently manage our inventories through the pandemic, we've selectively filled in key programs to ensure appropriate seasonal assortments. And as of June, we resumed shipping of very limited quantities of replenishment product and are working with our partners to take a carefully monitored approach to Fall/Holiday. While these reductions are driving significant declines in our first half sell-in to wholesale, they are a critical step to realign our inventories to expected demand and continue enabling our strategy of brand elevation.  
And third, we're utilizing this period to accelerate shifts in our wholesale distribution, particularly in North America brick-and-mortar. Working with our partners, we exited more than 200 lower-performing wholesale doors this spring in order to focus on our most productive locations. While these closures represent less than 5% of our sales to the channel, we are working to not only recapture these sales but also grow share in our remaining businesses. This is a two-pronged approach focused on increasing productivity in the brick-and-mortar doors we are moving forward with and deliberately shifting sales towards digital. To this end, we are activating highly targeted marketing aimed at relevant wholesale consumers, a program we successfully tested prior to COVID.  
That takes us to my next update, leading with digital. Through the pandemic, we have accelerated the rollout of connected retail programs and leveraged high-impact digital marketing as we shift toward a true omnichannel model. New connected retail capabilities in the quarter included Find In Store, virtual selling appointments, live stream selling, digital catalogs and expanded Buy Online-Ship From Store. Consumer response to these initiatives has been encouraging so far. In North America factory stores, for example, virtual appointments have driven double the spend versus our average consumer transaction.  
We also continued to roll out targeted personalized consumer engagement including tailored marketing and promotional offers. This will enable us to drive more effective marketing, along with a lower level of overall promotions and better product recommendations over time.  
While I'm energized by these successful rollouts in the midst of COVID, there remains a lot of opportunity to deepen and expand our digital connectivity and omnichannel capabilities. We will also continue to digitize how we work. This includes the adoption of virtual showrooms, which we successfully rolled out for men's Purple Label last month, and continuing to expand our digital product creation.  
Turning now to our marketing and brand-elevation journey through COVID. Since the start of our Next Great Chapter plan in fiscal '19, we've added an average of more than 5 million new consumers per year to our brands through our direct-to-consumer channels alone. This is consistent with our plan to win over a new generation, and we believe we have an opportunity to take share in this environment.  
In the first quarter, we resumed marketing activities. These included targeted e-mail campaigns with predictive AI and high-reach paid social media aimed at acquiring new consumers, driving traffic and conversion to our channels. And through our campaigns like RL @ Home and Pride, we continue to tap into our authentic values like optimism, quality and togetherness, which are especially relevant in the current context. These initiatives have resonated well with consumers. Globally, our brand awareness and purchase intent have accelerated since the start of the pandemic. And our total social media followers reached nearly 44 million in the first quarter, a 9% increase to last year, led by double-digit growth on Instagram and TikTok.  
Critically, we have also continued our work to both elevate and protect the health and integrity of our brands through the current crisis, consistent with our long-term strategy. These actions include: one, reducing our total penetration in off-price and bottom wholesale brick-and-mortar doors while driving faster growth in our direct-to-consumer and Wholesale Dot Com businesses; two, staying disciplined on inventories to reduce the need for discounting and heavy promotions; and three, we've continued improving our product offering and resetting our price value proposition across each channel in the marketplace. We were encouraged that underlying AUR growth outperformed our expectations this quarter, reflecting our continued brand elevation efforts, reductions in promotional activity and strategic price increases.  
Moving on to our initiative to operate with discipline to fuel growth. A key element of our long-term plan has been to balance growth with productivity, which includes driving a culture of cost discipline and working in new ways across our organization. Since the start of the pandemic, we have made hard choices to reduce near-term expenses so we can emerge from this crisis stronger than we came into it, and pivot quickly back to growth. We're also in the process of reassessing our long-term operating structure to align our resourcing and investments to our strategic priorities and the shifting retail landscape, while also building more flexibility into our cost structure. Jane will discuss this in more detail in a moment.  
And lastly, I want to highlight the continued importance of our journey to integrate citizenship and sustainability across our business. We were proud that Parity.org recently named us among the best companies for women to advance. And I hope you've all had a chance to check out our annual Design the Change report published this June. The report delineates clear target dates around our commitments, new science-based greenhouse gas-reduction targets and our new commitments to reducing water consumption across our value chain, in partnership with the World Wildlife Fund.  
In closing, Ralph and I are proud of and grateful for the dedication, commitment and agility our teams are demonstrating as we navigate through highly challenging conditions around the world. I've said this before, but I still strongly believe this crisis is creating opportunities for our business to emerge leaner, more nimble and ultimately take market share. We are using this time to proactively deliver the products, channels and authentic brand connections that consumers crave in this rapidly evolving environment.  
And while the effects of the pandemic appear to be far from over, we have strong foundations in place to manage through the continued uncertainty, including remote and flexible working, new connected retailing capabilities, a strong digital marketing proposition and a clear inventory management strategy. And we are privileged to have one of the greatest assets of all, the strength of our timeless global brand, which we will steadfastly protect and build through this period and beyond.  
And before I hand it off to Jane, I'd like to extend a warm welcome to Darren Walker, who joined our Board of Directors last week. Currently the President and CEO of the Ford Foundation, we believe Darren's experience in philanthropy and business will not only complement our Board's existing expertise but will bring important new perspective. I'd also like to thank departing directors Joyce Brown and Robert Wright for their leadership and valued contributions to the company over many years.  
With that, I'll turn it over to Jane to discuss our financial results, and I'll join her at the end to answer your questions."

This quarter was undoubtedly one of the most challenging periods in our company's history. All of our reportable regions and physical channels faced retail closures and consumer self-distancing on a mass scale. As we started reopening stores with new safety protocols, reduced hours and capacity restrictions, consumers remained cautious as expected, but we were encouraged by the sequential improvements across each region.  
During the quarter, we continued to leverage our key strengths starting with our balance sheet, which is a real competitive advantage through this crisis and gives us the flexibility to continue to execute our plan and elevate our brand.  
We ended the first quarter with $2.7 billion in cash and investments and $1.9 billion in total debt, which compared to $2 billion in cash and investments and $692 million in debt at the end of last year's first quarter. Building on our actions in Q4, we took additional precautionary measures to preserve cash and strengthen liquidity in the first quarter. These actions included: first, the issuance of $1.25 billion in debt in June, with proceeds going towards the paydown of our revolver, August 2020 notes and the remainder held for general corporate purposes as we continue to manage through COVID; second, we continue to reduce our costs to align to our top line and better align with our long-term strategy, with first quarter SG&A down 30% to last year; third, we reduced our wholesale footprint by more than 200 doors this quarter, and we'll continue evaluating our presence as we move forward. We also worked closely with our wholesale partners to reduce our outstanding receivables by more than half since the start of the crisis.  
In addition, we have improved our working capital and cash conversion cycle from the start of the crisis through a combination of lower accounts receivable and extended days payable, despite the challenging global retail conditions.  
Second, we are aligning our resources to support future growth and profitability as we accelerate our core strategic focus areas. As a part of this, we are in the process of determining the right organizational and operating structures to support this growth.  
Our work will focus on 6 key areas: team organizational structures and capabilities; enterprise-wide processes and new ways of working; our distribution center and corporate office footprint; our own DTC and wholesale door presence as we assess the role of each store within the ecosystem; all discretionary expenses such as travel and sample costs; and lastly, our brand portfolio. These plans are beginning to take shape, informed by both our growth objectives and the constantly evolving consumer context. And we will share more with you in the coming months.  
Net inventory at the end of the first quarter was down 22% to last year, with double-digit declines across all regions. Our strong AUR and gross margin performance this quarter gives us confidence that we are taking the right strategic approach to move through excess spring '20 product while also positioning the company for future growth.  
Moving on to our first quarter performance. First quarter revenues declined 66% and on a reported basis and 65% in constant currency. Total direct-to-consumer comps were down 57%, as Patrice mentioned, driven by COVID-related store closures across all regions and gradual recovery rates as doors reopened. The brick-and-mortar comp decline was partially offset by a 13% comp increase in our owned Ralph Lauren digital commerce business, led by strong double-digit growth in Asia and Europe. And more importantly, we accelerated digital profitability with Q1 digital operating margins expanding more than 1,000 basis points in all 3 regions through a combination of higher-quality sales and SG&A leverage.  
With digital representing our fastest-growing channel in the company, driving profitability in this business is not only critical to our long-term margin accretion, but also for our strategy of repositioning RalphLauren.com as our digital flagship or the best expression of our brand online.  
Adjusted gross margin was 71.8% in the first quarter compared to 64.5% last year. Approximately 1/3 of this expansion was driven by our continued improvement in pricing and promotions, while about 2/3 was driven by unusual geographic and channel mix shifts due to COVID. The COVID factors were: First, we reported significantly better top line results in Asia this quarter compared to Europe and North America, which were largely closed during the period. In addition to being the earliest region on the path to recovery from COVID-related impacts, Asia is also our highest gross margin and AUR market across the 3 geographies.  
Second, our gross margin mix benefited from a lower contribution from factory stores and off-price due to physical store closures, combined with a higher relative contribution from full price digital commerce in the period. We expect these mixed distortions to moderate significantly beyond Q1 as our other regions and factory stores have gradually returned to operations. However, we still expect to expand gross margins going forward with improved pricing and promotion continuing to be the most durable driver, along with a more normalized level of geographic and channel mix benefit.  
First quarter AUR growth of 25% exceeded our expectations in a promotional, competitive environment, led by double-digit increases in North America and Europe. Excluding the COVID-related mix impacts just noted, underlying AUR still grew high single digits to last year. This is consistent with our recent trajectory and above the low to mid-single-digit growth we guided for fiscal '21 as we continue to elevate our brands across every touch point, significantly reduced promotional depth and breadth and take targeted pricing increases, particularly in North America.  
SG&A expenses declined 30% to last year, on savings from employee furloughs and store rents as well as lower selling and marketing expenses. Adjusted operating loss for the first quarter was $174 million compared to operating income of $175 million last year. Marketing declined 34% as we shifted some activities later in the year. We also pivoted investment from in-store and event-based engagements toward longer-term brand-building activities focused on digital and our values-based messaging. We still anticipate that SG&A declines will moderate as we move through the year, as we bring an appropriate level of infrastructure and staffing back to support reopened businesses.  
Moving on to segment performance, starting with North America. Revenue decreased 77% to last year. Retail comps declined 64%, driven by a 77% decline in bricks-and-mortar comps while our own digital comps increased 3%. Brick-and-mortar comps were primarily impacted by store closures for a majority of the quarter across the region and in absence of foreign tourist traffic in quarter. In addition, as stores have reopened, we have seen moderate sequential improvement as reduced mall opening hours and restrictions on customer capacity further impact performance.  
Beyond Q1, we continue to plan cautiously, given a high level of uncertainty around broader macro trends as well as evolving consumer behavior. 
AUR for the quarter was up double digits in both our full price and factory stores, driven by reduced promotions and our continued rollout of targeted ticket price increases. Comps in our North America directly operated digital commerce business grew 3% compared to 7% decline in the fourth quarter. Underlying sales to domestic consumers accelerated to high-teens growth in the quarter, while sales to international and daigou customers declined double digits to last year as planned. 
Growth in our domestic traffic and comps improved as we turned performance-driven marketing back on in mid-April, following an initial quiet period due to COVID. Our digital marketing work generated a 65% increase in high-quality new consumers this quarter, driving our full price sales penetration higher.  
These comp gains were tempered by a significant planned reduction in promotions aimed at reducing our lower-margin sales to international customers and driving higher quality of sales overall. As a result, gross margins for our North America digital commerce expanded 500 basis points to last year. Going forward, our plan is to continue driving stronger profitability in this channel, while on the revenue side, balancing strong domestic growth with a steady reduction in sales to international shoppers.  
In North America wholesale, first quarter revenue declined 93% as we paused nearly all shipments to North American wholesale partners, starting in the fourth quarter due to COVID. However, we were encouraged by Wholesale Dot Com's sell-out trends, up mid-teens. Our sellout rates in both Wholesale Dot Com and brick-and-mortar wholesale are significantly outperforming our sell-in as stores reopen. However, we expect further pressure on reported sell-in over the next several quarters as we continue to realign inventories to demand and carefully monitor regional resurgence of the virus. We also continued reducing our penetration to the off-price channel in the quarter.  
Moving on to Europe. First quarter revenue declined 67% on a reported basis and 64% in constant currency. Europe retail comps were down 62% with a 75% decline in our brick-and-mortar stores comp, partly offset by a strong 44% increase in own digital commerce. Across Europe, our brick-and-mortar comps were impacted by COVID-related store closures for about 2/3 of the quarter, similar to North America. However, AUR was up 15% to last year, led by our ongoing efforts to elevate our factory channel. Like North America, we continue to be cautious on the pace of bricks-and-mortar recovery in Europe based on a number of uncertainties.  
Our own digital commerce comps were up 44% in the quarter as we quickly pivoted our marketing, focused on new consumer acquisition and accelerated Buy Online-Ship From Store to leverage store inventories.  
Europe wholesale revenue declined 68% in constant currency, driven by our plan to reduce shipments during COVID to rightsize inventories in the marketplace. However, similar to North America, we saw continued momentum in Wholesale Dot Com and digital pure-play sell-out performance through the period, with strong double-digit growth to last year.  
Turning to Asia. Revenue declined 34% on a reported basis and 32% in constant currency in the first quarter. Asia retail comps were down 33% to last year, with a 35% decline in our brick-and-mortar stores, partly offset by digital comps of 68%. Our performance in Korea and the Chinese Mainland continue to improve throughout the period, with Q1 sales up high single digits and mid-teens to last year, respectively. Japan was the biggest headwind in the quarter, with Q1 sales down nearly 60% on government-mandated store closures in April and May. Since reopening all of our stores in early June, the market appears to be recovering relatively well due to a loyal existing consumer base, largely mitigating pressure from weaker tourism. Other key markets, especially those with high levels of tourism like Hong Kong, are on a more prolonged and variable recovery.  
Overall momentum in our Asia digital businesses continued through the quarter even as stores reopened, driven by strong performance across all key markets and channels, including our own sites, digital pure plays and Wholesale Dot Com. We drove a successful 618 campaign in Mainland China, including our first brand live stream event on Tmall.  
Looking ahead, as we navigate the current environment, we remain first and foremost committed to the safety of our employees, partners and consumers. We continue to suspend guidance due to the high level of uncertainty and evolving situations surrounding COVID-19, including possible resurgences and additional economic shutdowns. Based on the current trends, however, we still expect Q1 to be the most significantly challenged quarter of the year on both the top and bottom line basis. While revenue decline should moderate gradually as we move through the year, we continue to expect second quarter revenues and operating profit to be down meaningfully as well as full year fiscal '21 due to the pandemic and prolonged demand recovery.  
As Patrice mentioned, as we move through the pandemic, we are continuing our strategic focus on elevating our brands and driving profitability as we reposition the company to return to sustainable long-term growth and value creation.  
In closing, we are operating in an incredibly dynamic environment, and our teams are facing the challenge with real agility. We will continue to face headwinds, but our purpose, strategy and objectives are clear. And led by Ralph's enduring vision, we believe our discipline, alongside a clear focus on continuing to elevate our iconic brand, will enable us to emerge from this time in a position of strength.  
With that, let's open up the call for your questions."

So listen, we are determined to win in this very dynamic environment. And as I look at our core strategic choices, which you know well, we believe they're broadly still relevant today. But obviously,",545,"Laurent, welcome back and thank you for your question. So listen, we are determined to win in this very dynamic environment. And as I look at our core strategic choices, which you know well, we believe they're broadly still relevant today. But obviously, the landscape is shifting rapidly, and we're proactively evolving our strategy to remain on offense, which includes accelerating certain strategic choices over others. So I thought I'd share a few examples of how our teams are working with agility and resilience to bring all this to life. 
First, on winning over a new generation. We're putting even more emphasis on purpose and values-based communication, and you saw some of that with our Pride campaign recently, coupled with targeted personalized digital marketing which -- both of which are actually resonating quite well with current consumers and new consumers. And you'll remember, our ambition is to get to one-to-one marketing ultimately. 
Within our product assortment, one of the things, I think, that really stands out for Ralph Lauren relative to the number of players in our peer group is the fact that we are a lifestyle brand. We're not attached specifically to one product category or another. We truly have this incredible ability to flex across categories. And so we're leveraging this to put more emphasis on areas that are resonating most with consumers right now. So for example, that is both our focus on the core and also new underdeveloped categories that we're focusing on now like home or loungewear, for example. 
Within our ecosystems, you remember, we're looking to build holistic omnichannel ecosystems in a limited number of big cities around the world. That's our go-to-market strategy. We're putting more emphasis on connected retail and refining how we integrate these capabilities within this ecosystem strategy. So connected retail, if you're familiar with all the capabilities that are available in this space, and I'm actually really pleased with the work our teams have done over the past few weeks and months to ramp up buy online, pick up in store -- Buy Online-Ship From Store, curbside, digital clienteling, virtual appointments, book appointments online and so on. And I think probably the Chinese Mainland situation is probably our best example of bringing all that to life, but it's actually been very energizing to see how this has been expanded across all of our regions. 
Fourth thing I would call out is related to this, actually, is really taking a digital-first lens to everything that we do, whether that applies to how we interact with consumers, how we interact within our teams, virtual showrooms -- we had our first Purple Label virtual showrooms a few weeks ago that was very successful -- or 3D design. 
And then finally, our work to operate with discipline to fuel growth, which is our fifth pillar, obviously doesn't stop here. With the changing environment, we're actively looking at our complete operating structure, where we are allocating resources and where we can drive more flexibility, as Jane mentioned in her prepared remarks. Now of course, all of this work will require reshaping of our organization and footprint to align with these updated and accelerated strategic choices, which we look forward to talking to you more about in the coming months."

Let me try to give you some comments as you think about the next few quarters. 
Like many competitors, we're watching changing regional dynamics and resurgences very carefully. But I think there's a second dynamic at play, which is the cadence of our business recovery, which really ties into our continued strategic focus on elevating our brands and driving quality of sales even during this pandemic. The way we're thinking about it based on what we know today is I think it's reasonable to expect that Q2 revenue will continue to see an improvement, but that our recovery will proceed at a more moderate pace than our Q1 exit rate, where we have the initial benefit of store reopenings. I think the most significant uncontrollable is traffic, where we still expect it to be a pressure point as we move forward, along with the broader macroeconomic environment. However, what we can control are the proactive decisions that we are making to elevate our brands and position them to return to healthy and sustainable growth. Now that will play out on the wholesale side in that we expect our reported sell-in to continue to be heavily pressured as we prioritize healthier sell-out and healthy inventory levels. Our sell-out trends are encouraging thus far, and our inventories were down meaningfully at the end of Q1, but we intend to continue this journey, especially through Q2. 
And on the DTC side, while nearly all of our stores are open, we expect the pace of recovery to be more gradual as we leverage this period to prioritize quality of sales and meaningfully improve profitability in our DTC channels, especially our digital channel where our operating margins expanded by 1,000 basis points in every region in Q1. 
I know that these decisions in the short term will temper the speed of recovery in our reported sales in both DTC and wholesale, but it will better position our brands to return to more normalized trajectory as we move beyond this period. But we're analyzing this day-by-day and really leaning into our strategic choices."

We are, as I said, encouraged by the week-on-week improvements that we saw in Q1, although our trends were still negative as we exited the quarter. And we do expect that indoor and mall environment could remain challenged through the coming quarter. But as we move into Fall/Holiday, we're very clear that we're going to continue to prioritize inventory management, which could be a headwind to sell-out if demand picks up, but is really important for our long-term strategy. But as we expect trends to improve as we move into fall and that we expect to start to close the gap to get to more normalized levels that were pre-COVID as we enter into spring '21, we're still taking a cautious approach. But I think that, that spring '21 starts to get to -- start -- with all things holding, start to get us back to that exit rate that we saw before we went into COVID. That said, there's a lot of uncertainty in the market, but we feel good about our position today, Matt. Our inventories are clean, we're keeping them that way. We're happy with our sell-out that we're seeing in the environment. But obviously, the environment has some uncertainty that we're watching."

If you look at our go-to-market strategy going forward, it has a few components. First, we want to focus on key cities, right? And actually, what you'll find in the U.S. is we have a lot of white space opportunities from a key city standpoint. Second is within each of these key cities, we want to make sure we have a balanced omnichannel ecosystem. And likewise here, we believe there are opportunities to rebalance it. So what are the key components of it? First is our DTC. Second is digital commerce, right? And digital commerce is 4 components in our minds. It's RalphLauren.com site, and you've heard Jane talk about all the work we're doing to elevate AUR, strengthen profitability, better connect with consumers moving forward. 
There are pure players, those -- the presence is more limited in the U.S., but that business is developing, obviously, much stronger in Europe and in Asia.
The third area is Wholesale Dot Com, which has very good momentum in the U.S. We're actually very pleased with the progress that we're making with our partners there. We're investing disproportionately additional capabilities with them to further accelerate our performance and enhance our brand presence. 
And fourth is social commerce, which is still nascent. So think of this as Instagram Checkout, for example. We are now available on Instagram Checkout. I think a little anecdote is we're the first home business actually on Instagram Checkout. We expect to see significant growth from these 4 components of digital commerce. 
And then the third element of this plan is the top doors of our wholesale partners. And you've seen further recent announcement that we have further reduced our footprint in wholesale to really focus even more on those top-performing doors where we can both project the brand in a way that's consistent with the image we want to build and also drive the type of profitability that we need to achieve within this space. 
So that's how we're thinking about it. We're going to leverage targeted marketing in order to guide consumers from those parts of the business that we are exiting to bring them into the parts of the business that represent the future of the company. And I have to say, over the past few months, we've ramped up our capabilities in terms of CRM, consumer segmentation, consumer targeting, and we feel quite good about our ability to leverage this as a way to build our business and get back to growth and value creation in the long term."

But I think as you can think about the underlying gross margin expansion, if you look at Q1 in terms of gross margin, about 2/3 of the 730 basis points was almost entirely channel- and geography-related due to COVID impacts. So 1/3 was really driven by pricing and promotions. 
And underneath the covers, if you looked at AUR growth, we had -- our AUR growth in Q3, Q4 and into Q1 was exactly the same. So it's sort of the 8 points that we called out in Q4, continued in -- Q3, Q4, Q1 continued. So we expect gross margin expansion for the year. I do expect there to be some volatility in underlying gross margin as we move through and we move through some inventory management as we cycle through the year, but we are still calling for gross margin expansion for the year, with the benefits going to -- the major benefit going to be pricing and promotion work that we continue to do, the elevation work that we're doing and continued benefits from geography, but they're going to be much less significant than what you saw in Q1. Q1, obviously, because of the impact of COVID, was outstated. 
There are some offsets in terms of FX was a pressure, and I expect that to continue through the year because of our hedge positions. And some of the liquidation and excess that we move to factory has a higher cost, and that has some pressure on gross margin as we move through as well. But those are the dynamics at play. We're very encouraged by our gross margin progress and expect to see it continue."

So Alex, the #1 driver of profitability across the regions in digital was our progress on AUR. We had extremely strong AUR, double-digit growth -- AUR growth in Q1, led by AUR growth, very strong in North America and across Europe. So very, very positive and the largest driver. Obviously, with the digital momentum we saw, we also saw SGs -- nice SG&A leverage, especially on our digital commerce sites in EMEA and Asia, where, as we called out, the comps were up in the 40s and over 50% in Asia, so very strong growth, leveraging SG&A. 
We really worked to drive AUR by significantly reducing site-wide promotions. We were down 43 days on the -- to the quarter last year. And the work that we're doing that Patrice called out in terms of personalization and specific consumer targeting and personalization, we're very encouraged by that. And I think that those results are most notable as you look into our EMEA results. 
As you called out, the pressure point in North America for us is our continued work on quality of sales, which has pressured our international or daigou consumers. They were down over very strong double digits, and that was counterbalanced by high-teens growth in our domestic consumers. But as I pull apart the performance differences across region, really, it is that international consumer that is the challenge point in North America. But very encouraged, over 1,000 basis points of profitability improvement, led by gross margin and SG&A improvement across all the channels."

That's at the heart of this company, so we want to continue to invest in marketing. You've seen our progress over the past few years, progressing from kind of 3% of sales on our way to at least 5%, and I'd like us to go beyond over time. So we're going to continue that. This year, based on our forecast, you will see a continued progression of marketing investment relative to sales compared to the prior year. When we look at how to structure the marketing activities, I think we're becoming even clearer now based on what we're seeing with consumers and what they're responding to, that this two-pronged approach is really working well for us. First element of the plan is really the storytelling around purpose, values-based communication, whether that's Earth Polo, Pride, philanthropic activities that we did recently to support on diversity and inclusions, we're going to continue to drive that. And then coupled with very targeted TRM digital marketing -- and again, the ambition here is to be able to do ultimately one-to-one marketing so that the message you get, the way the site looks when you get on it, is perfectly tailored to you, your profile, your history with us, your centers of interest, and I think we're making good progress there. 
In terms of measurement, which is near and dear to my heart, we've made good progress on a few capabilities. First of all, ROI, obviously, is the first lens that we look at, right? And on some activities, it's easy to calculate, on others, it's a little more complicated. So we couple that with new measurement that we have now on awareness, brand consideration and purchase intent scores, which we're able to track in all of our core markets for ourselves versus the past and versus our competitive set. And I actually feel very good, one, about our ability to measure; and two, about the progress that we are making based on what we saw this past quarter on all 3 of those metrics."

So I feel good about that, and I think we will be able to navigate this crisis by flexing up and down based on where the consumer is really interested in going. 
As far as portraying the American dream is concerned, absolutely. I think, obviously, all the conversations we've had with our Black African-American colleagues inside the company since the murder of George Floyd and the discussions on racial injustice and systemic racism, along with the conversations we've had with the communities that we operate in, clearly encourage us to evolve how we project the American dream. How do we -- what are the stories that we tell? What are the creators that we portray? How do we show up in a way that's really core to who we are fundamentally from a value standpoint, but evolve the execution to make sure that everywhere we connect with consumers it is relevant in a 2020, 2025 world."

We are finding that this significant intervention is what's needed at this point, so I don't anticipate a major change in the coming months.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. Our second quarter performance reflected solid progress on our path to return to growth.
Our results were overall in line with our expectations with better-than-expected earnings driven by gross and operating margin expansion. 
While COVID-19 is still impacting physical store traffic and consumer behavior, we continue to take proactive measures to get ahead of these shifts and position our business to emerge from this crisis stronger than we came into it. These measures include accelerating our connected retail offerings globally, delivering high-value new customer acquisition, expanding key categories and international markets and realigning our cost structure.
Throughout this period, we remain steadfastly focused on elevating our brand, and we were encouraged that underlying AUR growth outperformed our expectations this quarter, which is reflective of more personalized communications, reductions in promotional activity, geographic, channel and product mix benefit and strategic pricing increases.
This acceleration of core strategies in the quarter remains consistent with the 5 strategic priorities that we laid out as part of our long-term plan. These include: first, win over a new generation of consumers; second, energize core products and accelerate high potential underdeveloped categories; third, drive targeted expansion in our regions and channels; fourth, lead with digital across all activities; and fifth, operate with discipline to fuel growth. I will touch on a few of these areas in a moment.
But first, let me review a few highlights related to our recovery this quarter. Overall, we were encouraged that our performance improved sequentially in each of our geographies led by Asia and across our digital channels globally. 
Nevertheless, while we are confident in our strategy to return to growth, we remain cautious as our path to recovery may not be linear over the next few months, given meaningful traffic headwinds and a significant amount of uncertainty in the global environment. 
Looking across our regions. Asia is the furthest along on the path to recovery.
 This was driven by positive sales in the Chinese Mainland, which returned to pre-COVID growth levels of more than 30% as government restrictions were lifted as well as in Korea.
Strong sequential improvement in our North America and Europe comp trends in the second quarter, and we continue to monitor each of our markets closely, by channel. While our brick-and-mortar performance was still challenged due to store traffic headwinds, we reported solid digital comps in all 3 regions this quarter. This was driven by expanded connected retail offerings and an emphasis on product categories like home and loungewear that are resonating with consumers today, with notably less focus on formal tailored workwear and occasion dressing.
Within our Wholesale business, we were also encouraged by sequential progress across regions this quarter, particularly on a sell-out basis and led by Wholesale Dot Com. Our sell-in continues to improve but is lagging our recovery in direct-to-consumer as planned, as we exited department store doors in the first quarter and focus on prioritizing inventory management in this environment.
This near-term discipline is integral to building price harmonization across our ecosystem and to protecting the elevation and long-term equity of our brands.
Next, I want to spend a moment digging a little deeper into our digital transformation, which cuts across everything we do from how we create the best possible experience for our consumers to new ways of working as a company and with our partners. On the consumer-facing side, the continued acceleration of connected retail is central to our recovery and return to growth.
We now have a comprehensive offering of connected retailing options, enabling our consumers to interact with the world of Ralph Lauren in new and more personal ways. These include virtual client selling and appointment booking, buy online, pick up in store, curbside pickup, mobile checkout and contactless payments
We launched our pilot Ralph Lauren virtual store experience this quarter, bringing our Beverly hills flagship store experience online through a mix of multimedia and augmented reality capabilities. Wherever you are in the world, you can shop and interact with this unique store experience through your device. Along with our expanded connected retail options, we plan to roll out more virtual flagship shopping experiences this holiday and beyond. In addition to our consumer-facing enhancements, we also continue to digitize how we work as an organization. 
This quarter we began to roll out our digital value chain initiative that will streamline how we bring products to market and make it easier for our teams to stay connected and agile. 
Some key components of this include: Implementing 3D digital product creation in virtual fittings, rolling out digital showrooms and expanding our stepwise buying capabilities, enabling us to make purchase decisions closer to market. 
While I am encouraged by the successful rollouts in the midst of COVID, we sell have significant opportunity to continue integrating digital into how we work to enable greater effectiveness and efficiency. 
Turning now to our efforts to win over a new generation. In the second quarter, we continued to ramp up our personalization initiatives, including targeted e-mail campaigns with predictive AI and high reach [indiscernible] for media, helping to drive traffic and conversion to our channels.
 
We added more than 1 million new customers to our direct-to-consumer platforms alone in Q2. And as consumers are learning to live and work in new ways, we are likewise developing new ways of inspiring and engaging them. 
Let me share a few of the highlights from Q2. First, we were the first ever fashion brand to enable consumers to mix and match branded garments inspired by real-life designs on Snapchat through our Ralph Lauren Bitmoji collection. 
Over 10 million users dressed their Bitmoji and Ralph Lauren and tried on the collection over 250 million times this quarter. 
Our 360-degree marketing campaign included influencer and celebrity partnerships with a live stream concert by chance the wrapper from our Chicago flagship and an augmented reality portal on Snapchat. 
Successfully connecting with Gen Z audiences, Ralph Lauren reached leadership share of voice on social media through this launch. We also announced the winner of our Polo designed for good contest in Q2, entitled, Just Let Me Breathe, by artist, Michelle Smith. This was a great example of how we are engaging with our super fans, who submitted their art work for display on an exclusive Polo shirt  with the campaign generating more than 300 million PR impressions. It also connects to our core values, which Ralph established more than 50 years ago when he started this company with all proceeds of the winning shirt going to COVID-19 relief. 
Other high-impact activities to recruit new consumers this quarter included our partnership with the Popular Netflix Show Elite, outfitting BTS' official music video for Dynamite, a campaign supporting the Wimbledon foundation in the absence of this year's tournament and our continued sponsorship of the U.S. open tennis and PGA championships as we further strengthen our position in the world of sports globally.
These initiatives help to deliver an acceleration of our global brand awareness and purchase intent since the start of the pandemic, particularly with next-generation consumers.
And our total social media followers exceeded 44 million in the second quarter, led by our expansion on TikTok as well as double-digit growth on Instagram.
Looking ahead, our upcoming holiday campaigns will focus more than ever before on digital experiences  from the expansion of our virtual stores to our Polo Bear game with a live stream gaming event on Twitch. 
Our campaigns will also feature a much greater emphasis on gifting this holiday across all of our channels.
This represents a key opportunity globally, with 74% of consumers we surveyed recently highlighting Ralph Lauren as a brand that is great for gifting.
 
I also want to touch on our work to operate with discipline to fuel growth. Our ongoing focus on balancing growth with productivity has been an important element of our long-term plan.
And this discipline is even more critical as we make hard choices to realign our cost structure, so we can position the company to emerge from COVID stronger than we came into IT and pivot back to growth.
In the second quarter, we announced the first major action related to our fiscal 2021 strategic realignment plan, the simplification of our organizational structure.
This is designed to enable our teams to move with even greater agility and focus on what matters most, including our digital transformation.
Another element of our strategic review process we discussed last quarter was an assessment of our brand portfolio. Today, we announced that we are transitioning our Chaps business to a fully licensed model.
This shift is consistent with our long-term strategy from several aspects. First, it will enable us to put even greater focus on elevating our core namesake brands in the marketplace.
Second, it will reduce our total direct exposure to the North America brick-and-mortar department store channel, notably the more moderate tiers. And third, this move will create incremental value for the company by setting up chats to deliver on its potential with an experienced partner in the sector that is focused on nurturing the burn.
We are making good progress on our multipronged realignment plan, which gives us increased confidence in our ability to start fiscal '22 strong with the right foundations in place.
Importantly, I also want to take a moment to touch on our ongoing work to integrate citizenship and sustainability into everything we do. 
Q2 marked the kickoff of our participation in the CEO action for ratio equality fellowship, focused on advancing ratio quality and social justice in public policy. 
And the McKinsey Black leadership Academy aimed at developing and empowering our next-generation of black leaders on a global scale. 
On the sustainability front, we were excited to announce a minority investment in natural fiber welding, a leading sustainable material science start-up that has revolutionized the use of natural fibers and reuse of cotton waste into patented high-performance materials.
Our investment will help to expand the market and ecosystem that supports the use of recycled cotton. In closing, Ralph and I want to thank our teams for their incredible resilience, dedication and agility as we continue to navigate through challenging conditions around the world. In this unprecedented environment, we recognize the opportunity to accelerate key strategic priorities and continue to deliver Ralph's iconic vision in an elevated way to all of our consumers across all of our channels.
And before I turn it over to Jane, I want to extend a warm welcome to our newest Board member, Valerie Jarrett, Valerie's breadth of experience across the private and public sectors and unparalleled expertise in government, law and business will bring great perspective to the boardroom. And Ralph and I are confident that her experience and leadership will be invaluable.
With that, I'll turn it over to Jane to discuss our financial results, and I'll join her at the end to answer your questions."

We were encouraged by our team's execution and continued business progress in the second quarter. 
In the midst of a still challenging operating environment, we delivered sequential improvement across all regions, expanded our gross margins through continued AUR growth and brand elevation and reduced expenses across the company.
Importantly, our balance sheet is very strong with $2.4 billion of cash and investments, enhanced by ongoing working capital efficiencies.
At the same time, we continue to invest in our brands and in the channels that matter most to consumers today, notably, an increased emphasis on our digital transformation.
We continue to be cautious about the pace and regional variability of COVID recovery as well as consumer behavior, especially with the rise of restrictions, with the resurgence of COVID cases, notably in Europe. 
We are intensely focused on what we can control in this dynamic context and on positioning the company to accelerate value creation as we emerge from the global pandemics. This includes elevating our powerful lifestyle brands and maintaining a strong balance sheet, while also realigning and streamlining our operational and expense structures. 
To achieve this goal, in September, we announced the first stage of our fiscal '21 strategic realignment plan, designed to support future growth and profitability while creating a sustainable cost structure. 
Our full strategic review process includes the evaluation of our team organizational structures and ways of working, our real estate footprint and related costs across distribution centers, corporate offices and direct-to-consumer retail and wholesale doors and our brand portfolio. 
We announced actions related to the first initiative, reshaping our organization to align to our strategic growth priorities.
These are estimated to result in gross annualized pretax expense savings of approximately $180 million to $200 million.
We anticipate a substantial portion of these savings will flow through to the bottom line beginning in fiscal '22. In connection with the organizational reshaping, we expect to incur a total pretax charge of approximately $160 million. The majority of this charge was recorded in the second quarter.
As Patrice mentioned, we announced today that we are transitioning our North American Chaps menswear and womenswear business to a fully licensed model, starting in the second half of fiscal '22. Although the change is not material, we look forward to updating you on the business transition and progress in the coming months.
Moving on to second quarter performance. Second quarter revenues declined 30% compared to a 66% decline in Q1 with performance across all 3 regions, still adversely impacted by COVID. Total direct-to-consumer comps were down 28%, while global Wholesale revenues declined 37%.  Our bricks-and-mortar comps were down 33% following a 66% decline in the first quarter. AUR improvements were more than offset by traffic declines of more than 40% versus last year and limited store operating hours due to health and safety regulations, consistent with the broader environment.
Looking ahead to holiday, we are proactively working to drive traffic and comps through multiple levers, which include increasing high ROI performance marketing, expanding personalization and social commerce program and leveraging our connected retail capabilities, including new features that will be rolled out for holiday.
Our brick-and-mortar declines were partially offset by a 12% comp increase in our owned Ralph Lauren digital commerce business. And more importantly, our digital profitability continue to improve with Q2 digital operating margins expanding more than 1,000 basis points to last year through a combination of higher quality of sales and SG&A leverage.
With digital representing our fastest-growing channel in the company, driving profitability in this business remains important, not only to our long-term margin accretion, but also to our strategy of repositioning ralphlauren.com as our digital flagship or the best expression of our brand online.
Second quarter AUR growth of 26% was above our expectations, led by double-digit increases in North America and Europe. Excluding the COVID-related mix impact, underlying AUR still grew more than 20% to last year.
This underlying AUR growth represented an acceleration from the first quarter and is above the low to mid single-digit growth we guided to for fiscal '21. 
We plan to drive further AUR growth this year as we elevate our brands across every touch point, significantly reduced promotional depth and duration, drive favorable mix and take targeted pricing increases, particularly in North America. 
Our confidence in this brand elevation strategy is reinforced by our continued improvements in full price penetration rates, basket sizes and better-than-expected conversion, even as we reported higher AUR growth.
Adjusted gross margin was 66.5% in the second quarter, up 500 basis points to last year.
Gross margin expansion was driven by strong AUR improvements and favorable geographic and channel mix shift, as our higher AUR gross margin Asia business recovered faster than North America and Europe.
Approximately 2/3 of our gross margin expansion was driven by our continued global improvements in pricing and promotions, with the remainder driven by mix shifts that were outsized given COVID impacts. 
SG&A expenses declined 19% to last year on savings from employee furloughs, store rents and government subsidies as well as lower selling and marketing expenses. Adjusted operating margin for the second quarter was 12.6%, down 230 basis points to last year.
Marketing declined 31% as COVID canceled or limited the activation of key events like Wimbledon, the U.S. open and Fashion Week.
 
And we shifted some demand creation activities later in the year. We also continue to pivot investments from in-store and event-based engagements toward longer-term brand-building activities focused on digital and our values-based messaging, as Patrice discussed. 
Moving on to segment performance, starting with North America. Revenue decreased 38% to last year. Retail comps declined 32%, driven by a 40% decline in brick-and-mortar comps, while our owned digital comps increased 10%. 
Brick-and-mortar comps were primarily impacted by a steady but measured recovery in retail traffic, including a significant decline in foreign tourist sales in the quarter, consistent with the broader market. 
AUR for the quarter was up over 20%, driven by significantly reduced promotions and our continued rollout of targeted ticket price increases in factory stores. 
Our digital commerce comps accelerated to 10% from 3% growth in the first quarter. Underlying sales to domestic consumers, high teens while sales to international and daigou customers declined double digits to last year, as planned. Stronger sales to domestic consumers were driven by our investments in connected retailing, such as buy online, pickup in-store and expanded personalization and targeted marketing efforts. 
Our digital marketing work generated a 37% increase in new customers this quarter, driving our full-price sales penetration higher. 
Similar to last quarter, these comp gains were tempered by a significant planned reduction in promotions to drive higher quality of sales, while also serving to reduce lower-margin sales to international daigou customers. We reduced our total site-wide promotions by 52 days compared to the prior year period.
As a result, our digital AUR was also up over 20%, and gross margins for North America digital commerce expanded more than 1,000 basis points to last year.
 
Through this fiscal year, our plan is to continue driving stronger profitability in this channel, while on the revenue side, balancing strong domestic growth with a steady reduction in sales to international promotion seeking shoppers. In North America Wholesale, second quarter revenues declined 46% as we continue to manage our shipments carefully and realign inventories to demand. The decline was partially offset by a modest shift in timing of shipments to rebalance inventory before holiday. At the end of Q2, our inventories at Wholesale were clean and well positioned, down more than 40% at North America wholesale. We are encouraged that our sell-out rates in wholesale are still significantly outperforming sell-in. However, we expect further pressure on reported sell-in over the next few quarters, as we continue to manage inventories carefully. 
Moving on to Europe. Second quarter revenue declined 25% on a reported basis and 28% in constant currency. Europe retail comps were down 29%, with a 35% decline in our bricks-and-mortar store comps, partly offset by a strong 26% increase in our owned digital commerce.
 
Across Europe, our bricks-and-mortar comps were impacted by traffic headwinds similar to North America. However, AUR was up over 20% to last year, led by our ongoing strategy to elevate our factory channel. We continue to be cautious on the pace of brick-and-mortar recovery in Europe based on the growing intensity of second waves of COVID, along with other macro uncertainties. 
Strong momentum in our own digital commerce comps  was driven by our new consumer acquisition, up 30%, along with new site functionalities, connected retailing initiatives and enabled by the launch of our new brick-and-mortar -- sorry, new back end OMS platform in the quarter. We were also excited to go live on Farfetch this quarter with a marketing campaign launching in time for holiday.
 
Europe Wholesale revenue declined 27% in constant currency as we continue to limit shipments to reset our inventories to demand. However, we saw continuing momentum in Wholesale Dot Com and digital pure players sell-out performance through the period, with strong double-digit growth to last year, led by key platforms such as About You, ASOs and Zalando. 
Turning to Asia. Revenue declined 7% on a reported basis and 8% in constant currency. Our Asia retail comps improved from a 33% decline in the first quarter to an 11% decline in Q2. 
Brick-and-mortar stores were down 12% partially offset by digital comps up 32%. We are encouraged that growth in the Chinese Mainland is back to pre pre-COVID levels of more than 30%.  However, Japan continued to be the biggest headwind in the quarter, with sales declining 17%, following our store reopenings in early June, the market entered a second wave of COVID cases which impacted our performance, along with weaker tourism. The decline was partially offset by stronger-than-expected growth on our new digital site launched in June.
Other key markets, especially those with higher levels of tourism like Hong Kong continue to be on a more variable and prolonged recovery.
 
Overall, momentum in our agent digital businesses continued through the quarter, driven by a strong performance across all key markets and channels, including our own sites and digital pure plays.
 
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the second quarter with $2.4 billion in cash and investments and $1.6 billion in total debt, which compares to $1.6 billion in cash and investments and $693 million in total debt at the end of last year's second quarter. 
Net inventory declined 12% to last year with double-digit declines in North America and Europe and a 9% increase in Asia. 
While we have taken a highly cautious approach to managing inventories through the pandemic, overall, we were encouraged by our team's ability to merchandise around our core and iconic styles as well as key COVID categories like home and athleisure. 
Our increased agility is also enabling us to shift back into pre-COVID covet categories as consumers return to more normalized trends. Our tightly managed inventories, combined with our strong AUR and gross margin performance through the first half of the year give us increased confidence that we are taking the right strategic approach to move through excess [ Prim 20 ] product, while also positioning the company for sustainable future growth.
 
Meanwhile, our supply chain teams continue to improve our lead times and fast track capabilities to chase potential increases in demand. 
Looking ahead, we continue to plan around a number of demand scenarios, given the high level of uncertainty and evolving situation surrounding COVID-19. 
Based on our assessment of developing business trends and our strategic plans, we want to share some details on how we are thinking directionally about the rest of the fiscal year. 
First, we expect our financial results for both the third quarter and full year fiscal '21 to continue to be adversely impacted by the pandemic and prolonged demand recovery.
 
We expect gross margins to continue expanding in the second half of the year, albeit at a more moderate rate than the first half. Improved pricing and promotion, including targeted consumer messaging  should continue to be the most durable driver. 
Based on our year-to-date progress on our brand elevation strategy, we now expect AUR to grow low double digits this year, exceeding our long-term target of low to mid-single-digit average growth annually. 
We expect these tailwinds to be partly offset by higher production costs in the back half.
 
As we outlined at the start of the pandemic, we plan to clear excess full price merchandise, primarily through our factory channels. We continue to expect declines in operating expenses to moderate with the highest level of dollar spend in the third quarter around holiday. 
Our first half results included onetime benefits from employee furloughs, rent abatements, executive compensation reductions and government subsidies that are not likely to repeat in the second half. 
We also shifted a meaningful portion of marketing investments to the back half of the year to position our business for growth as we emerge from the crisis, with first half marketing expense declining 32% to last year but expected to grow about 10% in the second half.
 
Note that cost savings associated with our organizational realignment and any additional potential actions are expected to begin primarily in fiscal '22. Lastly, our tax rate may be higher and more volatile this year. This is due to impacts from stock compensation and nondeductible items under tax reform as well as limitations on tax benefits from losses eligible for carryback under the Cares Act. 
In closing, guided by our clear purpose and strategy along with the strength of our Timeless brand and Ralph's creative vision, we are encouraged by the progress we have made over the first 2 quarters of the year. 
Our brand elevation is working across every geography. We are accelerating our push into digital, and we are driving even greater cost discipline as we make difficult decisions around realigning our organization and footprint around the world.
While we continue to navigate a highly dynamic global environment, our teams are laser-focused on managing through this period to position the company to return to healthy and sustainable growth. 
And with that, let's open up the call for your questions."

First and foremost, our strength comes from our teams and their incredible dedication, resilience and agility have fueled our progress in -- during these challenging times.Our team's engagement, coupled with a laser",672,"Sure. Well, thanks for your question. First and foremost, our strength comes from our teams and their incredible dedication, resilience and agility have fueled our progress in -- during these challenging times.
Our team's engagement, coupled with a laser focus on strategic priorities and also proactively reducing our exposure to the most structurally challenged parts of our businesses, leads me to actually have great confidence that right now, the fundamentals of the company are actually stronger than when we came into this crisis. 
Let me elaborate on both areas. First, the strategic growth areas, and then I'll talk about how we're tackling the structural headwinds for the company. So strategic growth focus area is really centered on elevating our brand, right? We have 1 of the best brands in the world at hector resiliency and authentic consumer connection during COVID. Our latest read on purchase intent over the past 6 months since the crisis started indicates actually our purchase intent, our brand consideration scores are up versus precrisis. Second point is accelerating digital growth and profitability, right? We've been adding connected retail functionality. We've driven a great focus on personalization in the interaction with our customers and also a strong drive on quality of sales. 
The third area is recruiting high-quality new consumers, bringing in consumers who buy at higher prices and are really at the sweet spot of our general targeting.
And we also saw very strong consumer growth on ralphlauren.com over the past quarter versus prior year. 
Fourth area is driving high potential underdeveloped markets and categories, namely China, outerwear and home. And then finally, it's realigning our organization and cost structure to support our future growth and deliver for the numbers we announced a few weeks ago, at least $180 million of savings. 
So those are the strategic growth focus areas. And then we're really tackling head on the most challenging areas of the business, and I'll quote the top 3. One is our North America  brick-and-mortar wholesale presence; the second is our off-price penetration and the third is the underperformance of our noncore brands. 
So we closed another 200 underperforming North America Wholesale doors over the past few months. If you step back a little bit, Omar, and you look at the past 3-year time frame, we've basically reduced our North America Wholesale, brick-and-mortar presence by over 50%. 
 
We closed more than 50% of doors. We also continued to reduce the penetration of off-price in our business, significantly this past quarter. Likewise, to step back and look at the past 3 year focus and progress, we've reduced the penetration of our off-price business by more than half. 
And then finally, you heard in our prepared remarks, the fact that we are transitioning the Chaps brand, which is roughly $200 million in revenue to a value-accretive, fully licensed model. So although we recognize we're still operating in a highly volatile environment and clearly, yesterday's new restrictions in Europe are unfortunately a good reminder of this, and we will need to continue to manage with agility as we have since the beginning of this pandemic as we kind of work through it. We are focused on strategically positioning the company for long-term growth and value creation. 
Specifically, Omar, to your question on the organization reshaping work that we announced a few weeks ago. So it fits perfectly into the strategic focus areas that we have called out.
We really looked ahead and said, okay, next 3 to 5 years, what are the key growth areas for the company? What are the key capabilities that we need to succeed? And how do we align our organization structure, our ways of working, our investment levels to make sure that we're taking advantage of all these growth factors. And so what you've seen through our announcement for the reshaping work is a reflection of that. And also, of course, the adjustment of our cost structure to reflect the -- where the business is today and where, again, we want to allocate our resources."

We were really encouraged by the progress we saw from Q1 to Q2. 
Now as we think about the future, there is a high degree of uncertainty surrounding the second wave shutdowns. In our assessment, this is the biggest potential impact to second half recovery and is why we continue to plan around a number of demand scenarios. We're obviously encouraged by the recovery in the Chinese Mainland, getting back to pre-COVID levels of growth, but are cautious given the announcements of what we saw in Europe, particularly in France and Germany, and it's the rising case count in North America. 
Given the current dynamics, we're not guiding for when we will return to pre-COVID levels.  We're looking at trends in terms of the challenges in bricks-and-mortar traffic, the tourism trends that will take longer to recover. And the work that Patrice referenced, which is our proactive cleanup of North America distribution, notably in wholesale and in off-price wholesale.
 
And from a timing perspective, obviously, we expected this point that recovery will continue to be led by Asia, followed by Europe and North America, subject to second wave.
 
So we continue -- I think our teams continue to manage agilely through this. We think it's prudent not to give guidance given what's happening in the marketplace today, but we are managing what we can control through the second half. And that's price, AUR, gross margin."

And I believe that our drivers are durable in the third and fourth quarter. And we're very much encouraged by the progress we've made, albeit, I do expect that gross margin expansion is not going to be at the pace that you saw in the first half. 
In terms of the pacing of Wholesale, what we've said is we do expect, given what we see today in terms of the environment that spring '21 will continue to improve from where we're at today. We know that fall '20 was constrained by our proactive inventory management, with inventories down 40% in North America wholesale. We expect this spring sell-in to improve sequentially, but this is going to be a paced recovery. And obviously, our wholesale partners are watching what's happening in North America as carefully as we are. So there's still a bit of uncertainty in that environment, but that's our expectation."

And then the work that we're doing on continuing ground portfolio valuation and real estate would likely flow through in fiscal '22, but closer to year-end in fiscal '22. 
In terms of -- we are focused on margin right now. Some of these actions like moving Chaps to a wholesale model will be helpful from a profitability standpoint.

So Adrienne, on the consumer front, we're actually very excited about the response we're seeing from millennials GMG consumers.

But what we have seen in terms of next-generation performance over the past 2 quarters, there's actually significant progress within the customer base below the age of 35, basically across all 3 regions. Now you would expect that in China because a big chunk of population is there, but we're also seeing that is in Europe and in North America. 
So with the tracking that we now do, we -- I think we've got much greater visibility to that encouraged by the traction. And obviously, we'll continue to fuel it. And you saw in our earnings release that we intend to increase our marketing spending in the back half [ Q3 Q4 ] plus 10% versus last year, a good deal of the activities that will be funded are specifically targeted at the millennial Gen Z population."

Our second quarter performance reflected solid progress on our path to return to growth. Our results were overall in line with our expectations, with better-than-expected earnings driven by gross and operating margin expansion.  
While COVID-19 is still impacting physical store traffic and consumer behavior, we continue to take proactive measures to get ahead of these shifts and position our business to emerge from this crisis stronger than we came into it. These measures include accelerating our connected retail offerings globally, delivering high-value new customer acquisition, expanding key categories and international markets and realigning our cost structure. Throughout this period, we remain steadfastly focused on elevating our brand, and we were encouraged that underlying AUR growth outperformed our expectations this quarter, which is reflective of more personalized communications; reductions in promotional activity; geographic, channel and product mix benefits; and strategic pricing increases. 
This acceleration of core strategies in the quarter remains consistent with the 5 strategic priorities that we laid out as part of our long-term plan. These include: first, win over a new generation of consumers; second, energize core products and accelerate high-potential, underdeveloped categories; third, drive targeted expansion in our regions and channels; fourth, lead with digital across all activities; and fifth, operate with discipline to fuel growth. I will touch on a few of these areas in a moment. But first, let me review a few highlights related to our recovery this quarter. 
Overall, we were encouraged that our performance improved sequentially in each of our geographies, led by Asia, and across our digital channels globally. Nevertheless, while we are confident in our strategy to return to growth, we remain cautious as our path to recovery may not be linear over the next few months, given meaningful traffic headwinds and a significant amount of uncertainty in the global environment. 
Looking across our regions. Asia is the furthest along on the path to recovery. This was driven by positive sales in the Chinese Mainland, which returned to pre-COVID growth levels of more than 30% as government restrictions were lifted, as well as in Korea. Strong sequential improvement in our North America and Europe comp trends in the second quarter, and we continue to monitor each of our markets closely. 
By channel. While our brick-and-mortar performance was still challenged due to store traffic headwinds, we reported solid digital comps in all 3 regions this quarter. This was driven by expanded connected retail offerings and an emphasis on product categories, like home and loungewear, that are resonating with consumers today, with notably less focus on formal, tailored workwear and occasion dressing. 
Within our wholesale business, we were also encouraged by sequential progress across regions this quarter, particularly on a sell-out basis and led by Wholesale Dot Com. Our sell-in continues to improve but is lagging our recovery in direct-to-consumer, as planned, as we exited department store doors in the first quarter and focused on prioritizing inventory management in this environment. This near-term discipline is integral to building price harmonization across our ecosystem and to protecting the elevation and long-term equity of our brands. 
Next, I want to spend a moment digging a little deeper into our digital transformation, which cuts across everything we do, from how we create the best possible experience for our consumers to new ways of working as a company and with our partners. On the consumer-facing side, the continued acceleration of connected retail is central to our recovery and return to growth. We now have a comprehensive offering of connected retailing options, enabling our consumers to interact with the world of Ralph Lauren in new and more personal ways. These include virtual client selling and appointment booking; buy online, pick up in store; curbside pickup; mobile checkout; and contactless payments. 
We launched our pilot Ralph Lauren virtual store experience this quarter, bringing our Beverly Hills flagship store experience online through a mix of multimedia and augmented reality capabilities. Wherever you are in the world, you can shop and interact with this unique store experience through your device. Along with our expanded connected retail options, we plan to roll out more virtual flagship shopping experiences this holiday and beyond. 
In addition to our consumer-facing enhancements, we also continue to digitize how we work as an organization. This quarter we began to roll out our digital value chain initiative that will streamline how we bring products to market and make it easier for our teams to stay connected and agile. Some key components of this include: implementing 3D digital product creation in virtual fittings; rolling out digital showrooms; and expanding our stepwise buying capabilities, enabling us to make purchase decisions closer to market. While I am encouraged by the successful rollouts in the midst of COVID, we still have significant opportunity to continue integrating digital into how we work to enable greater effectiveness and efficiency. 
Turning now to our efforts to win over new generation. In the second quarter, we continued to ramp up our personalization initiatives, including targeted e-mail campaigns with predictive AI and high-reach paid social media, helping to drive traffic and conversion to our channels. 
We added more than 1 million new customers to our direct-to-consumer platforms alone in Q2. And as consumers are learning to live and work in new ways, we are likewise developing new ways of inspiring and engaging them. Let me share a few of the highlights from Q2. First, we were the first-ever fashion brand to enable consumers to mix and match branded garments inspired by real-life designs on Snapchat through our Ralph Lauren Bitmoji collection. Over 10 million users dressed their Bitmoji in Ralph Lauren and tried on the collection over 250 million times this quarter. Our 360-degree marketing campaign included influencer and celebrity partnerships with a live stream concert by chance the wrapper from our Chicago flagship and an augmented reality portal on Snapchat. Successfully connecting with Gen Z audiences, Ralph Lauren reached leadership share of voice on social media through this launch. 
We also announced the winner of our Polo Design for Good contest in Q2, entitled Just Let Me Breathe by artist Michelle Smith. This was a great example of how we are engaging with our superfans, who submitted their art work for display on an exclusive Polo shirt  with the campaign generating more than 300 million PR impressions. It also connects to our core values, which Ralph established more than 50 years ago when he started this company, with all proceeds of the winning shirt going to COVID-19 relief. 
Other high-impact activities to recruit new consumers this quarter included our partnership with the popular Netflix show Elite, outfitting BTS' official music video for Dynamite, a campaign supporting the Wimbledon foundation in the absence of this year's tournament and our continued sponsorship of the US Open Tennis and PGA Championships, as we further strengthen our position in the world of sports globally. These initiatives help to deliver an acceleration of our global brand awareness and purchase intent since the start of the pandemic, particularly with next-generation consumers. And our total social media followers exceeded 44 million in the second quarter, led by our expansion on TikTok as well as double-digit growth on Instagram. 
Looking ahead, our upcoming holiday campaigns will focus more than ever before on digital experiences, from the expansion of our virtual stores to our Polo Bear game with a live stream gaming event on Twitch. Our campaigns will also feature a much greater emphasis on gifting this holiday across all of our channels. This represents a key opportunity globally, with 74% of consumers we surveyed recently highlighting Ralph Lauren as a brand that is great for gifting. 
 
I also want to touch on our work to operate with discipline to fuel growth. Our ongoing focus on balancing growth with productivity has been an important element of our long-term plan. And this discipline is even more critical as we make hard choices to realign our cost structure so we can position the company to emerge from COVID stronger than we came into it and pivot back to growth. In the second quarter, we announced the first major action related to our fiscal 2021 strategic realignment plan, the simplification of our organizational structure. This is designed to enable our teams to move with even greater agility and focus on what matters most, including our digital transformation. 
Another element of our strategic review process we discussed last quarter was an assessment of our brand portfolio. Today, we announced that we are transitioning our Chaps business to a fully licensed model. This shift is consistent with our long-term strategy from several aspects. First, it will enable us to put even greater focus on elevating our core namesake brands in the marketplace; second, it will reduce our total direct exposure to the North America brick-and-mortar department store channel, notably the more moderate tiers; and third, this move will create incremental value for the company by setting up Chaps to deliver on its potential with an experienced partner in the sector that is focused on nurturing the brand. 
We are making good progress on our multipronged realignment plan, which gives us increased confidence in our ability to start fiscal '22 strong with the right foundations in place. 
Importantly, I also want to take a moment to touch on our ongoing work to integrate citizenship and sustainability into everything we do. Q2 marked the kickoff of our participation in the CEO Action for Racial Equality fellowship, focused on advancing racial quality and social justice in public policy, and the McKinsey Black Leadership Academy aimed at developing and empowering our next-generation of black leaders on a global scale.  
On the sustainability front, we were excited to announce a minority investment in Natural Fiber Welding, a leading sustainable material science start-up that has revolutionized the use of natural fibers and reuse of cotton waste into patented high-performance materials. Our investment will help to expand the market and ecosystem that supports the use of recycled cotton. 
In closing, Ralph and I want to thank our teams for their incredible resilience, dedication and agility as we continue to navigate through challenging conditions around the world. In this unprecedented environment, we recognize the opportunity to accelerate key strategic priorities and continue to deliver Ralph's iconic vision in an elevated way to all of our consumers across all of our channels. 
And before I turn it over to Jane, I want to extend a warm welcome to our newest Board member, Valerie Jarrett. Valerie's breadth of experience across the private and public sectors and unparalleled expertise in government, law and business will bring great perspective to the boardroom. And Ralph and I are confident that her experience and leadership will be invaluable. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Jane to discuss our financial results, and I'll join her at the end to answer your questions."

We were encouraged by our team's execution and continued business progress in the second quarter. In the midst of a still challenging operating environment, we delivered sequential improvement across all regions, expanded our gross margins through continued AUR growth and brand elevation and reduced expenses across the company. 
Importantly, our balance sheet is very strong with $2.4 billion of cash and investments, enhanced by ongoing working capital efficiencies. At the same time, we continue to invest in our brands and in the channels that matter most to consumers today, notably, an increased emphasis on our digital transformation.
We continue to be cautious about the pace and regional variability of COVID recovery as well as consumer behavior, especially with the rise of restrictions with the resurgence of COVID cases, notably in Europe. We are intensely focused on what we can control in this dynamic context and on positioning the company to accelerate value creation as we emerge from the global pandemic. This includes elevating our powerful lifestyle brands and maintaining a strong balance sheet, while also realigning and streamlining our operational and expense structures.  
To achieve this goal, in September, we announced the first stage of our fiscal '21 strategic realignment plan, designed to support future growth and profitability while creating a sustainable cost structure. Our full strategic review process includes the evaluation of: our team organizational structures and ways of working; our real estate footprint and related costs across distribution centers, corporate offices and direct-to-consumer retail and wholesale doors; and our brand portfolio.  
We announced actions related to the first initiative, reshaping our organization to align to our strategic growth priorities. These are estimated to result in gross annualized pretax expense savings of approximately $180 million to $200 million. We anticipate a substantial portion of these savings will flow through to the bottom line, beginning in fiscal '22. In connection with the organizational reshaping, we expect to incur a total pretax charge of approximately $160 million. The majority of this charge was recorded in the second quarter. 
As Patrice mentioned, we announced today that we are transitioning our North American Chaps menswear and womenswear business to a fully licensed model, starting in the second half of fiscal '22. Although the change is not material, we look forward to updating you on the business transition and progress in the coming months. 
Moving on to second quarter performance. Second quarter revenues declined 30% compared to a 66% decline in Q1, with performance across all 3 regions still adversely impacted by COVID. Total direct-to-consumer comps were down 28%, while global wholesale revenues declined 37%. Our bricks-and-mortar comps were down 33% following a 66% decline in the first quarter. AUR improvements were more than offset by traffic declines of more than 40% versus last year and limited store operating hours due to health and safety regulations, consistent with the broader environment. 
Looking ahead to holiday, we are proactively working to drive traffic and comps through multiple levers, which include increasing high-ROI performance marketing; expanding personalization and social commerce programs; and leveraging our connected retail capabilities, including new features that will be rolled out for holiday. 
Our brick-and-mortar declines were partially offset by a 12% comp increase in our owned Ralph Lauren digital commerce business. And more importantly, our digital profitability continued to improve, with Q2 digital operating margins expanding more than 1,000 basis points to last year through a combination of higher quality of sales and SG&A leverage. 
With digital representing our fastest-growing channel in the company, driving profitability in this business remains important, not only to our long-term margin accretion but also to our strategy of repositioning ralphlauren.com as our digital flagship or the best expression of our brand online. 
Second quarter AUR growth of 26% was above our expectations, led by double-digit increases in North America and Europe. Excluding the COVID-related mix impact, underlying AUR still grew more than 20% to last year. This underlying AUR growth represented an acceleration from the first quarter and is above the low to mid-single-digit growth we guided to for fiscal '21. We plan to drive further AUR growth this year as we elevate our brands across every touch point; significantly reduce promotional depth and duration; drive favorable mix; and take targeted pricing increases, particularly in North America. Our confidence in this brand-elevation strategy is reinforced by our continued improvements in full-price penetration rates, basket sizes and better-than-expected conversions, even as we reported higher AUR growth. 
Adjusted gross margin was 66.5% in the second quarter, up 500 basis points to last year. Gross margin expansion was driven by strong AUR improvements and favorable geographic and channel mix shift as our higher-AUR-gross-margin Asia business recovered faster than North America and Europe. Approximately 2/3 of our gross margin expansion was driven by our continued global improvements in pricing and promotions, with the remainder driven by mix shifts that were outsized given COVID impacts.  
SG&A expenses declined 19% to last year on savings from employee furloughs, store rents and government subsidies as well as lower selling and marketing expenses. Adjusted operating margin for the second quarter was 12.6%, down 230 basis points to last year. Marketing declined 31%, as COVID canceled or limited the activation of key events like Wimbledon, the U.S. Open and Fashion Week. And we shifted some demand-creation activities later in the year. We also continue to pivot investments from in-store and event-based engagements toward longer-term brand-building activities focused on digital and our values-based messaging, as Patrice discussed.  
Moving on to segment performance, starting with North America. Revenue decreased 38% to last year. Retail comps declined 32%, driven by a 40% decline in brick-and-mortar comps, while our owned digital comps increased 10%. Brick-and-mortar comps were primarily impacted by a steady but measured recovery in retail traffic, including a significant decline in foreign tourist sales in the quarter, consistent with the broader market. AUR for the quarter was up over 20%, driven by significantly reduced promotions and our continued rollout of targeted ticket price increases in factory stores.  
Our digital commerce comps accelerated to 10% from 3% growth in the first quarter. Underlying sales to domestic consumers grew high teens, while sales to international and daigou customers declined double digits to last year, as planned. Stronger sales to domestic consumers were driven by our investments in connected retailing, such as buy online, pickup in-store, and expanded personalization and targeted marketing efforts. Our digital marketing work generated a 37% increase in new customers this quarter, driving our full-price sales penetration higher. Similar to last quarter, these comp gains were tempered by a significant planned reduction in promotions to drive higher quality of sales while also serving to reduce lower-margin sales to international daigou customers. 
We reduced our total site-wide promotions by 52 days compared to the prior year period. As a result, our digital AUR was also up over 20%, and gross margins for North America digital commerce expanded more than 1,000 basis points to last year. Through this fiscal year, our plan is to continue driving stronger profitability in this channel, while, on the revenue side, balancing strong domestic growth with a steady reduction in sales to international promotion-seeking shoppers. 
In North America wholesale, second quarter revenues declined 46% as we continued to manage our shipments carefully and realigned inventories to demand. The decline was partially offset by a modest shift in timing of shipments to rebalance inventory before holiday. At the end of Q2, our inventories at wholesale were clean and well positioned, down more than 40% at North America wholesale. We are encouraged that our sell-out rates in wholesale are still significantly outperforming sell-in. However, we expect further pressure on reported sell-in over the next few quarters as we continue to manage inventories carefully. 
Moving on to Europe. Second quarter revenue declined 25% on a reported basis and 28% in constant currency. Europe retail comps were down 29%, with a 35% decline in our bricks-and-mortar store comps, partly offset by a strong 26% increase in our owned digital commerce. Across Europe, our bricks-and-mortar comps were impacted by traffic headwinds similar to North America. However, AUR was up over 20% to last year, led by our ongoing strategy to elevate our factory channel. We continue to be cautious on the pace of brick-and-mortar recovery in Europe based on the growing intensity of second waves of COVID, along with other macro uncertainties. 
Strong momentum in our owned digital commerce comps  was driven by our new consumer acquisition, up 30%, along with new site functionalities, connected retailing initiatives and enabled by the launch of our new brick-and-mortar -- I'm sorry, new back-end OMS platform in the quarter. We were also excited to go live on FARFETCH this quarter with a marketing campaign launching in time for holiday. 
Europe wholesale revenue declined 27% in constant currency as we continued to limit shipments to reset our inventories to demand. However, we saw continuing momentum in Wholesale Dot Com and digital pure players' sell-out performance through the period, with strong double-digit growth to last year, led by key platforms, such as ABOUT YOU, ASOS and Zalando.  
Turning to Asia. Revenue declined 7% on a reported basis and 8% in constant currency. Our Asia retail comps improved from a 33% decline in the first quarter to an 11% decline in Q2. Brick-and-mortar stores were down 12% partially offset by digital comps, up 32%. 
We are encouraged that growth in the Chinese Mainland is back to pre-COVID levels of more than 30%.  However, Japan continued to be the biggest headwind in the quarter, with sales declining 17%. Following our store reopenings in early June, the market entered a second wave of COVID cases, which impacted our performance, along with weaker tourism. The decline was partially offset by stronger-than-expected growth on our new digital site launched in June. Other key markets, especially those with higher levels of tourism, like Hong Kong, continue to be on a more variable and prolonged recovery. 
Overall, momentum in our Asian digital businesses continued through the quarter, driven by a strong performance across all key markets and channels, including our own sites and digital pure plays. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the second quarter with $2.4 billion in cash and investments and $1.6 billion in total debt, which compares to $1.6 billion in cash and investments and $693 million in total debt at the end of last year's second quarter. 
Net inventory declined 12% to last year, with double-digit declines in North America and Europe and a 9% increase in Asia. While we have taken a highly cautious approach to managing inventories through the pandemic, overall, we were encouraged by our team's ability to merchandise around our core and iconic styles as well as key COVID categories, like home and Athleisure.  
Our increased agility is also enabling us to shift back into pre-COVID categories as consumers return to more normalized trends. Our tightly managed inventories, combined with our strong AUR and gross margin performance through the first half of the year, give us increased confidence that we are taking the right strategic approach to move through excess spring '20 product, while also positioning the company for sustainable future growth. Meanwhile, our supply chain teams continue to improve our lead times and fast-track capabilities to chase potential increases in demand.  
Looking ahead, we continue to plan around a number of demand scenarios, given the high level of uncertainty and evolving situation surrounding COVID-19. Based on our assessment of developing business trends and our strategic plans, we want to share some details on how we are thinking directionally about the rest of the fiscal year. 
First, we expect our financial results for both the third quarter and full year fiscal '21 to continue to be adversely impacted by the pandemic and prolonged demand recovery. We expect gross margins to continue expanding in the second half of the year, albeit at a more moderate rate than the first half. Improved pricing and promotion, including targeted consumer messaging, should continue to be the most durable driver. Based on our year-to-date progress on our brand-elevation strategy, we now expect AUR to grow low double digits this year, exceeding our long-term target of low to mid-single-digit average growth annually. We expect these tailwinds to be partly offset by higher production costs in the back half. As we outlined at the start of the pandemic, we plan to clear excess full-price merchandise, primarily through our factory channels. 
We continue to expect declines in operating expenses to moderate with the highest level of dollar spend in the third quarter around holiday. Our first half results included onetime benefits from employee furloughs, rent abatements, executive compensation reductions and government subsidies that are not likely to repeat in the second half. We also shifted a meaningful portion of marketing investments to the back half of the year to position our business for growth as we emerge from the crisis, with first half marketing expense declining 32% to last year but expected to grow about 10% in the second half. Note that cost savings associated with our organizational realignment and any additional potential actions are expected to begin primarily in fiscal '22. 
Lastly, our tax rate may be higher and more volatile this year. This is due to impacts from stock compensation and nondeductible items under tax reform as well as limitations on tax benefits from losses eligible for carryback under the CARES Act. 
In closing, guided by our clear purpose and strategy along with the strength of our timeless brand and Ralph's creative vision, we are encouraged by the progress we have made over the first 2 quarters of the year. Our brand elevation is working across every geography. We are accelerating our push into digital, and we are driving even greater cost discipline as we make difficult decisions around realigning our organization and footprint around the world. 
While we continue to navigate a highly dynamic global environment, our teams are laser-focused on managing through this period to position the company to return to healthy and sustainable growth.  
And with that, let's open up the call for your questions."

First and foremost, our strength comes from our teams, and their incredible dedication, resilience and agility have fueled our progress in -- during these challenging times. Our team's engagement, coupled with a laser",675,"Sure. Well, thanks for your question. First and foremost, our strength comes from our teams, and their incredible dedication, resilience and agility have fueled our progress in -- during these challenging times. Our team's engagement, coupled with a laser focus on strategic priorities and also proactively reducing our exposure to the most structurally challenged parts of our businesses leads me to actually have great confidence that, right now, the fundamentals of the company are actually stronger than when we came into this crisis. Let me elaborate on both areas, first, the strategic growth areas, and then I'll talk about how we're tackling the structural headwinds for the company. 
So strategic growth focus area is really centered on elevating our brand, right? We have one of the best brands in the world. It has shown resiliency and authentic consumer connection during COVID. Our latest read on purchase intent over the past 6 months since the crisis started indicates actually our purchase intent, our brand consideration scores are up versus precrisis. Second point is accelerating digital growth and profitability, right? We've been adding connected retail functionality, we've driven a great focus on personalization in the interaction with our customers and also a strong drive on quality of sales. The third area is recruiting high-quality new consumers, bringing in consumers who buy at higher prices and are really at the sweet spot of our general targeting. And we also saw very strong consumer growth on ralphlauren.com over the past quarter versus prior year. Fourth area is driving high-potential, underdeveloped markets and categories, namely China outerwear and home. And then finally, it's realigning our organization and cost structure to support our future growth and deliver, per the numbers we announced a few weeks ago, at least $180 million of savings. So those are the strategic growth focus areas. 
And then we're really tackling head on the most challenging areas of the business, and I'll quote the top 3. One is our North America  brick-and-mortar wholesale presence, the second is our off-price penetration, and the third is the underperformance of our noncore brands. So we closed another 200 underperforming North America wholesale doors over the past few months. If you step back a little bit, Omar, and you look at the past 3-year time frame, we've basically reduced our North America wholesale brick-and-mortar presence by over 50%. We've closed more than 50% of our doors. 
We also continued to reduce the penetration of off-price in our business significantly this past quarter. Likewise, if you step back and look at the past 3 year focus and progress, we've reduced the penetration of our off-price business by more than 1/2.  
And then finally, you heard in our prepared remarks the fact that we are transitioning the Chaps brand, which is roughly $200 million in revenue to a value-accretive, fully licensed model. 
So although we recognize we're still operating in a highly volatile environment, and clearly, yesterday's new restrictions in Europe are unfortunately a good reminder of this and we will need to continue to manage with agility, as we have since the beginning of this pandemic as we kind of work through it, we are focused on strategically positioning the company for long-term growth and value creation.  
Specifically, Omar, to your question on the organization reshaping work that we announced a few weeks ago, so it fits perfectly into the strategic focus areas that we have called out. We really looked ahead and said, okay, next 3 to 5 years, what are the key growth areas for the company? What are the key capabilities that we need to succeed? And how do we align our organization structure, our ways of working, our investment levels to make sure that we're taking advantage of all these growth factors? And so what you've seen through our announcement for the org reshaping work is a reflection of that, and also, of course, the adjustment of our cost structure to reflect the -- where the business is today and where, again, we want to allocate our resources."

Matt, from a second half perspective, here's what we were encouraged by in the quarter: we were really encouraged by the progress we saw from Q1 to Q2. Now as we think about the future, there is a high degree of uncertainty surrounding the second wave shutdowns. In our assessment, this is the biggest potential impact to second half recovery and is why we continue to plan around a number of demand scenarios. We're obviously encouraged by the recovery in the Chinese Mainland getting back to pre-COVID levels of growth, but are cautious given the announcements of what we saw in Europe, particularly in France and Germany and the rising case count in North America. 
Given the current dynamics, we're not guiding for when we will return to pre-COVID levels.  We're looking at trends in terms of the challenges in bricks-and-mortar traffic; the tourism trends that will take longer to recover; and the work that Patrice referenced, which is our proactive cleanup of North America distribution, notably in wholesale and in off-price wholesale.
 
And from a timing perspective, obviously, we expect at this point that recovery will continue to be led by Asia, followed by Europe and North America, subject to second wave.
 
So we continue -- I think our teams continue to manage agilely through this. We think it's prudent not to give guidance, given what's happening in the marketplace today. But we are managing what we can control through the second half, and that's price, AUR, gross margin, expense."

And we're very much encouraged by the progress we've made, albeit, I do expect that gross margin expansion is not going to be at the pace that you saw in the first half. 
In terms of the pacing of wholesale, what we've said is we do expect, given what we see today in terms of the environment, that spring '21 will continue to improve from where we're at today. We know that fall '20 was constrained by our proactive inventory management, with inventories down 40% in North America wholesale. We do expect the spring sell-in to improve sequentially, but this is going to be a paced recovery. And obviously, our wholesale partners are watching what's happening in North America as carefully as we are. So there's still a bit of uncertainty in that environment, but that's our expectation."

And then the work that we're doing on continuing brand portfolio evaluation and real estate would likely flow through in fiscal '22, but closer to year-end in fiscal '22. 
In terms of -- we are focused on margin right now. Some of these actions, like moving Chaps to a wholesale model, will be helpful from a profitability standpoint.

So Adrienne, on the consumer front, we're actually very excited about the response we're seeing from millennials/Gen Z consumers. As you know, we have very deliberate actions to appeal to that customer group, whether that's where we show up from a media standpoint; whether that's the type of activity that we have, like our pretty special Bitmoji program; or whether that's the type of influencer that we partner with. But what we have seen in terms of next-generation performance over the past 2 quarters is actually significant progress within the customer base below the age of 35 basically across all 3 regions. Now you would expect that in China because a big chunk of population is there, but we're also seeing that actually in Europe and in North America. 
So with the tracking that we now do, we -- I think we've got much greater visibility to that. Encouraged by the traction, and obviously, we'll continue to fuel it. And you saw in our earnings release that we intend to increase our marketing spending in the back half, so Q3, Q4, plus 10% versus last year. A good deal of the activities that will be funded are specifically targeted at the millennial/Gen Z population."

Our second quarter performance reflected solid progress on our path to return to growth. Our results were overall in line with our expectations, with better-than-expected earnings driven by gross and operating margin expansion.  
While COVID-19 is still impacting physical store traffic and consumer behavior, we continue to take proactive measures to get ahead of these shifts and position our business to emerge from this crisis stronger than we came into it. These measures include accelerating our connected retail offerings globally, delivering high-value new customer acquisition, expanding key categories and international markets and realigning our cost structure. Throughout this period, we remain steadfastly focused on elevating our brand, and we were encouraged that underlying AUR growth outperformed our expectations this quarter, which is reflective of more personalized communications; reductions in promotional activity; geographic, channel and product mix benefits; and strategic pricing increases. 
This acceleration of core strategies in the quarter remains consistent with the 5 strategic priorities that we laid out as part of our long-term plan. These include: first, win over a new generation of consumers; second, energize core products and accelerate high-potential, underdeveloped categories; third, drive targeted expansion in our regions and channels; fourth, lead with digital across all activities; and fifth, operate with discipline to fuel growth. I will touch on a few of these areas in a moment. But first, let me review a few highlights related to our recovery this quarter. 
Overall, we were encouraged that our performance improved sequentially in each of our geographies, led by Asia, and across our digital channels globally. Nevertheless, while we are confident in our strategy to return to growth, we remain cautious as our path to recovery may not be linear over the next few months, given meaningful traffic headwinds and a significant amount of uncertainty in the global environment. 
Looking across our regions. Asia is the furthest along on the path to recovery. This was driven by positive sales in the Chinese Mainland, which returned to pre-COVID growth levels of more than 30% as government restrictions were lifted, as well as in Korea. Strong sequential improvement in our North America and Europe comp trends in the second quarter, and we continue to monitor each of our markets closely. 
By channel. While our brick-and-mortar performance was still challenged due to store traffic headwinds, we reported solid digital comps in all 3 regions this quarter. This was driven by expanded connected retail offerings and an emphasis on product categories, like home and loungewear, that are resonating with consumers today, with notably less focus on formal, tailored workwear and occasion dressing. 
Within our wholesale business, we were also encouraged by sequential progress across regions this quarter, particularly on a sell-out basis and led by Wholesale Dot Com. Our sell-in continues to improve but is lagging our recovery in direct-to-consumer, as planned, as we exited department store doors in the first quarter and focused on prioritizing inventory management in this environment. This near-term discipline is integral to building price harmonization across our ecosystem and to protecting the elevation and long-term equity of our brands. 
Next, I want to spend a moment digging a little deeper into our digital transformation, which cuts across everything we do, from how we create the best possible experience for our consumers to new ways of working as a company and with our partners. On the consumer-facing side, the continued acceleration of connected retail is central to our recovery and return to growth. We now have a comprehensive offering of connected retailing options, enabling our consumers to interact with the world of Ralph Lauren in new and more personal ways. These include virtual client selling and appointment booking; buy online, pick up in store; curbside pickup; mobile checkout; and contactless payments. 
We launched our pilot Ralph Lauren virtual store experience this quarter, bringing our Beverly Hills flagship store experience online through a mix of multimedia and augmented reality capabilities. Wherever you are in the world, you can shop and interact with this unique store experience through your device. Along with our expanded connected retail options, we plan to roll out more virtual flagship shopping experiences this holiday and beyond. 
In addition to our consumer-facing enhancements, we also continue to digitize how we work as an organization. This quarter we began to roll out our digital value chain initiative that will streamline how we bring products to market and make it easier for our teams to stay connected and agile. Some key components of this include: implementing 3D digital product creation in virtual fittings; rolling out digital showrooms; and expanding our stepwise buying capabilities, enabling us to make purchase decisions closer to market. While I am encouraged by the successful rollouts in the midst of COVID, we still have significant opportunity to continue integrating digital into how we work to enable greater effectiveness and efficiency. 
Turning now to our efforts to win over new generation. In the second quarter, we continued to ramp up our personalization initiatives, including targeted e-mail campaigns with predictive AI and high-reach paid social media, helping to drive traffic and conversion to our channels. 
We added more than 1 million new customers to our direct-to-consumer platforms alone in Q2. And as consumers are learning to live and work in new ways, we are likewise developing new ways of inspiring and engaging them. Let me share a few of the highlights from Q2. First, we were the first-ever fashion brand to enable consumers to mix and match branded garments inspired by real-life designs on Snapchat through our Ralph Lauren Bitmoji collection. Over 10 million users dressed their Bitmoji in Ralph Lauren and tried on the collection over 250 million times this quarter. Our 360-degree marketing campaign included influencer and celebrity partnerships with a live stream concert by chance the wrapper from our Chicago flagship and an augmented reality portal on Snapchat. Successfully connecting with Gen Z audiences, Ralph Lauren reached leadership share of voice on social media through this launch. 
We also announced the winner of our Polo Design for Good contest in Q2, entitled Just Let Me Breathe by artist Michelle Smith. This was a great example of how we are engaging with our superfans, who submitted their art work for display on an exclusive Polo shirt  with the campaign generating more than 300 million PR impressions. It also connects to our core values, which Ralph established more than 50 years ago when he started this company, with all proceeds of the winning shirt going to COVID-19 relief. 
Other high-impact activities to recruit new consumers this quarter included our partnership with the popular Netflix show Elite, outfitting BTS' official music video for Dynamite, a campaign supporting the Wimbledon foundation in the absence of this year's tournament and our continued sponsorship of the US Open Tennis and PGA Championships, as we further strengthen our position in the world of sports globally. These initiatives help to deliver an acceleration of our global brand awareness and purchase intent since the start of the pandemic, particularly with next-generation consumers. And our total social media followers exceeded 44 million in the second quarter, led by our expansion on TikTok as well as double-digit growth on Instagram. 
Looking ahead, our upcoming holiday campaigns will focus more than ever before on digital experiences, from the expansion of our virtual stores to our Polo Bear game with a live stream gaming event on Twitch. Our campaigns will also feature a much greater emphasis on gifting this holiday across all of our channels. This represents a key opportunity globally, with 74% of consumers we surveyed recently highlighting Ralph Lauren as a brand that is great for gifting. 
 
I also want to touch on our work to operate with discipline to fuel growth. Our ongoing focus on balancing growth with productivity has been an important element of our long-term plan. And this discipline is even more critical as we make hard choices to realign our cost structure so we can position the company to emerge from COVID stronger than we came into it and pivot back to growth. In the second quarter, we announced the first major action related to our fiscal 2021 strategic realignment plan, the simplification of our organizational structure. This is designed to enable our teams to move with even greater agility and focus on what matters most, including our digital transformation. 
Another element of our strategic review process we discussed last quarter was an assessment of our brand portfolio. Today, we announced that we are transitioning our Chaps business to a fully licensed model. This shift is consistent with our long-term strategy from several aspects. First, it will enable us to put even greater focus on elevating our core namesake brands in the marketplace; second, it will reduce our total direct exposure to the North America brick-and-mortar department store channel, notably the more moderate tiers; and third, this move will create incremental value for the company by setting up Chaps to deliver on its potential with an experienced partner in the sector that is focused on nurturing the brand. 
We are making good progress on our multipronged realignment plan, which gives us increased confidence in our ability to start fiscal '22 strong with the right foundations in place. 
Importantly, I also want to take a moment to touch on our ongoing work to integrate citizenship and sustainability into everything we do. Q2 marked the kickoff of our participation in the CEO Action for Racial Equality fellowship, focused on advancing racial quality and social justice in public policy, and the McKinsey Black Leadership Academy aimed at developing and empowering our next-generation of black leaders on a global scale.  
On the sustainability front, we were excited to announce a minority investment in Natural Fiber Welding, a leading sustainable material science start-up that has revolutionized the use of natural fibers and reuse of cotton waste into patented high-performance materials. Our investment will help to expand the market and ecosystem that supports the use of recycled cotton. 
In closing, Ralph and I want to thank our teams for their incredible resilience, dedication and agility as we continue to navigate through challenging conditions around the world. In this unprecedented environment, we recognize the opportunity to accelerate key strategic priorities and continue to deliver Ralph's iconic vision in an elevated way to all of our consumers across all of our channels. 
And before I turn it over to Jane, I want to extend a warm welcome to our newest Board member, Valerie Jarrett. Valerie's breadth of experience across the private and public sectors and unparalleled expertise in government, law and business will bring great perspective to the boardroom. And Ralph and I are confident that her experience and leadership will be invaluable. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Jane to discuss our financial results, and I'll join her at the end to answer your questions."

We were encouraged by our team's execution and continued business progress in the second quarter.

We were encouraged by our team's execution and continued business progress in the second quarter. In the midst of a still challenging operating environment, we delivered sequential improvement across all regions, expanded our gross margins through continued AUR growth and brand elevation and reduced expenses across the company. 
Importantly, our balance sheet is very strong with $2.4 billion of cash and investments, enhanced by ongoing working capital efficiencies. At the same time, we continue to invest in our brands and in the channels that matter most to consumers today, notably, an increased emphasis on our digital transformation.
We continue to be cautious about the pace and regional variability of COVID recovery as well as consumer behavior, especially with the rise of restrictions with the resurgence of COVID cases, notably in Europe. We are intensely focused on what we can control in this dynamic context and on positioning the company to accelerate value creation as we emerge from the global pandemic. This includes elevating our powerful lifestyle brands and maintaining a strong balance sheet, while also realigning and streamlining our operational and expense structures.  
To achieve this goal, in September, we announced the first stage of our fiscal '21 strategic realignment plan, designed to support future growth and profitability while creating a sustainable cost structure. Our full strategic review process includes the evaluation of: our team organizational structures and ways of working; our real estate footprint and related costs across distribution centers, corporate offices and direct-to-consumer retail and wholesale doors; and our brand portfolio.  
We announced actions related to the first initiative, reshaping our organization to align to our strategic growth priorities. These are estimated to result in gross annualized pretax expense savings of approximately $180 million to $200 million. We anticipate a substantial portion of these savings will flow through to the bottom line, beginning in fiscal '22. In connection with the organizational reshaping, we expect to incur a total pretax charge of approximately $160 million. The majority of this charge was recorded in the second quarter. 
As Patrice mentioned, we announced today that we are transitioning our North American Chaps menswear and womenswear business to a fully licensed model, starting in the second half of fiscal '22. Although the change is not material, we look forward to updating you on the business transition and progress in the coming months. 
Moving on to second quarter performance. Second quarter revenues declined 30% compared to a 66% decline in Q1, with performance across all 3 regions still adversely impacted by COVID. Total direct-to-consumer comps were down 28%, while global wholesale revenues declined 37%. Our bricks-and-mortar comps were down 33% following a 66% decline in the first quarter. AUR improvements were more than offset by traffic declines of more than 40% versus last year and limited store operating hours due to health and safety regulations, consistent with the broader environment. 
Looking ahead to holiday, we are proactively working to drive traffic and comps through multiple levers, which include increasing high-ROI performance marketing; expanding personalization and social commerce programs; and leveraging our connected retail capabilities, including new features that will be rolled out for holiday. 
Our brick-and-mortar declines were partially offset by a 12% comp increase in our owned Ralph Lauren digital commerce business. And more importantly, our digital profitability continued to improve, with Q2 digital operating margins expanding more than 1,000 basis points to last year through a combination of higher quality of sales and SG&A leverage. 
With digital representing our fastest-growing channel in the company, driving profitability in this business remains important, not only to our long-term margin accretion but also to our strategy of repositioning ralphlauren.com as our digital flagship or the best expression of our brand online. 
Second quarter AUR growth of 26% was above our expectations, led by double-digit increases in North America and Europe. Excluding the COVID-related mix impact, underlying AUR still grew more than 20% to last year. This underlying AUR growth represented an acceleration from the first quarter and is above the low to mid-single-digit growth we guided to for fiscal '21. We plan to drive further AUR growth this year as we elevate our brands across every touch point; significantly reduce promotional depth and duration; drive favorable mix; and take targeted pricing increases, particularly in North America. Our confidence in this brand-elevation strategy is reinforced by our continued improvements in full-price penetration rates, basket sizes and better-than-expected conversions, even as we reported higher AUR growth. 
Adjusted gross margin was 66.5% in the second quarter, up 500 basis points to last year. Gross margin expansion was driven by strong AUR improvements and favorable geographic and channel mix shift as our higher-AUR-gross-margin Asia business recovered faster than North America and Europe. Approximately 2/3 of our gross margin expansion was driven by our continued global improvements in pricing and promotions, with the remainder driven by mix shifts that were outsized given COVID impacts.  
SG&A expenses declined 19% to last year on savings from employee furloughs, store rents and government subsidies as well as lower selling and marketing expenses. Adjusted operating margin for the second quarter was 12.6%, down 230 basis points to last year. Marketing declined 31%, as COVID canceled or limited the activation of key events like Wimbledon, the U.S. Open and Fashion Week. And we shifted some demand-creation activities later in the year. We also continue to pivot investments from in-store and event-based engagements toward longer-term brand-building activities focused on digital and our values-based messaging, as Patrice discussed.  
Moving on to segment performance, starting with North America. Revenue decreased 38% to last year. Retail comps declined 32%, driven by a 40% decline in brick-and-mortar comps, while our owned digital comps increased 10%. Brick-and-mortar comps were primarily impacted by a steady but measured recovery in retail traffic, including a significant decline in foreign tourist sales in the quarter, consistent with the broader market. AUR for the quarter was up over 20%, driven by significantly reduced promotions and our continued rollout of targeted ticket price increases in factory stores.  
Our digital commerce comps accelerated to 10% from 3% growth in the first quarter. Underlying sales to domestic consumers grew high teens, while sales to international and daigou customers declined double digits to last year, as planned. Stronger sales to domestic consumers were driven by our investments in connected retailing, such as buy online, pickup in-store, and expanded personalization and targeted marketing efforts. Our digital marketing work generated a 37% increase in new customers this quarter, driving our full-price sales penetration higher. Similar to last quarter, these comp gains were tempered by a significant planned reduction in promotions to drive higher quality of sales while also serving to reduce lower-margin sales to international daigou customers. 
We reduced our total site-wide promotions by 52 days compared to the prior year period. As a result, our digital AUR was also up over 20%, and gross margins for North America digital commerce expanded more than 1,000 basis points to last year. Through this fiscal year, our plan is to continue driving stronger profitability in this channel, while, on the revenue side, balancing strong domestic growth with a steady reduction in sales to international promotion-seeking shoppers. 
In North America wholesale, second quarter revenues declined 46% as we continued to manage our shipments carefully and realigned inventories to demand. The decline was partially offset by a modest shift in timing of shipments to rebalance inventory before holiday. At the end of Q2, our inventories at wholesale were clean and well positioned, down more than 40% at North America wholesale. We are encouraged that our sell-out rates in wholesale are still significantly outperforming sell-in. However, we expect further pressure on reported sell-in over the next few quarters as we continue to manage inventories carefully. 
Moving on to Europe. Second quarter revenue declined 25% on a reported basis and 28% in constant currency. Europe retail comps were down 29%, with a 35% decline in our bricks-and-mortar store comps, partly offset by a strong 26% increase in our owned digital commerce. Across Europe, our bricks-and-mortar comps were impacted by traffic headwinds similar to North America. However, AUR was up over 20% to last year, led by our ongoing strategy to elevate our factory channel. We continue to be cautious on the pace of brick-and-mortar recovery in Europe based on the growing intensity of second waves of COVID, along with other macro uncertainties. 
Strong momentum in our owned digital commerce comps  was driven by our new consumer acquisition, up 30%, along with new site functionalities, connected retailing initiatives and enabled by the launch of our new brick-and-mortar -- I'm sorry, new back-end OMS platform in the quarter. We were also excited to go live on FARFETCH this quarter with a marketing campaign launching in time for holiday. 
Europe wholesale revenue declined 27% in constant currency as we continued to limit shipments to reset our inventories to demand. However, we saw continuing momentum in Wholesale Dot Com and digital pure players' sell-out performance through the period, with strong double-digit growth to last year, led by key platforms, such as ABOUT YOU, ASOS and Zalando.  
Turning to Asia. Revenue declined 7% on a reported basis and 8% in constant currency. Our Asia retail comps improved from a 33% decline in the first quarter to an 11% decline in Q2. Brick-and-mortar stores were down 12% partially offset by digital comps, up 32%. 
We are encouraged that growth in the Chinese Mainland is back to pre-COVID levels of more than 30%.  However, Japan continued to be the biggest headwind in the quarter, with sales declining 17%. Following our store reopenings in early June, the market entered a second wave of COVID cases, which impacted our performance, along with weaker tourism. The decline was partially offset by stronger-than-expected growth on our new digital site launched in June. Other key markets, especially those with higher levels of tourism, like Hong Kong, continue to be on a more variable and prolonged recovery. 
Overall, momentum in our Asian digital businesses continued through the quarter, driven by a strong performance across all key markets and channels, including our own sites and digital pure plays. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the second quarter with $2.4 billion in cash and investments and $1.6 billion in total debt, which compares to $1.6 billion in cash and investments and $693 million in total debt at the end of last year's second quarter. 
Net inventory declined 12% to last year, with double-digit declines in North America and Europe and a 9% increase in Asia. While we have taken a highly cautious approach to managing inventories through the pandemic, overall, we were encouraged by our team's ability to merchandise around our core and iconic styles as well as key COVID categories, like home and Athleisure.  
Our increased agility is also enabling us to shift back into pre-COVID categories as consumers return to more normalized trends. Our tightly managed inventories, combined with our strong AUR and gross margin performance through the first half of the year, give us increased confidence that we are taking the right strategic approach to move through excess spring '20 product, while also positioning the company for sustainable future growth. Meanwhile, our supply chain teams continue to improve our lead times and fast-track capabilities to chase potential increases in demand.  
Looking ahead, we continue to plan around a number of demand scenarios, given the high level of uncertainty and evolving situation surrounding COVID-19. Based on our assessment of developing business trends and our strategic plans, we want to share some details on how we are thinking directionally about the rest of the fiscal year. 
First, we expect our financial results for both the third quarter and full year fiscal '21 to continue to be adversely impacted by the pandemic and prolonged demand recovery. We expect gross margins to continue expanding in the second half of the year, albeit at a more moderate rate than the first half. Improved pricing and promotion, including targeted consumer messaging, should continue to be the most durable driver. Based on our year-to-date progress on our brand-elevation strategy, we now expect AUR to grow low double digits this year, exceeding our long-term target of low to mid-single-digit average growth annually. We expect these tailwinds to be partly offset by higher production costs in the back half. As we outlined at the start of the pandemic, we plan to clear excess full-price merchandise, primarily through our factory channels. 
We continue to expect declines in operating expenses to moderate with the highest level of dollar spend in the third quarter around holiday. Our first half results included onetime benefits from employee furloughs, rent abatements, executive compensation reductions and government subsidies that are not likely to repeat in the second half. We also shifted a meaningful portion of marketing investments to the back half of the year to position our business for growth as we emerge from the crisis, with first half marketing expense declining 32% to last year but expected to grow about 10% in the second half. Note that cost savings associated with our organizational realignment and any additional potential actions are expected to begin primarily in fiscal '22. 
Lastly, our tax rate may be higher and more volatile this year. This is due to impacts from stock compensation and nondeductible items under tax reform as well as limitations on tax benefits from losses eligible for carryback under the CARES Act. 
In closing, guided by our clear purpose and strategy along with the strength of our timeless brand and Ralph's creative vision, we are encouraged by the progress we have made over the first 2 quarters of the year. Our brand elevation is working across every geography. We are accelerating our push into digital, and we are driving even greater cost discipline as we make difficult decisions around realigning our organization and footprint around the world. 
While we continue to navigate a highly dynamic global environment, our teams are laser-focused on managing through this period to position the company to return to healthy and sustainable growth.

First and foremost, our strength comes from our teams, and their incredible dedication, resilience and agility have fueled our progress in -- during these challenging times. Our team's engagement, coupled with a laser focus on strategic priorities and also proactively reducing our exposure to the most structurally challenged parts of our businesses leads me to actually have great confidence that, right now, the fundamentals of the company are actually stronger than when we came into this crisis. Let me elaborate on both areas, first, the strategic growth areas, and then I'll talk about how we're tackling the structural headwinds for the company. 
So strategic growth focus area is really centered on elevating our brand, right? We have one of the best brands in the world. It has shown resiliency and authentic consumer connection during COVID. Our latest read on purchase intent over the past 6 months since the crisis started indicates actually our purchase intent, our brand consideration scores are up versus precrisis. Second point is accelerating digital growth and profitability, right? We've been adding connected retail functionality, we've driven a great focus on personalization in the interaction with our customers and also a strong drive on quality of sales. The third area is recruiting high-quality new consumers, bringing in consumers who buy at higher prices and are really at the sweet spot of our general targeting. And we also saw very strong consumer growth on ralphlauren.com over the past quarter versus prior year. Fourth area is driving high-potential, underdeveloped markets and categories, namely China outerwear and home. And then finally, it's realigning our organization and cost structure to support our future growth and deliver, per the numbers we announced a few weeks ago, at least $180 million of savings. So those are the strategic growth focus areas. 
And then we're really tackling head on the most challenging areas of the business, and I'll quote the top 3. One is our North America  brick-and-mortar wholesale presence, the second is our off-price penetration, and the third is the underperformance of our noncore brands. So we closed another 200 underperforming North America wholesale doors over the past few months. If you step back a little bit, Omar, and you look at the past 3-year time frame, we've basically reduced our North America wholesale brick-and-mortar presence by over 50%. We've closed more than 50% of our doors. 
We also continued to reduce the penetration of off-price in our business significantly this past quarter. Likewise, if you step back and look at the past 3 year focus and progress, we've reduced the penetration of our off-price business by more than 1/2.  
And then finally, you heard in our prepared remarks the fact that we are transitioning the Chaps brand, which is roughly $200 million in revenue to a value-accretive, fully licensed model. 
So although we recognize we're still operating in a highly volatile environment, and clearly, yesterday's new restrictions in Europe are unfortunately a good reminder of this and we will need to continue to manage with agility, as we have since the beginning of this pandemic as we kind of work through it, we are focused on strategically positioning the company for long-term growth and value creation.  
Specifically, Omar, to your question on the organization reshaping work that we announced a few weeks ago, so it fits perfectly into the strategic focus areas that we have called out. We really looked ahead and said, okay, next 3 to 5 years, what are the key growth areas for the company? What are the key capabilities that we need to succeed? And how do we align our organization structure, our ways of working, our investment levels to make sure that we're taking advantage of all these growth factors? And so what you've seen through our announcement for the org reshaping work is a reflection of that, and also, of course, the adjustment of our cost structure to reflect the -- where the business is today and where, again, we want to allocate our resources."

Matt, from a second half perspective, here's what we were encouraged by in the quarter: we were really encouraged by the progress we saw from Q1 to Q2. Now as we think about the future, there is a high degree of uncertainty surrounding the second wave shutdowns. In our assessment, this is the biggest potential impact to second half recovery and is why we continue to plan around a number of demand scenarios. We're obviously encouraged by the recovery in the Chinese Mainland getting back to pre-COVID levels of growth, but are cautious given the announcements of what we saw in Europe, particularly in France and Germany and the rising case count in North America. 
Given the current dynamics, we're not guiding for when we will return to pre-COVID levels.  We're looking at trends in terms of the challenges in bricks-and-mortar traffic; the tourism trends that will take longer to recover; and the work that Patrice referenced, which is our proactive cleanup of North America distribution, notably in wholesale and in off-price wholesale.
 
And from a timing perspective, obviously, we expect at this point that recovery will continue to be led by Asia, followed by Europe and North America, subject to second wave.
 
So we continue -- I think our teams continue to manage agilely through this. We think it's prudent not to give guidance, given what's happening in the marketplace today. But we are managing what we can control through the second half, and that's price, AUR, gross margin, expense."

And we're very much encouraged by the progress we've made, albeit, I do expect that gross margin expansion is not going to be at the pace that you saw in the first half. 
In terms of the pacing of wholesale, what we've said is we do expect, given what we see today in terms of the environment, that spring '21 will continue to improve from where we're at today. We know that fall '20 was constrained by our proactive inventory management, with inventories down 40% in North America wholesale. We do expect the spring sell-in to improve sequentially, but this is going to be a paced recovery. And obviously, our wholesale partners are watching what's happening in North America as carefully as we are. So there's still a bit of uncertainty in that environment, but that's our expectation."

And then the work that we're doing on continuing brand portfolio evaluation and real estate would likely flow through in fiscal '22, but closer to year-end in fiscal '22. 
In terms of -- we are focused on margin right now. Some of these actions, like moving Chaps to a wholesale model, will be helpful from a profitability standpoint.

Our second quarter performance reflected solid progress on our path to return to growth. Our results were overall in line with our expectations, with better-than-expected earnings driven by gross and operating margin expansion.  
While COVID-19 is still impacting physical store traffic and consumer behavior, we continue to take proactive measures to get ahead of these shifts and position our business to emerge from this crisis stronger than we came into it. These measures include accelerating our connected retail offerings globally, delivering high-value new customer acquisition, expanding key categories and international markets and realigning our cost structure. Throughout this period, we remain steadfastly focused on elevating our brand, and we were encouraged that underlying AUR growth outperformed our expectations this quarter, which is reflective of more personalized communications; reductions in promotional activity; geographic, channel and product mix benefits; and strategic pricing increases. 
This acceleration of core strategies in the quarter remains consistent with the 5 strategic priorities that we laid out as part of our long-term plan. These include: first, win over a new generation of consumers; second, energize core products and accelerate high-potential, underdeveloped categories; third, drive targeted expansion in our regions and channels; fourth, lead with digital across all activities; and fifth, operate with discipline to fuel growth. I will touch on a few of these areas in a moment. But first, let me review a few highlights related to our recovery this quarter. 
Overall, we were encouraged that our performance improved sequentially in each of our geographies, led by Asia and across our digital channels globally. Nevertheless, while we are confident in our strategy to return to growth, we remain cautious as our path to recovery may not be linear over the next few months, given meaningful traffic headwinds and a significant amount of uncertainty in the global environment. 
Looking across our regions. Asia is the furthest along on the path to recovery. This was driven by positive sales in the Chinese Mainland, which returned to pre-COVID growth levels of more than 30% as government restrictions were lifted, as well as in Korea. Strong sequential improvement in our North America and Europe comp trends in the second quarter and we continue to monitor each of our markets closely. 
By channel. While our brick-and-mortar performance was still challenged due to store traffic headwinds, we reported solid digital comps in all 3 regions this quarter. This was driven by expanded connected retail offerings and an emphasis on product categories, like home and loungewear, that are resonating with consumers today, with notably less focus on formal, tailored workwear and occasion dressing. 
Within our wholesale business, we were also encouraged by sequential progress across regions this quarter, particularly on a sell-out basis and led by Wholesale Dot Com. Our sell-in continues to improve but is lagging our recovery in direct-to-consumer, as planned, as we exited department store doors in the first quarter and focused on prioritizing inventory management in this environment. This near-term discipline is integral to building price harmonization across our ecosystem and to protecting the elevation and long-term equity of our brands. 
Next, I want to spend a moment digging a little deeper into our digital transformation, which cuts across everything we do, from how we create the best possible experience for our consumers to new ways of working as a company and with our partners. On the consumer-facing side, the continued acceleration of connected retail is central to our recovery and return to growth. We now have a comprehensive offering of connected retailing options, enabling our consumers to interact with the world of Ralph Lauren in new and more personal ways. These include virtual client selling and appointment booking; buy online, pick up in store; curbside pickup; mobile checkout; and contactless payments. 
We launched our pilot Ralph Lauren virtual store experience this quarter, bringing our Beverly Hills flagship store experience online through a mix of multimedia and augmented reality capabilities. Wherever you are in the world, you can shop and interact with this unique store experience through your device. Along with our expanded connected retail options, we plan to roll out more virtual flagship shopping experiences this holiday and beyond. 
In addition to our consumer-facing enhancements, we also continue to digitize how we work as an organization. This quarter we began to roll out our digital value chain initiative that will streamline how we bring products to market and make it easier for our teams to stay connected and agile. Some key components of this include: implementing 3D digital product creation in virtual fittings; rolling out digital showrooms; and expanding our stepwise buying capabilities, enabling us to make purchase decisions closer to market. While I am encouraged by the successful rollouts in the midst of COVID, we still have significant opportunity to continue integrating digital into how we work to enable greater effectiveness and efficiency. 
Turning now to our efforts to win over new generation. In the second quarter, we continued to ramp up our personalization initiatives, including targeted e-mail campaigns with predictive AI and high-reach paid social media, helping to drive traffic and conversion to our channels. 
We added more than 1 million new customers to our direct-to-consumer platforms alone in Q2. And as consumers are learning to live and work in new ways, we are likewise developing new ways of inspiring and engaging them. Let me share a few of the highlights from Q2. First, we were the first-ever fashion brand to enable consumers to mix and match branded garments inspired by real-life designs on Snapchat through our Ralph Lauren Bitmoji collection. Over 10 million users dressed their Bitmoji in Ralph Lauren and tried on the collection over 250 million times this quarter. Our 360-degree marketing campaign included influencer and celebrity partnerships with a live stream concert by chance the wrapper from our Chicago flagship and an augmented reality portal on Snapchat. Successfully connecting with Gen Z audiences, Ralph Lauren reached leadership share of voice on social media through this launch. 
We also announced the winner of our Polo Design for Good contest in Q2, entitled Just Let Me Breathe by artist Michelle Smith. This was a great example of how we are engaging with our superfans, who submitted their art work for display on an exclusive Polo shirt with the campaign generating more than 300 million PR impressions. It also connects to our core values, which Ralph established more than 50 years ago when he started this company, with all proceeds of the winning shirt going to COVID-19 relief. 
Other high-impact activities to recruit new consumers this quarter included our partnership with the popular Netflix show Elite, outfitting BTS' official music video for Dynamite, a campaign supporting the Wimbledon foundation in the absence of this year's tournament and our continued sponsorship of the US Open Tennis and PGA Championships, as we further strengthen our position in the world of sports globally. These initiatives help to deliver an acceleration of our global brand awareness and purchase intent since the start of the pandemic, particularly with next-generation consumers. And our total social media followers exceeded 44 million in the second quarter, led by our expansion on TikTok as well as double-digit growth on Instagram. 
Looking ahead, our upcoming holiday campaigns will focus more than ever before on digital experiences, from the expansion of our virtual stores to our Polo Bear game with a live stream gaming event on Twitch. Our campaigns will also feature a much greater emphasis on gifting this holiday across all of our channels. This represents a key opportunity globally, with 74% of consumers we surveyed recently highlighting Ralph Lauren as a brand that is great for gifting. 
 
I also want to touch on our work to operate with discipline to fuel growth. Our ongoing focus on balancing growth with productivity has been an important element of our long-term plan. And this discipline is even more critical as we make hard choices to realign our cost structure so we can position the company to emerge from COVID stronger than we came into it and pivot back to growth. In the second quarter, we announced the first major action related to our fiscal 2021 strategic realignment plan, the simplification of our organizational structure. This is designed to enable our teams to move with even greater agility and focus on what matters most, including our digital transformation. 
Another element of our strategic review process we discussed last quarter was an assessment of our brand portfolio. Today, we announced that we are transitioning our Chaps business to a fully licensed model. This shift is consistent with our long-term strategy from several aspects. First, it will enable us to put even greater focus on elevating our core namesake brands in the marketplace; second, it will reduce our total direct exposure to the North America brick-and-mortar department store channel, notably the more moderate tiers; and third, this move will create incremental value for the company by setting up Chaps to deliver on its potential with an experienced partner in the sector that is focused on nurturing the brand. 
We are making good progress on our multipronged realignment plan, which gives us increased confidence in our ability to start fiscal '22 strong with the right foundations in place. 
Importantly, I also want to take a moment to touch on our ongoing work to integrate citizenship and sustainability into everything we do. Q2 marked the kickoff of our participation in the CEO Action for Racial Equality fellowship, focused on advancing racial quality and social justice in public policy, and the McKinsey Black Leadership Academy aimed at developing and empowering our next-generation of black leaders on a global scale.  
On the sustainability front, we were excited to announce a minority investment in Natural Fiber Welding, a leading sustainable material science start-up that has revolutionized the use of natural fibers and reuse of cotton waste into patented high-performance materials. Our investment will help to expand the market and ecosystem that supports the use of recycled cotton. 
In closing, Ralph and I want to thank our teams for their incredible resilience, dedication and agility as we continue to navigate through challenging conditions around the world. In this unprecedented environment, we recognize the opportunity to accelerate key strategic priorities and continue to deliver Ralph's iconic vision in an elevated way to all of our consumers across all of our channels. 
And before I turn it over to Jane, I want to extend a warm welcome to our newest Board member, Valerie Jarrett. Valerie's breadth of experience across the private and public sectors and unparalleled expertise in government, law and business will bring great perspective to the boardroom. And Ralph and I are confident that her experience and leadership will be invaluable. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Jane to discuss our financial results, and I'll join her at the end to answer your questions."

We were encouraged by our team's execution and continued business progress in the second quarter. In the midst of a still challenging operating environment, we delivered sequential improvement across all regi",2360,"Thank you, Angela, and good morning, everyone. We were encouraged by our team's execution and continued business progress in the second quarter. In the midst of a still challenging operating environment, we delivered sequential improvement across all regions, expanded our gross margins through continued AUR growth and brand elevation and reduced expenses across the company. 
Importantly, our balance sheet is very strong with $2.4 billion of cash and investments, enhanced by ongoing working capital efficiencies. At the same time, we continue to invest in our brands and in the channels that matter most to consumers today, notably, an increased emphasis on our digital transformation.
We continue to be cautious about the pace and regional variability of COVID recovery as well as consumer behavior, especially with the rise of restrictions with the resurgence of COVID cases, notably in Europe. We are intensely focused on what we can control in this dynamic context and on positioning the company to accelerate value creation as we emerge from the global pandemic. This includes elevating our powerful lifestyle brands and maintaining a strong balance sheet, while also realigning and streamlining our operational and expense structures.  
To achieve this goal, in September, we announced the first stage of our fiscal '21 strategic realignment plan, designed to support future growth and profitability while creating a sustainable cost structure. Our full strategic review process includes the evaluation of: our team organizational structures and ways of working; our real estate footprint and related costs across distribution centers, corporate offices and direct-to-consumer retail and wholesale doors; and our brand portfolio.  
We announced actions related to the first initiative, reshaping our organization to align to our strategic growth priorities. These are estimated to result in gross annualized pretax expense savings of approximately $180 million to $200 million. We anticipate a substantial portion of these savings will flow through to the bottom line, beginning in fiscal '22. In connection with the organizational reshaping, we expect to incur a total pretax charge of approximately $160 million. The majority of this charge was recorded in the second quarter. 
As Patrice mentioned, we announced today that we are transitioning our North American Chaps menswear and womenswear business to a fully licensed model, starting in the second half of fiscal '22. Although the change is not material, we look forward to updating you on the business transition and progress in the coming months. 
Moving on to second quarter performance. Second quarter revenues declined 30% compared to a 66% decline in Q1, with performance across all 3 regions still adversely impacted by COVID. Total direct-to-consumer comps were down 28%, while global wholesale revenues declined 37%. Our bricks-and-mortar comps were down 33% following a 66% decline in the first quarter. AUR improvements were more than offset by traffic declines of more than 40% versus last year and limited store operating hours due to health and safety regulations, consistent with the broader environment. 
Looking ahead to holiday, we are proactively working to drive traffic and comps through multiple levers, which include increasing high-ROI performance marketing; expanding personalization and social commerce programs; and leveraging our connected retail capabilities, including new features that will be rolled out for holiday. 
Our brick-and-mortar declines were partially offset by a 12% comp increase in our owned Ralph Lauren digital commerce business. And more importantly, our digital profitability continued to improve, with Q2 digital operating margins expanding more than 1,000 basis points to last year through a combination of higher quality of sales and SG&A leverage. 
With digital representing our fastest-growing channel in the company, driving profitability in this business remains important, not only to our long-term margin accretion but also to our strategy of repositioning ralphlauren.com as our digital flagship or the best expression of our brand online. 
Second quarter AUR growth of 26% was above our expectations, led by double-digit increases in North America and Europe. Excluding the COVID-related mix impact, underlying AUR still grew more than 20% to last year. This underlying AUR growth represented an acceleration from the first quarter and is above the low to mid-single-digit growth we guided to for fiscal '21. We plan to drive further AUR growth this year as we elevate our brands across every touch point; significantly reduce promotional depth and duration; drive favorable mix; and take targeted pricing increases, particularly in North America. Our confidence in this brand-elevation strategy is reinforced by our continued improvements in full-price penetration rates, basket sizes and better-than-expected conversions, even as we reported higher AUR growth. 
Adjusted gross margin was 66.5% in the second quarter, up 500 basis points to last year. Gross margin expansion was driven by strong AUR improvements and favorable geographic and channel mix shift as our higher-AUR-gross-margin Asia business recovered faster than North America and Europe. Approximately 2/3 of our gross margin expansion was driven by our continued global improvements in pricing and promotions, with the remainder driven by mix shifts that were outsized given COVID impacts.  
SG&A expenses declined 19% to last year on savings from employee furloughs, store rents and government subsidies as well as lower selling and marketing expenses. Adjusted operating margin for the second quarter was 12.6%, down 230 basis points to last year. Marketing declined 31%, as COVID canceled or limited the activation of key events like Wimbledon, the U.S. Open and Fashion Week. And we shifted some demand-creation activities later in the year. We also continue to pivot investments from in-store and event-based engagements toward longer-term brand-building activities focused on digital and our values-based messaging, as Patrice discussed.  
Moving on to segment performance, starting with North America. Revenue decreased 38% to last year. Retail comps declined 32%, driven by a 40% decline in brick-and-mortar comps, while our owned digital comps increased 10%. Brick-and-mortar comps were primarily impacted by a steady but measured recovery in retail traffic, including a significant decline in foreign tourist sales in the quarter, consistent with the broader market. AUR for the quarter was up over 20%, driven by significantly reduced promotions and our continued rollout of targeted ticket price increases in factory stores.  
Our digital commerce comps accelerated to 10% from 3% growth in the first quarter. Underlying sales to domestic consumers grew high teens, while sales to international and daigou customers declined double digits to last year, as planned. Stronger sales to domestic consumers were driven by our investments in connected retailing, such as buy online, pickup in-store and expanded personalization and targeted marketing efforts. Our digital marketing work generated a 37% increase in new customers this quarter, driving our full-price sales penetration higher. Similar to last quarter, these comp gains were tempered by a significant planned reduction in promotions to drive higher quality of sales while also serving to reduce lower-margin sales to international daigou customers. 
We reduced our total site-wide promotions by 52 days compared to the prior year period. As a result, our digital AUR was also up over 20%, and gross margins for North America digital commerce expanded more than 1,000 basis points to last year. Through this fiscal year, our plan is to continue driving stronger profitability in this channel, while, on the revenue side, balancing strong domestic growth with a steady reduction in sales to international promotion-seeking shoppers. 
In North America wholesale, second quarter revenues declined 46% as we continued to manage our shipments carefully and realigned inventories to demand. The decline was partially offset by a modest shift in timing of shipments to rebalance inventory before holiday. At the end of Q2, our inventories at wholesale were clean and well positioned, down more than 40% at North America wholesale. We are encouraged that our sell-out rates in wholesale are still significantly outperforming sell-in. However, we expect further pressure on reported sell-in over the next few quarters as we continue to manage inventories carefully. 
Moving on to Europe. Second quarter revenue declined 25% on a reported basis and 28% in constant currency. Europe retail comps were down 29%, with a 35% decline in our bricks-and-mortar store comps, partly offset by a strong 26% increase in our owned digital commerce. Across Europe, our bricks-and-mortar comps were impacted by traffic headwinds similar to North America. However, AUR was up over 20% to last year, led by our ongoing strategy to elevate our factory channel. We continue to be cautious on the pace of brick-and-mortar recovery in Europe based on the growing intensity of second waves of COVID, along with other macro uncertainties. 
Strong momentum in our owned digital commerce comps was driven by our new consumer acquisition, up 30%, along with new site functionalities, connected retailing initiatives and enabled by the launch of our new brick-and-mortar -- I'm sorry, new back-end OMS platform in the quarter. We were also excited to go live on FARFETCH this quarter with a marketing campaign launching in time for holiday. 
Europe wholesale revenue declined 27% in constant currency as we continued to limit shipments to reset our inventories to demand. However, we saw continuing momentum in Wholesale Dot Com and digital pure players' sell-out performance through the period, with strong double-digit growth to last year, led by key platforms, such as ABOUT YOU, ASOS and Zalando.  
Turning to Asia. Revenue declined 7% on a reported basis and 8% in constant currency. Our Asia retail comps improved from a 33% decline in the first quarter to an 11% decline in Q2. Brick-and-mortar stores were down 12% partially offset by digital comps, up 32%. 
We are encouraged that growth in the Chinese Mainland is back to pre-COVID levels of more than 30%.  However, Japan continued to be the biggest headwind in the quarter, with sales declining 17%. Following our store reopenings in early June, the market entered a second wave of COVID cases, which impacted our performance, along with weaker tourism. The decline was partially offset by stronger-than-expected growth on our new digital site launched in June. Other key markets, especially those with higher levels of tourism, like Hong Kong, continue to be on a more variable and prolonged recovery. 
Overall, momentum in our Asian digital businesses continued through the quarter, driven by a strong performance across all key markets and channels, including our own sites and digital pure plays. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the second quarter with $2.4 billion in cash and investments and $1.6 billion in total debt, which compares to $1.6 billion in cash and investments and $693 million in total debt at the end of last year's second quarter. 
Net inventory declined 12% to last year, with double-digit declines in North America and Europe and a 9% increase in Asia. While we have taken a highly cautious approach to managing inventories through the pandemic, overall, we were encouraged by our team's ability to merchandise around our core and iconic styles as well as key COVID categories, like home and Athleisure.  
Our increased agility is also enabling us to shift back into pre-COVID categories as consumers return to more normalized trends. Our tightly managed inventories, combined with our strong AUR and gross margin performance through the first half of the year, give us increased confidence that we are taking the right strategic approach to move through excess spring '20 product, while also positioning the company for sustainable future growth. Meanwhile, our supply chain teams continue to improve our lead times and fast-track capabilities to chase potential increases in demand.  
Looking ahead, we continue to plan around a number of demand scenarios, given the high level of uncertainty and evolving situation surrounding COVID-19. Based on our assessment of developing business trends and our strategic plans, we want to share some details on how we are thinking directionally about the rest of the fiscal year. 
First, we expect our financial results for both the third quarter and full year fiscal '21 to continue to be adversely impacted by the pandemic and prolonged demand recovery. We expect gross margins to continue expanding in the second half of the year, albeit at a more moderate rate than the first half. Improved pricing and promotion, including targeted consumer messaging, should continue to be the most durable driver. Based on our year-to-date progress on our brand-elevation strategy, we now expect AUR to grow low double digits this year, exceeding our long-term target of low to mid-single-digit average growth annually. We expect these tailwinds to be partly offset by higher production costs in the back half. As we outlined at the start of the pandemic, we plan to clear excess full-price merchandise, primarily through our factory channels. 
We continue to expect declines in operating expenses to moderate with the highest level of dollar spend in the third quarter around holiday. Our first half results included onetime benefits from employee furloughs, rent abatements, executive compensation reductions and government subsidies that are not likely to repeat in the second half. We also shifted a meaningful portion of marketing investments to the back half of the year to position our business for growth as we emerge from the crisis, with first half marketing expense declining 32% to last year but expected to grow about 10% in the second half. Note that cost savings associated with our organizational realignment and any additional potential actions are expected to begin primarily in fiscal '22. 
Lastly, our tax rate may be higher and more volatile this year. This is due to impacts from stock compensation and nondeductible items under tax reform as well as limitations on tax benefits from losses eligible for carryback under the CARES Act. 
In closing, guided by our clear purpose and strategy along with the strength of our timeless brand and Ralph's creative vision, we are encouraged by the progress we have made over the first 2 quarters of the year. Our brand elevation is working across every geography. We are accelerating our push into digital, and we are driving even greater cost discipline as we make difficult decisions around realigning our organization and footprint around the world. 
While we continue to navigate a highly dynamic global environment, our teams are laser-focused on managing through this period to position the company to return to healthy and sustainable growth.  
And with that, let's open up the call for your questions."

First and foremost, our strength comes from our teams, and their incredible dedication, resilience and agility have fueled our progress in -- during these challenging times. Our team's engagement, coupled with a laser focus on strategic priorities and also proactively reducing our exposure to the most structurally challenged parts of our businesses leads me to actually have great confidence that, right now, the fundamentals of the company are actually stronger than when we came into this crisis. Let me elaborate on both areas, first, the strategic growth areas, and then I'll talk about how we're tackling the structural headwinds for the company. 
So strategic growth focus area is really centered on elevating our brand, right? We have one of the best brands in the world. It has shown resiliency and authentic consumer connection during COVID. Our latest read on purchase intent over the past 6 months since the crisis started indicates actually our purchase intent, our brand consideration scores are up versus precrisis. Second point is accelerating digital growth and profitability, right? We've been adding connected retail functionality, we've driven a great focus on personalization in the interaction with our customers and also a strong drive on quality of sales. The third area is recruiting high-quality new consumers, bringing in consumers who buy at higher prices and are really at the sweet spot of our general targeting. And we also saw very strong consumer growth on ralphlauren.com over the past quarter versus prior year. Fourth area is driving high-potential, underdeveloped markets and categories, namely China outerwear and home. And then finally, it's realigning our organization and cost structure to support our future growth and deliver, per the numbers we announced a few weeks ago, at least $180 million of savings. So those are the strategic growth focus areas. 
And then we're really tackling head on the most challenging areas of the business and I'll quote the top 3. One is our North America  brick-and-mortar wholesale presence, the second is our off-price penetration and the third is the underperformance of our noncore brands. So we closed another 200 underperforming North America wholesale doors over the past few months. If you step back a little bit, Omar, and you look at the past 3-year time frame, we've basically reduced our North America wholesale brick-and-mortar presence by over 50%. We've closed more than 50% of our doors. 
We also continued to reduce the penetration of off-price in our business significantly this past quarter. Likewise, if you step back and look at the past 3 year focus and progress, we've reduced the penetration of our off-price business by more than 1/2.  
And then finally, you heard in our prepared remarks the fact that we are transitioning the Chaps brand, which is roughly $200 million in revenue to a value-accretive, fully licensed model. 
So although we recognize we're still operating in a highly volatile environment, and clearly, yesterday's new restrictions in Europe are unfortunately a good reminder of this and we will need to continue to manage with agility, as we have since the beginning of this pandemic as we kind of work through it, we are focused on strategically positioning the company for long-term growth and value creation.  
Specifically, Omar, to your question on the organization reshaping work that we announced a few weeks ago, so it fits perfectly into the strategic focus areas that we have called out. We really looked ahead and said, okay, next 3 to 5 years, what are the key growth areas for the company? What are the key capabilities that we need to succeed? And how do we align our organization structure, our ways of working, our investment levels to make sure that we're taking advantage of all these growth factors? And so what you've seen through our announcement for the org reshaping work is a reflection of that, and also, of course, the adjustment of our cost structure to reflect the -- where the business is today and where, again, we want to allocate our resources."

On the other parts of the portfolio, some of which are work in progress, like the work that we've been doing on Lauren over the past year, we're feeling good about the pivots that have been made on product, the pivots that have been made on marketing and encouraged by the progress that we're seeing across the channels. The same is true for Luxury labels, Purple label and Collection and Double RL."

Matt, from a second half perspective, here's what we were encouraged by in the quarter: we were really encouraged by the progress we saw from Q1 to Q2. Now as we think about the future, there is a high degree of uncertainty surrounding the second wave shutdowns. In our assessment, this is the biggest potential impact to second half recovery and is why we continue to plan around a number of demand scenarios. We're obviously encouraged by the recovery in the Chinese Mainland getting back to pre-COVID levels of growth, but are cautious given the announcements of what we saw in Europe, particularly in France and Germany and the rising case count in North America. 
Given the current dynamics, we're not guiding for when we will return to pre-COVID levels.  We're looking at trends in terms of the challenges in bricks-and-mortar traffic; the tourism trends that will take longer to recover; and the work that Patrice referenced, which is our proactive cleanup of North America distribution, notably in wholesale and in off-price wholesale.
 
And from a timing perspective, obviously, we expect at this point that recovery will continue to be led by Asia, followed by Europe and North America, subject to second wave.
 
So we continue -- I think our teams continue to manage agilely through this. We think it's prudent not to give guidance, given what's happening in the marketplace today. But we are managing what we can control through the second half, and that's price, AUR, gross margin, expense."

And we're very much encouraged by the progress we've made, albeit, I do expect that gross margin expansion is not going to be at the pace that you saw in the first half. 
In terms of the pacing of wholesale, what we've said is we do expect, given what we see today in terms of the environment, that spring '21 will continue to improve from where we're at today. We know that fall '20 was constrained by our proactive inventory management, with inventories down 40% in North America wholesale. We do expect the spring sell-in to improve sequentially, but this is going to be a paced recovery. And obviously, our wholesale partners are watching what's happening in North America as carefully as we are. So there's still a bit of uncertainty in that environment, but that's our expectation."

And then the work that we're doing on continuing brand portfolio evaluation and real estate would likely flow through in fiscal '22, but closer to year-end in fiscal '22. 
In terms of -- we are focused on margin right now. Some of these actions, like moving Chaps to a wholesale model, will be helpful from a profitability standpoint.
