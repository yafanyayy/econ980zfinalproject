Thanks, everybody, for joining us. It's great to be with you on my first earnings call as CEO of McDonald's. Before I go into our highlights for the quarter and full year, I want to talk briefly about some of my observation",1056,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning. Thanks, everybody, for joining us. It's great to be with you on my first earnings call as CEO of McDonald's. Before I go into our highlights for the quarter and full year, I want to talk briefly about some of my observations from my first few months in this role.
For the past 3 months, I've been meeting with employees, conducting town halls, reviewing plans with senior functional and market leaders, sharing ideas with franchisees and suppliers and visiting restaurants and customers. This invaluable time spent with our people, partners and customers reinforced to me the vitality and global alignment we're seeing behind our Velocity Growth Plan. Our people are energized, they're proud of our culture, committed to the promise of our brand and share my confidence in the business and our direction.
This time has also reinforced things that make me deeply proud of our system. We create opportunity for our colleagues across the system. At every McDonald's gathering, there's a story to tell of the crew person, who's also a grandparent and excited to begin a new chapter of life working for McDonald's. We're the company employee who started in the system with a first job in their teens, went to college with the system support and is now in a leadership role. For those who work hard and live our values, McDonald's can change lives.
We provide a community space for our customers. When you enter McDonald's, whether in Brisbane, Berlin or Boston, you're entering more than just a restaurant. You're walking into a vibrant community, a place where people congregate share stories enjoy simple but powerful and delicious moments of happiness with family, friends and loved ones. That commitment to communities is the spirit that inspired the creation of Ronald McDonald House Charities and has helped friends and neighbors through hurricanes, tornadoes and countless other times of stress. Being integrated into communities worldwide, we know the very real challenges our customers face and we show up with solutions.
As we have grown, we've recognized our responsibility as one of the world's leading companies to use our scale to gain traction on some of the globe's most pressing challenges. It's the strength of our business over the past 65 years that enables McDonald's to play this role and a humbling responsibility to lead an organization with the ability to make an impact on the world.
Kevin will drill down on our quarterly results. Before then, I'd like to share with you some headlines for the year. In 2019, our system marked a historic milestone: $100 billion in system-wide sales. For the year, we grew global comp sales 5.9%, the highest increase we've seen in over a decade. 2019 was our third consecutive year of global comp guest count growth. To put that in perspective, McDonald's and our franchise partners now serve nearly 70 million people in over 100 countries every 24 hours. And Owner/Operator cash flow is at or near all-time highs in most of our largest markets. And in the U.S., it's at an all-time high.
Turning to segment highlights. Our International Operated Markets segment, or IOM, generated comp sales growth of 6.1% for the year. This was underscored by every market in the segment delivering both comp sales and comp guest count growth. At the same time, our International Developed Licensee segment, or IDL, generated comp sales of 7.2%. And importantly, our 3 largest IDL markets: China, Japan and Brazil, all posted positive comp sales, leading a list that includes nearly all of our IDL markets. We also have strong momentum in the U.S. In fact, we're now seeing the results of our most ambitious turnaround of the U.S. history. For the full year, comp sales growth grew 5%, our best comp since 2006 or 13 years ago.
Across the country, we're seeing clear evidence of the power of Bigger, Bolder Vision 2020, which our U.S. adaptation of the Velocity Growth Plan developed in combination with our franchisees. The initiatives we and our franchise partners deployed in 2017 and 2018, including a new value platform, fresh beef delivery, EOTF modernization and more were met with strong approval by our customers. This led to continued strong top line growth over the past 3 years. As one of the architects of our Velocity Growth Plan gives me a great sense of pride to watch 2 million restaurant crew around the world execute our strategies with such care and conviction. I continue to have great confidence in our ability to grow and shape our industry, and I'm equally confident that we have the right leadership in place to meet our customers' evolving needs with increasing ambition and speed. Joe Erlinger, an 18-year veteran of our company is now head of our U.S. business, where he's responsible for the operations of nearly 14,000 restaurants across the country. Joe returned to the U.S. after several years of increasing responsibility around the world. Most recently, he served as President of our International Operated markets, where we had oversight for McDonald's wholly owned markets outside the U.S. With Joe's transitioning in board and has expanded his role to oversee both our IOM and IDL segments. Ian began his McDonald's career 25 years ago in our finance department in Canada and have spent 23 of his 25 years in markets outside of North America. In his most recent role as President of our IDL segment, Ian worked with our developmental licensee partners across more than 80 markets. Under his leadership, we will drive greater collaboration across all markets and accelerate our pace of best practice and innovation sharing, building on our rich heritage of learning from each other. It's an important role for McDonald's as we maximize the full potential of our 3-legged stool of company, franchisee and supplier resources. Both Ian and Joe have deep track records of delivering profitable growth while building high-performing teams and strengthening collaboration with our franchisee community. Importantly, Ian, Joe and I have also worked closely together as segment presidents over the past few years, embodying the trust, respect and unity of mission that are the hallmark of our partnership culture. I'm thrilled to be working with both of them in their new roles.
Now I'll turn it to Kevin to talk about our fourth quarter results. Kevin?"
139488,650488979,1895322,"McDonald's Corporation, Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2020",2020-01-29,"Earnings Calls","McDonald's Corporation","Executives","Chris talked about our impressive full year results, so let me spend a few minutes talking about the quarter.Our strong top line momentum continued in the fourth quarter, with global comp sales increasing 5.9%. And as we've seen consistently throughout",962,"Chris talked about our impressive full year results, so let me spend a few minutes talking about the quarter.
Our strong top line momentum continued in the fourth quarter, with global comp sales increasing 5.9%. And as we've seen consistently throughout the year, each of the operating segments contributed meaningfully to our growth. This marks over 4 years of consecutive quarterly global comp sales growth. Our comp sales performance is a significant achievement given a soft global IEO market and on top of strong prior year results. Our International Operated segment, which represents over 50% of total revenues and operating income, generated comp sales of 6.2% for the quarter, with strong performance across the segment. France and the U.K. drove the segment's growth, along with positive comp sales in every market and positive guest counts in nearly all markets. France delivered its 11th consecutive quarter of comp sales growth with continued all-time high market share. The quarter benefited from delivery expansion, digital engagement and continued deployment of EOTF. The market has also been successful with the balance of premium and core burger offerings.
The U.K. reported a remarkable 55th consecutive quarter of comp sales growth and continued to gain market share across nearly all dayparts. The quarter benefited from extended breakfast hours, compelling digital offers, successful national LTOs and delivery, which has grown to about 10% of sales in the restaurants that offer it.
Turning to the U.S. Comp sales increased 5.1% for the quarter, with balanced growth across all dayparts. While traffic was negative, the U.S. continues to drive significant average check growth, with contributions from both product mix and strategic pricing.
Similar to prior quarters in 2019, Experience of the Future contributed to positive comp sales in the fourth quarter. Another 500 EOTF projects were completed during the quarter for a total of about 2,000 projects for the full year. The U.S. now has nearly 10,000 restaurants that have been converted to EOTF or about 70% of the estate. In addition, core favorites, including our fresh beef quarter pounders and world-famous French fries, continue to resonate with customers and fueled growth for the quarter. Delivery was also a contributor for the quarter as the addition of new delivery partners, like DoorDash and Grubhub drove incremental orders. And the deployment of dynamic yields suggestive cell technology in over 11,000 drive-thrus also contributed to the growth in average check. That said, returning to guest count growth in the U.S. remains our top priority. Sluggish industry traffic growth and unit expansion continue to fuel an aggressive battle for market share. In particular, the U.S. is centered on stemming traffic losses at the breakfast daypart by focusing on running better operations, introducing new menu items and offering delicious food at a compelling price point.
Finally, in the International Developmental Licensed markets, comp sales were up 6.6% for the quarter, with growth across each geographic region. The largest contributor to segment performance were Brazil, China and Japan.
Turning to the bottom line. Adjusted earnings per share was $1.97 for the quarter, a 1% increase in constant currencies when excluding impairment charges in the prior year and tax law change benefits in both the current and prior year. Results reflect strong global comp sales and operating growth, mostly offset by a higher tax rate versus the prior year.
Consolidated franchise margin dollars increased 7% in constant currencies, reflecting strong sales performance across all segments as well as expansion and the impact of refranchising.
Franchise margin percent declined 60 basis points as franchise revenue growth was more than offset by higher depreciation related to EOTF modernization in the U.S. and the impact of the new lease standard.
Consolidated company-operated margins improved 40 basis points to 17.9% for the quarter primarily due to strong comp sales growth. IOM segment company-operated margins increased 30 basis points to a healthy 20.1%, and U.S. company-operated margins increased 150 basis points to 16.4% as solid sales performance more than offset continued commodity and wage pressures and EOTF-related depreciation. Overall, our restaurant margins increased nearly $180 million in constant currencies for the quarter and over $600 million for the full year. And finally, excluding current and prior year special items, operating margin increased 30 basis points to 43.4% for the full year.
We also achieved our 3-year target of returning $25 billion to shareholders. This is a significant accomplishment given our substantial investments in Experience of the Future and technology to drive sustainable, profitable growth. As a perspective, over the last 3 years, we invested about $7 billion in the business to drive growth. We increased our dividends per share by over 30% and paid out $10 billion in dividends. And we reduced our shares outstanding about 10% by purchasing $15 billion of treasury stock. This also speaks to the progress we've made in enhancing our free cash flow profile. As a result of refranchising efforts and rightsizing our cost structure over the past several years, we've evolved to a more stable and predictable business model. In 2019, our free cash flow was $5.7 billion, up over 35% from the prior year. And free cash flow conversion, which measures our ability to convert bottom line earnings to free cash flow was 95%, a significant uptick from the prior year.
Going forward, our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged: first, to reinvest in existing restaurants and opportunities to grow the business; second, to continue growing our dividend; and third, to buy back shares. We expect our free cash flow to continue to grow, and we expect to continue to return all free cash flow to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases.
Now I'll turn it back to Chris to talk more about our Velocity Growth Plan and where we're headed in 2020."
139488,650488979,1895322,"McDonald's Corporation, Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2020",2020-01-29,"Earnings Calls","McDonald's Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Kevin. Nowhere is the power of our Velocity growth plan and franchise model come more to life than in our restaurants. In my recent travels to our European markets, I saw this firsthand everywhere I went. I was struck in particular during a visit",1036,"Thanks, Kevin. Nowhere is the power of our Velocity growth plan and franchise model come more to life than in our restaurants. In my recent travels to our European markets, I saw this firsthand everywhere I went. I was struck in particular during a visit to a restaurant in France, a society that famously values good food and beverages and inviting atmosphere in the spirit of community. There, I saw an engaged Owner/Operator who knew our customers by name and had made our modernized restaurant of vibrant gathering place for the community. Kids were everywhere. Much like their counterparts around the world, young adults were busy multitasking between bites of burgers and fries. Parents appear to be appreciating a moment of rust and other adults were seeded in singles and pairs, something I make a full meal, others just having coffee. With the scene that reinforced the fundamentals of the Velocity Growth Plan by simultaneously pulling the levers of great-tasting food with good value, convenience and a pleasing customer experience, this owner/operator and many others across France and other international markets are growing visits. A similar dynamic is playing out in the U.K., where our system is doing a great job meeting customers' expectations for convenience and speed while providing differentiated experiences for guests dining in, visiting the drive-thru or ordering through McDelivery.
This dynamic is playing out in Italy, where customer satisfaction scores are up at drive-thru and dine-in and across all 3 peak dayparts of breakfast, lunch and dinner. The excitement and energy behind our Velocity Growth Plan is widespread. It's a result of this commitment that our business is growing and our strategy continues to deliver.
At the same time, there's a realization that we can and will do more to deliver better taste, greater value and enhanced convenience for our customers. This is the guiding philosophy behind our 3 accelerators: Experience of the Future, digital and delivery. With Experience of the Future, our strategy is focused on enhancing the customer experience by improving convenience, hospitality and personalization. As Kevin said, in the U.S., we completed about 2,000 projects in 2019 and are on track for just about all restaurants to be modernized by the end of 2020. Customers are recognizing the changes we have made for their benefit. Customer satisfaction scores in the U.S. are at an all-time high. In our IOM markets, where the vast majority of our restaurants are now modernized, we have a strong foundation for long-term success by creating greater convenience, comfort and hospitality for our guests.
Meanwhile, our Digital journey, another critical accelerator, is focused on giving customers simpler, smoother and more personal engagement with McDonald's by leveraging the most relevant technology. To that end, we significantly strengthened our digital capabilities in 2019. In markets around the world, for example, a growing community of registered users is redeeming digital-only offers, giving our teams more opportunity to understand customer needs and create engaging digital customer experiences. Throughout the year, we made targeted investments to accelerate our capabilities. The suggestive sell capability of dynamic yield is now deployed in nearly all outdoor digital menu boards across the U.S. and Australia. In both markets, we're using the technology to make smarter recommendations to customers of menu items they are likely to want.
There's no question that digital is transforming global retail. Across the system, there is great excitement about the role it will play in transforming McDonald's by strengthening and deepening relationships with our customers. So we know there's great potential with digital, but there's also a lot of hard work to do to realize our ambitions. Our recently announced the creation of a new digital customer engagement team to accelerate customer-focused digital initiatives, including ordering, personalization, payments, loyalty and delivery platforms. Lucy Brady is leading this team. Lucy has been a driving force behind the evolution of the Velocity Growth Plan and rapid expansion of our McDelivery platform in her most recent role leading Corporate Strategy and Business Development. Lucy and her team will be responsible for developing new industry-leading digital experiences for our customers, and they'll partner with our Global Technology team to build new product road maps and technology solutions to fuel growth.
With our third accelerator, we're bringing more customers the McDonald's they love with the convenience of delivery. Today, about 2/3 of our restaurants worldwide, nearly 25,000, offer McDelivery. In just 3 years, McDelivery has gone from generating $1 billion in sales for McDonald's company and franchise restaurants to over $4 billion in sales this past year. We now have multiple [ 3 PO ] partners in most major markets, including the U.S., for the rapid scaling of DoorDash is showing consistent growth, and the U.K., where we recently announced an agreement to partner with . We continue to see great runway ahead of us to drive awareness and trial, and we're doubling down on our efforts to encourage frequency and retention.
As we inject speed, agility and flexibility into our system through the accelerators of Experience of the Future, Digital and Delivery, we continue to focus on the fundamentals of running great restaurants, and customers are noticing. Across our largest markets, we've reduced the time it takes a customer to receive their order by an average of 20 seconds. With this change, most markets saw overall customer satisfaction improve in 2019.
Our Velocity Growth Plan provides a solid and sustainable foundation to grow our business in 2020 and beyond, yet we know that we must stay in tune with evolving customer needs and adapt to changing market conditions. The uncertainties before us are no surprise to anyone on this call, whether due to geopolitical challenges, slow IEO growth, intensifying competition, growing labor costs or continuous technological disruption, the topics we've shared before continue to impact the industry and will need to be overcome. That means continuing aligned around a plan that always puts our customers first with great-tasting food, convenience and value means collaborating with our franchisee community for successful local execution. That means building flexibility into our system for initiatives that accelerate and sustain growth and provide new opportunities for McDonald's.
To build on that, let me turn it back over to Kevin."

The Velocity Growth Plan has resulted in strong operating performance over the past several years, reinforcing confidence in our ability to deliver long-term sustainable results. I want to take a minute to walk through some of our financial expectations for 2020. We anticipate that we'll host an Investor Day this year to provide an update on the business and longer-term expectations.
With our efficient business model, in 2020, we expect to continue achieving an operating margin in the mid-40s range, which includes the following: higher depreciation expense of about $80 million versus 2019 related to EOTF in the U.S., with the vast majority in franchise margins; with most of our major refranchising efforts complete, we expect gains on restaurant sales in 2020 to be roughly half of the amount in 2019, with most of the gains in the second half of the year; and as we have become more efficient with G&A required to run the business over the last few years, we have invested in areas that are already contributing to business performance and that we believe will continue to accelerate growth, including technology and research and development. As a result, we expect full year 2020 G&A to increase 5% to 7% in constant currencies due to these investments. This includes full year operating costs associated with the 2019 acquisitions of Dynamic Yield and Apprente. R&D spend and costs related to our biennial worldwide convention. We expect G&A percentage increases will be significantly higher in the first half of the year than the second half of the year. We also expect our annual tax rate will be 23% to 25%. Finally, based on current exchange rates, we anticipate currency translation will negatively impact EPS by $0.01 to $0.03 in the first quarter and a similar amount for the full year. As usual, this is directional guidance only as rates will change as we move through the year.
Moving on to capital. We ended 2019 with capital expenditures of $2.4 billion, in line with our expectations. As we've previously indicated, in 2020, we expect to spend a similar amount. About half of the total capital will be dedicated to the U.S., including the completion of roughly 1,800 EOTF projects.
Restaurant development also continues to be an important driver of our growth equation. We plan to open about 1,400 new restaurants this year, substantially all end markets outside the U.S. We'll spend approximately $800 million of our capital to open about 400 restaurants in our wholly owned markets.  And our developmental licensees and affiliates will spend their capital for the remaining openings, of which over 450 are planned in China.
So while we expect total capital this year will be similar to 2019, we've shifted about $200 million from reinvestment to new restaurants, which are higher-returning investments. As we enter 2020, I'm confident that we're well positioned to deliver sustained long-term profitable growth for the system and our shareholders.
Now I'll turn it back to Chris to close."

So as Kevin talked about, and as you alluded to, getting the U.S. to positive guest count growth for us is the #1 priority. I think the things that certainly give me confidence or make me feel better about our ability to do that is, as you mentioned, we have really strong alignment with franchisees at this point, that this needs to be a priority. One of the things that's, I think, sometimes not fully appreciated about the U.S. on our operator basis, it's largely a franchise -- or it's largely a family business in the U.S. over half of our franchisees are second, third-generation franchisees. And so for them, they completely recognize that no family business survives or thrives by passing on fewer customers from one generation to the next. So that's an important part of this. And then the second is we have a really good understanding of what it's going to take for us to drive guest counts to positive in the U.S. It starts with breakfast. Breakfast is the only daypart in the industry that's seeing traffic growth. We have to win at breakfast. There's obviously a lot of focus and attention that we're going to be putting on that in 2020. And then the second is a recognition that on rest of day deal or rest of day value, that we need to be competitive on that. So I think between alignment with the franchisees, between really, I think, a pretty keen understanding of where we need to focus, I feel good about that. We did see, in Q4, modest sequential improvement on it. But for us, there is certainly not -- it's too early to call a trend on this. We've got to see this happen over 4 or 5 quarters. And so it's going to be something we're going to be paying attention to. And I'm sure if you guys will be asking us about it as well so more to come on that."

Traffic in the industry is pretty muted. There's very little traffic growth. In fact, if you're not growing units, you've got a headwind there. So I think that's one recognition.

Well, as you noted, we did do 2 acquisitions last year: we bought Dynamic Yield, which was going to help us with our suggestive sell capability; and we bought Apprente, which is for voice recognition through the drive-thru of that capability. I would",463,"Yes. Well, as you noted, we did do 2 acquisitions last year: we bought Dynamic Yield, which was going to help us with our suggestive sell capability; and we bought Apprente, which is for voice recognition through the drive-thru of that capability. I would say our typical approach is partner not buy. And so both of those, for somewhat different reasons were, I think, unique situations. I don't foresee that buying tech companies is going to be our approach going forward. But we do want to be nimble enough where there are situations that come up, that we will make an acquisition. I think in the case of Dynamic Yield, what we saw there was really an opportunity for us to accelerate our rollout of suggestive sell across most of our major markets there with what we believe to be kind of the leading technology in the industry. And so with the idea of really wanting to drive an acceleration and do it with the leading partner, we made that acquisition of Dynamic Yield. Fast forward, even less than a year later, we've got Dynamic Yield in all 10,000-plus U.S. restaurants with drive-thru, it's fully rolled out in Australia and we're seeing a complex, very consistent with what we had modeled when the acquisition was done.
Similarly, with Apprente, we've got Apprente in test in a handful of U.S. restaurants, and we remain optimistic about that. So I think what you're seeing really is, for us, just an emphasis on -- we believe digital has the opportunity to really be a huge growth driver for us. When we can partner with people and do it kind of under our traditional model, that's always our preference. But if there are times that we need to do an acquisition, we're certainly not going to take that off the table. I think your question about is there a model in terms of how that gets shared with franchisees, I think one benefit is when you get the lift that we are getting with something like Dynamic Yield, we obviously participate through rent service on that. So I'd say the first part is all of these are meant to drive top line growth. And when we see that, we certainly participate from rent and service.
On the ongoing costs. The ongoing costs do get passed through to franchisees as part of our normal tech fee. We kind of separate tech costs between development costs and sort of the ongoing operating costs. We will typically pay for the development costs on our own, and then the ongoing costs are what gets shared through a text arrangement with our franchisees. So that's been kind of our model for a long period of time. I don't see that model changing."

One of the things that I do feel good about with the U.S. is when you look at the chef growth that we've gotten, it's really come through a number of different things. There has not been sort of a one-trick pony on that. We're seeing the majority of that growth is coming through mix as opposed to just kind of straight menu price. But then as you decompose mix, you've got a number of factors that have worked there: you've got delivery, which is delivering 2x the average check of a regular order; you have Dynamic Yield, which is typically leading to add-ons to an order; you have our self-order kiosk, where we know that people tend to have larger orders when they do self-order kiosk; you've seen some of our promotional items like donut sticks, the $1 $2 $3 as a value, which are really driving add on activity. So I think for me, I do feel better about how we went after check growth in 2019 because it was heavily mix-driven from that. But there is a pricing element to this. The inflation that we're seeing out there, particularly on the labor side, that does get priced through. And so I think as we head into 2020, the conversation we've been having with franchisees, which gets back to the opening question, is we've just got to make sure that we have balance. We need to have a balance between check growth and we need to get to transaction growth, and that's what everybody in the U.S. is working toward right now."

In Australia, they had a rudimentary suggestive sell already in the drive-thru. So as we put a Dynamic Yield, there wasn't a larger lift as we're certainly experiencing in the U.S. But the big positive about Dynamic Yield is our plans would be to take that similar decisioning engine-type logic and be able to use that further in kiosk and global mobile app ultimately so that we need to continue getting further sales lifts in other digital mechanisms also."

Right now, as you would expect, our priorities really on our employees, on our customers, doing everything we can to make sure that they are safe and taken care of. And so in that vein, we've been working a lot with the local authorities, particularly in the Hubei province. We have closed all restaurants in the Hubei province, which is several hundred restaurants that have been closed. But importantly, we do still have about 3,000 restaurants in the country that are still open. So several hundred closed but 3,000 that are still open.
We've also, with the China team, we've put in place an epidemic prevention and control task force, which is something we're doing again in combination with the local authorities there. And it's everything from using our kitchens to help provide meals to health care workers and hospitals. We're doing things in terms of giving medical screening for customers who come to some of our restaurants. So it's really an all-hands-on-deck effort from that vantage point.
China for us is a critical strategic market, but I think it's probably more because of the potential that we see in that market as opposed to its materiality to the business today. Just to put it in perspective, when you think about China, it does represent about 9% of our global restaurant count, but it's about 4% to 5% of system-wide sales and it's only about 3% of op income. And so while, again, China is a critical market for us, and we're very concerned about the situation over there, its actual impact on our business is going to be fairly small, assuming again that it stays contained to China."

But just from the perspective of -- should we be thinking about technology as a line item that grows faster going forward, sort of in that mid-single-digit range, more similar to labor than to other investments? I'm just trying to anticipate that.
And then the clarifying question was you talked about franchisees having record owner/operator cash flow this year in the U.S. Does that give you any more flexibility in terms of the value that you can address?

I'll talk about the G&A first, and then I'll let Chris come back and talk about value and the franchisees. Related to G&A, a couple of points. We've talked about how we've gotten more efficient with our day-to-day G&A, and we're investing in technology and R&D, so things like Dynamic Yield and Apprente. and the things we're investing in are either top line drivers or cost savings potential. So that's how we think about kind of some of these specific investments. We have decreased our overall G&A as a percent of sales from around 2.8% in 2016 to 2.2% in 2019. And roughly -- today, roughly more than 10% of that G&A spend is actually depreciation and amortization related to technology spend. So a chunk of that G&A is noncash as it relates to prior year spend. We do -- as you indicate, we expect full year G&A in 2020 to be up 5% to 7% in constant currency due to those investments, but that's because I'm lapping partial year on some of the acquisitions, we're now all have full year in 2020. So that level of increase, we certainly do not expect going forward. But as we've talked about for 2020, or as I mentioned in my script, first half of 2020 will be significantly higher growth rates than the second half of 2020. And then, I guess, the only other thing I'd say is we're in the midst of updating all of our analysis and long-term models also with the G&A. But so far, we haven't seen anything that significantly changes any of our thinking on G&A long term. So we don't think about it any differently today than than I did a couple of years ago. But I do have -- obviously, to your point, we had an increase in '19, we have a little larger increase in '20. But certainly, we don't expect that increase to be a run rate increase going forward."

Now that can take a number of different forms. That could take investments in the restaurant and some of the capital investments that we've been doing. It can take the form of putting more labor in the restaurants and it can take the form of value talking about. So to me, it's more about the point that our U.S. owner/operators are in a really healthy spot right now. I think that's also reflected in their sentiment, and they want to keep it going.

If you do the math, basically, with all of the guidance we've given, hopefully you get to similar places where we are, which is we do expect EPS growth for 2020 to meet the high-single-digit target. Certainly, a lower tax rate is helping that growth rate. And as you mentioned, it may not be even growth rates quarter-by-quarter through the year because of some of the individual quarter pressures. But as we look at the full year, we do have an expectation of being within that high-single-digit EPS growth rate target for 2020.
Regarding cash return, we're fortunate to generate a substantial amount of cash flow and be able to fund both the investments that we want to make in the business and still return a significant amount to shareholders. As I mentioned in my remarks, our free cash flow was $5.7 billion in 2019, which was up over 35%. Free cash flow conversion was around 95%. As we had internal discussions and discussed with several of our large shareholders, we decided not to give a specific dollar target over a 3-year period for cash return. But there is -- but I do want to reiterate our capital allocation philosophy because there is no change to that. As I mentioned, the priorities remain the same: first, to reinvest in existing restaurants and opportunities to grow the business; second, to continue growing our dividend; and third, to buy back shares. We do expect to continue to return all free cash flow to shareholders. And in our modeling, we anticipate net incremental debt of roughly $1 billion each year for the next few years. So that should give you an idea of kind of where the cash return comes out to that. Thanks."

Don't want to get specifically into timing and what we would do there, but we're committed to really updating and competing in an aggressive way in the chicken segment, so you should expect something there. And then we do see opportunities as well around beverages, desserts. So as the year unfolds, I think you'll see us staying strong on breakfast, but it's not going to be at the expense of rest of day."

Well, I think in the U.S., I'm really pleased with the performance that the team put up in 2019. As we talked about in our comments, we're at record customer satisfaction scores in the U.S. driven by operations, and we're seeing it broad-based across a number of ops metrics that we're looking at. The team did a really nice job in 2019 speeding up our drive-thrus. We saw good performance there. But I think what we're also excited about is we think there's more that we can do there. We think that there's certainly 20, 30 additional seconds that we want to go try to get in 2020. And it's a combination of activities: it's a combination of menu simplification moves, it's a combination of training and really making sure we have the right focus. We're doing things to bring fun into the restaurant to create kind of that competitive rivalry there. And then technology is a component to that. I'd say right now, in 2020, I don't see technology necessarily being a huge part of what's going to be driving cash flow or driving speed of service. Rather, we have zoom timers, which is an internal thing that we use that really gives the team a very detailed breakdown of each kind of part of the customer journey as they go through the drive-thru. We can be very pinpointed on how to drive speed of service. But that's now deployed in most of our restaurants. So I think in 2020, it's going to be a lot of blocking and tackling. Longer term, we're obviously very excited about what technology can do to help with speed of service, which is why we've done acquisitions like we did with Apprente. If we're able to get that commercialized and deployed, that's certainly going to be something that helps us with the speed of service in the future."

I think we probably sit roughly 2/3, but it's in that range really throughout the year for 2019. We are seeing -- in general, we're seeing a little bit higher customers per ticket. If you think about the way the business is evolving between things like delivery and the kiosks, we generally now have a little bit higher number of customers per ticket. So that is a piece of it. But even knowing that, we have been able to grow guest counts in many of our international markets, so I don't want to imply that, that would say that we should be able to grow guest counts in the U.S. The dynamics are changing, but we believe we can still grow guest counts even with those change in dynamics."

We have a very detailed and intimate understanding of what our competitors are doing there. I think for us, it's really all about finding a product that works in our restaurants, and so that has an operations component. Our menu, as you know, is much more broad than some of our competitors. So that's something we need to be mindful of in terms of how -- what we might do in chicken, what knock-on effect that might have on the rest of menu from a speed of service. And then there are some equipment differences in terms of the equipment that we have in our restaurants versus what some of our competitors would have. What we've been out testing, we're in a test right now, as you probably know. But we're testing a number of different approaches in terms of not just what you might do from a product standpoint, but are there things that we might want to do differently from an operations standpoint or are there things we might want to think about differently from an equipment standpoint. So like anything with menu in McDonald's, it's a little bit of a Rubik's cube of what's the customer looking for, what works operationally and then the business fundamentals under that. But I think I feel good about where we're going to net add on chicken. I think we're getting close to having something that we're excited to bring to customers."

Thanks, everybody, for joining us. It's great to be with you on my first earnings call as CEO of McDonald's.

It's great to be with you on my first earnings call as CEO of McDonald's. Before I go into our highlights for the quarter and full year, I want to talk briefly about some of my observations from my first few months in this role.
For the past 3 months, I've been meeting with employees, conducting town halls, reviewing plans with senior functional and market leaders, sharing ideas with franchisees and suppliers, and visiting restaurants and customers. This invaluable time spent with our people, partners and customers reinforced to me the vitality and global alignment we're seeing behind our Velocity Growth Plan. Our people are energized, they're proud of our culture, committed to the promise of our brand and share my confidence in the business and our direction.
This time has also reinforced things that make me deeply proud of our system. We create opportunity for our colleagues across the system. At every McDonald's gathering there's a story to tell of the crew person, who's also a grandparent and excited to begin a new chapter of life working for McDonald's, or the company employee who started in the system with a first job in their teens, went to college with the system support and is now on a leadership role. For those who work hard and live our values, McDonald's can change lives.
We provide a community space for our customers. When you enter McDonald's, whether in Brisbane, Berlin or Boston, you're entering more than just a restaurant, you're walking into a vibrant community, a place where people congregate, share stories and enjoy simple but powerful and delicious moments of happiness with family, friends and loved ones. 
That commitment to communities is the spirit that inspired the creation of Ronald McDonald House Charities and has helped friends and neighbors through hurricanes, tornadoes and countless other times of stress. Being integrated into communities worldwide, we know the very real challenges our customers face and we show up with solutions.
As we have grown, we've recognized our responsibility as one of the world's leading companies to use our scale to gain traction on some of the globe's most pressing challenges. It's the strength of our business over the past 65 years that enables McDonald's to play this role and a humbling responsibility to lead an organization with the ability to make an impact on the world.
Kevin will drill down on our quarterly results. Before then, I'd like to share with you some headlines for the year. In 2019, our system marked a historic milestone: $100 billion in system-wide sales. For the year, we grew global comp sales 5.9%, the highest increase we've seen in over a decade. 2019 was our third consecutive year of global comp guest count growth. 
To put that in perspective, McDonald's and our franchise partners now serve nearly 70 million people in over 100 countries every 24 hours. And owner/operator cash flow is at or near all-time highs in most of our largest markets. And in the U.S., it's at an all-time high.
Turning to segment highlights. Our International Operated Markets segment, or IOM, generated comp sales growth of 6.1% for the year. This was underscored by every market in the segment delivering both comp sales and comp guest count growth. At the same time, our International Developed Licensee (sic) [ International Developmental Licensed ] segment, or IDL, generated comp sales of 7.2%. And importantly, our 3 largest IDL markets: China, Japan and Brazil, all posted positive comp sales, leading a list that includes nearly all of our IDL markets. We also have strong momentum in the U.S. In fact, we're now seeing the results of our most ambitious turnaround of the U.S. history. For the full year, comp sales growth grew 5%, our best comp since 2006 or 13 years ago.
Across the country, we're seeing clear evidence of the power of Bigger, Bolder Vision 2020, which is our U.S. adaptation of the Velocity Growth Plan developed in combination with our franchisees. The initiatives we and our franchise partners deployed in 2017 and 2018, including a new value platform, fresh beef, delivery, EOTF modernization and more, were met with strong approval by our customers and this led to continued strong top line growth over the past 3 years. 
As one of the architects of our Velocity Growth Plan, it gives me a great sense of pride to watch 2 million restaurant crew around the world execute our strategies with such care and conviction. I continue to have great confidence in our ability to grow and shape our industry, and I'm equally confident that we have the right leadership in place to meet our customers' evolving needs with increasing ambition and speed. 
Joe Erlinger, an 18-year veteran of our company, is now head of our U.S. business, where he's responsible for the operations of nearly 14,000 restaurants across the country. Joe returned to the U.S. after several years of increasing responsibility around the world. Most recently, he served as President of our International Operated Markets, where we had oversight for McDonald's wholly owned markets outside the U.S. 
With Joe's transitioning, Ian Borden has expanded his role to oversee both our IOM and IDL segments. Ian began his McDonald's career 25 years ago in our finance department in Canada and have spent 23 of these 25 years in markets outside of North America. 
In his most recent role as President of our IDL segment, Ian worked with our developmental licensee partners across more than 80 markets. Under his leadership, we will drive greater collaboration across all markets and accelerate our pace of best practice and innovation sharing, building on our rich heritage of learning from each other. It's an important role for McDonald's as we maximize the full potential of our 3-legged stool of company, franchisee and supplier resources. 
Both Ian and Joe have deep track records of delivering profitable growth, while building high-performing teams and strengthening collaboration with our franchisee community. Importantly, Ian, Joe and I have also worked closely together as segment presidents over the past few years, embodying the trust, respect and unity of mission that are the hallmarks of our partnership culture. I'm thrilled to be working with both of them in their new roles.
Now I'll turn it to Kevin to talk about our fourth quarter results. Kevin?"
139488,650488979,1895481,"McDonald's Corporation, Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2020",2020-01-29,"Earnings Calls","McDonald's Corporation","Executives","Chris talked about our impressive full year results, so let me spend a few minutes talking about the quarter.Our strong top line momentum continued in the fourth quarter, with global comp sales increasing 5.9%. And as we've seen consistently throughout",962,"Chris talked about our impressive full year results, so let me spend a few minutes talking about the quarter.
Our strong top line momentum continued in the fourth quarter, with global comp sales increasing 5.9%. And as we've seen consistently throughout the year, each of the operating segments contributed meaningfully to our growth. This marks over 4 years of consecutive quarterly global comp sales growth. Our comp sales performance is a significant achievement given a soft global IEO market and on top of strong prior year results. 
Our International Operated segment, which represents over 50% of total revenues and operating income, generated comp sales of 6.2% for the quarter, with strong performance across the segment. France and the U.K. drove the segment's growth, along with positive comp sales in every market and positive guest counts in nearly all markets. 
France delivered its 11th consecutive quarter of comp sales growth with continued all-time high market share. The quarter benefited from delivery expansion, digital engagement and continued deployment of EOTF. The market has also been successful with the balance of premium and core burger offerings.
The U.K. reported a remarkable 55th consecutive quarter of comp sales growth and continued to gain market share across nearly all dayparts. The quarter benefited from extended breakfast hours, compelling digital offers, successful national LTOs and delivery, which has grown to about 10% of sales in the restaurants that offer it.
Turning to the U.S. Comp sales increased 5.1% for the quarter, with balanced growth across all dayparts. While traffic was negative, the U.S. continues to drive significant average check growth, with contributions from both product mix and strategic pricing.
Similar to prior quarters in 2019, Experience of the Future contributed to positive comp sales in the fourth quarter. Another 500 EOTF projects were completed during the quarter for a total of about 2,000 projects for the full year. The U.S. now has nearly 10,000 restaurants that have been converted to EOTF or about 70% of the estate. In addition, core favorites, including our fresh beef quarter pounders and world-famous French fries, continue to resonate with customers and fueled growth for the quarter. 
Delivery was also a contributor for the quarter as the addition of new delivery partners, like DoorDash and Grubhub drove incremental orders. And the deployment of Dynamic Yield's suggestive sell technology in over 11,000 drive-thrus also contributed to the growth in average check. 
That said, returning to guest count growth in the U.S. remains our top priority. Sluggish industry traffic growth and unit expansion continue to fuel an aggressive battle for market share. In particular, the U.S. is centered on stemming traffic losses at the breakfast daypart by focusing on running better operations, introducing new menu items and offering delicious food at a compelling price point.
Finally, in the International Developmental Licensed markets, comp sales were up 6.6% for the quarter, with growth across each geographic region. The largest contributor to segment performance were Brazil, China and Japan.
Turning to the bottom line. Adjusted earnings per share was $1.97 for the quarter, a 1% increase in constant currencies when excluding impairment charges in the prior year and tax law change benefits in both the current and prior year. Results reflect strong global comp sales and operating growth, mostly offset by a higher tax rate versus the prior year.
Consolidated franchise margin dollars increased 7% in constant currencies, reflecting strong sales performance across all segments as well as expansion and the impact of refranchising. Franchise margin percent declined 60 basis points as franchise revenue growth was more than offset by higher depreciation related to EOTF modernization in the U.S. and the impact of the new lease standard.
Consolidated company-operated margins improved 40 basis points to 17.9% for the quarter primarily due to strong comp sales growth. IOM segment company-operated margins increased 30 basis points to a healthy 20.1%, and U.S. company-operated margins increased 150 basis points to 16.4% as solid sales performance more than offset continued commodity and wage pressures and EOTF-related depreciation. 
Overall, our restaurant margins increased nearly $180 million in constant currencies for the quarter and over $600 million for the full year. And finally, excluding current and prior year special items, operating margin increased 30 basis points to 43.4% for the full year.
We also achieved our 3-year target of returning $25 billion to shareholders. This is a significant accomplishment given our substantial investments in Experience of the Future and technology to drive sustainable, profitable growth. 
As a perspective, over the last 3 years, we invested about $7 billion in the business to drive growth, we increased our dividends per share by over 30% and paid out $10 billion in dividends, and we reduced our shares outstanding about 10% by purchasing $15 billion of treasury stock. 
This also speaks to the progress we've made in enhancing our free cash flow profile. As a result of refranchising efforts and rightsizing our cost structure over the past several years, we've evolved to a more stable and predictable business model. 
In 2019, our free cash flow was $5.7 billion, up over 35% from the prior year. And free cash flow conversion, which measures our ability to convert bottom line earnings to free cash flow, was 95%, a significant uptick from the prior year.
Going forward, our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged: first, to reinvest in existing restaurants and opportunities to grow the business; second, to continue growing our dividend; and third, to buy back shares. We expect our free cash flow to continue to grow, and we expect to continue to return all free cash flow to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases.
Now I'll turn it back to Chris to talk more about our Velocity Growth Plan and where we're headed in 2020."
139488,650488979,1895481,"McDonald's Corporation, Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2020",2020-01-29,"Earnings Calls","McDonald's Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Kevin. Nowhere is the power of our Velocity Growth Plan and franchise model come more to life than in our restaurants. In my recent travels to our European markets, I saw this firsthand everywhere I went. I was struck in particular during a visit",1036,"Thanks, Kevin. Nowhere is the power of our Velocity Growth Plan and franchise model come more to life than in our restaurants. In my recent travels to our European markets, I saw this firsthand everywhere I went. I was struck in particular during a visit to a restaurant in France, a society that famously values good food and beverages and inviting atmosphere in the spirit of community. 
There, I saw an engaged owner/operator who knew her customers by name and had made her modernized restaurant a vibrant gathering place for the community. Kids were everywhere. Much like their counterparts around the world, young adults were busy multitasking between bites of burgers and fries. Parents appear to be appreciating a moment of rest and other adults were seated in singles and pairs, some having a full meal, others just having coffee. 
With the scene that reinforced the fundamentals of the Velocity Growth Plan by simultaneously pulling the levers of great-tasting food with good value, convenience and a pleasing customer experience, this owner/operator, and many others across France and other international markets, are growing visits. 
A similar dynamic is playing out in the U.K., where our system is doing a great job meeting customers' expectations for convenience and speed while providing differentiated experiences for guests dining in, visiting the drive-thru or ordering through McDelivery.
This dynamic is playing out in Italy, where customer satisfaction scores are up at drive-thru and dine-in and across all 3 peak dayparts of breakfast, lunch and dinner. The excitement and energy behind our Velocity Growth Plan is widespread. It's a result of this commitment that our business is growing and our strategy continues to deliver.
At the same time, there's a realization that we can and will do more to deliver better taste, greater value and enhanced convenience for our customers. This is the guiding philosophy behind our 3 accelerators: Experience of the Future, digital and delivery. 
With Experience of the Future, our strategy is focused on enhancing the customer experience by improving convenience, hospitality and personalization. As Kevin said, in the U.S., we completed about 2,000 projects in 2019 and are on track for just about all restaurants to be modernized by the end of 2020. 
Customers are recognizing the changes we have made for their benefit. Customer satisfaction scores in the U.S. are at an all-time high. In our IOM markets, where the vast majority of our restaurants are now modernized, we have a strong foundation for long-term success by creating greater convenience, comfort and hospitality for our guests.
Meanwhile, our digital journey, another critical accelerator, is focused on giving customers simpler, smoother and more personal engagement with McDonald's by leveraging the most relevant technology. To that end, we significantly strengthened our digital capabilities in 2019. In markets around the world, for example, a growing community of registered users is redeeming digital-only offers, giving our teams more opportunity to understand customer needs and create engaging digital customer experiences. 
Throughout the year, we made targeted investments to accelerate our capabilities. The suggestive sell capability of Dynamic Yield is now deployed in nearly all outdoor digital menu boards across the U.S. and Australia. In both markets, we're using the technology to make smarter recommendations to customers of menu items they are likely to want.
There's no question that digital is transforming global retail. Across the system, there is great excitement about the role it will play in transforming McDonald's by strengthening and deepening relationships with our customers. So we know there's great potential with digital, but there's also a lot of hard work to do to realize our ambitions. 
I recently announced creation of a new digital customer engagement team to accelerate customer-focused digital initiatives, including ordering, personalization, payments, loyalty and delivery platforms. Lucy Brady is leading this team. 
Lucy has been a driving force behind the evolution of the Velocity Growth Plan and rapid expansion of our McDelivery platform in her most recent role leading Corporate Strategy and Business Development. Lucy and her team will be responsible for developing new industry-leading digital experiences for our customers, and they'll partner with our global technology team to build new product road maps and technology solutions to fuel growth.
With our third accelerator, we're bringing more customers the McDonald's they love with the convenience of delivery. Today, about 2/3 of our restaurants worldwide, nearly 25,000, offer McDelivery. In just 3 years, McDelivery has gone from generating $1 billion in sales for McDonald's company and franchise restaurants to over $4 billion in sales this past year. 
We now have multiple 3PL partners in most major markets, including the U.S., where the rapid scaling of DoorDash is showing consistent growth; and the U.K., where we recently announced an agreement to partner with Just Eat. We continue to see great runway ahead of us to drive awareness and trial, and we're doubling down on our efforts to encourage frequency and retention.
As we inject speed, agility and flexibility into our system through the accelerators of Experience of the Future, digital and delivery, we continue to focus on the fundamentals of running great restaurants, and customers are noticing. Across our largest markets, we've reduced the time it takes a customer to receive their order by an average of 20 seconds. With this change, most markets saw overall customer satisfaction improve in 2019.
Our Velocity Growth Plan provides a solid and sustainable foundation to grow our business in 2020 and beyond, yet we know that we must stay in tune with evolving customer needs and adapt to changing market conditions. The uncertainties before us are no surprise to anyone on this call, whether due to geopolitical challenges, slow IEO growth, intensifying competition, growing labor costs or continuous technological disruption. 
The topics we've shared before continue to impact the industry and will need to be overcome. And that means continuing to align around a plan that always puts our customers first with great-tasting food, convenience and value. It means collaborating with our franchisee community for a successful local execution.  That means building flexibility into our system for initiatives that accelerate and sustain growth, and provide new opportunities for McDonald's.
To build on that, let me turn it back over to Kevin."

The Velocity Growth Plan has resulted in strong operating performance over the past several years, reinforcing confidence in our ability to deliver long-term sustainable results. 
I want to take a minute to walk through some of our financial expectations for 2020. We anticipate that we'll host an Investor Day this year to provide an update on the business and longer-term expectations. 
With our efficient business model, in 2020, we expect to continue achieving an operating margin in the mid-40s range, which includes the following: Higher depreciation expense of about $80 million versus 2019 related to EOTF in the U.S., with the vast majority in franchise margins. With most of our major refranchising efforts complete, we expect gains on restaurant sales in 2020 to be roughly half of the amount in 2019, with most of the gains in the second half of the year. And as we have become more efficient with G&A required to run the business over the last few years, we have invested in areas that are already contributing to business performance and that we believe will continue to accelerate growth, including technology and research and development. 
As a result, we expect full year 2020 G&A to increase 5% to 7% in constant currencies due to these investments. This includes full year operating costs associated with the 2019 acquisitions of Dynamic Yield and Apprente, R&D spend and costs related to our biennial worldwide convention. We expect G&A percentage increases will be significantly higher in the first half of the year than the second half of the year. We also expect our annual tax rate will be 23% to 25%. 
Finally, based on current exchange rates, we anticipate currency translation will negatively impact EPS by $0.01 to $0.03 in the first quarter and a similar amount for the full year. As usual, this is directional guidance only as rates will change as we move through the year.
Moving on to capital. We ended 2019 with capital expenditures of $2.4 billion, in line with our expectations. As we've previously indicated, in 2020, we expect to spend a similar amount. About half of the total capital will be dedicated to the U.S., including the completion of roughly 1,800 EOTF projects.
Restaurant development also continues to be an important driver of our growth equation. We plan to open about 1,400 new restaurants this year, substantially all in markets outside the U.S. We'll spend approximately $800 million of our capital to open about 400 restaurants in our wholly owned markets. And our developmental licensees and affiliates will spend their capital for the remaining openings, of which over 450 are planned in China.
So while we expect total capital this year will be similar to 2019, we've shifted about $200 million from reinvestment to new restaurants, which are higher-returning investments. As we enter 2020, I'm confident that we're well positioned to deliver sustained long-term profitable growth for the system and our shareholders.
Now I'll turn it back to Chris to close."

And through it all, we've made a path forward even as the landscape changes. With these changes, customer expectations evolve, placing new demands on the world's leading brands. We're ready for that challenge, embracing it across our business with the enduring strength and values that make McDonald's a force for positive social and economic development in every community we serve. 
As we enter 2020, we do so from a position of strength and with an unwavering commitment to our Velocity Growth Plan, the accelerators driving it and the incredible people and partners who keep us nimble, agile and open in new innovations and new possibilities. We have some exciting milestones ahead of us in 2020, including worldwide convention in April. 
On a final note, I'd like to offer a heartfelt thank you to everyone across the McDonald's system who helped us achieve this milestone of $100 billion in system-wide sales this past year. It's the sum of many things done right every day by every employee, supplier, franchisee and crew member around the world. I'm proud of our collective success and grateful for their commitment as we begin a new year.
With that, let's begin Q&A."

So as Kevin talked about, and as you alluded to, getting the U.S. to positive guest count growth for us is the #1 priority. I think the things that certainly give me confidence or make me feel better about our ability",333,"Yes. Good morning. Thank you, Andrew. So as Kevin talked about, and as you alluded to, getting the U.S. to positive guest count growth for us is the #1 priority. I think the things that certainly give me confidence or make me feel better about our ability to do that is, as you mentioned, we have really strong alignment with franchisees at this point, that this needs to be a priority. 
One of the things that's, I think, sometimes not fully appreciated about the U.S. on an operator basis, it's largely a franchise -- or it's largely a family business in the U.S. Over half of our franchisees are second and third-generation franchisees. And so for them, they completely recognize that no family business survives or thrives by passing on fewer customers from one generation to the next. So that's an important part of this. 
And then the second is we have a really good understanding of what it's going to take for us to drive guest counts to positive in the U.S. It starts with breakfast. Breakfast is the only daypart in the industry that's seeing traffic growth. We have to win at breakfast. There's obviously a lot of focus and attention that we're going to be putting on that in 2020. And then the second is a recognition that on rest-of-day deal or rest-of-day value, that we need to be competitive on that. 
So I think between alignment with the franchisees, between really, I think, a pretty keen understanding of where we need to focus, I feel good about that, we did see, in Q4, modest sequential improvement on it. But for us, there is certainly not -- it's too early to call a trend on this. We've got to see this happen over 4 or 5 quarters. And so it's going to be something we're going to be paying attention to and I'm sure you guys will be asking us about it as well. So more to come on that."

But I think what you're talking about and what you mentioned is really a recognition that growth in this industry at this point is going to have to come through stealing share. 
Traffic in the industry is pretty muted. There's very little traffic growth. In fact, if you're not growing units, you've got a headwind there. So I think that's one recognition. And certainly, you're seeing, I think, just a lot of people really wanting to make sure that they can get the growth that they need to be able to offset some of the cost headwinds. So I think between those two things, it has been a competitive environment, it's going to continue to be a competitive environment, but I wouldn't say I'm seeing an uptick right now."

Well, as you noted, we did do 2 acquisitions last year, we bought Dynamic Yield, which was going to help us with our suggestive sell capability; and we bought Apprente, which is for voice recognition through the drive-thru of that capability. I would",467,"Yes. Well, as you noted, we did do 2 acquisitions last year, we bought Dynamic Yield, which was going to help us with our suggestive sell capability; and we bought Apprente, which is for voice recognition through the drive-thru of that capability. I would say our typical approach is partner not buy. And so both of those, for somewhat different reasons were, I think, unique situations. I don't foresee that buying tech companies is going to be our approach going forward. 
But we do want to be nimble enough where there are situations that come up that we will make an acquisition. I think in the case of Dynamic Yield, what we saw there was really an opportunity for us to accelerate our rollout of suggestive sell across most of our major markets there with what we believe to be kind of the leading technology in the industry. And so with the idea of really wanting to drive an acceleration and do it with a leading partner, we made that acquisition of Dynamic Yield. Fast forward, even less than a year later, we've got Dynamic Yield in all 10,000-plus U.S. restaurants with a drive-thru. It's fully rolled out in Australia. And we're seeing a comp lift, very consistent with what we had modeled when the acquisition was done. Similarly, with Apprente, we've got Apprente in test in a handful of U.S. restaurants, and we remain optimistic about that. 
So I think what you're seeing really is, for us, just an emphasis on -- we believe digital has the opportunity to really be a huge growth driver for us. When we can partner with people and do it kind of under our traditional model, that's always our preference. But if there are times that we need to do an acquisition, we're certainly not going to take that off the table. I think your question about is there a model in terms of how that gets shared with franchisees, I think one benefit is when you get the lift that we are getting with something like Dynamic Yield, we obviously participate through rent and service on that. So I'd say the first part is all of these are meant to drive top line growth, and when we see that, we certainly participate from rent and service.
On the ongoing costs, the ongoing costs do get passed through to franchisees as part of our normal tech fee. We kind of separate tech costs between development costs and sort of the ongoing operating costs. We will typically pay for the development costs on our own, and then the ongoing costs are what gets shared through a tech fee arrangement with our franchisees. So that's been kind of our model for a long period of time. I don't see that model changing."

One of the things that I do feel good about with the U.S. is when you look at the check growth that we've gotten, it's really come through a number of different things. There has not been sort of a one-trick pony on that. We're seeing the majority of that growth is coming through mix as opposed to just kind of straight menu price. But then as you decompose mix, you've got a number of factors that are worked there. You've got delivery, which is delivering 2x the average check of a regular order. You have Dynamic Yield, which is typically leading to add-ons to an order. You have our self-order kiosk, where we know that people tend to have larger orders when they do self-order kiosk. You've seen some of our promotional items like donut sticks, D $1 $2 $3 as a value, which are really driving add-on activity. 
So I think, for me, I do feel better about how we went after check growth in 2019 because it was heavily mix-driven from that. But there is a pricing element to this. The inflation that we're seeing out there, particularly on the labor side, that does get priced through. And so I think as we head into 2020, the conversation we've been having with franchisees, which gets back to the opening question, is we've just got to make sure that we have balance. We need to have a balance between check growth and we need to get to transaction growth, and that's what everybody in the U.S. is working toward right now."

What I would say is it will be potentially different in different countries. So right now, we're certainly getting a bigger lift from Dynamic Yield in the U.S. than in Australia. In Australia, they had a rudimentary suggestive sell already in the drive-thru. So as we put a Dynamic Yield, there wasn't as larger a lift as we're certainly experiencing in the U.S. But the big positive about Dynamic Yield is our plans would be to take that similar decisioning engine-type logic and be able to use that further in kiosk and global mobile app ultimately. So that we need -- can continue getting further sales lifts in other digital mechanisms also."

Right now, as you would expect, our priority is really on our employees, on our customers, doing everything we can to make sure that they are safe and taken care of. And so in that vein, we've been working a lot with the local authorities, particularly in the Hubei province. We have closed all restaurants in the Hubei province, which is several hundred restaurants that have been closed. But importantly, we do still have about 3,000 restaurants in the country that are still open. So several hundred closed, but 3,000 that are still open.
We've also, with the China team, we've put in place an epidemic prevention and control task force, which is something we're doing again in combination with the local authorities there. And it's everything from using our kitchens to help provide meals to health care workers in hospitals. We're doing things in terms of giving medical screening for customers who come to some of our restaurants. So it's really an ""all hands on deck"" effort from that vantage point.
China for us is a critical strategic market, but I think it's probably more because of the potential that we see in that market as opposed to its materiality to the business today. Just to put it in perspective, when you think about China, it does represent about 9% of our global restaurant count, but it's about 4% to 5% of system-wide sales and it's only about 3% of op income. And so while, again, China is a critical market for us and we're very concerned about the situation over there, its actual impact on our business is going to be fairly small, assuming, again, that it stays contained to China."

So a chunk of that G&A is noncash as it relates to prior year spend. We do -- as you indicate, we expect full year G&A in 2020 to be up 5% to 7% in constant currency due to those investments. But that's -- because I'm lapping partial year on some of the acquisitions, we now will have full year in 2020. So that level of increase, we certainly do not expect going forward. But as we've talked about for 2020 or as I mentioned in my script, first half of 2020 will be significantly higher growth rates than the second half of 2020. 
And then, I guess, the only other thing I'd say is we're in the midst of updating all of our analysis and long-term models also with the G&A. But so far, we haven't seen anything that significantly changes any of our thinking on G&A long term. So we don't think about it any differently today than  I did a couple of years ago. But I do have -- obviously, to your point, we had an increase in '19, we have a little larger increase in '20. But certainly, we don't expect that increase to be a run rate increase going forward."

And in 2019, in the U.S., they did so in kind of a resounding way. I mean, they blew through the prior cash flow record and surpassed that by probably another $50,000 or something like that. So it's a really good thing when you have wealthy franchisees who are making a lot of money because it means that their mentality is to be aggressive to invest in the business. 
Now that can take a number of different forms. That could take investments in the restaurant. And some of the capital investments that we've been doing, it can take the form of putting more labor in the restaurants and it can take the form of value as you talking about. So to me, it's more about the point that our U.S. owner/operators are in a really healthy spot right now. I think that's also reflected in their sentiment, and they want to keep it going. And so that's going to require staying aggressive on the business, and I'm confident they're going to do that."

On the flip side, I guess, you're talking about maybe some elevated G&A in the short term. So I'm just wondering how you think about that in relation to your thoughts on achieving your long-term algorithm, which is for high-single-digit EPS growth. I know you don't necessarily guide specifically to any 1 year, but just wondering how you see that potentially playing out, whether this is a year where we could expect some more normalized comparison to long-term growth.
And within that, that return of cash that you mentioned, I know you finished your 3-year target. I'm just wondering whether, going forward, we should now just think of it as you're going to return all free cash in any one year versus perhaps giving a target for one or multiple years?"

Let me hit -- it's a couple of different things. Let me first talk about 2020. If you do the math, basically, with all of the guidance we've given, hopefully you get to similar places where we are, which is we do expect EPS growth for 2020 to meet the high-single-digit target. Certainly, a lower tax rate is helping that growth rate. And as you mentioned, it may not be even growth rates quarter-by-quarter through the year because of some of the individual quarter pressures. But as we look at the full year, we do have an expectation of being within that high-single-digit EPS growth rate target for 2020.
Regarding cash return, we're fortunate to generate a substantial amount of cash flow and be able to fund both the investments that we want to make in the business and still return a significant amount to shareholders. As I mentioned in my remarks, our free cash flow was $5.7 billion in 2019, which was up over 35%. Free cash flow conversion was around 95%. As we had internal discussions and discussed with several of our large shareholders, we decided not to give a specific dollar target over a 3-year period for cash return. 
But there is -- but I do want to reiterate our capital allocation philosophy because there is no change to that. As I mentioned, the priorities remain the same: first, to reinvest in existing restaurants and opportunities to grow the business; second, to continue growing our dividend; and third, to buy back shares. We do expect to continue to return all free cash flow to shareholders. And in our modeling, we anticipate net incremental debt of roughly $1 billion each year for the next few years. So that should give you an idea of kind of where the cash return comes out to that. Thanks."

And I think you're going to see for us, in 2020, that there's going to be burger news, there's going to be things that we're doing there that continue to keep driving our QPC business, which really has been a standout performer for us the last couple of years. 
Obviously, a lot of discussion about chicken. Don't want to get specifically into timing and what we would do there, but we're committed to really updating it and competing in an aggressive way in the chicken segment, so you should expect something there. And then we do see opportunities as well around beverages, desserts.

The team did a really nice job in 2019 speeding up our drive-thrus. We saw good performance there. 
But I think what we're also excited about is we think there's more that we can do there. We think that there's certainly 20, 30 additional seconds that we want to go try to get in 2020. And it's a combination of activities. It's a combination of menu simplification moves. It's a combination of training and really making sure we have the right focus. We're doing things to bring fun into the restaurant to create kind of that competitive rivalry there. 
And then technology is a component to that. I'd say right now, in 2020, I don't see technology necessarily being a huge part of what's going to be driving cash flow or driving speed of service, rather. We have ZOOM timers, which is an internal thing that we use, that really gives the team a very detailed breakdown of each kind of part of the customer journey as they go through the drive-thrus. We can be very pinpointed on how to drive speed of service. But that's now deployed in most of our restaurants. So I think in 2020, it's going to be a lot of blocking and tackling. 
Longer term, we're obviously very excited about what technology can do to help with speed of service, which is why we've done acquisitions like we did with Apprente. If we're able to get that commercialized and deployed, that's certainly going to be something that helps us with the speed of service in the future."

So that's something we need to be mindful of in terms of how -- what we might do in chicken, what knock-on effect that might have on the rest of menu from a speed of service. And then there are some equipment differences in terms of the equipment that we have in our restaurants versus what some of our competitors would have. 
What we've been out testing -- we're in a test right now, as you probably know. But we're testing a number of different approaches in terms of not just what you might do from a product standpoint, but are there things that we might want to do differently from an operations standpoint or are there things we might want to think about differently from an equipment standpoint. So like anything with menu in McDonald's, it's a little bit of a Rubik's cube of what's the customer looking for, what works operationally and then the business fundamentals under that. But I think I feel good about where we're going to net add on chicken. I think we're getting close to having something that we're excited to bring to customers."

It's great to be with you on my first earnings call as CEO of McDonald's. Before I go into our highlights for the quarter and full year, I want to talk briefly about some of my observations from my first few months in this role.
For the past 3 months, I've been meeting with employees, conducting town halls, reviewing plans with senior functional and market leaders, sharing ideas with franchisees and suppliers, and visiting restaurants and customers. This invaluable time spent with our people, partners and customers reinforced to me the vitality and global alignment we're seeing behind our Velocity Growth Plan. Our people are energized, they're proud of our culture, committed to the promise of our brand and share my confidence in the business and our direction.
This time has also reinforced things that make me deeply proud of our system. We create opportunity for our colleagues across the system. At every McDonald's gathering there's a story to tell of the crew person, who's also a grandparent and excited to begin a new chapter of life working for McDonald's, or the company employee who started in the system with a first job in their teens, went to college with the system support and is now in a leadership role. For those who work hard and live our values, McDonald's can change lives.
We provide a community space for our customers. When you enter McDonald's, whether in Brisbane, Berlin or Boston, you're entering more than just a restaurant, you're walking into a vibrant community, a place where people congregate, share stories and enjoy simple but powerful and delicious moments of happiness with family, friends and loved ones. 
That commitment to communities is the spirit that inspired the creation of Ronald McDonald House Charities and has helped friends and neighbors through hurricanes, tornadoes and countless other times of stress. Being integrated into communities worldwide, we know the very real challenges our customers face and we show up with solutions.
As we have grown, we've recognized our responsibility as one of the world's leading companies to use our scale to gain traction on some of the globe's most pressing challenges. It's the strength of our business over the past 65 years that enables McDonald's to play this role and a humbling responsibility to lead an organization with the ability to make an impact on the world.
Kevin will drill down on our quarterly results. Before then, I'd like to share with you some headlines for the year. In 2019, our system marked a historic milestone: $100 billion in system-wide sales. For the year, we grew global comp sales 5.9%, the highest increase we've seen in over a decade. 2019 was our third consecutive year of global comp guest count growth. 
To put that in perspective, McDonald's and our franchise partners now serve nearly 70 million people in over 100 countries every 24 hours. And owner/operator cash flow is at or near all-time highs in most of our largest markets. And in the U.S., it's at an all-time high.
Turning to segment highlights. Our International Operated Markets segment, or IOM, generated comp sales growth of 6.1% for the year. This was underscored by every market in the segment delivering both comp sales and comp guest count growth. At the same time, our International Developed Licensee (sic) [ International Developmental Licensed ] segment, or IDL, generated comp sales of 7.2%. And importantly, our 3 largest IDL markets: China, Japan and Brazil, all posted positive comp sales, leading a list that includes nearly all of our IDL markets. We also have strong momentum in the U.S. In fact, we're now seeing the results of our most ambitious turnaround of the U.S. history. For the full year, comp sales growth grew 5%, our best comp since 2006 or 13 years ago.
Across the country, we're seeing clear evidence of the power of Bigger, Bolder Vision 2020, which is our U.S. adaptation of the Velocity Growth Plan developed in combination with our franchisees. The initiatives we and our franchise partners deployed in 2017 and 2018, including a new value platform, fresh beef, delivery, EOTF modernization and more, were met with strong approval by our customers and this led to continued strong top line growth over the past 3 years. 
As one of the architects of our Velocity Growth Plan, it gives me a great sense of pride to watch 2 million restaurant crew around the world execute our strategies with such care and conviction. I continue to have great confidence in our ability to grow and shape our industry, and I'm equally confident that we have the right leadership in place to meet our customers' evolving needs with increasing ambition and speed. 
Joe Erlinger, an 18-year veteran of our company, is now head of our U.S. business, where he's responsible for the operations of nearly 14,000 restaurants across the country. Joe returns to the U.S. after several years of increasing responsibility around the world. Most recently, he served as President of our International Operated Markets, where we had oversight for McDonald's wholly owned markets outside the U.S. 
With Joe's transitioning, Ian Borden has expanded his role to oversee both our IOM and IDL segments. Ian began his McDonald's career 25 years ago in our finance department in Canada and has spent 23 of these 25 years in markets outside of North America. 
In his most recent role as President of our IDL segment, Ian worked with our developmental licensee partners across more than 80 markets. Under his leadership, we will drive greater collaboration across all markets and accelerate our pace of best practice and innovation sharing, building on our rich heritage of learning from each other. It's an important role for McDonald's as we maximize the full potential of our 3-legged stool of company, franchisee and supplier resources. 
Both Ian and Joe have deep track records of delivering profitable growth, while building high-performing teams and strengthening collaboration with our franchisee community. Importantly, Ian, Joe and I have also worked closely together as segment presidents over the past few years, embodying the trust, respect and unity of mission that are the hallmarks of our partnership culture. I'm thrilled to be working with both of them in their new roles.
Now I'll turn it to Kevin to talk about our fourth quarter results. Kevin?"

And as we've seen consistently throughout",962,"Chris talked about our impressive full year results, so let me spend a few minutes talking about the quarter.
Our strong top line momentum continued in the fourth quarter, with global comp sales increasing 5.9%. And as we've seen consistently throughout the year, each of the operating segments contributed meaningfully to our growth. This marks over 4 years of consecutive quarterly global comp sales growth. Our comp sales performance is a significant achievement given a soft global IEO market and on top of strong prior year results. 
Our International Operated segment, which represents over 50% of total revenues and operating income, generated comp sales of 6.2% for the quarter, with strong performance across the segment. France and the U.K. drove the segment's growth, along with positive comp sales in every market and positive guest counts in nearly all markets. 
France delivered its 11th consecutive quarter of comp sales growth with continued all-time high market share. The quarter benefited from delivery expansion, digital engagement and continued deployment of EOTF. The market has also been successful with the balance of premium and core burger offerings.
The U.K. reported a remarkable 55th consecutive quarter of comp sales growth and continued to gain market share across nearly all dayparts. The quarter benefited from extended breakfast hours, compelling digital offers, successful national LTOs and delivery, which has grown to about 10% of sales in the restaurants that offer it.
Turning to the U.S. Comp sales increased 5.1% for the quarter, with balanced growth across all dayparts. While traffic was negative, the U.S. continues to drive significant average check growth, with contributions from both product mix and strategic pricing.
Similar to prior quarters in 2019, Experience of the Future contributed to positive comp sales in the fourth quarter. Another 500 EOTF projects were completed during the quarter for a total of about 2,000 projects for the full year. The U.S. now has nearly 10,000 restaurants that have been converted to EOTF or about 70% of the estate. In addition, core favorites, including our fresh beef quarter pounders and world-famous French fries, continue to resonate with customers and fueled growth for the quarter. 
Delivery was also a contributor for the quarter as the addition of new delivery partners, like DoorDash and Grubhub drove incremental orders. And the deployment of Dynamic Yield's suggestive sell technology in over 11,000 drive-thrus also contributed to the growth in average check. 
That said, returning to guest count growth in the U.S. remains our top priority. Sluggish industry traffic growth and unit expansion continue to fuel an aggressive battle for market share. In particular, the U.S. is centered on stemming traffic losses at the breakfast daypart by focusing on running better operations, introducing new menu items and offering delicious food at a compelling price point.
Finally, in the International Developmental Licensed markets, comp sales were up 6.6% for the quarter, with growth across each geographic region. The largest contributor to segment performance were Brazil, China and Japan.
Turning to the bottom line. Adjusted earnings per share was $1.97 for the quarter, a 1% increase in constant currencies when excluding impairment charges in the prior year and tax law change benefits in both the current and prior year. Results reflect strong global comp sales and operating growth, mostly offset by a higher tax rate versus the prior year.
Consolidated franchise margin dollars increased 7% in constant currencies, reflecting strong sales performance across all segments as well as expansion and the impact of refranchising. Franchise margin percent declined 60 basis points as franchise revenue growth was more than offset by higher depreciation related to EOTF modernization in the U.S. and the impact of the new lease standard.
Consolidated company-operated margins improved 40 basis points to 17.9% for the quarter primarily due to strong comp sales growth. IOM segment company-operated margins increased 30 basis points to a healthy 20.1%, and U.S. company-operated margins increased 150 basis points to 16.4% as solid sales performance more than offset continued commodity and wage pressures and EOTF-related depreciation. 
Overall, our restaurant margins increased nearly $180 million in constant currencies for the quarter and over $600 million for the full year. And finally, excluding current and prior year special items, operating margin increased 30 basis points to 43.4% for the full year.
We also achieved our 3-year target of returning $25 billion to shareholders. This is a significant accomplishment given our substantial investments in Experience of the Future and technology to drive sustainable, profitable growth. 
As a perspective, over the last 3 years, we invested about $7 billion in the business to drive growth, we increased our dividends per share by over 30% and paid out $10 billion in dividends, and we reduced our shares outstanding about 10% by purchasing $15 billion of treasury stock. 
This also speaks to the progress we've made in enhancing our free cash flow profile. As a result of refranchising efforts and rightsizing our cost structure over the past several years, we've evolved to a more stable and predictable business model. 
In 2019, our free cash flow was $5.7 billion, up over 35% from the prior year. And free cash flow conversion, which measures our ability to convert bottom line earnings to free cash flow, was 95%, a significant uptick from the prior year.
Going forward, our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged: first, to reinvest in existing restaurants and opportunities to grow the business; second, to continue growing our dividend; and third, to buy back shares. We expect our free cash flow to continue to grow, and we expect to continue to return all free cash flow to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases.
Now I'll turn it back to Chris to talk more about our Velocity Growth Plan and where we're headed in 2020."
139488,650488979,1897918,"McDonald's Corporation, Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2020",2020-01-29,"Earnings Calls","McDonald's Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Kevin. Nowhere is the power of our Velocity Growth Plan and franchise model come more to life than in our restaurants. In my recent travels to our European markets, I saw this firsthand everywhere I went. I was struck in particular during a visit",1038,"Thanks, Kevin. Nowhere is the power of our Velocity Growth Plan and franchise model come more to life than in our restaurants. In my recent travels to our European markets, I saw this firsthand everywhere I went. I was struck in particular during a visit to a restaurant in France, a society that famously values good food and beverages, an inviting atmosphere in the spirit of community. 
There, I saw an engaged owner/operator who knew her customers by name and had made her modernized restaurant a vibrant gathering place for the community. Kids were everywhere. Much like their counterparts around the world, young adults were busy multitasking between bites of burgers and fries. Parents appear to be appreciating a moment of rest and other adults were seated in singles and pairs, some having a full meal, others just having coffee. 
It was a scene that reinforced the fundamentals of the Velocity Growth Plan by simultaneously pulling the levers of great-tasting food with good value, convenience and a pleasing customer experience, this owner/operator, and many others across France and other international markets, are growing visits. 
A similar dynamic is playing out in the U.K., where our system is doing a great job meeting customers' expectations for convenience and speed while providing differentiated experiences for guests dining in, visiting the drive-thru or ordering through McDelivery.
This dynamic is playing out in Italy, where customer satisfaction scores are up at drive-thru and dine-in and across all 3 peak dayparts of breakfast, lunch and dinner. The excitement and energy behind our Velocity Growth Plan is widespread. It's a result of this commitment that our business is growing and our strategy continues to deliver.
At the same time, there's a realization that we can and will do more to deliver better taste, greater value and enhanced convenience for our customers. This is the guiding philosophy behind our 3 accelerators: Experience of the Future, digital and delivery. 
With Experience of the Future, our strategy is focused on enhancing the customer experience by improving convenience, hospitality and personalization. As Kevin said, in the U.S., we completed about 2,000 projects in 2019 and are on track for just about all restaurants to be modernized by the end of 2020. 
Customers are recognizing the changes we have made for their benefit. Customer satisfaction scores in the U.S. are at an all-time high. In our IOM markets, where the vast majority of our restaurants are now modernized, we have a strong foundation for long-term success by creating greater convenience, comfort and hospitality for our guests.
Meanwhile, our digital journey, another critical accelerator, is focused on giving customers simpler, smoother and more personal engagement with McDonald's by leveraging the most relevant technology. To that end, we significantly strengthened our digital capabilities in 2019. In markets around the world, for example, a growing community of registered users is redeeming digital-only offers, giving our teams more opportunity to understand customer needs and create engaging digital customer experiences. 
Throughout the year, we made targeted investments to accelerate our capabilities. The suggestive sell capability of Dynamic Yield is now deployed in nearly all outdoor digital menu boards across the U.S. and Australia. In both markets, we're using the technology to make smarter recommendations to customers of menu items they are likely to want.
There's no question that digital is transforming global retail. Across the system, there is great excitement about the role it will play in transforming McDonald's by strengthening and deepening relationships with our customers. So we know there's great potential with digital, but there's also a lot of hard work to do to realize our ambitions. 
I recently announced a creation of a new digital customer engagement team to accelerate customer-focused digital initiatives, including ordering, personalization, payments, loyalty and delivery platforms. Lucy Brady is leading this team. 
Lucy has been a driving force behind the evolution of the Velocity Growth Plan and rapid expansion of our McDelivery platform in her most recent role leading Corporate Strategy and Business Development. Lucy and her team will be responsible for developing new industry-leading digital experiences for our customers, and they'll partner with our global technology team to build new product road maps and technology solutions to fuel growth.
With our third accelerator, we're bringing more customers the McDonald's they love with the convenience of delivery. Today, about 2/3 of our restaurants worldwide, nearly 25,000, offer McDelivery. In just 3 years, McDelivery has gone from generating $1 billion in sales for McDonald's company and franchise restaurants to over $4 billion in sales this past year. 
We now have multiple 3PL partners in most major markets, including the U.S., where the rapid scaling of DoorDash is showing consistent growth; and the U.K., where we recently announced an agreement to partner with Just Eat. We continue to see great runway ahead of us to drive awareness and trial, and we're doubling down on our efforts to encourage frequency and retention.
As we inject speed, agility and flexibility into our system through the accelerators of Experience of the Future, digital and delivery, we continue to focus on the fundamentals of running great restaurants, and customers are noticing. Across our largest markets, we've reduced the time it takes a customer to receive their order by an average of 20 seconds. With this change, most markets saw overall customer satisfaction improve in 2019.
Our Velocity Growth Plan provides a solid and sustainable foundation to grow our business in 2020 and beyond, yet we know that we must stay in tune with evolving customer needs and adapt to changing market conditions. The uncertainties before us are no surprise to anyone on this call, whether due to geopolitical challenges, slow IEO growth, intensifying competition, growing labor costs or continuous technological disruption. 
The topics we've shared before continue to impact the industry and will need to be overcome. And that means continuing to align around a plan that always puts our customers first with great-tasting food, convenience and value. It means collaborating with our franchisee community for a successful local execution.  That means building flexibility into our system for initiatives that accelerate and sustain growth, and provide new opportunities for McDonald's.
To build on that, let me turn it back over to Kevin."

I want to take a minute to",506,"We head into 2020 from a position of strength. The Velocity Growth Plan has resulted in strong operating performance over the past several years, reinforcing confidence in our ability to deliver long-term sustainable results. 
I want to take a minute to walk through some of our financial expectations for 2020. We anticipate that we'll host an Investor Day this year to provide an update on the business and longer-term expectations. 
With our efficient business model, in 2020, we expect to continue achieving an operating margin in the mid-40s range, which includes the following: Higher depreciation expense of about $80 million versus 2019 related to EOTF in the U.S., with the vast majority in franchise margins. With most of our major refranchising efforts complete, we expect gains on restaurant sales in 2020 to be roughly half of the amount in 2019, with most of the gains in the second half of the year. And as we have become more efficient with G&A required to run the business over the last few years, we have invested in areas that are already contributing to business performance and that we believe will continue to accelerate growth, including technology and research and development. 
As a result, we expect full year 2020 G&A to increase 5% to 7% in constant currencies due to these investments. This includes full year operating costs associated with the 2019 acquisitions of Dynamic Yield and Apprente, R&D spend and costs related to our biennial worldwide convention. We expect G&A percentage increases will be significantly higher in the first half of the year than the second half of the year. We also expect our annual tax rate will be 23% to 25%. 
Finally, based on current exchange rates, we anticipate currency translation will negatively impact EPS by $0.01 to $0.03 in the first quarter and a similar amount for the full year. As usual, this is directional guidance only as rates will change as we move through the year.
Moving on to capital. We ended 2019 with capital expenditures of $2.4 billion, in line with our expectations. As we've previously indicated, in 2020, we expect to spend a similar amount. About half of the total capital will be dedicated to the U.S., including the completion of roughly 1,800 EOTF projects.
Restaurant development also continues to be an important driver of our growth equation. We plan to open about 1,400 new restaurants this year, substantially all in markets outside the U.S. We'll spend approximately $800 million of our capital to open about 400 restaurants in our wholly owned markets. And our developmental licensees and affiliates will spend their capital for the remaining openings, of which over 450 are planned in China.
So while we expect total capital this year will be similar to 2019, we've shifted about $200 million from reinvestment to new restaurants, which are higher-returning investments. As we enter 2020, I'm confident that we're well positioned to deliver sustained long-term profitable growth for the system and our shareholders.
Now I'll turn it back to Chris to close."

And through it all, we've made a path forward even as the landscape changes. With these changes, customer expectations evolve, placing new demands on the world's leading brands. We're ready for that challenge, embracing it across our business with the enduring strength and values that make McDonald's a force for positive social and economic development in every community we serve. 
As we enter 2020, we do so from a position of strength and with an unwavering commitment to our Velocity Growth Plan, the accelerators driving it and the incredible people and partners who keep us nimble, agile and open to new innovations and new possibilities. We have some exciting milestones ahead of us in 2020, including worldwide convention in April. 
On a final note, I'd like to offer a heartfelt thank you to everyone across the McDonald's system who helped us achieve this milestone of $100 billion in system-wide sales this past year. It's the sum of many things done right every day by every employee, supplier, franchisee and crew member around the world. I'm proud of our collective success and grateful for their commitment as we begin a new year.

So as Kevin talked about, and as you alluded to, getting the U.S. to positive guest count growth for us is the #1 priority.

So as Kevin talked about, and as you alluded to, getting the U.S. to positive guest count growth for us is the #1 priority. I think the things that certainly give me confidence or make me feel better about our ability to do that is, as you mentioned, we have really strong alignment with franchisees at this point, that this needs to be a priority. 
One of the things that's, I think, sometimes not fully appreciated about the U.S. owner operator basis, it's largely a franchise -- or it's largely a family business in the U.S. Over half of our franchisees are second and third-generation franchisees. And so for them, they completely recognize that no family business survives or thrives by passing on fewer customers from one generation to the next. So that's an important part of this. 
And then the second is we have a really good understanding of what it's going to take for us to drive guest counts to positive in the U.S. It starts with breakfast. Breakfast is the only daypart in the industry that's seeing traffic growth. We have to win at breakfast. There's obviously a lot of focus and attention that we're going to be putting on that in 2020. And then the second is a recognition that on rest-of-day deal or rest-of-day value, that we need to be competitive on that. 
So I think between alignment with the franchisees, between really, I think, a pretty keen understanding of where we need to focus, I feel good about that, we did see, in Q4, modest sequential improvement on it. But for us, there is certainly not -- it's too early to call a trend on this. We've got to see this happen over 4 or 5 quarters. And so it's going to be something we're going to be paying attention to and I'm sure you guys will be asking us about it as well. So more to come on that."

But I think what you're talking about and what you mentioned is really a recognition that growth in this industry at this point is going to have to come through stealing share. 
Traffic in the industry is pretty muted. There's very little traffic growth. In fact, if you're not growing units, you've got a headwind there. So I think that's one recognition. And certainly, you're seeing, I think, just a lot of people really wanting to make sure that they can get the growth that they need to be able to offset some of the cost headwinds. So I think between those two things, it has been a competitive environment, it's going to continue to be a competitive environment, but I wouldn't say I'm seeing an uptick right now."

Well, as you noted, we did do 2 acquisitions last year, we bought Dynamic Yield, which was going to help us with our suggestive sell capability; and we bought Apprente, which is for voice recognition through the drive-thru of that capability. I would",467,"Yes. Well, as you noted, we did do 2 acquisitions last year, we bought Dynamic Yield, which was going to help us with our suggestive sell capability; and we bought Apprente, which is for voice recognition through the drive-thru of that capability. I would say our typical approach is partner not buy. And so both of those, for somewhat different reasons were, I think, unique situations. I don't foresee that buying tech companies is going to be our approach going forward. 
But we do want to be nimble enough where there are situations that come up that we will make an acquisition. I think in the case of Dynamic Yield, what we saw there was really an opportunity for us to accelerate our rollout of suggestive sell across most of our major markets there with what we believe to be kind of the leading technology in the industry. And so with the idea of really wanting to drive an acceleration and do it with a leading partner, we made that acquisition of Dynamic Yield. Fast forward, even less than a year later, we've got Dynamic Yield in all 10,000-plus U.S. restaurants with a drive-thru. It's fully rolled out in Australia. And we're seeing a comp lift, very consistent with what we had modeled when the acquisition was done. Similarly, with Apprente, we've got Apprente in test in a handful of U.S. restaurants, and we remain optimistic about that. 
So I think what you're seeing really is, for us, just an emphasis on -- we believe digital has the opportunity to really be a huge growth driver for us. When we can partner with people and do it kind of under our traditional model, that's always our preference. But if there are times that we need to do an acquisition, we're certainly not going to take that off the table. I think your question about is there a model in terms of how that gets shared with franchisees, I think one benefit is when you get the lift that we are getting with something like Dynamic Yield, we obviously participate through rent and service on that. So I'd say the first part is all of these are meant to drive top line growth, and when we see that, we certainly participate from rent and service.
On the ongoing costs, the ongoing costs do get passed through to franchisees as part of our normal tech fee. We kind of separate tech costs between development costs and sort of the ongoing operating costs. We will typically pay for the development costs on our own, and then the ongoing costs are what gets shared through a tech fee arrangement with our franchisees. So that's been kind of our model for a long period of time. I don't see that model changing."

One of the things that I do feel good about with the U.S. is when you look at the check growth that we've gotten, it's really come through a number of different things. There has not been sort of a one-trick pony on that. We're seeing the majority of that growth is coming through mix as opposed to just kind of straight menu price. But then as you decompose mix, you've got a number of factors that are at work there. You've got delivery, which is delivering 2x the average check of a regular order. You have Dynamic Yield, which is typically leading to add-ons to an order. You have our self-order kiosk, where we know that people tend to have larger orders when they do self-order kiosk. You've seen some of our promotional items like donut sticks, D $1 $2 $3 as a value, which are really driving add-on activity. 
So I think, for me, I do feel better about how we went after check growth in 2019 because it was heavily mix-driven from that. But there is a pricing element to this. The inflation that we're seeing out there, particularly on the labor side, that does get priced through. And so I think as we head into 2020, the conversation we've been having with franchisees, which gets back to the opening question, is we've just got to make sure that we have balance. We need to have a balance between check growth and we need to get to transaction growth, and that's what everybody in the U.S. is working toward right now."

In Australia, they had a rudimentary suggestive sell already in the drive-thru. So as we put in Dynamic Yield, there wasn't as large a lift as we're certainly experiencing in the U.S. But the big positive about Dynamic Yield is our plans would be to take that similar decisioning engine-type logic and be able to use that further in kiosk and global mobile app ultimately. So that we need -- can continue getting further sales lifts in other digital mechanisms also."

So we're currently evaluating the opportunity to invest in some of those new units outside the U.S. You'll see that we have gone up a little bit in our openings in 2020, growing about 1,400 new units that should, between those and the ones we opened in 2019, contribute roughly 1.5 to our sales growth. So that's the one area we're currently evaluating. I think as far as longer term, we want to get through this evaluation, then we'll talk further about that when we have our Investor Day later this year."

So we've been having a lot of conversations on that. As you would imagine, I'm not going to telegraph on this call in terms of how we actually plan to go about it. 
But I think back to a couple of the earlier points that we've talked about here, there is strong alignment with the owner/operators the U.S. that we need to be in a situation where we're getting both transaction growth as well as check growth. And so it's up to us now to deliver on it, but I do think there's good alignment to it. And it's probably going to come more through deal than it is necessarily everyday value. I think we've got a good everyday value platform embedded already."

Well obviously, the situation in China is fluid and it's concerning. Right now, as you would expect, our priority is really on our employees, on our customers, doing everything we can to make sure that they are safe and taken care of. And so in that vein, we've been working a lot with the local authorities, particularly in the Hubei province. We have closed all restaurants in the Hubei province, which is several hundred restaurants that have been closed. But importantly, we do still have about 3,000 restaurants in the country that are still open. So several hundred closed, but 3,000 that are still open.
We've also, with the China team, we've put in place an epidemic prevention and control task force, which is something we're doing again in combination with the local authorities there. And it's everything from using our kitchens to help provide meals to health care workers in hospitals. We're doing things in terms of giving medical screening for customers who come to some of our restaurants. So it's really an ""all hands on deck"" effort from that vantage point.
China for us is a critical strategic market, but I think it's probably more because of the potential that we see in that market as opposed to its materiality to the business today. Just to put it in perspective, when you think about China, it does represent about 9% of our global restaurant count, but it's about 4% to 5% of system-wide sales and it's only about 3% of op income. And so while, again, China is a critical market for us and we're very concerned about the situation over there, its actual impact on our business is going to be fairly small, assuming, again, that it stays contained to China."

I think at the investor event last month, and certainly you reiterated just now, the sort of very case-specific reason to make acquisitions. But I mean, how should we think about tech spend going forward? I think the guidance for G&A this year was a little bit higher than I would have expected. I know some of that is the owner/operator convention. Maybe you could quantify that? But just from the perspective of should we be thinking about technology as a line item that grows faster going forward, sort of in that mid-single-digit range, more similar to labor than to other investments? Just trying to anticipate that.
And then the clarifying question was you talked about franchisees having record owner/operator cash flow this year in the U.S. Does that give you any more flexibility in terms of the value that you can address? Or are franchisees more looking to kind of protect that after having had a couple of years of declining cash flows?"

I'll talk about the G&A first, and then I'll let Chris come back and talk about value and the franchisees. Related to G&A, a couple of points.

I'll talk about the G&A first, and then I'll let Chris come back and talk about value and the franchisees. Related to G&A, a couple of points. We've talked about how we've gotten more efficient with our day-to-day G&A, and we're investing in technology and R&D, so things like Dynamic Yield and Apprente.  And the things we're investing in are either top line drivers or cost saving potentials. So that's how we think about kind of some of these specific investments. 
We have decreased our overall G&A as a percent of sales from around 2.8% in 2016 to 2.2% in 2019. And roughly -- today, roughly more than 10% of that G&A spend is actually depreciation and amortization related to technology spend. So a chunk of that G&A is noncash as it relates to prior year spend. We do -- as you indicate, we expect full year G&A in 2020 to be up 5% to 7% in constant currency due to those investments. But that's -- because I'm lapping partial year on some of the acquisitions, we now will have full year in 2020. So that level of increase, we certainly do not expect going forward. But as we've talked about for 2020 or as I mentioned in my script, first half of 2020 will be significantly higher growth rates than the second half of 2020. 
And then, I guess, the only other thing I'd say is we're in the midst of updating all of our analysis and long-term models also with the G&A. But so far, we haven't seen anything that significantly changes any of our thinking on G&A long term. So we don't think about it any differently today than  I did a couple of years ago. But I do have -- obviously, to your point, we had an increase in '19, we have a little larger increase in '20. But certainly, we don't expect that increase to be a run rate increase going forward."

And in 2019, in the U.S., they did so in kind of a resounding way. I mean, they blew through the prior cash flow record and surpassed that by probably another $50,000 or something like that. So it's a really good thing when you have wealthy franchisees who are making a lot of money because it means that their mentality is to be aggressive to invest in the business. 
Now that can take a number of different forms. That could take investments in the restaurant. And some of the capital investments that we've been doing, it can take the form of putting more labor in the restaurants and it can take the form of value as you talking about. So to me, it's more about the point that our U.S. owner/operators are in a really healthy spot right now. I think that's also reflected in their sentiment, and they want to keep it going. And so that's going to require staying aggressive on the business, and I'm confident they're going to do that."

I know you don't necessarily guide specifically to any 1 year, but just wondering how you see that potentially playing out, whether this is a year where we could expect some more normalized comparison to long-term growth.
And within that, that return of cash that you mentioned, I know you finished your 3-year target. I'm just wondering whether, going forward, we should now just think of it as you're going to return all free cash in any one year versus perhaps giving a target for one or multiple years?"

Let me hit -- it's a couple of different things. Let me first talk about 2020. If you do the math, basically, with all of the guidance we've given, hopefully you get to similar places where we are, which is we do expect EPS growth for 2020 to meet the high-single-digit target. Certainly, a lower tax rate is helping that growth rate. And as you mentioned, it may not be even growth rates quarter-by-quarter through the year because of some of the individual quarter pressures. But as we look at the full year, we do have an expectation of being within that high-single-digit EPS growth rate target for 2020.
Regarding cash return, we're fortunate to generate a substantial amount of cash flow and be able to fund both the investments that we want to make in the business and still return a significant amount to shareholders. As I mentioned in my remarks, our free cash flow was $5.7 billion in 2019, which was up over 35%. Free cash flow conversion was around 95%. As we had internal discussions and discussed with several of our large shareholders, we decided not to give a specific dollar target over a 3-year period for cash return. 
But there is -- but I do want to reiterate our capital allocation philosophy because there is no change to that. As I mentioned, the priorities remain the same: first, to reinvest in existing restaurants and opportunities to grow the business; second, to continue growing our dividend; and third, to buy back shares. We do expect to continue to return all free cash flow to shareholders. And in our modeling, we anticipate net incremental debt of roughly $1 billion each year for the next few years. So that should give you an idea of kind of where the cash return comes out to that. Thanks."

Obviously, a lot of discussion about chicken. Don't want to get specifically into timing and what we would do there, but we're committed to really updating it and competing in an aggressive way in the chicken segment, so you should expect something there.

The team did a really nice job in 2019 speeding up our drive-thrus. We saw good performance there. 
But I think what we're also excited about is we think there's more that we can do there. We think that there's certainly 20, 30 additional seconds that we want to go try to get in 2020. And it's a combination of activities. It's a combination of menu simplification moves. It's a combination of training and really making sure we have the right focus. We're doing things to bring fun into the restaurant to create kind of that competitive rivalry there. 
And then technology is a component to that. I'd say right now, in 2020, I don't see technology necessarily being a huge part of what's going to be driving cash flow or driving speed of service, rather. We have ZOOM timers, which is an internal thing that we use, that really gives the team a very detailed breakdown of each kind of part of the customer journey as they go through the drive-thrus. We can be very pinpointed on how to drive speed of service. But that's now deployed in most of our restaurants. So I think in 2020, it's going to be a lot of blocking and tackling. 
Longer term, we're obviously very excited about what technology can do to help with speed of service, which is why we've done acquisitions like we did with Apprente. If we're able to get that commercialized and deployed, that's certainly going to be something that helps us with the speed of service in the future."

So that's something we need to be mindful of in terms of how -- what we might do in chicken, what knock-on effect that might have on the rest of menu from a speed of service.

What we've been out testing -- we're in a test right now, as you probably know. But we're testing a number of different approaches in terms of not just what you might do from a product standpoint, but are there things that we might want to do differently from an operations standpoint or are there things we might want to think about differently from an equipment standpoint.

Thanks, everybody, for joining us. It's great to be with you on my first earnings call as CEO of McDonald's. Before I go into our highlights for the quarter and full year, I want to talk briefly about some of my observation",1065,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning. Thanks, everybody, for joining us. It's great to be with you on my first earnings call as CEO of McDonald's. Before I go into our highlights for the quarter and full year, I want to talk briefly about some of my observations from my first few months in this role.
For the past 3 months, I've been meeting with employees, conducting town halls, reviewing plans with senior functional and market leaders, sharing ideas with franchisees and suppliers, and visiting restaurants and customers. This invaluable time spent with our people, partners and customers reinforced to me the vitality and global alignment we're seeing behind our Velocity Growth Plan. Our people are energized, they're proud of our culture, committed to the promise of our brand and share my confidence in the business and our direction.
This time has also reinforced things that make me deeply proud of our system. We create opportunity for our colleagues across the system. At every McDonald's gathering, there's a story to tell of the crew person, who's also a grandparent and excited to begin a new chapter of life working for McDonald's; or the company employee who started in the system with a first job in their teens, went to college with the system support and is now in a leadership role. For those who work hard and live our values, McDonald's can change lives.
We provide a community space for our customers. When you enter McDonald's, whether in Brisbane, Berlin or Boston, you're entering more than just a restaurant, you're walking into a vibrant community, a place where people congregate, share stories and enjoy simple but powerful and delicious moments of happiness with family, friends and loved ones. 
That commitment to communities is the spirit that inspired the creation of Ronald McDonald House Charities and has helped friends and neighbors through hurricanes, tornadoes and countless other times of stress. Being integrated into communities worldwide, we know the very real challenges our customers face and we show up with solutions.
As we have grown, we've recognized our responsibility as one of the world's leading companies to use our scale to gain traction on some of the globe's most pressing challenges. It's the strength of our business over the past 65 years that enables McDonald's to play this role and a humbling responsibility to lead an organization with the ability to make an impact on the world.
Kevin will drill down on our quarterly results. Before then, I'd like to share with you some headlines for the year. In 2019, our system marked a historic milestone: $100 billion in system-wide sales. For the year, we grew global comp sales 5.9%, the highest increase we've seen in over a decade. 2019 was our third consecutive year of global comp guest count growth. 
To put that in perspective, McDonald's and our franchise partners now serve nearly 70 million people in over 100 countries every 24 hours. And owner/operator cash flow is at or near all-time highs in most of our largest markets. And in the U.S., it's at an all-time high.
Turning to segment highlights. Our International Operated Markets segment, or IOM, generated comp sales growth of 6.1% for the year. This was underscored by every market in the segment delivering both comp sales and comp guest count growth. At the same time, our International Developed Licensee (sic) [ International Developmental Licensed ] segment, or IDL, generated comp sales of 7.2%. And importantly, our 3 largest IDL markets: China, Japan and Brazil, all posted positive comp sales, leading a list that includes nearly all of our IDL markets. We also have strong momentum in the U.S. In fact, we're now seeing the results of our most ambitious turnaround of the U.S. history. For the full year, comp sales growth grew 5%, our best comp since 2006 or 13 years ago.
Across the country, we're seeing clear evidence of the power of Bigger, Bolder Vision 2020, which is our U.S. adaptation of the Velocity Growth Plan developed in combination with our franchisees. The initiatives we and our franchise partners deployed in 2017 and 2018, including a new value platform, fresh beef, delivery, EOTF modernization and more, were met with strong approval by our customers and this led to continued strong top line growth over the past 3 years. 
As one of the architects of our Velocity Growth Plan, it gives me a great sense of pride to watch 2 million restaurant crew around the world execute our strategies with such care and conviction. I continue to have great confidence in our ability to grow and shape our industry, and I'm equally confident that we have the right leadership in place to meet our customers' evolving needs with increasing ambition and speed. 
Joe Erlinger, an 18-year veteran of our company, is now head of our U.S. business, where he's responsible for the operations of nearly 14,000 restaurants across the country. Joe returns to the U.S. after several years of increasing responsibility around the world. Most recently, he served as President of our International Operated Markets, where we had oversight for McDonald's wholly owned markets outside the U.S. 
With Joe's transitioning, Ian Borden has expanded his role to oversee both our IOM and IDL segments. Ian began his McDonald's career 25 years ago in our finance department in Canada and has spent 23 of these 25 years in markets outside of North America. 
In his most recent role as President of our IDL segment, Ian worked with our developmental licensee partners across more than 80 markets. Under his leadership, we will drive greater collaboration across all markets and accelerate our pace of best practice and innovation sharing, building on our rich heritage of learning from each other. It's an important role for McDonald's as we maximize the full potential of our 3-legged stool of company, franchisee and supplier resources. 
Both Ian and Joe have deep track records of delivering profitable growth, while building high-performing teams and strengthening collaboration with our franchisee community. Importantly, Ian, Joe and I have also worked closely together as segment presidents over the past few years, embodying the trust, respect and unity of mission that are the hallmarks of our partnership culture. I'm thrilled to be working with both of them in their new roles.
Now I'll turn it to Kevin to talk about our fourth quarter results. Kevin?"
139488,650488979,1898399,"McDonald's Corporation, Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2020",2020-01-29,"Earnings Calls","McDonald's Corporation","Executives","Chris talked about our impressive full year results, so let me spend a few minutes talking about the quarter.Our strong top line momentum continued in the fourth quarter, with global comp sales increasing 5.9%. And as we've seen consistently throughout",962,"Chris talked about our impressive full year results, so let me spend a few minutes talking about the quarter.
Our strong top line momentum continued in the fourth quarter, with global comp sales increasing 5.9%. And as we've seen consistently throughout the year, each of the operating segments contributed meaningfully to our growth. This marks over 4 years of consecutive quarterly global comp sales growth. Our comp sales performance is a significant achievement given a soft global IEO market and on top of strong prior year results. 
Our International Operated segment, which represents over 50% of total revenues and operating income, generated comp sales of 6.2% for the quarter, with strong performance across the segment. France and the U.K. drove the segment's growth, along with positive comp sales in every market and positive guest counts in nearly all markets. 
France delivered its 11th consecutive quarter of comp sales growth with continued all-time high market share. The quarter benefited from delivery expansion, digital engagement and continued deployment of EOTF. The market has also been successful with the balance of premium and core burger offerings.
The U.K. reported a remarkable 55th consecutive quarter of comp sales growth and continued to gain market share across nearly all dayparts. The quarter benefited from extended breakfast hours, compelling digital offers, successful national LTOs and delivery, which has grown to about 10% of sales in the restaurants that offer it.
Turning to the U.S. Comp sales increased 5.1% for the quarter, with balanced growth across all dayparts. While traffic was negative, the U.S. continues to drive significant average check growth, with contributions from both product mix and strategic pricing.
Similar to prior quarters in 2019, Experience of the Future contributed to positive comp sales in the fourth quarter. Another 500 EOTF projects were completed during the quarter for a total of about 2,000 projects for the full year. The U.S. now has nearly 10,000 restaurants that have been converted to EOTF or about 70% of the estate. In addition, core favorites, including our fresh beef quarter pounders and world-famous French fries, continue to resonate with customers and fueled growth for the quarter. 
Delivery was also a contributor for the quarter as the addition of new delivery partners, like DoorDash and Grubhub drove incremental orders. And the deployment of Dynamic Yield's suggestive sell technology in over 11,000 drive-thrus also contributed to the growth in average check. 
That said, returning to guest count growth in the U.S. remains our top priority. Sluggish industry traffic growth and unit expansion continue to fuel an aggressive battle for market share. In particular, the U.S. is centered on stemming traffic losses at the breakfast daypart by focusing on running better operations, introducing new menu items and offering delicious food at a compelling price point.
Finally, in the International Developmental Licensed markets, comp sales were up 6.6% for the quarter, with growth across each geographic region. The largest contributor to segment performance were Brazil, China and Japan.
Turning to the bottom line. Adjusted earnings per share was $1.97 for the quarter, a 1% increase in constant currencies when excluding impairment charges in the prior year and tax law change benefits in both the current and prior year. Results reflect strong global comp sales and operating growth, mostly offset by a higher tax rate versus the prior year.
Consolidated franchise margin dollars increased 7% in constant currencies, reflecting strong sales performance across all segments as well as expansion and the impact of refranchising. Franchise margin percent declined 60 basis points as franchise revenue growth was more than offset by higher depreciation related to EOTF modernization in the U.S. and the impact of the new lease standard.
Consolidated company-operated margins improved 40 basis points to 17.9% for the quarter primarily due to strong comp sales growth. IOM segment company-operated margins increased 30 basis points to a healthy 20.1%, and U.S. company-operated margins increased 150 basis points to 16.4% as solid sales performance more than offset continued commodity and wage pressures and EOTF-related depreciation. 
Overall, our restaurant margins increased nearly $180 million in constant currencies for the quarter and over $600 million for the full year. And finally, excluding current and prior year special items, operating margin increased 30 basis points to 43.4% for the full year.
We also achieved our 3-year target of returning $25 billion to shareholders. This is a significant accomplishment given our substantial investments in Experience of the Future and technology to drive sustainable, profitable growth. 
As a perspective, over the last 3 years, we invested about $7 billion in the business to drive growth, we increased our dividends per share by over 30% and paid out $10 billion in dividends, and we reduced our shares outstanding about 10% by purchasing $15 billion of treasury stock. 
This also speaks to the progress we've made in enhancing our free cash flow profile. As a result of refranchising efforts and rightsizing our cost structure over the past several years, we've evolved to a more stable and predictable business model. 
In 2019, our free cash flow was $5.7 billion, up over 35% from the prior year. And free cash flow conversion, which measures our ability to convert bottom line earnings to free cash flow, was 95%, a significant uptick from the prior year.
Going forward, our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged: first, to reinvest in existing restaurants and opportunities to grow the business; second, to continue growing our dividend; and third, to buy back shares. We expect our free cash flow to continue to grow, and we expect to continue to return all free cash flow to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases.
Now I'll turn it back to Chris to talk more about our Velocity Growth Plan and where we're headed in 2020."
139488,650488979,1898399,"McDonald's Corporation, Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2020",2020-01-29,"Earnings Calls","McDonald's Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Kevin. Nowhere is the power of our Velocity Growth Plan and franchise model come more to life than in our restaurants. In my recent travels to our European markets, I saw this firsthand everywhere I went. I was struck in particular during a visit",1038,"Thanks, Kevin. Nowhere is the power of our Velocity Growth Plan and franchise model come more to life than in our restaurants. In my recent travels to our European markets, I saw this firsthand everywhere I went. I was struck in particular during a visit to a restaurant in France, a society that famously values good food and beverages, an inviting atmosphere in the spirit of community. 
There, I saw an engaged owner/operator who knew her customers by name and had made her modernized restaurant a vibrant gathering place for the community. Kids were everywhere. Much like their counterparts around the world, young adults were busy multitasking between bites of burgers and fries. Parents appear to be appreciating a moment of rest and other adults were seated in singles and pairs, some having a full meal, others just having coffee. 
It was a scene that reinforced the fundamentals of the Velocity Growth Plan by simultaneously pulling the levers of great-tasting food with good value, convenience and a pleasing customer experience, this owner/operator, and many others across France and other international markets, are growing visits. 
A similar dynamic is playing out in the U.K., where our system is doing a great job meeting customers' expectations for convenience and speed while providing differentiated experiences for guests dining in, visiting the drive-thru or ordering through McDelivery.
This dynamic is playing out in Italy, where customer satisfaction scores are up at drive-thru and dine-in and across all 3 peak dayparts of breakfast, lunch and dinner. The excitement and energy behind our Velocity Growth Plan is widespread. It's a result of this commitment that our business is growing and our strategy continues to deliver.
At the same time, there's a realization that we can and will do more to deliver better taste, greater value and enhanced convenience for our customers. This is the guiding philosophy behind our 3 accelerators: Experience of the Future, digital and delivery. 
With Experience of the Future, our strategy is focused on enhancing the customer experience by improving convenience, hospitality and personalization. As Kevin said, in the U.S., we completed about 2,000 projects in 2019 and are on track for just about all restaurants to be modernized by the end of 2020. 
Customers are recognizing the changes we have made for their benefit. Customer satisfaction scores in the U.S. are at an all-time high. In our IOM markets, where the vast majority of our restaurants are now modernized, we have a strong foundation for long-term success by creating greater convenience, comfort and hospitality for our guests.
Meanwhile, our digital journey, another critical accelerator, is focused on giving customers simpler, smoother and more personal engagement with McDonald's by leveraging the most relevant technology. To that end, we significantly strengthened our digital capabilities in 2019. In markets around the world, for example, a growing community of registered users is redeeming digital-only offers, giving our teams more opportunity to understand customer needs and create engaging digital customer experiences. 
Throughout the year, we made targeted investments to accelerate our capabilities. The suggestive sell capability of Dynamic Yield is now deployed in nearly all outdoor digital menu boards across the U.S. and Australia. In both markets, we're using the technology to make smarter recommendations to customers of menu items they are likely to want.
There's no question that digital is transforming global retail. Across the system, there is great excitement about the role it will play in transforming McDonald's by strengthening and deepening relationships with our customers. So we know there's great potential with digital, but there's also a lot of hard work to do to realize our ambitions. 
I recently announced a creation of a new digital customer engagement team to accelerate customer-focused digital initiatives, including ordering, personalization, payments, loyalty and delivery platforms. Lucy Brady is leading this team. 
Lucy has been a driving force behind the evolution of the Velocity Growth Plan and rapid expansion of our McDelivery platform in her most recent role leading Corporate Strategy and Business Development. Lucy and her team will be responsible for developing new industry-leading digital experiences for our customers, and they'll partner with our global technology team to build new product road maps and technology solutions to fuel growth.
With our third accelerator, we're bringing more customers the McDonald's they love with the convenience of delivery. Today, about 2/3 of our restaurants worldwide, nearly 25,000, offer McDelivery. In just 3 years, McDelivery has gone from generating $1 billion in sales for McDonald's company and franchise restaurants to over $4 billion in sales this past year. 
We now have multiple 3PL partners in most major markets, including the U.S., where the rapid scaling of DoorDash is showing consistent growth; and the U.K., where we recently announced an agreement to partner with Just Eat. We continue to see great runway ahead of us to drive awareness and trial, and we're doubling down on our efforts to encourage frequency and retention.
As we inject speed, agility and flexibility into our system through the accelerators of Experience of the Future, digital and delivery, we continue to focus on the fundamentals of running great restaurants, and customers are noticing. Across our largest markets, we've reduced the time it takes a customer to receive their order by an average of 20 seconds. With this change, most markets saw overall customer satisfaction improve in 2019.
Our Velocity Growth Plan provides a solid and sustainable foundation to grow our business in 2020 and beyond, yet we know that we must stay in tune with evolving customer needs and adapt to changing market conditions. The uncertainties before us are no surprise to anyone on this call, whether due to geopolitical challenges, slow IEO growth, intensifying competition, growing labor costs or continuous technological disruption. 
The topics we've shared before continue to impact the industry and will need to be overcome. And that means continuing to align around a plan that always puts our customers first with great-tasting food, convenience and value. It means collaborating with our franchisee community for a successful local execution.  That means building flexibility into our system for initiatives that accelerate and sustain growth, and provide new opportunities for McDonald's.
To build on that, let me turn it back over to Kevin."

The Velocity Growth Plan has resulted in strong operating performance over the past several years, reinforcing confidence in our ability to deliver long-term sustainable results. 
I want to take a minute to walk through some of our financial expectations for 2020. We anticipate that we'll host an Investor Day this year to provide an update on the business and longer-term expectations. 
With our efficient business model, in 2020, we expect to continue achieving an operating margin in the mid-40s range, which includes the following: Higher depreciation expense of about $80 million versus 2019 related to EOTF in the U.S., with the vast majority in franchise margins. With most of our major refranchising efforts complete, we expect gains on restaurant sales in 2020 to be roughly half of the amount in 2019, with most of the gains in the second half of the year. And as we have become more efficient with G&A required to run the business over the last few years, we have invested in areas that are already contributing to business performance and that we believe will continue to accelerate growth, including technology and research and development. 
As a result, we expect full year 2020 G&A to increase 5% to 7% in constant currencies due to these investments. This includes full year operating costs associated with the 2019 acquisitions of Dynamic Yield and Apprente, R&D spend and costs related to our biennial worldwide convention. We expect G&A percentage increases will be significantly higher in the first half of the year than the second half of the year. We also expect our annual tax rate will be 23% to 25%. 
Finally, based on current exchange rates, we anticipate currency translation will negatively impact EPS by $0.01 to $0.03 in the first quarter and a similar amount for the full year. As usual, this is directional guidance only as rates will change as we move through the year.
Moving on to capital. We ended 2019 with capital expenditures of $2.4 billion, in line with our expectations. As we've previously indicated, in 2020, we expect to spend a similar amount. About half of the total capital will be dedicated to the U.S., including the completion of roughly 1,800 EOTF projects.
Restaurant development also continues to be an important driver of our growth equation. We plan to open about 1,400 new restaurants this year, substantially all in markets outside the U.S. We'll spend approximately $800 million of our capital to open about 400 restaurants in our wholly owned markets. And our developmental licensees and affiliates will spend their capital for the remaining openings, of which over 450 are planned in China.
So while we expect total capital this year will be similar to 2019, we've shifted about $200 million from reinvestment to new restaurants, which are higher-returning investments. As we enter 2020, I'm confident that we're well positioned to deliver sustained long-term profitable growth for the system and our shareholders.
Now I'll turn it back to Chris to close."

On a final note, I'd like to offer a heartfelt thank you to everyone across the McDonald's system who helped us achieve this milestone of $100 billion in system-wide sales this past year.

So as Kevin talked about, and as you alluded to, getting the U.S. to positive guest count growth for us is the #1 priority.

So as Kevin talked about, and as you alluded to, getting the U.S. to positive guest count growth for us is the #1 priority. I think the things that certainly give me confidence or make me feel better about our ability to do that is, as you mentioned, we have really strong alignment with franchisees at this point, that this needs to be a priority. 
One of the things that's, I think, sometimes not fully appreciated about the U.S. owner operator basis, it's largely a franchise -- or it's largely a family business in the U.S. Over half of our franchisees are second and third-generation franchisees. And so for them, they completely recognize that no family business survives or thrives by passing on fewer customers from one generation to the next. So that's an important part of this. 
And then the second is we have a really good understanding of what it's going to take for us to drive guest counts to positive in the U.S. It starts with breakfast. Breakfast is the only daypart in the industry that's seeing traffic growth. We have to win at breakfast. There's obviously a lot of focus and attention that we're going to be putting on that in 2020. And then the second is a recognition that on rest-of-day deal or rest-of-day value, that we need to be competitive on that. 
So I think between alignment with the franchisees, between really, I think, a pretty keen understanding of where we need to focus, I feel good about that, we did see, in Q4, modest sequential improvement on it. But for us, there is certainly not -- it's too early to call a trend on this. We've got to see this happen over 4 or 5 quarters. And so it's going to be something we're going to be paying attention to and I'm sure you guys will be asking us about it as well. So more to come on that."

But I think what you're talking about and what you mentioned is really a recognition that growth in this industry at this point is going to have to come through stealing share. 
Traffic in the industry is pretty muted. There's very little traffic growth. In fact, if you're not growing units, you've got a headwind there. So I think that's one recognition. And certainly, you're seeing, I think, just a lot of people really wanting to make sure that they can get the growth that they need to be able to offset some of the cost headwinds.

Well, as you noted, we did do 2 acquisitions last year, we bought Dynamic Yield, which was going to help us with our suggestive sell capability; and we bought Apprente, which is for voice recognition through the drive-thru of that capability. I would",467,"Yes. Well, as you noted, we did do 2 acquisitions last year, we bought Dynamic Yield, which was going to help us with our suggestive sell capability; and we bought Apprente, which is for voice recognition through the drive-thru of that capability. I would say our typical approach is partner not buy. And so both of those, for somewhat different reasons were, I think, unique situations. I don't foresee that buying tech companies is going to be our approach going forward. 
But we do want to be nimble enough where there are situations that come up that we will make an acquisition. I think in the case of Dynamic Yield, what we saw there was really an opportunity for us to accelerate our rollout of suggestive sell across most of our major markets there with what we believe to be kind of the leading technology in the industry. And so with the idea of really wanting to drive an acceleration and do it with a leading partner, we made that acquisition of Dynamic Yield. Fast forward, even less than a year later, we've got Dynamic Yield in all 10,000-plus U.S. restaurants with a drive-thru. It's fully rolled out in Australia. And we're seeing a comp lift, very consistent with what we had modeled when the acquisition was done. Similarly, with Apprente, we've got Apprente in test in a handful of U.S. restaurants, and we remain optimistic about that. 
So I think what you're seeing really is, for us, just an emphasis on -- we believe digital has the opportunity to really be a huge growth driver for us. When we can partner with people and do it kind of under our traditional model, that's always our preference. But if there are times that we need to do an acquisition, we're certainly not going to take that off the table. I think your question about is there a model in terms of how that gets shared with franchisees, I think one benefit is when you get the lift that we are getting with something like Dynamic Yield, we obviously participate through rent and service on that. So I'd say the first part is all of these are meant to drive top line growth, and when we see that, we certainly participate from rent and service.
On the ongoing costs, the ongoing costs do get passed through to franchisees as part of our normal tech fee. We kind of separate tech costs between development costs and sort of the ongoing operating costs. We will typically pay for the development costs on our own, and then the ongoing costs are what gets shared through a tech fee arrangement with our franchisees. So that's been kind of our model for a long period of time. I don't see that model changing."

One of the things that I do feel good about with the U.S. is when you look at the check growth that we've gotten, it's really come through a number of different things. There has not been sort of a one-trick pony on that. We're seeing the majority of that growth is coming through mix as opposed to just kind of straight menu price. But then as you decompose mix, you've got a number of factors that are at work there. You've got delivery, which is delivering 2x the average check of a regular order. You have Dynamic Yield, which is typically leading to add-ons to an order. You have our self-order kiosk, where we know that people tend to have larger orders when they do self-order kiosk. You've seen some of our promotional items like donut sticks, D $1 $2 $3 as a value, which are really driving add-on activity. 
So I think, for me, I do feel better about how we went after check growth in 2019 because it was heavily mix-driven from that. But there is a pricing element to this. The inflation that we're seeing out there, particularly on the labor side, that does get priced through. And so I think as we head into 2020, the conversation we've been having with franchisees, which gets back to the opening question, is we've just got to make sure that we have balance. We need to have a balance between check growth and we need to get to transaction growth, and that's what everybody in the U.S. is working toward right now."

What I would say is it will be potentially different in different countries. So right now, we're certainly getting a bigger lift from Dynamic Yield in the U.S. than in Australia. In Australia, they had a rudimentary suggestive sell already in the drive-thru. So as we put in Dynamic Yield, there wasn't as large a lift as we're certainly experiencing in the U.S. But the big positive about Dynamic Yield is our plans would be to take that similar decisioning engine-type logic and be able to use that further in kiosk and global mobile app ultimately. So that we need -- can continue getting further sales lifts in other digital mechanisms also."

So we've been having a lot of conversations on that. As you would imagine, I'm not going to telegraph on this call in terms of how we actually plan to go about it. 
But I think back to a couple of the earlier points that we've talked about here, there is strong alignment with the owner/operators the U.S. that we need to be in a situation where we're getting both transaction growth as well as check growth.

Right now, as you would expect, our priority is really on our employees, on our customers, doing everything we can to make sure that they are safe and taken care of. And so in that vein, we've been working a lot with the local authorities, particularly in the Hubei province. We have closed all restaurants in the Hubei province, which is several hundred restaurants that have been closed. But importantly, we do still have about 3,000 restaurants in the country that are still open. So several hundred closed, but 3,000 that are still open.
We've also, with the China team, we've put in place an epidemic prevention and control task force, which is something we're doing again in combination with the local authorities there. And it's everything from using our kitchens to help provide meals to health care workers in hospitals. We're doing things in terms of giving medical screening for customers who come to some of our restaurants. So it's really an ""all hands on deck"" effort from that vantage point.
China for us is a critical strategic market, but I think it's probably more because of the potential that we see in that market as opposed to its materiality to the business today. Just to put it in perspective, when you think about China, it does represent about 9% of our global restaurant count, but it's about 4% to 5% of system-wide sales and it's only about 3% of op income. And so while, again, China is a critical market for us and we're very concerned about the situation over there, its actual impact on our business is going to be fairly small, assuming, again, that it stays contained to China."

I'll talk about the G&A first, and then I'll let Chris come back and talk about value and the franchisees. Related to G&A, a couple of points. We've talked about how we've gotten more efficient with our day-to-day G&A, and we're investing in technology and R&D, so things like Dynamic Yield and Apprente.  And the things we're investing in are either top line drivers or cost saving potentials. So that's how we think about kind of some of these specific investments. 
We have decreased our overall G&A as a percent of sales from around 2.8% in 2016 to 2.2% in 2019. And roughly -- today, roughly more than 10% of that G&A spend is actually depreciation and amortization related to technology spend. So a chunk of that G&A is noncash as it relates to prior year spend. We do -- as you indicate, we expect full year G&A in 2020 to be up 5% to 7% in constant currency due to those investments. But that's -- because I'm lapping partial year on some of the acquisitions, we now will have full year in 2020. So that level of increase, we certainly do not expect going forward. But as we've talked about for 2020 or as I mentioned in my script, first half of 2020 will be significantly higher growth rates than the second half of 2020. 
And then, I guess, the only other thing I'd say is we're in the midst of updating all of our analysis and long-term models also with the G&A. But so far, we haven't seen anything that significantly changes any of our thinking on G&A long term. So we don't think about it any differently today than  I did a couple of years ago. But I do have -- obviously, to your point, we had an increase in '19, we have a little larger increase in '20. But certainly, we don't expect that increase to be a run rate increase going forward."

Now that can take a number of different forms. That could take investments in the restaurant. And some of the capital investments that we've been doing, it can take the form of putting more labor in the restaurants and it can take the form of value as you talking about. So to me, it's more about the point that our U.S. owner/operators are in a really healthy spot right now. I think that's also reflected in their sentiment, and they want to keep it going.

If you do the math, basically, with all of the guidance we've given, hopefully you get to similar places where we are, which is we do expect EPS growth for 2020 to meet the high-single-digit target. Certainly, a lower tax rate is helping that growth rate. And as you mentioned, it may not be even growth rates quarter-by-quarter through the year because of some of the individual quarter pressures. But as we look at the full year, we do have an expectation of being within that high-single-digit EPS growth rate target for 2020.
Regarding cash return, we're fortunate to generate a substantial amount of cash flow and be able to fund both the investments that we want to make in the business and still return a significant amount to shareholders. As I mentioned in my remarks, our free cash flow was $5.7 billion in 2019, which was up over 35%. Free cash flow conversion was around 95%. As we had internal discussions and discussed with several of our large shareholders, we decided not to give a specific dollar target over a 3-year period for cash return. 
But there is -- but I do want to reiterate our capital allocation philosophy because there is no change to that. As I mentioned, the priorities remain the same: first, to reinvest in existing restaurants and opportunities to grow the business; second, to continue growing our dividend; and third, to buy back shares. We do expect to continue to return all free cash flow to shareholders. And in our modeling, we anticipate net incremental debt of roughly $1 billion each year for the next few years. So that should give you an idea of kind of where the cash return comes out to that. Thanks."

Well, I think in the U.S., I'm really pleased with the performance that the team put up in 2019. As we talked about in our comments, we're at record customer satisfaction scores in the U.S. driven by operations, and we're seeing it broad-based across a number of ops metrics that we're looking at. The team did a really nice job in 2019 speeding up our drive-thrus. We saw good performance there. 
But I think what we're also excited about is we think there's more that we can do there. We think that there's certainly 20, 30 additional seconds that we want to go try to get in 2020. And it's a combination of activities. It's a combination of menu simplification moves. It's a combination of training and really making sure we have the right focus. We're doing things to bring fun into the restaurant to create kind of that competitive rivalry there. 
And then technology is a component to that. I'd say right now, in 2020, I don't see technology necessarily being a huge part of what's going to be driving cash flow or driving speed of service, rather. We have ZOOM timers, which is an internal thing that we use, that really gives the team a very detailed breakdown of each kind of part of the customer journey as they go through the drive-thrus. We can be very pinpointed on how to drive speed of service. But that's now deployed in most of our restaurants. So I think in 2020, it's going to be a lot of blocking and tackling. 
Longer term, we're obviously very excited about what technology can do to help with speed of service, which is why we've done acquisitions like we did with Apprente. If we're able to get that commercialized and deployed, that's certainly going to be something that helps us with the speed of service in the future."

I think, for us, it's really all about finding a product that works in our restaurants. And so that has an operations component. Our menu, as you know, is much more broad than some of our competitors. So that's something we need to be mindful of in terms of how -- what we might do in chicken, what knock-on effect that might have on the rest of menu from a speed of service. And then there are some equipment differences in terms of the equipment that we have in our restaurants versus what some of our competitors would have. 
What we've been out testing -- we're in a test right now, as you probably know. But we're testing a number of different approaches in terms of not just what you might do from a product standpoint but are there things that we might want to do differently from an operations standpoint or are there things we might want to think about differently from an equipment standpoint. So like anything with menu in McDonald's, it's a little bit of a Rubik's Cube of what's the customer looking for, what works operationally and then the business fundamentals under that. But I think I feel good about where we're going to net out on chicken. I think we're getting close to having something that we're excited to bring to customers."

But I want to start by acknowledging the human toll of this pandemic. Let me express our deepest sympathies to those inside and outside of McDonald's who have been affected by this virus. In particular, I want to extend heartfelt thanks and gratitude to health care professionals, first responders and other essential workers around the world who have put their own lives at risk to help others. 
The global crisis has impacted people and communities everywhere. In the face of such enormous challenges, I'm immensely proud of the entire McDonald's system and the tireless efforts of our franchisees, crew members, suppliers and company employees. Where we've been able to stay open safely and responsible, they've made it possible for McDonald's to continue offering great-tasting, affordable and convenient food amidst widespread change and disruption. 
Turning now to our performance for the quarter. Our Velocity Growth Plan drove strong results in 2019. That momentum carried into January and February. Since then, the outbreak of coronavirus around the world has created a major business disruption that adversely impacted our performance. 
Beginning in mid-March, we experienced a significant decline in our business due to the pandemic, dragging down our Q1 global comparable sales by 3.4%. We're now operating in a completely different world, and we expect these changes to persist long after the crisis is over. 
In times like these, we take strength from the resilience and experiences we've developed over our 65-year history. While we're not immune to the immediate pressures threatening our global community, we came into the situation better positioned than most, and we believe that we will strengthen our competitive advantages following the crisis. 
Entering the crisis, our system was in great shape. In addition to McDonald's strong balance sheet, franchisee cash flows in most of our major markets were at or near record highs in 2019. Our global restaurant estate had been largely modernized. And we've made significant investments to build new capabilities and delivery in digital that have proven to be critical to our business during the pandemic. 
We now navigate through the crisis. McDonald's unmatched global footprint, scale and deep operational expertise are also proving to be significant strengths for us. Specifically, with a presence in over 100 markets, we've been able to develop insights and best practices as countries move through different phases of the outbreak. 
In China, where the outbreak began, we quickly learned how to adjust our operations to enhance crew and customer safety. We developed new positioning guides and piloted contactless delivery. These solutions, along with many others, were then shared around the globe. As each country develops their own innovations, these are quickly shared by our global restaurant solutions group across all markets. Our system's ability to quickly adapt operations across 40,000 restaurants has been incredible to see. 
The size and scale of our supply chain has also proven to be a significant advantage during this crisis. To date, despite the disruption of our business, we have had no break in supply for any food, packaging materials, toys, equipment, logistics or other solutions globally. 
I want to give particular recognition to our supply chain team for sourcing vital PPE materials, such as masks. To give you just some sense of the scale with which we operate, our global supply chain team has sourced over 120 million masks to meet the needs of the McDonald's system. 
And of course, McDonald's strong drive-thru development has continued to allow us to safely serve millions of customers each day while adhering to social distancing mandates or guidelines. In the U.S., nearly 95% of our locations have drive-thru, and virtually all are open to serve health care professionals, first responders, other essential workers and customers looking for their McDonald's moment. Similarly, Australia and Canada have been able to safely remain open. 
Finally, I should note that our global delivery sales are up significantly versus pre-covid. Our restaurant footprint and customers love for our brand make us an essential partner for any third-party operator. 
Once we emerge from this crisis, our expectation is that McDonald's can further extend its leadership in every market where we operate. To do this, it's essential that our franchisees have the financial wherewithal to capitalize on the opportunities we think will be available to our system. For that reason, we've taken several steps to help our franchisees and developmental licensees maintain their liquidity and financial strength. While there will continue to be difficult decisions along the way, we are providing timely, targeted and temporary financial support, which Kevin will walk through in a few minutes. 
From a customer perspective, we're encouraged by some of our early learnings that lead us to believe customers will be seeking known brands and familiar routines. We're also seeing a heightened focus on value and convenience. In China, this was reflected in the response to our recent Big Mac promotion, showed that after a prolonged disruption of their daily lives, customers are craving comfort in our iconic core menu items. We've also seen this where we've been able to safely remain open in cities like Tokyo, Berlin and Chicago and in Northern France, where we slowly began reopening restaurants last week. 
As I mentioned earlier, our reopening efforts in our European markets will be phased and grounded in what's best for the safety of our customers and crew. Similar to what we did in U.S. and Canada, we'll be serving a limited menu in many markets, focused primarily on our core items when we reopen in countries around the world. Through this, we will focus on what McDonald's has done so well for decades, serving great-tasting food fast. 
This is a challenging and unpredictable time. Looking at comparable sales, we expect the second quarter as a whole to be significantly worse than what we experienced for the full month of March. Kevin will talk about what we've seen in the month of April. 
As things stand, we believe we reached a trough in terms of number of restaurants closed in late March. We are planning for limited reopenings in markets in the near future. The exact trajectory of our recovery, however, is highly uncertain and dependent on many factors outside our control, such as government mandates, the risk of a second wave of infection to the availability of testing and the overall economic backdrop. We're developing contingency plans for a wide variety of scenarios. 
From our experience in China as well as from our experience closing and opening 10,000 restaurants as part of our EOTF remodel program in the U.S., we do know that customers will not immediately revert back to their pre shutdown routines. For example, we know that breakfast will be the most challenged daypart. We know that a focus on core menu will be critical due to both customer interest in familiar favorites and operational lease. We know that value will be a necessary element to reengage our customers. Each market is rebuilding their marketing calendar to reflect these learnings and many others so we can reignite our business momentum. 
But our first priority has been and will continue to be safeguarding the health and safety of our people and customers. The trust that McDonald's brand has developed over the last 65 years is our most precious asset, and we will never put that at risk. We remain closely aligned with the expert judgment of scientific and government leaders in our various markets, and we support the focus on widespread testing as a central element to broader recovery efforts. 
Whatever the cadence of reopening markets, we know we can adapt. McDonald's is a remarkable system, and I'm confident that the strengths we've exhibited both before and during the crisis will be even more apparent as we emerge into a new post-coronavirus world. 
I'll now turn it over to Kevin to talk about our first quarter results."

We began 2020 with strong top line momentum. Global comp sales were up 7.2% through February, reflecting strong performance in most countries around the world and the benefit of leap year. Beginning in mid-March, consumer traffic began to d",1718,"Thanks, Chris. We began 2020 with strong top line momentum. Global comp sales were up 7.2% through February, reflecting strong performance in most countries around the world and the benefit of leap year. Beginning in mid-March, consumer traffic began to decline significantly due to the impact of COVID-19 as we temporarily closed some restaurants and shifted to limited operations and others when many parts of the world experienced government restrictions and shelter in place guidelines. As a result, global comp sales were down 22% in the month of March, and down 3.4% in the first quarter. 
Today, I'll walk through March and April trends to provide perspective on how comp sales have progressed over the past few months. 
International Operated market comp sales were down 35% for the month of March. In the second half of March, comp sales were down roughly 70% as several markets like France, Italy, Spain and the U.K. temporarily closed all restaurants, and other markets like Australia, Canada and Germany had drive-thru delivery and takeaway only or limited hours and menus. Comp sales have continued to be down about 70% through April in this segment, as many of the fully closed markets are now just beginning to reopen. 
Turning to the U.S. Comp sales were negative 13% for the month of March. Beginning in mid-March and continuing through mid-April, U.S. comp sales were consistently down about 25%. However, we have begun to see some improvement in the last couple of weeks. We expect April comp sales to be down about 20%. 
Also, over the last several weeks, the U.S. has experienced a significant increase in average check across all channels. This is due to an increase in party size as well as evolving consumer behavior, with daily routines interrupted and fewer transactions at the breakfast daypart. 
Not surprisingly, the U.S. has also seen sales impacted on weekends more than weekdays, as consumers leave their houses only when necessary. And we've seen a shift in sales mix by order channel, as nearly all restaurants are operating drive-thru, delivery and takeaway only. 
Prior to the impact of COVID-19, the drive-thru accounted for about 2/3 of all sales in the U.S. As consumers shifted from in-person ordering to drive-thru and delivery channels, drive-thru now accounts for nearly 90% of sales in the U.S. 
We're also seeing an uptick in delivery and digital transactions per restaurant. And all of these trends are similar to what we've seen in China and other markets. 
Comp sales in the International Developmental Licensed segment were down 19% for the month of March. Similar to the other segments, in the second half of March, comp sales were down even more significantly, reflecting the impact of COVID-19 as it's spread throughout the segment. 
In China, approximately 25% of restaurants were closed in early February. By the end of March, substantially all restaurants had reopened. However, the market continues to experience a reduced level of demand as consumers have not fully returned to their pre covid routines, resulting in negative comp sales since the initial outbreak in late January. 
Comp sales were down over 20% in the first quarter, and trends have improved in April to negative mid-teens. 
In terms of new unit development, China opened over 100 restaurants in the quarter. We remain confident in new restaurant growth opportunities in China. However, we expect time lines to be delayed due to the crisis. 
I want to transition to some areas that are most relevant to understanding the impact of COVID-19 on our results, including flow-through considerations on the P&L, corporate liquidity and franchisee financial health. 
Starting with the P&L. As we've become a more heavily franchised business over the last several years, our operating model is designed to tap into the entrepreneurial spirit of our local business owners and for efficient conversion of top line growth to the bottom line. In other words, as comp sales grow, the fixed nature of our franchise cost structure results in strong flow-through to the bottom line. Conversely, in the current environment of declining sales, we see less flow through to franchise margin dollars. Our company-operated restaurant expenses are more variable in areas such as food and paper and labor costs. So the flow-through to margin dollars is a bit better in our company-operated restaurants in the current environment. 
For perspective, in March with a comp sales of negative 22%, our total restaurant margin dollars declined $350 million, with about 75% of the decline driven by franchise margin dollars. Most of the decline was in the IOM segment due to the significant number of temporary restaurant closures. 
Turning to G&A. We saw an increase of about $95 million in constant currencies or 19% versus first quarter last year. About 2/3 of the increase relates to nonrecurring costs, including $40 million for the cancellation of our biennial worldwide convention, and roughly $20 million related to payments of contractual obligations as we reduce the scope and ongoing spend in R&D work of certain restaurant technology. The remaining increase relates to the run costs associated with our acquisitions of Dynamic Yield and Apprente, as well as continued depreciation and amortization costs related to technology. As a reminder, both of these acquisitions occurred subsequent to first quarter 2019, so we're not lapping those acquisitions yet. 
Our investment in digital customer engagement remains a priority for our business. As I mentioned before, we've already seen the benefits of Dynamic Yield in our operating results. These digital investments enable us to give customers more choice and flexibility in how they order, pay and receive their food during this unprecedented time and will remain important in serving customers as we think about our business beyond this crisis. 
As we navigate through uncharted waters, we're taking a disciplined approach to decision making. This includes reviewing all investments and reducing or delaying spending as we rescope priorities in some areas and redirect dollars to other priorities. We're focusing resources on projects and initiatives that can reasonably be implemented and executed in the near term, both in terms of cost and time and will also benefit the system for the long term. 
As we make these assessments, we'll also prioritize our resources against the most critical needs of the business. Due to COVID-19, we expect a few lines of the other operating section of the P&L to be impacted in 2020 as well. Gains on restaurant sales are expected to be down about $100 million as a result of minimal restaurant sale activity for the rest of the year. Our equity and earnings of affiliates is expected to be down substantially, and we expect to have some additional reserves for bad debts related to rent and royalty deferrals subsequent to March. 
The result of all of this is that we expect our operating cash flow to be down significantly this year. We entered the crisis with a strong balance sheet, and we've taken a number of actions to preserve financial flexibility. In addition to currently reviewing our G&A costs, we suspended our share repurchase program in early March. We secured $6.5 billion of new financing in March, including $5.5 billion of debt issuances at various maturities and a new $1 billion line of credit that we drew upon immediately. 
In terms of capital expenditures, we've taken a very practical approach to development activity. We suspended Experience of the Future groundbreaks in the U.S. and new restaurant openings around the world as COVID-19 began to spread. Given that our first quarter CapEx is typically about 20% of the full year and many projects are delayed or on hold, we now have some flexibility with decisions for the majority of our planned capital spend for the year. As a result, we're reducing our 2020 spending by about $1 billion from our initial expectation of $2.4 billion. 
I also want to acknowledge our dividend. We paid our first quarter dividend at the beginning of March, prior to the widespread impact of COVID. McDonald's remains financially strong, and our capital allocation priorities remain investing in the business for growth and prioritizing dividends to our shareholders. We will continue to manage and utilize our funds in a judicious manner that focuses on ensuring the company is able to grow the business and our franchisees remain financially strong. 
As I mentioned earlier, we've taken a number of actions to ensure that the company is in a sound financial position and to put our franchisees and developmental licensee partners around the world in a position to be successful in running their businesses. As Covid spread quickly around the world, our first step was determining operating procedures, resulting in temporary closures of all restaurants in some countries and limited operations in others, as I've mentioned. That was quickly followed by providing broad-based financial liquidity assistance in the form of rent and royalty deferrals that were generally applicable to all franchisees within various markets because we needed to make quick decisions to alleviate franchisee concerns and put them in the best position to maintain their businesses. Generally, we've deferred the collection of rent and royalties earned in March and April in most markets around the world. Cash is collected on a 1-month lag, so the cash impact of these deferrals occurs in April and May. This deferral amounts to roughly $1 billion of liquidity assistance that we committed to our franchisees and developmental licensee partners across the system. We also work closely with lenders, suppliers and distributors to extend payment terms to franchisees where necessary. 
Now we're assessing the financial health and liquidity of specific at risk-franchisee and developmental licensee organizations. This assessment includes various sales projection scenarios and takes into account the impact of liquidity assistance measures provided by the company, suppliers, lenders and governments. We've developed an objective framework for making decisions regarding which specific franchisee and deal organizations may need further liquidity assistance and how we may support them. This will help ensure a consistent and equitable approach to decision-making across all of our markets. As Chris mentioned, our general philosophy is for any assistance to be timely, targeted and temporary. The financial health and strength of our franchisees has been a competitive advantage for McDonald's for years, and we expect that to continue post COVID-19. 
Now I'll turn it back to Chris."

While there's much we don't know about the future course of this pandemic, we are taking the necessary actions to ensure we will emerge from this crisis in a position of strength. Looking ahead, we know these unprecedented times will bring about some fundamental changes to the way businesses, including ours, operate. What will remain constant is our commitment to maintaining the strong level of trust our customers have in the business. 
We're also beginning to think about our strategy in the aftermath of COVID-19. While elements of Velocity Growth Plan will continue to be important, we're making adjustments in real time and there will likely need to be further changes. We'll look to provide updates on our overall progress later in the year. 
In these challenging times, I'm immensely proud of the way our system has banded together to stay true to our purpose to feed and foster community. The countless inspiring examples of this around the world showcase the real impact McDonald's has in the communities in which we operate. I'm proud to share a handful of these stories. 
In the U.S., our restaurants are offering our appreciation with free thank you meal boxes to first responders and health care workers to thank them for their tireless efforts to protect us all. These include favorite breakfast and lunch menu items, packaged and happy meal boxes with a thank you note in place of a toy. We're in the middle of this 2-week show of appreciation, and we've already provided nearly 4 million thank you meals. 
Across Europe, many markets are providing free drinks, coffee and meals to first responders and health care workers on the front lines. In Madrid, a restaurant just reopened solely to serve frontline workers at the nearby hospital. 
In Australia, we've added staples of milk, eggs and bread to our menus, enabling customers to use McDonald's contactless drive-thru and takeaway to shopper basics, providing a safe and easy way for customers to shop. 
And in many of the communities around the world that we call home, extra food within the supply chain is being redistributed through nonprofit organizations and local food banks to feed communities in need. 
We've also donated nearly 1.5 million masks to COVID relief efforts. 
As I said earlier, we entered this crisis with a solid foundation. While we face significant disruptions and challenges, we remain confident in our ability to adapt, as we've done throughout our 65 years to secure our long-term success. And now we'll begin Q&A."

So can you give us a sense about how things look in those markets as you get back to reopening. Do you see the snapback as strong as it's been in the U.S.? And then perhaps you can dig into that comment about the support you're offering to franchisees, especially in those hardest hit markets."

In the international, particularly in our IOM markets in Europe, we have a number of countries that are completely closed based on government mandates. We are just beginning the process of reopening on a limited basis in a number of those markets. And so it's probably a little premature for us to give you any indication of what the overall trajectory is going to be. But I would say we've been really encouraged when we do start to open limited restaurants by the demand. You may have seen in the last week, as we've opened up in a few of these markets, we had a 3-hour wait at one of our restaurants in France. For people to get through the drive-thru in Austria, we had a 2-mile line of people looking to get into the drive-thru. And I think our overall view is, as markets start to open up, this desire to really return to familiar favorites, to brands that are known is very, very powerful. And I think the fact that we also have a strong orientation toward convenience and value that I think are also 2 key elements. We are optimistic. We certainly are expecting that we're going to be able to take share in those markets. And so I think we, like everybody else, are closely watching what the overall level of customer demand is going to be. We do feel like we're well positioned on that, but probably too soon to say. 
In terms of financial support that we're providing to franchisees, let me pass it over to Kevin to address."

David, related to the franchisee assistance, I'd say it's similar to what we've done in the U.S.. As I talked about in my remarks, at the beginning, what we really did was kind of this broad-based assistance that was deferring a couple of months of rent and royalties, generally for most franchisees around the world. The other thing that's happened is essentially, we've converted our rent to variable rent based on sales. So the restaurants that have been closed effectively aren't paying rent because they don't have sales. The only other thing I would point out is, there's various different forms of government assistance in each country. So certain countries provide more assistance related to kind of workers who aren't working temporarily, which means that in some of the markets, they've been able to effectively help the franchisees in terms of being able to keep their workers, but not at the -- while the restaurants are closed. And then in several markets, we've actually been working with other companies to actually even find places where employees have been able to work. So in a couple of them, we've partnered up with companies like Aldi and others to provide temporary employment for our workers while our restaurants are closed. So I wouldn't say that our assistance is substantially different on the international side. Again, we started at the broad base, and now we're looking in both internationally and in the U.S."

I think in terms of in terms of the best practices, we have learned a lot around how we adjust operations to really make sure that we're providing a safe environment for our crew and for our customers. In almost every market where we operate, the U.S. included, there are dedicated teams that are meeting daily and reviewing procedures and connected to our global restaurant Solutions group to understand these best practices. In the case of the U.S., they've made 50 different changes to operating procedures as we've learned more. And it's everything from positioning guides to protective barriers to other things like masks, how often, how frequently we are sanitizing services, that has been really helpful for us in terms of just making sure that our restaurant continue to be a safe environment for both us help with the demand that we're seeing. I think as people get confident about our ability to test certainly helps, but there is a benefit that I think you could attribute to the stimulus checks. I think there's probably also, as customers are starting to venture out a little bit more, this desire to really go to familiar brands. You saw it in -- in the -- away from -- or in the at-home occasion, center of the store, familiar brands in grocery really benefited as people were staying home. I think that same dynamic is going to be at play as people start to come out looking for familiar brands. So I think there's a variety of different things that play there in the U.S., but certainly, we've been more encouraged by what we've seen in the last couple of weeks in the U.S."

But in the past, you've given some detail on what's happened to franchisee cash flow.

So the question is, are rent and royalty deferrals enough to prevent some of your bottom quartile franchisees from failing? And I think you alluded to this in the prepared remarks, but there maybe some other options in the table. So if you could talk about what those might be for those troubled franchisees.

And that was the broad-based deferrals that Kevin referenced. Now as we've had more time, we've essentially been able to go through and do stress test, if you will, for every single franchisee organization and have developed a sense of what we think their liquidity needs are under a variety of different scenarios in terms of how this business recovers. I think the important point that Kevin talked about in terms of the principles of timely, targeted and temporary is, we will provide the support when it's apparent that what the scenario is that we're dealing with. So that's the timely element, which is, who knows how many of this progresses. But we certainly have a sense of, depending on which trajectory we go, who's going to be at risk.

I guess, one, I would just remind everyone that we did come into 2020 with most of our franchisees in most of our major markets either at or near all-time high cash flows.

So we are cognizant of that and certainly are having the appropriate discussions with those franchisees. And to Chris' point, I think now we're at the point where we are looking at organization by organization and seeing where we may need to step in and provide further assistance or make sure that they're getting all the assist they need from lenders, suppliers, et cetera. 
Related to kind of the loans, I guess, I would just remind everyone, our operators are small independent business owners who are eligible for the loans. They're working with their advisers to determine kind of the needs for their business. Our understanding is that most have been able to get approved and which would enable them to keep paying their crew and continue running their businesses. And then we'll certainly continue to work it with them to make sure that they've got the liquidity to keep running their businesses. So I think we feel pretty comfortable in general about franchisees, but there certainly will be a few that we need to just think about how they get further assistance if they need."

This is not a large majority of operators or a large piece of the operators. It's generally maybe a few operators in each market that we're working with. So it isn't a widespread issue that we're dealing with. 
Related to cash flow, and let me try and put that in some context, and I'll go back and just -- I may repeat some of the things that I mentioned in my remarks, but remember, we entered the crisis certainly from a position of financial strength. From a corporate standpoint, we're obviously -- we have a strong investment-grade credit rating, that's always been important to us, so we've been maintaining that. And I talked about our franchisees also entered into the year pretty strong financially. As we got into this year and the impact of COVID was growing, you would have seen that we acted pretty quickly to bolster our cash position, certainly in anticipation of the changing macroeconomic and business conditions around the world. We secured $6.5 billion of new financing in March, which was about 5.5 -- well, which was $5.5 billion of bonds and $1 billion of line of credit. And then we also still have full access to a committed line of credit of $3.5 billion. So I know cash burn is a frequent topic of discussion lately. We certainly keep our eye on that, but we do have confidence in our liquidity position based on our current cash balance and our ability to get further access if we need it in the markets. We ended the first quarter a little over $5 billion of cash on our balance sheet. And again, remember, we still have that $3.5 billion line of credit that's untapped if we ever should need it. I'd say our cash outflows right now are fairly consistent month-to-month for things like G&A and capital and lease expense costs. In this environment, the big variable is the cash inflows. Because, as you know, we operate in over 100 countries. We've given some of that -- those rent and royalty deferrals of over $1 billion. And now we're looking at those individual operator organizations that may need something further. Having said all that, between the temporary restaurant closures and the deferrals, our cash inflows certainly will be significantly less in the second quarter than normal. So we're likely to have negative free cash flow in the second quarter. But assuming that the countries continue to reopen on the schedules that we're seeing right now, and again most of those are in the European markets, and assuming franchisees can have the ability to pay their rents and royalties, we would expect that the free cash flow would turn back to positive in the third quarter. So we do think second quarter will be a rougher quarter in terms of cash flow. But right now, based on current plans, we would expect that to turn around back to positive in the third quarter."

So before January and February, you noted that comp was balanced between traffic and ticket in the U.S. I guess if you could just talk a little bit about does that account for leap year? Effectively, you haven't had positive traffic in the U.S. in a while. I'm trying to understand what the drivers might have been. And then after the emergence of pandemic, you've talked about global delivery sales being up significant. Could you just quantify share of sales or year-over-year growth in delivery? Maybe give some color on digital ordering as well since, presumably, even some of the drive-thru orders or carry out would have been digital. So just a little bit more context before and after."

We were really encouraged by the traffic trends that we were seeing entering into the new year, and that excludes the extra benefit that we then got through leap year. So we were in a good traffic position through the first couple of months in the U.S. Leap year further helped that and then we had COVID and kind of the rest from there in terms of what we've been working through. 
I think from a delivery standpoint, the important thing is the vast majority of our business is still drive-thru-driven in the U.S. And so while delivery is up significantly, it's not the predominant thing that is driving our business. The predominant channel is really through the drive-thru. Kevin, I don't know if you have anything else you want to add."

But as you mentioned, as we've referenced as well, the pace of recovery in China has been slow. We're not seeing a V-shaped recovery in China. The business trends are improving. But they're still running negative to where we were a year ago. I think there's a couple of things that are worth just noting as to reasons for that. The first is we had substantially more restaurants in China that were fully closed than have to reopen. So that's a larger disruption than if you're able to kind of continue to be open and then just moderating your channels. So that was one issue. The second is, just a reminder, in China, only 15% of the restaurants have drive-thru. And I would say one of the things that we have seen as a real strength of our business is drive-thru penetration. And so when you have a strong drive-thru penetration, I think your ability for that business, that market to get -- bounced back, that's certainly an added benefit.

People are still largely staying at home even in markets that are able to remain open. So that is adversely affecting even in restaurants that are open comp trends. But again, it varies really market by market. 
I think if you then go to your second question, which is about percent of restaurants primarily in Europe, again, I'll focus there that have drive-thru.

Is the thought process to complete them as soon as feasible? Or are franchisees seeking to largely just delay beyond this year?"

So we've said we're going to reduce CapEx by roughly $1 billion. Part of that or a chunk of that really are U.S. Experience of the Future projects, we've substantially reduced those projects for this year. Now to your point,",266,"Yes, thanks for the question. So we've said we're going to reduce CapEx by roughly $1 billion. Part of that or a chunk of that really are U.S. Experience of the Future projects, we've substantially reduced those projects for this year. Now to your point, I view that as, as soon as it's reasonably feasible to keep going on those, many of the franchisees will want to continue doing those. We have gotten some requests even already for some franchisees to continue those projects. So I would expect a lot of those would get pushed into 2021. But I think the franchisees and rightly so want to understand that the business is back to operating, I'll say, more normally before they go invest substantial dollars and close their restaurants for a period of time also. So that's a piece of it. We're also reducing openings in many of the markets outside the U.S., again partly because if you think about several of those countries, they've been closed for a period of time now. They're just getting back up and running now the normal operations. And so the disruption of going and opening new restaurants right now at a maybe quicker pace probably isn't the right thing to do for a lot of the franchisees there. So that pace will slow in 2020. But again, I think that's relatively easy to continue picking up. And we certainly still see opportunities for growth in most of those markets. So it isn't a long-term change in opportunity, but it is a pause in 2020 for a lot of that."

And then the other menu. Yes, and limited menu, it's been interesting, and it's a good question. So we have gone to a limited menu in the U.S. as well as a number of other markets. I think one of the things that each of the markets are thinking about is as you go back to more of a standard menu, do you immediately revert back to sort of everything that was on the menu? Or does this maybe provide us an opportunity to do some things that get that balance right between margin, operationally, speed of service, et cetera. So I think it's probably safe to say at this point that, that is going to be a market-by-market decision, but I would say every market is thinking about, does it make sense to go all the way back to where we were pre-crisis or maybe we want to go back in more of a staged way and add some items, but not all items?

Your other point, though, which we did talk about is, and as I mentioned in my remarks, the world is going to look different coming out of this crisis, and we expect that many of those changes are going to be enduring. And so part of the work that we're going through is really thinking about our strategy kind of in this post-COVID world. We've got a great foundation to build on with Velocity Growth Plan, but I think it's probably fair to say that we're not just going to pick up the Velocity Growth Plan playbook and kind of resume business as usual. There are going to need to be adjustments to that.

We have some contractual obligations we needed to pay for stopping some R&D work. That cost us about $20 million. And then we also have an unusual dynamic where there's a portion of our people costs that are capitalized related to restaurant openings. And as we reduce our restaurant openings, less of those costs will be able to be capitalized, that will likely cost us another $30 million to $35 million of G&A. Now that's not additional cash because we were paying those folks already, but it's the accounting of them where it may end up in G&A instead of where it would have been capitalized on development. So we've got some offsetting things going on in G&A for the year."

But I want to start by acknowledging the human toll of this pandemic. Let me express our deepest sympathies to those inside and outside of McDonald's who have been affected by this virus. In particular, I want to extend heartfelt thanks and gratitude to health care professionals, first responders and other essential workers around the world who have put their own lives at risk to help others. 
The global crisis has impacted people and communities everywhere. In the face of such enormous challenges, I'm immensely proud of the entire McDonald's system and the tireless efforts of our franchisees, crew members, suppliers and company employees. Where we've been able to stay open safely and responsible, they've made it possible for McDonald's to continue offering great-tasting, affordable and convenient food amidst widespread change and disruption. 
Turning now to our performance for the quarter. Our Velocity Growth Plan drove strong results in 2019. That momentum carried into January and February. Since then, the outbreak of coronavirus around the world has created a major business disruption that adversely impacted our performance. 
Beginning in mid-March, we experienced a significant decline in our business due to the pandemic, dragging down our Q1 global comparable sales by 3.4%. We're now operating in a completely different world, and we expect these changes to persist long after the crisis is over. 
In times like these, we take strength from the resilience and experiences we've developed over our 65-year history. While we're not immune to the immediate pressures threatening our global community, we came into the situation better positioned than most, and we believe that we will strengthen our competitive advantages following the crisis. 
Entering the crisis, our system was in great shape. In addition to McDonald's strong balance sheet, franchisee cash flows in most of our major markets were at or near record highs in 2019. Our global restaurant estate had been largely modernized. And we've made significant investments to build new capabilities and delivery in digital that have proven to be critical to our business during the pandemic. 
We now navigate through the crisis. McDonald's unmatched global footprint, scale and deep operational expertise are also proving to be significant strengths for us. Specifically, with a presence in over 100 markets, we've been able to develop insights and best practices as countries move through different phases of the outbreak. 
In China, where the outbreak began, we quickly learned how to adjust our operations to enhance crew and customer safety. We developed new positioning guides and piloted contactless delivery. These solutions, along with many others, were then shared around the globe. As each country develops their own innovations, these are quickly shared by our global restaurant solutions group across all markets. Our system's ability to quickly adapt operations across 40,000 restaurants has been incredible to see. 
The size and scale of our supply chain has also proven to be a significant advantage during this crisis. To date, despite the disruption of our business, we have had no break in supply for any food, packaging materials, toys, equipment, logistics or other solutions globally. 
I want to give particular recognition to our supply chain team for sourcing vital PPE materials, such as masks. To give you just some sense of the scale with which we operate, our global supply chain team has sourced over 120 million masks to meet the needs of the McDonald's system. 
And of course, McDonald's strong drive-thru development has continued to allow us to safely serve millions of customers each day while adhering to social distancing mandates or guidelines. In the U.S., nearly 95% of our locations have drive-thru, and virtually all are open to serve health care professionals, first responders, other essential workers and customers looking for their McDonald's moment. Similarly, Australia and Canada have been able to safely remain open. 
Finally, I should note that our global delivery sales are up significantly versus pre-covid. Our restaurant footprint and customers love for our brand make us an essential partner for any third-party operator. 
Once we emerge from this crisis, our expectation is that McDonald's can further extend its leadership in every market where we operate. To do this, it's essential that our franchisees have the financial wherewithal to capitalize on the opportunities we think will be available to our system. For that reason, we've taken several steps to help our franchisees and developmental licensees maintain their liquidity and financial strength. While there will continue to be difficult decisions along the way, we are providing timely, targeted and temporary financial support, which Kevin will walk through in a few minutes. 
From a customer perspective, we're encouraged by some of our early learnings that lead us to believe customers will be seeking known brands and familiar routines. We're also seeing a heightened focus on value and convenience. In China, this was reflected in the response to our recent Big Mac promotion, showed that after a prolonged disruption of their daily lives, customers are craving comfort in our iconic core menu items. We've also seen this where we've been able to safely remain open in cities like Tokyo, Berlin and Chicago and in Northern France, where we slowly began reopening restaurants last week. 
As I mentioned earlier, our reopening efforts in our European markets will be phased and grounded in what's best for the safety of our customers and crew. Similar to what we did in U.S. and Canada, we'll be serving a limited menu in many markets, focused primarily on our core items when we reopen in countries around the world. Through this, we will focus on what McDonald's has done so well for decades, serving great-tasting food fast. 
This is a challenging and unpredictable time. Looking at comparable sales, we expect the second quarter as a whole to be significantly worse than what we experienced for the full month of March. Kevin will talk about what we've seen in the month of April. 
As things stand, we believe we reached a trough in terms of number of restaurants closed in late March. We are planning for limited reopenings in markets in the near future. The exact trajectory of our recovery, however, is highly uncertain and dependent on many factors outside our control, such as government mandates, the risk of a second wave of infection to the availability of testing and the overall economic backdrop. We're developing contingency plans for a wide variety of scenarios. 
From our experience in China as well as from our experience closing and opening 10,000 restaurants as part of our EOTF remodel program in the U.S., we do know that customers will not immediately revert back to their pre shutdown routines. For example, we know that breakfast will be the most challenged daypart. We know that a focus on core menu will be critical due to both customer interest in familiar favorites and operational lease. We know that value will be a necessary element to reengage our customers. Each market is rebuilding their marketing calendar to reflect these learnings and many others so we can reignite our business momentum. 
But our first priority has been and will continue to be safeguarding the health and safety of our people and customers. The trust that McDonald's brand has developed over the last 65 years is our most precious asset, and we will never put that at risk. We remain closely aligned with the expert judgment of scientific and government leaders in our various markets, and we support the focus on widespread testing as a central element to broader recovery efforts. 
Whatever the cadence of reopening markets, we know we can adapt. McDonald's is a remarkable system, and I'm confident that the strengths we've exhibited both before and during the crisis will be even more apparent as we emerge into a new post-coronavirus world. 
I'll now turn it over to Kevin to talk about our first quarter results."
139488,662236749,1966080,"McDonald's Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",2020-04-30,"Earnings Calls","McDonald's Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Chris. We began 2020 with strong top line momentum. Global comp sales were up 7.2% through February, reflecting strong performance in most countries around the world and the benefit of leap year. Beginning in mid-March, consumer traffic began to d",1718,"Thanks, Chris. We began 2020 with strong top line momentum. Global comp sales were up 7.2% through February, reflecting strong performance in most countries around the world and the benefit of leap year. Beginning in mid-March, consumer traffic began to decline significantly due to the impact of COVID-19 as we temporarily closed some restaurants and shifted to limited operations and others when many parts of the world experienced government restrictions and shelter in place guidelines. As a result, global comp sales were down 22% in the month of March, and down 3.4% in the first quarter. 
Today, I'll walk through March and April trends to provide perspective on how comp sales have progressed over the past few months. 
International Operated market comp sales were down 35% for the month of March. In the second half of March, comp sales were down roughly 70% as several markets like France, Italy, Spain and the U.K. temporarily closed all restaurants, and other markets like Australia, Canada and Germany had drive-thru delivery and takeaway only or limited hours and menus. Comp sales have continued to be down about 70% through April in this segment, as many of the fully closed markets are now just beginning to reopen. 
Turning to the U.S. Comp sales were negative 13% for the month of March. Beginning in mid-March and continuing through mid-April, U.S. comp sales were consistently down about 25%. However, we have begun to see some improvement in the last couple of weeks. We expect April comp sales to be down about 20%. 
Also, over the last several weeks, the U.S. has experienced a significant increase in average check across all channels. This is due to an increase in party size as well as evolving consumer behavior, with daily routines interrupted and fewer transactions at the breakfast daypart. 
Not surprisingly, the U.S. has also seen sales impacted on weekends more than weekdays, as consumers leave their houses only when necessary. And we've seen a shift in sales mix by order channel, as nearly all restaurants are operating drive-thru, delivery and takeaway only. 
Prior to the impact of COVID-19, the drive-thru accounted for about 2/3 of all sales in the U.S. As consumers shifted from in-person ordering to drive-thru and delivery channels, drive-thru now accounts for nearly 90% of sales in the U.S. 
We're also seeing an uptick in delivery and digital transactions per restaurant. And all of these trends are similar to what we've seen in China and other markets. 
Comp sales in the International Developmental Licensed segment were down 19% for the month of March. Similar to the other segments, in the second half of March, comp sales were down even more significantly, reflecting the impact of COVID-19 as it's spread throughout the segment. 
In China, approximately 25% of restaurants were closed in early February. By the end of March, substantially all restaurants had reopened. However, the market continues to experience a reduced level of demand as consumers have not fully returned to their pre covid routines, resulting in negative comp sales since the initial outbreak in late January. 
Comp sales were down over 20% in the first quarter, and trends have improved in April to negative mid-teens. 
In terms of new unit development, China opened over 100 restaurants in the quarter. We remain confident in new restaurant growth opportunities in China. However, we expect time lines to be delayed due to the crisis. 
I want to transition to some areas that are most relevant to understanding the impact of COVID-19 on our results, including flow-through considerations on the P&L, corporate liquidity and franchisee financial health. 
Starting with the P&L. As we've become a more heavily franchised business over the last several years, our operating model is designed to tap into the entrepreneurial spirit of our local business owners and for efficient conversion of top line growth to the bottom line. In other words, as comp sales grow, the fixed nature of our franchise cost structure results in strong flow-through to the bottom line. Conversely, in the current environment of declining sales, we see less flow through to franchise margin dollars. Our company-operated restaurant expenses are more variable in areas such as food and paper and labor costs. So the flow-through to margin dollars is a bit better in our company-operated restaurants in the current environment. 
For perspective, in March with a comp sales of negative 22%, our total restaurant margin dollars declined $350 million, with about 75% of the decline driven by franchise margin dollars. Most of the decline was in the IOM segment due to the significant number of temporary restaurant closures. 
Turning to G&A. We saw an increase of about $95 million in constant currencies or 19% versus first quarter last year. About 2/3 of the increase relates to nonrecurring costs, including $40 million for the cancellation of our biennial worldwide convention, and roughly $20 million related to payments of contractual obligations as we reduce the scope and ongoing spend in R&D work of certain restaurant technology. The remaining increase relates to the run costs associated with our acquisitions of Dynamic Yield and Apprente, as well as continued depreciation and amortization costs related to technology. As a reminder, both of these acquisitions occurred subsequent to first quarter 2019, so we're not lapping those acquisitions yet. 
Our investment in digital customer engagement remains a priority for our business. As I mentioned before, we've already seen the benefits of Dynamic Yield in our operating results. These digital investments enable us to give customers more choice and flexibility in how they order, pay and receive their food during this unprecedented time and will remain important in serving customers as we think about our business beyond this crisis. 
As we navigate through uncharted waters, we're taking a disciplined approach to decision making. This includes reviewing all investments and reducing or delaying spending as we rescope priorities in some areas and redirect dollars to other priorities. We're focusing resources on projects and initiatives that can reasonably be implemented and executed in the near term, both in terms of cost and time and will also benefit the system for the long term. 
As we make these assessments, we'll also prioritize our resources against the most critical needs of the business. Due to COVID-19, we expect a few lines of the other operating section of the P&L to be impacted in 2020 as well. Gains on restaurant sales are expected to be down about $100 million as a result of minimal restaurant sale activity for the rest of the year. Our equity and earnings of affiliates is expected to be down substantially, and we expect to have some additional reserves for bad debts related to rent and royalty deferrals subsequent to March. 
The result of all of this is that we expect our operating cash flow to be down significantly this year. We entered the crisis with a strong balance sheet, and we've taken a number of actions to preserve financial flexibility. In addition to currently reviewing our G&A costs, we suspended our share repurchase program in early March. We secured $6.5 billion of new financing in March, including $5.5 billion of debt issuances at various maturities and a new $1 billion line of credit that we drew upon immediately. 
In terms of capital expenditures, we've taken a very practical approach to development activity. We suspended Experience of the Future groundbreaks in the U.S. and new restaurant openings around the world as COVID-19 began to spread. Given that our first quarter CapEx is typically about 20% of the full year and many projects are delayed or on hold, we now have some flexibility with decisions for the majority of our planned capital spend for the year. As a result, we're reducing our 2020 spending by about $1 billion from our initial expectation of $2.4 billion. 
I also want to acknowledge our dividend. We paid our first quarter dividend at the beginning of March, prior to the widespread impact of COVID. McDonald's remains financially strong, and our capital allocation priorities remain investing in the business for growth and prioritizing dividends to our shareholders. We will continue to manage and utilize our funds in a judicious manner that focuses on ensuring the company is able to grow the business and our franchisees remain financially strong. 
As I mentioned earlier, we've taken a number of actions to ensure that the company is in a sound financial position and to put our franchisees and developmental licensee partners around the world in a position to be successful in running their businesses. As Covid spread quickly around the world, our first step was determining operating procedures, resulting in temporary closures of all restaurants in some countries and limited operations in others, as I've mentioned. That was quickly followed by providing broad-based financial liquidity assistance in the form of rent and royalty deferrals that were generally applicable to all franchisees within various markets because we needed to make quick decisions to alleviate franchisee concerns and put them in the best position to maintain their businesses. Generally, we've deferred the collection of rent and royalties earned in March and April in most markets around the world. Cash is collected on a 1-month lag, so the cash impact of these deferrals occurs in April and May. This deferral amounts to roughly $1 billion of liquidity assistance that we committed to our franchisees and developmental licensee partners across the system. We also work closely with lenders, suppliers and distributors to extend payment terms to franchisees where necessary. 
Now we're assessing the financial health and liquidity of specific at risk-franchisee and developmental licensee organizations. This assessment includes various sales projection scenarios and takes into account the impact of liquidity assistance measures provided by the company, suppliers, lenders and governments. We've developed an objective framework for making decisions regarding which specific franchisee and deal organizations may need further liquidity assistance and how we may support them. This will help ensure a consistent and equitable approach to decision-making across all of our markets. As Chris mentioned, our general philosophy is for any assistance to be timely, targeted and temporary. The financial health and strength of our franchisees has been a competitive advantage for McDonald's for years, and we expect that to continue post COVID-19. 
Now I'll turn it back to Chris."

While there's much we don't know about the future course of this pandemic, we are taking the necessary actions to ensure we will emerge from this crisis in a position of strength. Looking ahead, we know these unprecedented times will bring about some fundamental changes to the way businesses, including ours, operate. What will remain constant is our commitment to maintaining the strong level of trust our customers have in the business. 
We're also beginning to think about our strategy in the aftermath of COVID-19. While elements of Velocity Growth Plan will continue to be important, we're making adjustments in real time and there will likely need to be further changes. We'll look to provide updates on our overall progress later in the year. 
In these challenging times, I'm immensely proud of the way our system has banded together to stay true to our purpose to feed and foster community. The countless inspiring examples of this around the world showcase the real impact McDonald's has in the communities in which we operate. I'm proud to share a handful of these stories. 
In the U.S., our restaurants are offering our appreciation with free thank you meal boxes to first responders and health care workers to thank them for their tireless efforts to protect us all. These include favorite breakfast and lunch menu items, packaged and happy meal boxes with a thank you note in place of a toy. We're in the middle of this 2-week show of appreciation, and we've already provided nearly 4 million thank you meals. 
Across Europe, many markets are providing free drinks, coffee and meals to first responders and health care workers on the front lines. In Madrid, a restaurant just reopened solely to serve frontline workers at the nearby hospital. 
In Australia, we've added staples of milk, eggs and bread to our menus, enabling customers to use McDonald's contactless drive-thru and takeaway to shopper basics, providing a safe and easy way for customers to shop. 
And in many of the communities around the world that we call home, extra food within the supply chain is being redistributed through nonprofit organizations and local food banks to feed communities in need. 
We've also donated nearly 1.5 million masks to COVID relief efforts. 
As I said earlier, we entered this crisis with a solid foundation. While we face significant disruptions and challenges, we remain confident in our ability to adapt, as we've done throughout our 65 years to secure our long-term success. And now we'll begin Q&A."

So just focusing on those international markets, obviously, a lot of that weakness has been closed stores. But I would also imagine that those would be more vulnerable to COVID-type formats, like higher walk-in mix, and there might be other economic and structural factors that might linger. So can you give us a sense about how things look in those markets as you get back to reopening. Do you see the snapback as strong as it's been in the U.S.? And then perhaps you can dig into that comment about the support you're offering to franchisees, especially in those hardest hit markets."

In the international, particularly in our IOM markets in Europe, we have a number of countries that are completely closed based on government mandates. We are just beginning the process of reopening on a limited basis in a number of those markets. And so it's probably a little premature for us to give you any indication of what the overall trajectory is going to be. But I would say we've been really encouraged when we do start to open limited restaurants by the demand. You may have seen in the last week, as we've opened up in a few of these markets, we had a 3-hour wait at one of our restaurants in France. For people to get through the drive-thru in Austria, we had a 2-mile line of people looking to get into the drive-thru. And I think our overall view is, as markets start to open up, this desire to really return to familiar favorites, to brands that are known is very, very powerful. And I think the fact that we also have a strong orientation toward convenience and value that I think are also 2 key elements. We are optimistic. We certainly are expecting that we're going to be able to take share in those markets. And so I think we, like everybody else, are closely watching what the overall level of customer demand is going to be. We do feel like we're well positioned on that, but probably too soon to say. 
In terms of financial support that we're providing to franchisees, let me pass it over to Kevin to address."

David, related to the franchisee assistance, I'd say it's similar to what we've done in the U.S.. As I talked about in my remarks, at the beginning, what we really did was kind of this broad-based assistance that was deferring a couple of months of rent and royalties, generally for most franchisees around the world. The other thing that's happened is essentially, we've converted our rent to variable rent based on sales. So the restaurants that have been closed effectively aren't paying rent because they don't have sales. The only other thing I would point out is, there's various different forms of government assistance in each country. So certain countries provide more assistance related to kind of workers who aren't working temporarily, which means that in some of the markets, they've been able to effectively help the franchisees in terms of being able to keep their workers, but not at the -- while the restaurants are closed. And then in several markets, we've actually been working with other companies to actually even find places where employees have been able to work. So in a couple of them, we've partnered up with companies like Aldi and others to provide temporary employment for our workers while our restaurants are closed. So I wouldn't say that our assistance is substantially different on the international side. Again, we started at the broad base, and now we're looking in both internationally and in the U.S."

I think in terms of in terms of the best practices, we have learned a lot around how we adjust operations to really make sure that we're providing a safe environment for our crew and for our customers. In almost every market where we operate, the U.S. included, there are dedicated teams that are meeting daily and reviewing procedures and connected to our global restaurant Solutions group to understand these best practices. In the case of the U.S., they've made 50 different changes to operating procedures as we've learned more. And it's everything from positioning guides to protective barriers to other things like masks, how often, how frequently we are sanitizing services, that has been really helpful for us in terms of just making sure that our restaurant continue to be a safe environment for both us help with the demand that we're seeing. I think as people get confident about our ability to test certainly helps, but there is a benefit that I think you could attribute to the stimulus checks. I think there's probably also, as customers are starting to venture out a little bit more, this desire to really go to familiar brands. You saw it in -- in the -- away from -- or in the at-home occasion, center of the store, familiar brands in grocery really benefited as people were staying home. I think that same dynamic is going to be at play as people start to come out looking for familiar brands. So I think there's a variety of different things that play there in the U.S., but certainly, we've been more encouraged by what we've seen in the last couple of weeks in the U.S."

So the question is, are rent and royalty deferrals enough to prevent some of your bottom quartile franchisees from failing?

And that was the broad-based deferrals that Kevin referenced. Now as we've had more time, we've essentially been able to go through and do stress test, if you will, for every single franchisee organization and have developed a sense of what we think their liquidity needs are under a variety of different scenarios in terms of how this business recovers. I think the important point that Kevin talked about in terms of the principles of timely, targeted and temporary is, we will provide the support when it's apparent that what the scenario is that we're dealing with. So that's the timely element, which is, who knows how many of this progresses. But we certainly have a sense of, depending on which trajectory we go, who's going to be at risk.

I guess, one, I would just remind everyone that we did come into 2020 with most of our franchisees in most of our major markets either at or near all-time high cash flows.

So we are cognizant of that and certainly are having the appropriate discussions with those franchisees. And to Chris' point, I think now we're at the point where we are looking at organization by organization and seeing where we may need to step in and provide further assistance or make sure that they're getting all the assist they need from lenders, suppliers, et cetera. 
Related to kind of the loans, I guess, I would just remind everyone, our operators are small independent business owners who are eligible for the loans. They're working with their advisers to determine kind of the needs for their business. Our understanding is that most have been able to get approved and which would enable them to keep paying their crew and continue running their businesses. And then we'll certainly continue to work it with them to make sure that they've got the liquidity to keep running their businesses. So I think we feel pretty comfortable in general about franchisees, but there certainly will be a few that we need to just think about how they get further assistance if they need."

This is not a large majority of operators or a large piece of the operators. It's generally maybe a few operators in each market that we're working with. So it isn't a widespread issue that we're dealing with. 
Related to cash flow, and let me try and put that in some context, and I'll go back and just -- I may repeat some of the things that I mentioned in my remarks, but remember, we entered the crisis certainly from a position of financial strength. From a corporate standpoint, we're obviously -- we have a strong investment-grade credit rating, that's always been important to us, so we've been maintaining that. And I talked about our franchisees also entered into the year pretty strong financially. As we got into this year and the impact of COVID was growing, you would have seen that we acted pretty quickly to bolster our cash position, certainly in anticipation of the changing macroeconomic and business conditions around the world. We secured $6.5 billion of new financing in March, which was about 5.5 -- well, which was $5.5 billion of bonds and $1 billion of line of credit. And then we also still have full access to a committed line of credit of $3.5 billion. So I know cash burn is a frequent topic of discussion lately. We certainly keep our eye on that, but we do have confidence in our liquidity position based on our current cash balance and our ability to get further access if we need it in the markets. We ended the first quarter a little over $5 billion of cash on our balance sheet. And again, remember, we still have that $3.5 billion line of credit that's untapped if we ever should need it. I'd say our cash outflows right now are fairly consistent month-to-month for things like G&A and capital and lease expense costs. In this environment, the big variable is the cash inflows. Because, as you know, we operate in over 100 countries. We've given some of that -- those rent and royalty deferrals of over $1 billion. And now we're looking at those individual operator organizations that may need something further. Having said all that, between the temporary restaurant closures and the deferrals, our cash inflows certainly will be significantly less in the second quarter than normal. So we're likely to have negative free cash flow in the second quarter. But assuming that the countries continue to reopen on the schedules that we're seeing right now, and again most of those are in the European markets, and assuming franchisees can have the ability to pay their rents and royalties, we would expect that the free cash flow would turn back to positive in the third quarter. So we do think second quarter will be a rougher quarter in terms of cash flow. But right now, based on current plans, we would expect that to turn around back to positive in the third quarter."

So before January and February, you noted that comp was balanced between traffic and ticket in the U.S. I guess if you could just talk a little bit about does that account for leap year? Effectively, you haven't had positive traffic in the U.S. in a while. I'm trying to understand what the drivers might have been. And then after the emergence of pandemic, you've talked about global delivery sales being up significant. Could you just quantify share of sales or year-over-year growth in delivery? Maybe give some color on digital ordering as well since, presumably, even some of the drive-thru orders or carry out would have been digital. So just a little bit more context before and after."

The team was very excited about the U.S. results through February. As you know, we were up over 8% for the first 2 months of the year, and a good amount of that was due to traffic. We were really encouraged by the traffic trends that we were seeing entering into the new year, and that excludes the extra benefit that we then got through leap year. So we were in a good traffic position through the first couple of months in the U.S. Leap year further helped that and then we had COVID and kind of the rest from there in terms of what we've been working through. 
I think from a delivery standpoint, the important thing is the vast majority of our business is still drive-thru-driven in the U.S. And so while delivery is up significantly, it's not the predominant thing that is driving our business. The predominant channel is really through the drive-thru. Kevin, I don't know if you have anything else you want to add."

But as you mentioned, as we've referenced as well, the pace of recovery in China has been slow. We're not seeing a V-shaped recovery in China. The business trends are improving. But they're still running negative to where we were a year ago. I think there's a couple of things that are worth just noting as to reasons for that. The first is we had substantially more restaurants in China that were fully closed than have to reopen. So that's a larger disruption than if you're able to kind of continue to be open and then just moderating your channels. So that was one issue. The second is, just a reminder, in China, only 15% of the restaurants have drive-thru. And I would say one of the things that we have seen as a real strength of our business is drive-thru penetration. And so when you have a strong drive-thru penetration, I think your ability for that business, that market to get -- bounced back, that's certainly an added benefit.

And you're just talking about China and drive-thru, and that's a critical differentiator in the U.S., for example. What percentage of the IOM markets have drive-thru? What percentage offer breakfast? I know it varies, but if there's an average or some anecdotes there. 
And then, Kevin, I just want to make sure I clarify your dividend comment. You said you're acknowledging the dividend. Does that mean that it's under review? Or it's not under review? Just making it clear what you said about the dividend and your decisions around that."

So I'll start with just an overall comment about IOM in the European markets. It is tough to generalize. I mean, I've got to say that every market is in a different situation based on what's happened from government mandates, just the overall orientation of that market. So difficult to generalize. Certainly, I think you can conclude that in restaurants that are open, comp is still down. Comp is down, reflecting just a lower level of economic activity. People are still largely staying at home even in markets that are able to remain open. So that is adversely affecting even in restaurants that are open comp trends. But again, it varies really market by market. 
I think if you then go to your second question, which is about percent of restaurants primarily in Europe, again, I'll focus there that have drive-thru. The majority of our restaurants have drive-thru in Europe. It does vary market by market, but the majority of our restaurants do have drive-thru. So that certainly is something that we expect to be helpful to us as we emerge out of this. And then Kevin, I'll flip the other questions over to you."

So we've said we're going to reduce CapEx by roughly $1 billion. Part of that or a chunk of that really are U.S. Experience of the Future projects, we've substantially reduced those projects for this year. Now to your point, I view that as, as soon as it's reasonably feasible to keep going on those, many of the franchisees will want to continue doing those. We have gotten some requests even already for some franchisees to continue those projects. So I would expect a lot of those would get pushed into 2021. But I think the franchisees and rightly so want to understand that the business is back to operating, I'll say, more normally before they go invest substantial dollars and close their restaurants for a period of time also. So that's a piece of it. We're also reducing openings in many of the markets outside the U.S., again partly because if you think about several of those countries, they've been closed for a period of time now. They're just getting back up and running now the normal operations. And so the disruption of going and opening new restaurants right now at a maybe quicker pace probably isn't the right thing to do for a lot of the franchisees there. So that pace will slow in 2020. But again, I think that's relatively easy to continue picking up. And we certainly still see opportunities for growth in most of those markets. So it isn't a long-term change in opportunity, but it is a pause in 2020 for a lot of that."

And then the other menu. Yes, and limited menu, it's been interesting, and it's a good question. So we have gone to a limited menu in the U.S. as well as a number of other markets. I think one of the things that each of the markets are thinking about is as you go back to more of a standard menu, do you immediately revert back to sort of everything that was on the menu? Or does this maybe provide us an opportunity to do some things that get that balance right between margin, operationally, speed of service, et cetera. So I think it's probably safe to say at this point that, that is going to be a market-by-market decision, but I would say every market is thinking about, does it make sense to go all the way back to where we were pre-crisis or maybe we want to go back in more of a staged way and add some items, but not all items?

Your other point, though, which we did talk about is, and as I mentioned in my remarks, the world is going to look different coming out of this crisis, and we expect that many of those changes are going to be enduring. And so part of the work that we're going through is really thinking about our strategy kind of in this post-COVID world. We've got a great foundation to build on with Velocity Growth Plan, but I think it's probably fair to say that we're not just going to pick up the Velocity Growth Plan playbook and kind of resume business as usual. There are going to need to be adjustments to that.

We have some contractual obligations we needed to pay for stopping some R&D work. That cost us about $20 million. And then we also have an unusual dynamic where there's a portion of our people costs that are capitalized related to restaurant openings. And as we reduce our restaurant openings, less of those costs will be able to be capitalized, that will likely cost us another $30 million to $35 million of G&A. Now that's not additional cash because we were paying those folks already, but it's the accounting of them where it may end up in G&A instead of where it would have been capitalized on development.

But I want to start by acknowledging the human toll of this pandemic. Let me express our deepest sympathies to those inside and outside of McDonald's who have been affected by this virus. In particular, I want to extend heartfelt thanks and gratitude to health care professionals, first responders and other essential workers around the world who have put their own lives at risk to help others.  
The global crisis has impacted people and communities everywhere. In the face of such enormous challenges, I'm immensely proud of the entire McDonald's system and the tireless efforts of our franchisees, crew members, suppliers and company employees. Where we've been able to stay open safely and responsible, they've made it possible for McDonald's to continue offering great-tasting, affordable and convenient food amidst widespread change and disruption.  
Turning now to our performance for the quarter. Our Velocity Growth Plan drove strong results in 2019. That momentum carried into January and February. Since then, the outbreak of coronavirus around the world has created a major business disruption that adversely impacted our performance.  
Beginning in mid-March, we experienced a significant decline in our business due to the pandemic, dragging down our Q1 global comparable sales by 3.4%. We're now operating in a completely different world, and we expect these changes to persist long after the crisis is over.  
In times like these, we take strength from the resilience and experiences we've developed over our 65-year history. While we're not immune to the immediate pressures threatening our global community, we came into the situation better positioned than most, and we believe that we will strengthen our competitive advantages following the crisis.  
Entering the crisis, our system was in great shape. In addition to McDonald's strong balance sheet, franchisee cash flows in most of our major markets were at or near record highs in 2019. Our global restaurant estate had been largely modernized. And we've made significant investments to build new capabilities and delivery in digital that have proven to be critical to our business during the pandemic.  
We now navigate through the crisis. McDonald's unmatched global footprint, scale and deep operational expertise are also proving to be significant strengths for us. Specifically, with a presence in over 100 markets, we've been able to develop insights and best practices as countries move through different phases of the outbreak.  
In China, where the outbreak began, we quickly learned how to adjust our operations to enhance crew and customer safety. We developed new positioning guides and piloted contactless delivery. These solutions, along with many others, were then shared around the globe. As each country develops their own innovations, these are quickly shared by our global restaurant solutions group across all markets. Our system's ability to quickly adapt operations across 40,000 restaurants has been incredible to see.  
The size and scale of our supply chain has also proven to be a significant advantage during this crisis. To date, despite the disruption to our business, we have had no break in supply for any food, packaging materials, toys, equipment, logistics or other solutions globally.  
I want to give particular recognition to our supply chain team for sourcing vital PPE materials such as masks. To give you just some sense of the scale with which we operate, our global supply chain team has sourced over 120 million masks to meet the needs of the McDonald's system. And of course, McDonald's strong drive-thru development has continued to allow us to safely serve millions of customers each day while adhering to social distancing mandates or guidelines. In the U.S., nearly 95% of our locations have drive-thru, and virtually all are open to serve health care professionals, first responders, other essential workers and customers looking for their McDonald's moment. Similarly, Australia and Canada have been able to safely remain open.  
Finally, I should note that our global delivery sales are up significantly versus pre-COVID. Our restaurant footprint and customers' love for our brand make us an essential partner for any third-party operator.  
Once we emerge from this crisis, our expectation is that McDonald's can further extend its leadership in every market where we operate. To do this, it's essential that our franchisees have the financial wherewithal to capitalize on the opportunities we think will be available to our system. For that reason, we've taken several steps to help our franchisees and developmental licensees maintain their liquidity and financial strength. While there will continue to be difficult decisions along the way, we are providing timely, targeted and temporary financial support, which Kevin will walk through in a few minutes.  
From a customer perspective, we're encouraged by some of our early learnings that lead us to believe customers will be seeking known brands and familiar routines. We're also seeking -- seeing a heightened focus on value and convenience. In China, this was reflected in the response to our recent Big Mac promotion, showed that after a prolonged disruption to their daily lives, customers are craving comfort in our iconic core menu items. We've also seen this where we've been able to safely remain open in cities like Tokyo, Berlin and Chicago and in Northern France, where we slowly began reopening restaurants last week.  
As I mentioned earlier, our reopening efforts in our European markets will be phased and grounded in what's best for the safety of our customers and crew. Similar to what we did in U.S. and Canada, we'll be serving a limited menu in many markets, focused primarily on our core items when we reopen in countries around the world. Through this, we will focus on what McDonald's has done so well for decades, serving great-tasting food fast.  
This is a challenging and unpredictable time. Looking at comparable sales, we expect the second quarter as a whole to be significantly worse than what we experienced for the full month of March. Kevin will talk about what we've seen in the month of April.  
As things stand, we believe we reached a trough in terms of number of restaurants closed in late March. We are planning for limited reopenings in markets in the near future. The exact trajectory of our recovery, however, is highly uncertain and dependent on many factors outside our control such as government mandates, the risk of a second wave of infection to the availability of testing and the overall economic backdrop. We're developing contingency plans for a wide variety of scenarios.  
From our experience in China as well as from our experience closing and opening 10,000 restaurants as part of our EOTF remodel program in the U.S., we do know that customers will not immediately revert back to their pre-shutdown routines. For example, we know that breakfast will be the most challenged daypart. We know that a focus on core menu will be critical due to both customer interest in familiar favorites and operational ease. We know that value will be a necessary element to reengage our customers. Each market is rebuilding their marketing calendar to reflect these learnings and many others so we can reignite our business momentum.  
But our first priority has been and will continue to be safeguarding the health and safety of our people and customers. The trust that McDonald's brand has developed over the last 65 years is our most precious asset, and we will never put that at risk. We remain closely aligned with the expert judgment of scientific and government leaders in our various markets, and we support the focus on widespread testing as a central element to broader recovery efforts.  
Whatever the cadence of reopening markets, we know we can adapt. McDonald's is a remarkable system, and I'm confident that the strengths we've exhibited both before and during the crisis will be even more apparent as we emerge into a new post-coronavirus world.  
I'll now turn it over to Kevin to talk about our first quarter results."

We began 2020 with strong top line momentum. Global comp sales were up 7.2% through February, reflecting strong performance in most countries around the world and the benefit of leap year. Beginning in mid-March, consumer traffic began to d",1715,"Thanks, Chris. We began 2020 with strong top line momentum. Global comp sales were up 7.2% through February, reflecting strong performance in most countries around the world and the benefit of leap year. Beginning in mid-March, consumer traffic began to decline significantly due to the impact of COVID-19 as we temporarily closed some restaurants and shifted to limited operations and others when many parts of the world experienced government restrictions and shelter-in-place guidelines. As a result, global comp sales were down 22% in the month of March and down 3.4% in the first quarter.  
Today, I'll walk through March and April trends to provide perspective on how comp sales have progressed over the past few months.  
International Operated market comp sales were down 35% for the month of March. In the second half of March, comp sales were down roughly 70% as several markets like France, Italy, Spain and the U.K. temporarily closed all restaurants, and other markets like Australia, Canada and Germany had drive-thru delivery and takeaway only or limited hours and menus. Comp sales have continued to be down about 70% through April in this segment, as many of the fully closed markets are now just beginning to reopen.  
Turning to the U.S. Comp sales were negative 13% for the month of March. Beginning in mid-March and continuing through mid-April, U.S. comp sales were consistently down about 25%. However, we have begun to see some improvement in the last couple of weeks. We expect April comp sales to be down about 20%.  
Also, over the last several weeks, the U.S. has experienced a significant increase in average check across all channels. This is due to an increase in party size as well as evolving consumer behavior, with daily routines interrupted and fewer transactions at the breakfast daypart.  
Not surprisingly, the U.S. has also seen sales impacted on weekends more than weekdays, as consumers leave their houses only when necessary. And we've seen a shift in sales mix by order channel, as nearly all restaurants are operating drive-thru, delivery and takeaway only.  
Prior to the impact of COVID-19, the drive-thru accounted for about 2/3 of all sales in the U.S. As consumers shifted from in-person ordering to drive-thru and delivery channels, drive-thru now accounts for nearly 90% of sales in the U.S.  
We're also seeing an uptick in delivery and digital transactions per restaurant. And all of these trends are similar to what we've seen in China and other markets.  
Comp sales in the International Developmental Licensed segment were down 19% for the month of March. Similar to the other segments, in the second half of March, comp sales were down even more significantly, reflecting the impact of COVID-19 as it's spread throughout the segment.  
In China, approximately 25% of restaurants were closed in early February. By the end of March, substantially all restaurants had reopened. However, the market continues to experience a reduced level of demand as consumers have not fully returned to their pre-COVID routines, resulting in negative comp sales since the initial outbreak in late January.  
Comp sales were down over 20% in the first quarter, and trends have improved in April to negative mid-teens.  
In terms of new unit development, China opened over 100 restaurants in the quarter. We remain confident in new restaurant growth opportunities in China. However, we expect time lines to be delayed due to the crisis.  
I want to transition to some areas that are most relevant to understanding the impact of COVID-19 on our results, including flow-through considerations on the P&L, corporate liquidity and franchisee financial health.  
Starting with the P&L. As we've become a more heavily franchised business over the last several years, our operating model is designed to tap into the entrepreneurial spirit of our local business owners and for efficient conversion of top line growth to the bottom line. In other words, as comp sales grow, the fixed nature of our franchise cost structure results in strong flow-through to the bottom line. Conversely, in the current environment of declining sales, we see less flow-through to franchise margin dollars.  
Our company-operated restaurant expenses are more variable in areas such as food and paper and labor costs. So the flow-through to margin dollars is a bit better in our company-operated restaurants in the current environment.  
For perspective, in March with a comp sales of negative 22%, our total restaurant margin dollars declined $350 million, with about 75% of the decline driven by franchise margin dollars. Most of the decline was in the IOM segment due to the significant number of temporary restaurant closures.  
Turning to G&A. We saw an increase of about $95 million in constant currencies or 19% versus first quarter last year. About 2/3 of the increase relates to nonrecurring costs, including $40 million for the cancellation of our biennial worldwide convention and roughly $20 million related to payments of contractual obligations as we reduce the scope and ongoing spend in R&D work of certain restaurant technology. The remaining increase relates to the run costs associated with our acquisitions of Dynamic Yield and Apprente as well as continued depreciation and amortization costs related to technology. As a reminder, both of these acquisitions occurred subsequent to first quarter 2019, so we're not lapping those acquisitions yet.  
Our investment in digital customer engagement remains a priority for our business. And as I mentioned before, we've already seen the benefits of Dynamic Yield in our operating results. These digital investments enable us to give customers more choice and flexibility in how they order, pay and receive their food during this unprecedented time and will remain important in serving customers as we think about our business beyond this crisis.  
As we navigate through uncharted waters, we're taking a disciplined approach to decision making. This includes reviewing all investments and reducing or delaying spending as we rescope priorities in some areas and redirect dollars to other priorities. We're focusing resources on projects and initiatives that can reasonably be implemented and executed in the near term, both in terms of cost and time and will also benefit the system for the long term.  
As we make these assessments, we'll also prioritize our resources against the most critical needs of the business. Due to COVID-19, we expect a few lines of the other operating section of the P&L to be impacted in 2020 as well. Gains on restaurant sales are expected to be down about $100 million as a result of minimal restaurant sale activity for the rest of the year. Our equity and earnings of affiliates is expected to be down substantially, and we expect to have some additional reserves for bad debts related to rent and royalty deferrals subsequent to March.  
The result of all of this is that we expect our operating cash flow to be down significantly this year. We entered the crisis with a strong balance sheet, and we've taken a number of actions to preserve financial flexibility. In addition to currently reviewing our G&A costs, we suspended our share repurchase program in early March. We secured $6.5 billion of new financing in March, including $5.5 billion of debt issuances at various maturities and a new $1 billion line of credit that we drew upon immediately.  
In terms of capital expenditures, we've taken a very practical approach to development activity. We suspended Experience of the Future groundbreaks in the U.S. and new restaurant openings around the world as COVID-19 began to spread. Given that our first quarter CapEx is typically about 20% of the full year and many projects are delayed or on hold, we now have some flexibility with decisions for the majority of our planned capital spend for the year. As a result, we're reducing our 2020 spending by about $1 billion from our initial expectation of $2.4 billion.  
I also want to acknowledge our dividend. We paid our first quarter dividend at the beginning of March, prior to the widespread impact of COVID. McDonald's remains financially strong, and our capital allocation priorities remain investing in the business for growth and prioritizing dividends to our shareholders. We will continue to manage and utilize our funds in a judicious manner that focuses on ensuring the company is able to grow the business and our franchisees remain financially strong.  
As I mentioned earlier, we've taken a number of actions to ensure that the company is in a sound financial position and to put our franchisees and developmental licensee partners around the world in a position to be successful in running their businesses. As COVID spread quickly around the world, our first step was determining operating procedures, resulting in temporary closures of all restaurants in some countries and limited operations in others, as I've mentioned. That was quickly followed by providing broad-based financial liquidity assistance in the form of rent and royalty deferrals that were generally applicable to all franchisees within various markets because we needed to make quick decisions to alleviate franchisee concerns and put them in the best position to maintain their businesses. Generally, we've deferred the collection of rent and royalties earned in March and April in most markets around the world. Cash is collected on a 1-month lag, so the cash impact of these deferrals occurs in April and May. This deferral amounts to roughly $1 billion of liquidity assistance that we committed to our franchisees and developmental licensee partners across the system. We also work closely with lenders, suppliers and distributors to extend payment terms to franchisees where necessary.  
Now we're assessing the financial health and liquidity of specific at risk-franchisee and developmental licensee organizations. This assessment includes various sales projection scenarios and takes into account the impact of liquidity assistance measures provided by the company, suppliers, lenders and governments. We've developed an objective framework for making decisions regarding which specific franchisee and deal organizations may need further liquidity assistance and how we may support them. This will help ensure a consistent and equitable approach to decision-making across all of our markets. As Chris mentioned, our general philosophy is for any assistance to be timely, targeted and temporary. The financial health and strength of our franchisees has been a competitive advantage for McDonald's for years, and we expect that to continue post COVID-19.  
Now I'll turn it back to Chris."

While there's much we don't know about the future course of this pandemic, we are taking the necessary actions to ensure we will emerge from this crisis in a position of strength. Looking ahead, we know these unprecedented times will bring about some fundamental changes to the way businesses, including ours, operate. What will remain constant is our commitment to maintaining the strong level of trust our customers have in the business.  
We're also beginning to think about our strategy in the aftermath of COVID-19. While elements of Velocity Growth Plan will continue to be important, we're making adjustments in real time and there will likely need to be further changes. We'll look to provide updates on our overall progress later in the year.  
In these challenging times, I'm immensely proud of the way our system has banded together to stay true to our purpose to feed and foster community. The countless inspiring examples of this around the world showcase the real impact McDonald's has in the communities in which we operate. I'm proud to share a handful of these stories.  
In the U.S., our restaurants are offering our appreciation with free Thank You Meal boxes to first responders and health care workers to thank them for their tireless efforts to protect us all. These include favorite breakfast and lunch menu items, packaged and Happy Meal boxes with a thank you note in place of a toy. We're in the middle of this 2-week show of appreciation, and we've already provided nearly 4 million Thank You Meals.  
Across Europe, many markets are providing free drinks, coffee and meals to first responders and health care workers on the front lines. In Madrid, a restaurant just reopened solely to serve frontline workers at the nearby hospital.  
In Australia, we've added staples of milk, eggs and bread to our menus, enabling customers to use McDonald's contactless drive-thru and takeaway to shop for basics, providing a safe and easy way for customers to shop.  
And in many of the communities around the world that we call home, extra food within the supply chain is being redistributed through nonprofit organizations and local food banks to feed communities in need.  
We've also donated nearly 1.5 million masks to COVID relief efforts.  
As I said earlier, we entered this crisis with a solid foundation. While we face significant disruptions and challenges, we remain confident in our ability to adapt, as we've done throughout our 65 years to secure our long-term success. And now we'll begin Q&A."

So can you give us a sense about how things look in those markets as you get back to reopening? Do you see the snapback as strong as it's been in the U.S.?

In the international, particularly in our IOM markets in Europe, we have a number of countries that are completely closed based on government mandates. We are just beginning the process of reopening on a limited basis in a number of those markets. And so it's probably a little premature for us to give you any indication of what the overall trajectory is going to be. But I would say we've been really encouraged when we do start to open limited restaurants by the demand. You may have seen in the last week, as we've opened up in a few of these markets, we had a 3-hour wait at one of our restaurants in France. For people to get through the drive-thru in Austria, we had a 2-mile line of people looking to get into the drive-thru. And I think our overall view is, as markets start to open up, this desire to really return to familiar favorites, to brands that are known is very, very powerful. And I think the fact that we also have a strong orientation toward convenience and value that I think are also 2 key elements. We are optimistic. We certainly are expecting that we're going to be able to take share in those markets. And so I think we, like everybody else, are closely watching what the overall level of customer demand is going to be. We do feel like we're well positioned on that, but probably too soon to say.  
In terms of financial support that we're providing to franchisees, let me pass it over to Kevin to address."

David, related to the franchisee assistance, I'd say it's similar to what we've done in the U.S.. As I talked about in my remarks, at the beginning, what we really did was kind of this broad-based assistance that was deferring a couple of months of rent and royalties, generally for most franchisees around the world. The other thing that's happened is essentially, we've converted our rent to variable rent based on sales. So the restaurants that have been closed effectively aren't paying rent because they don't have sales. The only other thing I would point out is, there's various different forms of government assistance in each country. So certain countries provide more assistance related to kind of workers who aren't working temporarily, which means that in some of the markets, they've been able to effectively help the franchisees in terms of being able to keep their workers, but not at the -- that payment doesn't come out of the franchisees' pockets while the restaurants are closed. And then in several markets, we've actually been working with other companies to actually even find places where employees have been able to work. So in a couple of them, we've partnered up with companies like ALDI and others to provide temporary employment for our workers while our restaurants are closed. So I wouldn't say that our assistance is substantially different on the international side. Again, we started at the broad base, and now we're looking at individual organizations to see where we may need to step in, both internationally and in the U.S."

So maybe let me take it in 2 different pieces there. I think in terms of the best practices, we have learned a lot around how we adjust operations to really make sure that we're providing a safe environment for our crew and for our customers. In almost every market where we operate, the U.S. included, there are dedicated teams that are meeting daily and reviewing procedures and connected to our global restaurant solutions group to understand these best practices. In the case of the U.S., they've made 50 different changes to operating procedures as we've learned more. And it's everything from positioning guides to protective barriers to other things like masks, how often, how frequently we are sanitizing surfaces, just a variety of different things. So that has been really helpful for us in terms of just making sure that our restaurant continue to be a safe environment for both customers as well as for our crew. I think that certainly does help with the demand that we're seeing. I think as people get confident about our ability to continue to offer food in a safe way, that certainly helps, but there is a benefit that I think you could attribute to the stimulus checks. I think there's probably also, as customers are starting to venture out a little bit more, this desire to really go to familiar brands. You saw it in -- in the -- away from -- or in the at-home occasion, center of the store, familiar brands in grocery really benefited as people were staying home. I think that same dynamic is going to be at play as people start to come out looking for familiar brands. So I think there's a variety of different things that play there in the U.S., but certainly, we've been more encouraged by what we've seen in the last couple of weeks in the U.S."

And that was the broad-based deferrals that Kevin referenced. Now as we've had more time, we've essentially been able to go through and do stress test, if you will, for every single franchisee organization and have developed a sense of what we think their liquidity needs are under a variety of different scenarios in terms of how this business recovers. I think the important point that Kevin talked about in terms of the principles of timely, targeted and temporary is, we will provide the support when it's apparent that what the scenario is that we're dealing with. So that's the timely element, which is, who knows how any of this progresses. But we certainly have a sense of, depending on which trajectory we go, who's going to be at risk.

Related to kind of the loans, I guess, I would just remind everyone, our operators are small independent business owners who are eligible for the loans. They're working with their advisers to determine kind of the needs for their business. Our understanding is that most have been able to get approved and -- which would enable them to keep paying their crew and continue running their businesses.

This is not a large majority of operators or a large piece of the operators. It's generally maybe a few operators in each market that we're working with. So it isn't a widespread issue that we're dealing with.  
Related to cash flow, and let me try and put that in some context, and I'll go back and just -- I may repeat some of the things that I mentioned in my remarks, but remember, we entered the crisis certainly from a position of financial strength. From a corporate standpoint, we're obviously -- we have a strong investment-grade credit rating, that's always been important to us, so we've been maintaining that. And I talked about our franchisees also entered into the year pretty strong financially. As we got into this year and the impact of COVID was growing, you would have seen that we acted pretty quickly to bolster our cash position, certainly in anticipation of the changing macroeconomic and business conditions around the world. We secured $6.5 billion of new financing in March, which was about 5.5 -- well, which was $5.5 billion of bonds and $1 billion of line of credit. And then we also still have full access to a committed line of credit of $3.5 billion. So I know cash burn is a frequent topic of discussion lately. We certainly keep our eye on that, but we do have confidence in our liquidity position based on our current cash balance and our ability to get further access if we need it in the markets. We ended the first quarter a little over $5 billion of cash on our balance sheet. And again, remember, we still have that $3.5 billion line of credit that's untapped if we ever should need it. I'd say our cash outflows right now are fairly consistent month-to-month for things like G&A and capital and lease expense costs. In this environment, the big variable is the cash inflows because, as you know, we operate in over 100 countries. We've given some of that -- those rent and royalty deferrals of over $1 billion. And now we're looking at those individual operator organizations that may need something further. 
Having said all that, between the temporary restaurant closures and the deferrals, our cash inflows certainly will be significantly less in the second quarter than normal. So we're likely to have negative free cash flow in the second quarter. But assuming that the countries continue to reopen on the schedules that we're seeing right now, and again most of those are in the European markets, and assuming franchisees then can have the ability to pay their rents and royalties, we would expect that the free cash flow would turn back to positive in the third quarter. So we do think second quarter will be a rougher quarter in terms of cash flow. But right now, based on current plans, we would expect that to turn around back to positive in the third quarter."

Effectively, you haven't had positive traffic in the U.S. in a while. I'm trying to understand what the drivers might have been. And then after the emergence of the pandemic, you've talked about global delivery sales being up significant. Could you just quantify share of sales or year-over-year growth in delivery? Maybe give some color on digital ordering as well since, presumably, even some of the drive-thru orders or carryout would have been digital. So just a little bit more context before and after."

The team was very excited about the U.S. results through February. As you know, we were up over 8% for the first 2 months of the year, and a good amount of that was due to traffic. We were really encouraged by the traffic trends that we were seeing entering into the new year, and that excludes the extra benefit that we then got through leap year. So we were in a good traffic position through the first couple of months in the U.S. Leap year further helped that and then we had COVID and kind of the rest from there in terms of what we've been working through.  
I think from a delivery standpoint, the important thing is the vast majority of our business is still drive-thru driven in the U.S. And so while delivery is up significantly, it's not the predominant thing that is driving our business. The predominant channel is really through the drive-thru. Kevin, I don't know if you have anything else you want to add."

Just trying to get some historical context for whatever historical means in terms of COVID. But China seems like some good intelligence. I'm just trying to assess the pace of recovery through the crisis. It seems like you mentioned it was down more than 20% from a comp perspective in the January, February time frame. Wondering if maybe you can give some sort of a monthly trend as that market, I think you said it's now down mid-teens. So it seems like it's a 5-point-plus improvement but over multiple months. So it seems like maybe it's slower than some had hoped. I was just wondering maybe if you can list out the primary factors. It looks like you said the U.S. is much more quickly improving, I think you said it started April, down 25%. And just within the month, it's now only down 15%. So anything you can compare and contrast between China and the U.S. in terms of how we think about the recoveries around the world would be great."

A lot of it was around operational elements that I described earlier in the call. We've certainly also been watching and learning as China has been able to approach the digital side of the business. I think they are further ahead than most of our markets in terms of how they use digital. So a lot of good -- but as you mentioned, as we've referenced as well, the pace of recovery in China has been slow. We're not seeing a V-shaped recovery in China. The business trends are improving, but they're still running negative to where we were a year ago. I think there's a couple of things that are worth just noting as to reasons for that. The first is we had substantially more restaurants in China that were fully closed than have to reopen. So that's a larger disruption than if you're able to kind of continue to be open and then just moderating your channels. So that was one issue.
The second is, just a reminder, in China, only 15% of the restaurants have drive-thru. And I would say one of the things that we have seen as a real strength of our business is drive-thru penetration. And so when you have a strong drive-thru penetration, I think your ability for that business, that market to get -- bounce back, that's certainly an added benefit. Kevin, I don't know if anything else you want to add."

I know it varies, but if there's an average or some anecdotes there.  
And then, Kevin, I just want to make sure I clarify your dividend comment. You said you're acknowledging the dividend. Does that mean that it's under review or it's not under review? Just making it clear what you said about the dividend and your decisions around that."

I mean, I've got to say that every market is in a different situation based on what's happened from government mandates, just the overall orientation of that market. So difficult to generalize. Certainly, I think you can conclude that in restaurants that are open, comp is still down. Comp is down, reflecting just a lower level of economic activity. People are still largely staying at home, even in markets that are able to remain open. So that is adversely affecting, even in restaurants that are open, comp trends. But again, it varies really market by market.  
I think if you then go to your second question, which is about percent of restaurants primarily in Europe, again, I'll focus there that have drive-thru. The majority of our restaurants have drive-thru in Europe. It does vary market by market, but the majority of our restaurants do have drive-thru. So that certainly is something that we expect to be helpful to us as we emerge out of this. And then, Kevin, I'll flip the other questions over to you."

Part of that or a chunk of that really are U.S. Experience of the Future projects. We've substantially reduced those projects for this year. Now to your point, I view that as, as soon as it's reasonably feasible to keep going on those, many of the franchisees will want to continue doing those. We have gotten some requests even already for some franchisees to continue those projects. So I would expect a lot of those would get pushed into 2021. But I think the franchisees, and rightly so, want to understand that the business is back to operating, I'll say, more normally before they go invest substantial dollars and close their restaurants for a period of time also. So that's a piece of it. We're also reducing openings in many of the markets outside the U.S., again, partly because if you think about several of those countries, they've been closed for a period of time now. They're just getting back up and running now, the normal operations. And so the disruption of going and opening new restaurants right now at a maybe quicker pace probably isn't the right thing to do for a lot of the franchisees there. So that pace will slow in 2020. But again, I think that's relatively easy to continue picking up. And we certainly still see opportunities for growth in most of those markets. So it isn't a long-term change in opportunity, but it is a pause in 2020 for a lot of that."

We have some contractual obligations we needed to pay for stopping some R&D work. That cost us about $20 million. And then we also have an unusual dynamic where there's a portion of our people costs that are capitalized related to restaurant openings. And as we reduce our restaurant openings, less of those costs will be able to be capitalized. That will likely cost us another $30 million to $35 million of G&A. Now that's not additional cash because we were paying those folks already, but it's the accounting of them where it may end up in G&A instead of where it would have been capitalized on development.

But I want to start by acknowledging the human toll of this pandemic. Let me express our deepest sympathies to those inside and outside of McDonald's who have been affected by this virus. In particular, I want to extend heartfelt thanks and gratitude to health care professionals, first responders and other essential workers around the world who have put their own lives at risk to help others.  
The global crisis has impacted people and communities everywhere. In the face of such enormous challenges, I'm immensely proud of the entire McDonald's system and the tireless efforts of our franchisees, crew members, suppliers and company employees. Where we've been able to stay open safely and responsible, they've made it possible for McDonald's to continue offering great-tasting, affordable and convenient food amidst widespread change and disruption.  
Turning now to our performance for the quarter. Our Velocity Growth Plan drove strong results in 2019. That momentum carried into January and February. Since then, the outbreak of coronavirus around the world has created a major business disruption that adversely impacted our performance.  
Beginning in mid-March, we experienced a significant decline in our business due to the pandemic, dragging down our Q1 global comparable sales by 3.4%. We're now operating in a completely different world, and we expect these changes to persist long after the crisis is over.  
In times like these, we take strength from the resilience and experiences we've developed over our 65-year history. While we're not immune to the immediate pressures threatening our global community, we came into the situation better positioned than most, and we believe that we will strengthen our competitive advantages following the crisis.  
Entering the crisis, our system was in great shape. In addition to McDonald's strong balance sheet, franchisee cash flows in most of our major markets were at or near record highs in 2019. Our global restaurant estate had been largely modernized. And we've made significant investments to build new capabilities and delivery in digital that have proven to be critical to our business during the pandemic.  
We now navigate through the crisis. McDonald's unmatched global footprint, scale and deep operational expertise are also proving to be significant strengths for us. Specifically, with a presence in over 100 markets, we've been able to develop insights and best practices as countries move through different phases of the outbreak.  
In China, where the outbreak began, we quickly learned how to adjust our operations to enhance crew and customer safety. We developed new positioning guides and piloted contactless delivery. These solutions, along with many others, were then shared around the globe. As each country develops their own innovations, these are quickly shared by our global restaurant solutions group across all markets. Our system's ability to quickly adapt operations across 40,000 restaurants has been incredible to see.  
The size and scale of our supply chain has also proven to be a significant advantage during this crisis. To date, despite the disruption to our business, we have had no break in supply for any food, packaging materials, toys, equipment, logistics or other solutions globally.  
I want to give particular recognition to our supply chain team for sourcing vital PPE materials such as masks. To give you just some sense of the scale with which we operate, our global supply chain team has sourced over 120 million masks to meet the needs of the McDonald's system. And of course, McDonald's strong drive-thru development has continued to allow us to safely serve millions of customers each day while adhering to social distancing mandates or guidelines. In the U.S., nearly 95% of our locations have drive-thru, and virtually all are open to serve health care professionals, first responders, other essential workers and customers looking for their McDonald's moment. Similarly, Australia and Canada have been able to safely remain open.  
Finally, I should note that our global delivery sales are up significantly versus pre-COVID. Our restaurant footprint and customers' love for our brand make us an essential partner for any third-party operator.  
Once we emerge from this crisis, our expectation is that McDonald's can further extend its leadership in every market where we operate. To do this, it's essential that our franchisees have the financial wherewithal to capitalize on the opportunities we think will be available to our system. For that reason, we've taken several steps to help our franchisees and developmental licensees maintain their liquidity and financial strength. While there will continue to be difficult decisions along the way, we are providing timely, targeted and temporary financial support, which Kevin will walk through in a few minutes.  
From a customer perspective, we're encouraged by some of our early learnings that lead us to believe customers will be seeking known brands and familiar routines. We're also seeking -- seeing a heightened focus on value and convenience. In China, this was reflected in the response to our recent Big Mac promotion, showed that after a prolonged disruption to their daily lives, customers are craving comfort in our iconic core menu items. We've also seen this where we've been able to safely remain open in cities like Tokyo, Berlin and Chicago and in Northern France, where we slowly began reopening restaurants last week.  
As I mentioned earlier, our reopening efforts in our European markets will be phased and grounded in what's best for the safety of our customers and crew. Similar to what we did in U.S. and Canada, we'll be serving a limited menu in many markets, focused primarily on our core items when we reopen in countries around the world. Through this, we will focus on what McDonald's has done so well for decades, serving great-tasting food fast.  
This is a challenging and unpredictable time. Looking at comparable sales, we expect the second quarter as a whole to be significantly worse than what we experienced for the full month of March. Kevin will talk about what we've seen in the month of April.  
As things stand, we believe we reached the trough in terms of number of restaurants closed in late March. We are planning for limited reopenings in markets in the near future. The exact trajectory of our recovery, however, is highly uncertain and dependent on many factors outside our control such as government mandates, the risk of a second wave of infection to the availability of testing and the overall economic backdrop. We're developing contingency plans for a wide variety of scenarios.  
From our experience in China as well as from our experience closing and opening 10,000 restaurants as part of our EOTF remodel program in the U.S., we do know that customers will not immediately revert back to their pre-shutdown routines. For example, we know that breakfast will be the most challenged daypart. We know that a focus on core menu will be critical due to both customer interest in familiar favorites and operational ease. We know that value will be a necessary element to reengage our customers. Each market is rebuilding their marketing calendar to reflect these learnings and many others so we can reignite our business momentum.  
But our first priority has been and will continue to be safeguarding the health and safety of our people and customers. The trust the McDonald's brand has developed over the last 65 years is our most precious asset, and we will never put that at risk. We remain closely aligned with the expert judgment of scientific and government leaders in our various markets, and we support the focus on widespread testing as a central element to broader recovery efforts.  
Whatever the cadence of reopening markets, we know we can adapt. McDonald's is a remarkable system, and I'm confident that the strengths we've exhibited both before and during the crisis will be even more apparent as we emerge into a new post-coronavirus world.  
I'll now turn it over to Kevin to talk about our first quarter results."

Beginning in mid-March, consumer traffic began to d",1715,"Thanks, Chris. We began 2020 with strong top line momentum. Global comp sales were up 7.2% through February, reflecting strong performance in most countries around the world and the benefit of leap year. Beginning in mid-March, consumer traffic began to decline significantly due to the impact of COVID-19 as we temporarily closed some restaurants and shifted to limited operations and others when many parts of the world experienced government restrictions and shelter-in-place guidelines. As a result, global comp sales were down 22% in the month of March and down 3.4% in the first quarter.  
Today, I'll walk through March and April trends to provide perspective on how comp sales have progressed over the past few months.  
International Operated Market comp sales were down 35% for the month of March. In the second half of March, comp sales were down roughly 70% as several markets like France, Italy, Spain and the U.K. temporarily closed all restaurants, and other markets like Australia, Canada and Germany had drive-thru, delivery and takeaway only or limited hours and menus. Comp sales have continued to be down about 70% through April in this segment, as many of the fully closed markets are now just beginning to reopen.  
Turning to the U.S. Comp sales were negative 13% for the month of March. Beginning in mid-March and continuing through mid-April, U.S. comp sales were consistently down about 25%. However, we have begun to see some improvement in the last couple of weeks. We expect April comp sales to be down about 20%.  
Also, over the last several weeks, the U.S. has experienced a significant increase in average check across all channels. This is due to an increase in party size as well as evolving consumer behavior, with daily routines interrupted and fewer transactions at the breakfast daypart.  
Not surprisingly, the U.S. has also seen sales impacted on weekends more than weekdays, as consumers leave their houses only when necessary. And we've seen a shift in sales mix by order channel, as nearly all restaurants are operating drive-thru, delivery and takeaway only.  
Prior to the impact of COVID-19, the drive-thru accounted for about 2/3 of all sales in the U.S. As consumers shifted from in-person ordering to drive-thru and delivery channels, drive-thru now accounts for nearly 90% of sales in the U.S.  
We're also seeing an uptick in delivery and digital transactions per restaurant. And all of these trends are similar to what we've seen in China and other markets.  
Comp sales in the International Developmental Licensed segment were down 19% for the month of March. Similar to the other segments, in the second half of March, comp sales were down even more significantly, reflecting the impact of COVID-19 as it's spread throughout the segment.  
In China, approximately 25% of restaurants were closed in early February. By the end of March, substantially all restaurants had reopened. However, the market continues to experience a reduced level of demand as consumers have not fully returned to their pre-COVID routines, resulting in negative comp sales since the initial outbreak in late January.  
Comp sales were down over 20% in the first quarter, and trends have improved in April to negative mid-teens.  
In terms of new unit development, China opened over 100 restaurants in the quarter. We remain confident in new restaurant growth opportunities in China. However, we expect time lines to be delayed due to the crisis.  
I want to transition to some areas that are most relevant to understanding the impact of COVID-19 on our results, including flow-through considerations on the P&L, corporate liquidity and franchisee financial health.  
Starting with the P&L. As we've become a more heavily franchised business over the last several years, our operating model is designed to tap into the entrepreneurial spirit of our local business owners and for efficient conversion of top line growth to the bottom line. In other words, as comp sales grow, the fixed nature of our franchise cost structure results in strong flow-through to the bottom line. Conversely, in the current environment of declining sales, we see less flow-through to franchise margin dollars.  
Our company-operated restaurant expenses are more variable in areas such as food and paper and labor costs. So the flow-through to margin dollars is a bit better in our company-operated restaurants in the current environment.  
For perspective, in March with a comp sales of negative 22%, our total restaurant margin dollars declined $350 million, with about 75% of the decline driven by franchise margin dollars. Most of the decline was in the IOM segment due to the significant number of temporary restaurant closures.  
Turning to G&A. We saw an increase of about $95 million in constant currencies or 19% versus first quarter last year. About 2/3 of the increase relates to nonrecurring costs, including $40 million for the cancellation of our biennial worldwide convention and roughly $20 million related to payments of contractual obligations as we reduce the scope and ongoing spend in R&D work of certain restaurant technology. The remaining increase relates to the run costs associated with our acquisitions of Dynamic Yield and Apprente as well as continued depreciation and amortization costs related to technology. As a reminder, both of these acquisitions occurred subsequent to first quarter 2019, so we're not lapping those acquisitions yet.  
Our investment in digital customer engagement remains a priority for our business. And as I mentioned before, we've already seen the benefits of Dynamic Yield in our operating results. These digital investments enable us to give customers more choice and flexibility in how they order, pay and receive their food during this unprecedented time and will remain important in serving customers as we think about our business beyond this crisis.  
As we navigate through uncharted waters, we're taking a disciplined approach to decision making. This includes reviewing all investments and reducing or delaying spending as we rescope priorities in some areas and redirect dollars to other priorities. We're focusing resources on projects and initiatives that can reasonably be implemented and executed in the near term, both in terms of cost and time and will also benefit the system for the long term.  
As we make these assessments, we'll also prioritize our resources against the most critical needs of the business. Due to COVID-19, we expect a few lines of the other operating section of the P&L to be impacted in 2020 as well. Gains on restaurant sales are expected to be down about $100 million as a result of minimal restaurant sale activity for the rest of the year. Our equity and earnings of affiliates is expected to be down substantially, and we expect to have some additional reserves for bad debts related to rent and royalty deferrals subsequent to March.  
The result of all of this is that we expect our operating cash flow to be down significantly this year. We entered the crisis with a strong balance sheet, and we've taken a number of actions to preserve financial flexibility. In addition to currently reviewing our G&A costs, we suspended our share repurchase program in early March. We secured $6.5 billion of new financing in March, including $5.5 billion of debt issuances at various maturities and a new $1 billion line of credit that we drew upon immediately.  
In terms of capital expenditures, we've taken a very practical approach to development activity. We suspended Experience of the Future groundbreaks in the U.S. and new restaurant openings around the world as COVID-19 began to spread. Given that our first quarter CapEx is typically about 20% of the full year and many projects are delayed or on hold, we now have some flexibility with decisions for the majority of our planned capital spend for the year. As a result, we're reducing our 2020 spending by about $1 billion from our initial expectation of $2.4 billion.  
I also want to acknowledge our dividend. We paid our first quarter dividend at the beginning of March, prior to the widespread impact of COVID. McDonald's remains financially strong, and our capital allocation priorities remain investing in the business for growth and prioritizing dividends to our shareholders. We will continue to manage and utilize our funds in a judicious manner that focuses on ensuring the company is able to grow the business and our franchisees remain financially strong.  
As I mentioned earlier, we've taken a number of actions to ensure that the company is in a sound financial position and to put our franchisees and developmental licensee partners around the world in a position to be successful in running their businesses. As COVID spread quickly around the world, our first step was determining operating procedures, resulting in temporary closures of all restaurants in some countries and limited operations in others, as I've mentioned. That was quickly followed by providing broad-based financial liquidity assistance in the form of rent and royalty deferrals that were generally applicable to all franchisees within various markets because we needed to make quick decisions to alleviate franchisee concerns and put them in the best position to maintain their businesses. Generally, we've deferred the collection of rent and royalties earned in March and April in most markets around the world. Cash is collected on a 1-month lag, so the cash impact of these deferrals occurs in April and May. This deferral amounts to roughly $1 billion of liquidity assistance that we committed to our franchisees and developmental licensee partners across the system. We also work closely with lenders, suppliers and distributors to extend payment terms to franchisees where necessary.  
Now we're assessing the financial health and liquidity of specific at-risk franchisee and developmental licensee organizations. This assessment includes various sales projection scenarios and takes into account the impact of liquidity assistance measures provided by the company, suppliers, lenders and governments. We've developed an objective framework for making decisions regarding which specific franchisee and DL organizations may need further liquidity assistance and how we may support them. This will help ensure a consistent and equitable approach to decision-making across all of our markets. As Chris mentioned, our general philosophy is for any assistance to be timely, targeted and temporary. The financial health and strength of our franchisees has been a competitive advantage for McDonald's for years, and we expect that to continue post COVID-19.  
Now I'll turn it back to Chris."

While there's much we don't know about the future course of this pandemic, we are taking the necessary actions to ensure we will emerge from this crisis in a position of strength. Looking ahead, we know these unprecedented times will bring about some fundamental changes to the way businesses, including ours, operate. What will remain constant is our commitment to maintaining the strong level of trust our customers have in the business.  
We're also beginning to think about our strategy in the aftermath of COVID-19. While elements of Velocity Growth Plan will continue to be important, we're making adjustments in real time and there will likely need to be further changes. We'll look to provide updates on our overall progress later in the year.  
In these challenging times, I'm immensely proud of the way our system has banded together to stay true to our purpose to feed and foster community. The countless inspiring examples of this around the world showcase the real impact McDonald's has in the communities in which we operate. I'm proud to share a handful of these stories.  
In the U.S., our restaurants are offering our appreciation with free Thank You Meal boxes to first responders and health care workers to thank them for their tireless efforts to protect us all. These include favorite breakfast and lunch menu items packaged in and Happy Meal boxes with a thank you note in place of a toy. We're in the middle of this 2-week show of appreciation, and we've already provided nearly 4 million Thank You Meals.  
Across Europe, many markets are providing free drinks, coffee and meals to first responders and health care workers on the front lines. In Madrid, a restaurant just reopened solely to serve frontline workers at the nearby hospital.  
In Australia, we've added staples of milk, eggs and bread to our menus, enabling customers to use McDonald's contactless drive-thru and takeaway to shop for basics, providing a safe and easy way for customers to shop.  
And in many of the communities around the world that we call home, extra food within the supply chain is being redistributed through nonprofit organizations and local food banks to feed communities in need.  
We've also donated nearly 1.5 million masks to COVID relief efforts.  
As I said earlier, we entered this crisis with a solid foundation. While we face significant disruptions and challenges, we remain confident in our ability to adapt, as we've done throughout our 65 years to secure our long-term success. And now we'll begin Q&A."

So just focusing on those international markets, obviously, a lot of that weakness has been closed stores. But I would also imagine that those would be more vulnerable to COVID-type formats, like higher walk-in mix, and there might be other economic and structural factors that might linger. So can you give us a sense about how things look in those markets as you get back to reopening? Do you see the snapback as strong as it's been in the U.S.? And then perhaps you can dig into that comment about the support you're offering to franchisees, especially in those hardest hit markets."

In the international, particularly in our IOM markets in Europe, we have a number of countries that are completely closed based on government mandates. We are just beginning the process of reopening on a limited basis in a number of those markets. And so it's probably a little premature for us to give you any indication of what the overall trajectory is going to be. But I would say we've been really encouraged when we do start to open limited restaurants by the demand. You may have seen in the last week, as we've opened up in a few of these markets, we had a 3-hour wait at one of our restaurants in France. For people to get through the drive-thru in Austria, we had a 2-mile line of people looking to get into the drive-thru. And I think our overall view is, as markets start to open up, this desire to really return to familiar favorites, to brands that are known is very, very powerful. And I think the fact that we also have a strong orientation toward convenience and value, that, I think are also 2 key elements. We are optimistic. We certainly are expecting that we're going to be able to take share in those markets. And so I think, we, like everybody else, are closely watching what the overall level of customer demand is going to be. We do feel like we're well positioned on that, but probably too soon to say.  
In terms of financial support that we're providing to franchisees, let me pass it over to Kevin to address."

David, related to the franchisee assistance, I'd say it's similar to what we've done in the U.S. As I talked about in my remarks, at the beginning, what we really did was kind of this broad-based assistance that was deferring a couple of months of rent and royalties, generally, for most franchisees around the world. The other thing that's happened is essentially, we've converted our rent to variable rent based on sales. So the restaurants that have been closed effectively aren't paying rent because they don't have sales. The only other thing I would point out is, there's various different forms of government assistance in each country. So certain countries provide more assistance related to kind of workers who aren't working temporarily, which means that in some of the markets, they've been able to effectively help the franchisees in terms of being able to keep their workers, but not if the -- that payment doesn't come out of the franchisees' pockets while the restaurants are closed. And then in several markets, we've actually been working with other companies to actually even find places where employees have been able to work. So in a couple of them, we've partnered up with companies like ALDI and others to provide temporary employment for our workers while our restaurants are closed. So I wouldn't say that our assistance is substantially different on the international side. Again, we started at the broad base, and now we're looking at individual organizations to see where we may need to step in, both internationally and in the U.S."

So maybe let me take it in 2 different pieces there. I think in terms of the best practices, we have learned a lot around how we adjust operations to really make sure that we're providing a safe environment for our crew and for our customers. In almost every market where we operate, the U.S. included, there are dedicated teams that are meeting daily and reviewing procedures and connected to our global restaurant solutions group to understand these best practices. In the case of the U.S., they've made 50 different changes to operating procedures as we've learned more. And it's everything from positioning guides to protective barriers to other things like masks, how often, how frequently we are sanitizing surfaces, just a variety of different things. So that has been really helpful for us in terms of just making sure that our restaurant continue to be a safe environment for both customers as well as for our crew. I think that certainly does help with the demand that we're seeing. I think as people get confident about our ability to continue to offer food in a safe way, that certainly helps, but there is a benefit that I think you could attribute to the stimulus checks. I think there's probably also, as customers are starting to venture out a little bit more, this desire to really go to familiar brands. You saw it in -- in the -- away from -- or in the at-home occasion, center of the store, familiar brands in grocery really benefited as people were staying home. I think that same dynamic is going to be at play as people start to come out looking for familiar brands. So I think there's a variety of different things that play there in the U.S., but certainly, we've been more encouraged by what we've seen in the last couple of weeks in the U.S."

I think the important point that Kevin talked about in terms of the principles of timely, targeted and temporary is, we will provide the support when it's apparent that what the scenario is that we're dealing with. So that's the timely element, which is, who knows how any of this progresses. But we certainly have a sense of, depending on which trajectory we go, who's going to be at risk.

Is there any way to maybe bucket how many of those franchisees or what percentage of the system would fall into the category of you might need to offer additional assistance?  
And then my second part of the question is really related to how you think the cash flows will shape up in the short run. If there's any metrics you can share in terms of cash burn rate for the second quarter, for example, that would be helpful."

This is not a large majority of operators or a large piece of the operators. It's generally maybe a few operators in each market that we're working with. So it isn't a widespread issue that we're dealing with.  
Related to cash flow, and let me try and put that in some context, and I'll go back and just -- I may repeat some of the things I had mentioned in my remarks, but remember, we entered the crisis certainly from a position of financial strength. From a corporate standpoint, we're obviously -- we have a strong investment-grade credit rating, that's always been important to us, so we've been maintaining that. And I talked about our franchisees also entered into the year pretty strong financially. As we got into this year and the impact of COVID was growing, you would have seen that we acted pretty quickly to bolster our cash position, certainly in anticipation of the changing macroeconomic and business conditions around the world. We secured $6.5 billion of new financing in March, which was about 5.5 -- well, which was $5.5 billion of bonds and $1 billion of line of credit. And then we also still have full access to a committed line of credit of $3.5 billion. So I know cash burn is a frequent topic of discussion lately. We certainly keep our eye on that, but we do have confidence in our liquidity position based on our current cash balance and our ability to get further access if we need it in the markets. We ended the first quarter a little over $5 billion of cash on our balance sheet. And again, remember, we still have that $3.5 billion line of credit that's untapped if we ever should need it. I'd say our cash outflows right now are fairly consistent month-to-month for things like G&A and capital and lease expense costs. In this environment, the big variable is the cash inflows because, as you know, we operate in over 100 countries. We've given some of that -- those rent and royalty deferrals of over $1 billion. And now we're looking at those individual operator organizations that may need something further. 
Having said all that, between the temporary restaurant closures and the deferrals, our cash inflows certainly will be significantly less in the second quarter than normal. So we're likely to have negative free cash flow in the second quarter. But assuming that the countries continue to reopen on the schedules that we're seeing right now, and again most of those are in the European markets, and assuming franchisees then can have the ability to pay their rents and royalties, we would expect that the free cash flow would turn back to positive in the third quarter. So we do think second quarter will be a rougher quarter in terms of cash flow. But right now, based on current plans, we would expect that to turn around back to positive in the third quarter."

So before January and February, you noted that comp was balanced between traffic and ticket in the U.S. I guess if you could just talk a little bit about does that account for leap year? Effectively, you haven't had positive traffic in the U.S. in a while. I'm trying to understand what the drivers might have been. And then after the emergence of the pandemic, you've talked about global delivery sales being up significant. Could you just quantify share of sales or year-over-year growth in delivery? Maybe give some color on digital ordering as well some -- presumably, even some of the drive-thru orders or carryout would have been digital. So just a little bit more context before and after."

The team was very excited about the U.S. results through February. As you know, we were up over 8% for the first 2 months of the year, and a good amount of that was due to traffic. We were really encouraged by the traffic trends that we were seeing entering into the new year, and that excludes the extra benefit that we then got through leap year. So we were in a good traffic position through the first couple of months in the U.S. Leap year further helped that and then we had COVID and kind of the rest from there in terms of what we've been working through.  
I think from a delivery standpoint, the important thing is the vast majority of our business is still drive-thru driven in the U.S. And so while delivery is up significantly, it's not the predominant thing that is driving our business. The predominant channel is really through the drive-thru. Kevin, I don't know if you have anything else you want to add."

Wondering if maybe you can give some sort of a monthly trend as that market, I think you said, is now down mid-teens. So it seems like it's a 5-point-plus improvement but over multiple months. So it seems like maybe it's slower than some had hoped. I was just wondering maybe if you can list out the primary factors. It looks like you said the U.S. is much more quickly improving, I think you said it started April, down 25%. And just within the month, it's now only down 15%.

A lot of it was around operational elements that I described earlier in the call. We've certainly also been watching and learning as China has been able to approach the digital side of the business. I think they are further ahead than most of our markets in terms of how they use digital. So a lot of good -- but as you mentioned, as we've referenced as well, the pace of recovery in China has been slow. We're not seeing a V-shaped recovery in China. The business trends are improving, but they're still running negative to where we were a year ago. I think there's a couple of things that are worth just noting as to reasons for that. The first is we had substantially more restaurants in China that were fully closed and then have to reopen. So that's a larger disruption than if you're able to kind of continue to be open and then just moderating your channels. So that was one issue.
The second is, just a reminder, in China, only 15% of the restaurants have drive-thru. And I would say one of the things that we have seen as a real strength of our business is drive-thru penetration. And so when you have a strong drive-thru penetration, I think your ability for that business, that market to get -- bounce back, that's certainly an added benefit.

I mean I've got to say that every market is in a different situation based on what's happened from government mandates, just the overall orientation of that market. So difficult to generalize. Certainly, I think you can conclude that in restaurants that are open, comp is still down. Comp is down, reflecting just a lower level of economic activity. People are still largely staying at home, even in markets that are able to remain open. So that is adversely affecting, even in restaurants that are open, comp trends. But again, it varies really market by market.  
I think if you then go to your second question, which is about percent of restaurants primarily in Europe, again, I'll focus there that have drive-thru. The majority of our restaurants have drive-thru in Europe. It does vary market by market, but the majority of our restaurants do have drive-thru. So that certainly is something that we expect to be helpful to us as we emerge out of this. And then, Kevin, I'll flip the other questions over to you."

Part of that or a chunk of that really are U.S. Experience of the Future projects. We've substantially reduced those projects for this year. Now to your point, I view that as, as soon as it's reasonably feasible to keep going on those, many of the franchisees will want to continue doing those. We have gotten some requests even already for some franchisees to continue those projects. So I would expect a lot of those would get pushed into 2021. But I think the franchisees, and rightly so, want to understand that the business is back to operating, I'll say, more normally before they go invest substantial dollars and close their restaurants for a period of time also. So that's a piece of it. We're also reducing openings in many of the markets outside the U.S., again, partly because if you think about several of those countries, they've been closed for a period of time now. They're just getting back up and running now, the normal operations. And so the disruption of going and opening new restaurants right now at a maybe quicker pace probably isn't the right thing to do for a lot of the franchisees there. So that pace will slow in 2020. But again, I think that's relatively easy to continue picking up. And we certainly still see opportunities for growth in most of those markets. So it isn't a long-term change in opportunity, but it is a pause in 2020 for a lot of that."

And as we reduce our restaurant openings, less of those costs will be able to be capitalized. That will likely cost us another $30 million to $35 million of G&A. Now that's not additional cash because we were paying those folks already, but it's the accounting of them where it may end up in G&A instead of where it would have been capitalized on development. So we've got some offsetting things going on in G&A for the year."

But I want to start by acknowledging the human toll of this pandemic. Let me express our deepest sympathies to those inside and outside of McDonald's who have been affected by this virus. In particular, I want to extend heartfelt thanks and gratitude to health care professionals, first responders and other essential workers around the world who have put their own lives at risk to help others.  
The global crisis has impacted people and communities everywhere. In the face of such enormous challenges, I'm immensely proud of the entire McDonald's system and the tireless efforts of our franchisees, crew members, suppliers and company employees. Where we've been able to stay open safely and responsible, they've made it possible for McDonald's to continue offering great-tasting, affordable and convenient food amidst widespread change and disruption.  
Turning now to our performance for the quarter. Our Velocity Growth Plan drove strong results in 2019. That momentum carried into January and February. Since then, the outbreak of coronavirus around the world has created a major business disruption that adversely impacted our performance.  
Beginning in mid-March, we experienced a significant decline in our business due to the pandemic, dragging down our Q1 global comparable sales by 3.4%. We're now operating in a completely different world, and we expect these changes to persist long after the crisis is over.  
In times like these, we take strength from the resilience and experiences we've developed over our 65-year history. While we're not immune to the immediate pressures threatening our global community, we came into the situation better positioned than most, and we believe that we will strengthen our competitive advantages following the crisis.  
Entering the crisis, our system was in great shape. In addition to McDonald's strong balance sheet, franchisee cash flows in most of our major markets were at or near record highs in 2019. Our global restaurant estate had been largely modernized. And we've made significant investments to build new capabilities and delivery in digital that have proven to be critical to our business during the pandemic.  
We now navigate through the crisis. McDonald's unmatched global footprint, scale and deep operational expertise are also proving to be significant strengths for us. Specifically, with a presence in over 100 markets, we've been able to develop insights and best practices as countries move through different phases of the outbreak.  
In China, where the outbreak began, we quickly learned how to adjust our operations to enhance crew and customer safety. We developed new positioning guides and piloted contactless delivery. These solutions, along with many others, were then shared around the globe. As each country develops their own innovations, these are quickly shared by our global restaurant solutions group across all markets. Our system's ability to quickly adapt operations across 40,000 restaurants has been incredible to see.  
The size and scale of our supply chain has also proven to be a significant advantage during this crisis. To date, despite the disruption to our business, we have had no break in supply for any food, packaging materials, toys, equipment, logistics or other solutions globally.  
I want to give particular recognition to our supply chain team for sourcing vital PPE materials such as masks. To give you just some sense of the scale with which we operate, our global supply chain team has sourced over 120 million masks to meet the needs of the McDonald's system. And of course, McDonald's strong drive-thru development has continued to allow us to safely serve millions of customers each day while adhering to social distancing mandates or guidelines. In the U.S., nearly 95% of our locations have drive-thru, and virtually all are open to serve health care professionals, first responders, other essential workers and customers looking for their McDonald's moment. Similarly, Australia and Canada have been able to safely remain open.  
Finally, I should note that our global delivery sales are up significantly versus pre-COVID. Our restaurant footprint and customers' love for our brand make us an essential partner for any third-party operator.  
Once we emerge from this crisis, our expectation is that McDonald's can further extend its leadership in every market where we operate. To do this, it's essential that our franchisees have the financial wherewithal to capitalize on the opportunities we think will be available to our system. For that reason, we've taken several steps to help our franchisees and developmental licensees maintain their liquidity and financial strength. While there will continue to be difficult decisions along the way, we are providing timely, targeted and temporary financial support, which Kevin will walk through in a few minutes.  
From a customer perspective, we're encouraged by some of our early learnings that lead us to believe customers will be seeking known brands and familiar routines. We're also seeking -- seeing a heightened focus on value and convenience. In China, this was reflected in the response to our recent Big Mac promotion, showed that after a prolonged disruption to their daily lives, customers are craving comfort in our iconic core menu items. We've also seen this where we've been able to safely remain open in cities like Tokyo, Berlin and Chicago and in Northern France, where we slowly began reopening restaurants last week.  
As I mentioned earlier, our reopening efforts in our European markets will be phased and grounded in what's best for the safety of our customers and crew. Similar to what we did in U.S. and Canada, we'll be serving a limited menu in many markets, focused primarily on our core items when we reopen in countries around the world. Through this, we will focus on what McDonald's has done so well for decades, serving great-tasting food fast.  
This is a challenging and unpredictable time. Looking at comparable sales, we expect the second quarter as a whole to be significantly worse than what we experienced for the full month of March. Kevin will talk about what we've seen in the month of April.  
As things stand, we believe we reached the trough in terms of number of restaurants closed in late March. We are planning for limited reopenings in markets in the near future. The exact trajectory of our recovery, however, is highly uncertain and dependent on many factors outside our control such as government mandates, the risk of a second wave of infection to the availability of testing and the overall economic backdrop. We're developing contingency plans for a wide variety of scenarios.  
From our experience in China as well as from our experience closing and opening 10,000 restaurants as part of our EOTF remodel program in the U.S., we do know that customers will not immediately revert back to their pre-shutdown routines. For example, we know that breakfast will be the most challenged daypart. We know that a focus on core menu will be critical due to both customer interest in familiar favorites and operational ease. We know that value will be a necessary element to reengage our customers. Each market is rebuilding their marketing calendar to reflect these learnings and many others so we can reignite our business momentum.  
But our first priority has been and will continue to be safeguarding the health and safety of our people and customers. The trust the McDonald's brand has developed over the last 65 years is our most precious asset, and we will never put that at risk. We remain closely aligned with the expert judgment of scientific and government leaders in our various markets, and we support the focus on widespread testing as a central element to broader recovery efforts.  
Whatever the cadence of reopening markets, we know we can adapt. McDonald's is a remarkable system, and I'm confident that the strengths we've exhibited both before and during the crisis will be even more apparent as we emerge into a new post-coronavirus world.  
I'll now turn it over to Kevin to talk about our first quarter results."
139488,662236749,1969105,"McDonald's Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",2020-04-30,"Earnings Calls","McDonald's Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Chris. We began 2020 with strong top line momentum. Global comp sales were up 7.2% through February, reflecting strong performance in most countries around the world and the benefit of leap year. Beginning in mid-March, consumer traffic began to d",1715,"Thanks, Chris. We began 2020 with strong top line momentum. Global comp sales were up 7.2% through February, reflecting strong performance in most countries around the world and the benefit of leap year. Beginning in mid-March, consumer traffic began to decline significantly due to the impact of COVID-19 as we temporarily closed some restaurants and shifted to limited operations and others when many parts of the world experienced government restrictions and shelter-in-place guidelines. As a result, global comp sales were down 22% in the month of March and down 3.4% in the first quarter.  
Today, I'll walk through March and April trends to provide perspective on how comp sales have progressed over the past few months.  
International Operated Market comp sales were down 35% for the month of March. In the second half of March, comp sales were down roughly 70% as several markets like France, Italy, Spain and the U.K. temporarily closed all restaurants, and other markets like Australia, Canada and Germany had drive-thru, delivery and takeaway only or limited hours and menus. Comp sales have continued to be down about 70% through April in this segment, as many of the fully closed markets are now just beginning to reopen.  
Turning to the U.S. Comp sales were negative 13% for the month of March. Beginning in mid-March and continuing through mid-April, U.S. comp sales were consistently down about 25%. However, we have begun to see some improvement in the last couple of weeks. We expect April comp sales to be down about 20%.  
Also, over the last several weeks, the U.S. has experienced a significant increase in average check across all channels. This is due to an increase in party size as well as evolving consumer behavior, with daily routines interrupted and fewer transactions at the breakfast daypart.  
Not surprisingly, the U.S. has also seen sales impacted on weekends more than weekdays, as consumers leave their houses only when necessary. And we've seen a shift in sales mix by order channel, as nearly all restaurants are operating drive-thru, delivery and takeaway only.  
Prior to the impact of COVID-19, the drive-thru accounted for about 2/3 of all sales in the U.S. As consumers shifted from in-person ordering to drive-thru and delivery channels, drive-thru now accounts for nearly 90% of sales in the U.S.  
We're also seeing an uptick in delivery and digital transactions per restaurant. And all of these trends are similar to what we've seen in China and other markets.  
Comp sales in the International Developmental Licensed segment were down 19% for the month of March. Similar to the other segments, in the second half of March, comp sales were down even more significantly, reflecting the impact of COVID-19 as it's spread throughout the segment.  
In China, approximately 25% of restaurants were closed in early February. By the end of March, substantially all restaurants had reopened. However, the market continues to experience a reduced level of demand as consumers have not fully returned to their pre-COVID routines, resulting in negative comp sales since the initial outbreak in late January.  
Comp sales were down over 20% in the first quarter, and trends have improved in April to negative mid-teens.  
In terms of new unit development, China opened over 100 restaurants in the quarter. We remain confident in new restaurant growth opportunities in China. However, we expect time lines to be delayed due to the crisis.  
I want to transition to some areas that are most relevant to understanding the impact of COVID-19 on our results, including flow-through considerations on the P&L, corporate liquidity and franchisee financial health.  
Starting with the P&L. As we've become a more heavily franchised business over the last several years, our operating model is designed to tap into the entrepreneurial spirit of our local business owners and for efficient conversion of top line growth to the bottom line. In other words, as comp sales grow, the fixed nature of our franchise cost structure results in strong flow-through to the bottom line. Conversely, in the current environment of declining sales, we see less flow-through to franchise margin dollars.  
Our company-operated restaurant expenses are more variable in areas such as food and paper and labor costs. So the flow-through to margin dollars is a bit better in our company-operated restaurants in the current environment.  
For perspective, in March with a comp sales of negative 22%, our total restaurant margin dollars declined $350 million, with about 75% of the decline driven by franchise margin dollars. Most of the decline was in the IOM segment due to the significant number of temporary restaurant closures.  
Turning to G&A. We saw an increase of about $95 million in constant currencies or 19% versus first quarter last year. About 2/3 of the increase relates to nonrecurring costs, including $40 million for the cancellation of our biennial worldwide convention and roughly $20 million related to payments of contractual obligations as we reduce the scope and ongoing spend in R&D work of certain restaurant technology. The remaining increase relates to the run costs associated with our acquisitions of Dynamic Yield and Apprente as well as continued depreciation and amortization costs related to technology. As a reminder, both of these acquisitions occurred subsequent to first quarter 2019, so we're not lapping those acquisitions yet.  
Our investment in digital customer engagement remains a priority for our business. And as I mentioned before, we've already seen the benefits of Dynamic Yield in our operating results. These digital investments enable us to give customers more choice and flexibility in how they order, pay and receive their food during this unprecedented time and will remain important in serving customers as we think about our business beyond this crisis.  
As we navigate through uncharted waters, we're taking a disciplined approach to decision making. This includes reviewing all investments and reducing or delaying spending as we rescope priorities in some areas and redirect dollars to other priorities. We're focusing resources on projects and initiatives that can reasonably be implemented and executed in the near term, both in terms of cost and time and will also benefit the system for the long term.  
As we make these assessments, we'll also prioritize our resources against the most critical needs of the business. Due to COVID-19, we expect a few lines of the other operating section of the P&L to be impacted in 2020 as well. Gains on restaurant sales are expected to be down about $100 million as a result of minimal restaurant sale activity for the rest of the year. Our equity and earnings of affiliates is expected to be down substantially, and we expect to have some additional reserves for bad debts related to rent and royalty deferrals subsequent to March.  
The result of all of this is that we expect our operating cash flow to be down significantly this year. We entered the crisis with a strong balance sheet, and we've taken a number of actions to preserve financial flexibility. In addition to currently reviewing our G&A costs, we suspended our share repurchase program in early March. We secured $6.5 billion of new financing in March, including $5.5 billion of debt issuances at various maturities and a new $1 billion line of credit that we drew upon immediately.  
In terms of capital expenditures, we've taken a very practical approach to development activity. We suspended Experience of the Future groundbreaks in the U.S. and new restaurant openings around the world as COVID-19 began to spread. Given that our first quarter CapEx is typically about 20% of the full year and many projects are delayed or on hold, we now have some flexibility with decisions for the majority of our planned capital spend for the year. As a result, we're reducing our 2020 spending by about $1 billion from our initial expectation of $2.4 billion.  
I also want to acknowledge our dividend. We paid our first quarter dividend at the beginning of March, prior to the widespread impact of COVID. McDonald's remains financially strong, and our capital allocation priorities remain investing in the business for growth and prioritizing dividends to our shareholders. We will continue to manage and utilize our funds in a judicious manner that focuses on ensuring the company is able to grow the business and our franchisees remain financially strong.  
As I mentioned earlier, we've taken a number of actions to ensure that the company is in a sound financial position and to put our franchisees and developmental licensee partners around the world in a position to be successful in running their businesses. As COVID spread quickly around the world, our first step was determining operating procedures, resulting in temporary closures of all restaurants in some countries and limited operations in others, as I've mentioned. That was quickly followed by providing broad-based financial liquidity assistance in the form of rent and royalty deferrals that were generally applicable to all franchisees within various markets because we needed to make quick decisions to alleviate franchisee concerns and put them in the best position to maintain their businesses. Generally, we've deferred the collection of rent and royalties earned in March and April in most markets around the world. Cash is collected on a 1-month lag, so the cash impact of these deferrals occurs in April and May. This deferral amounts to roughly $1 billion of liquidity assistance that we committed to our franchisees and developmental licensee partners across the system. We also work closely with lenders, suppliers and distributors to extend payment terms to franchisees where necessary.  
Now we're assessing the financial health and liquidity of specific at-risk franchisee and developmental licensee organizations. This assessment includes various sales projection scenarios and takes into account the impact of liquidity assistance measures provided by the company, suppliers, lenders and governments. We've developed an objective framework for making decisions regarding which specific franchisee and DL organizations may need further liquidity assistance and how we may support them. This will help ensure a consistent and equitable approach to decision-making across all of our markets. As Chris mentioned, our general philosophy is for any assistance to be timely, targeted and temporary. The financial health and strength of our franchisees has been a competitive advantage for McDonald's for years, and we expect that to continue post COVID-19.  
Now I'll turn it back to Chris."

While there's much we don't know about the future course of this pandemic, we are taking the necessary actions to ensure we will emerge from this crisis in a position of strength. Looking ahead, we know these unprecedented times will bring about some fundamental changes to the way businesses, including ours, operate. What will remain constant is our commitment to maintaining the strong level of trust our customers have in the business.  
We're also beginning to think about our strategy in the aftermath of COVID-19. While elements of Velocity Growth Plan will continue to be important, we're making adjustments in real time and there will likely need to be further changes. We'll look to provide updates on our overall progress later in the year.  
In these challenging times, I'm immensely proud of the way our system has banded together to stay true to our purpose to feed and foster community. The countless inspiring examples of this around the world showcase the real impact McDonald's has in the communities in which we operate. I'm proud to share a handful of these stories.  
In the U.S., our restaurants are offering our appreciation with free Thank You Meal boxes to first responders and health care workers to thank them for their tireless efforts to protect us all. These include favorite breakfast and lunch menu items packaged in and Happy Meal boxes with a thank you note in place of a toy. We're in the middle of this 2-week show of appreciation, and we've already provided nearly 4 million Thank You Meals.  
Across Europe, many markets are providing free drinks, coffee and meals to first responders and health care workers on the front lines. In Madrid, a restaurant just reopened solely to serve frontline workers at the nearby hospital.  
In Australia, we've added staples of milk, eggs and bread to our menus, enabling customers to use McDonald's contactless drive-thru and takeaway to shop for basics, providing a safe and easy way for customers to shop.  
And in many of the communities around the world that we call home, extra food within the supply chain is being redistributed through nonprofit organizations and local food banks to feed communities in need.  
We've also donated nearly 1.5 million masks to COVID relief efforts.  
As I said earlier, we entered this crisis with a solid foundation. While we face significant disruptions and challenges, we remain confident in our ability to adapt, as we've done throughout our 65 years to secure our long-term success. And now we'll begin Q&A."

So just focusing on those international markets, obviously, a lot of that weakness has been closed stores. But I would also imagine that those would be more vulnerable to COVID-type formats, like higher walk-in mix, and there might be other economic and structural factors that might linger. So can you give us a sense about how things look in those markets as you get back to reopening? Do you see the snapback as strong as it's been in the U.S.? And then perhaps you can dig into that comment about the support you're offering to franchisees, especially in those hardest hit markets."

In the international, particularly in our IOM markets in Europe, we have a number of countries that are completely closed based on government mandates. We are just beginning the process of reopening on a limited basis in a number of those markets. And so it's probably a little premature for us to give you any indication of what the overall trajectory is going to be. But I would say we've been really encouraged when we do start to open limited restaurants by the demand. You may have seen in the last week, as we've opened up in a few of these markets, we had a 3-hour wait at one of our restaurants in France. For people to get through the drive-thru in Austria, we had a 2-mile line of people looking to get into the drive-thru. And I think our overall view is, as markets start to open up, this desire to really return to familiar favorites, to brands that are known is very, very powerful. And I think the fact that we also have a strong orientation toward convenience and value, that I think are also 2 key elements. We are optimistic. We certainly are expecting that we're going to be able to take share in those markets. And so I think, we, like everybody else, are closely watching what the overall level of customer demand is going to be. We do feel like we're well positioned on that, but probably too soon to say.  
In terms of financial support that we're providing to franchisees, let me pass it over to Kevin to address."

David, related to the franchisee assistance, I'd say it's similar to what we've done in the U.S. As I talked about in my remarks, at the beginning, what we really did was kind of this broad-based assistance that was deferring a couple of months of rent and royalties, generally, for most franchisees around the world. The other thing that's happened is essentially, we've converted our rent to variable rent based on sales. So the restaurants that have been closed effectively aren't paying rent because they don't have sales. The only other thing I would point out is, there's various different forms of government assistance in each country. So certain countries provide more assistance related to kind of workers who aren't working temporarily, which means that in some of the markets, they've been able to effectively help the franchisees in terms of being able to keep their workers, but not if the -- that payment doesn't come out of the franchisees' pockets while the restaurants are closed. And then in several markets, we've actually been working with other companies to actually even find places where employees have been able to work. So in a couple of them, we've partnered up with companies like ALDI and others to provide temporary employment for our workers while our restaurants are closed. So I wouldn't say that our assistance is substantially different on the international side. Again, we started at the broad base, and now we're looking at individual organizations to see where we may need to step in, both internationally and in the U.S."

I think that certainly does help with the demand that we're seeing. I think as people get confident about our ability to continue to offer food in a safe way, that certainly helps, but there is a benefit that I think you could attribute to the stimulus checks. I think there's probably also, as customers are starting to venture out a little bit more, this desire to really go to familiar brands. You saw it in -- in the -- away from -- or in the at-home occasion, center of the store, familiar brands in grocery really benefited as people were staying home. I think that same dynamic is going to be at play as people start to come out looking for familiar brands. So I think there's a variety of different things that play there in the U.S., but certainly, we've been more encouraged by what we've seen in the last couple of weeks in the U.S."

But in the past, you've given some detail on what's happened to franchisee cash flow. And it also seems like a lot of operators have increased debt loads quite significantly to cover the remodels and tech upgrades. So the question is, are rent and royalty deferrals enough to prevent some of your bottom-quartile franchisees from failing? And I think you alluded to this in the prepared remarks, but there may be some other options in the table. So if you could talk about what those might be for those troubled franchisees?  
And then secondarily regarding the Cares Act and the PPP relief, would you be able to say what proportion of your stores actually qualify for some government assistance there?"

And so that was why we just pushed a lot of liquidity out into the system, both from what we did as well as what our suppliers did to just, in that initial phase, make sure our system had the sufficient liquidity. And that was the broad-based deferrals that Kevin referenced. Now as we've had more time, we've essentially been able to go through and do stress test, if you will, for every single franchisee organization and have developed a sense of what we think their liquidity needs are under a variety of different scenarios in terms of how this business recovers. I think the important point that Kevin talked about in terms of the principles of timely, targeted and temporary is, we will provide the support when it's apparent that what the scenario is that we're dealing with. So that's the timely element which is, who knows how any of this progresses. But we certainly have a sense of, depending on which trajectory we go, who's going to be at risk. And then I would say we have a full suite of tools at our disposal to address those situations. But Kevin, if you want to add anything to that."

I guess, one, I would just remind everyone that we did come into 2020 with most of our franchisees in most of our major markets either at or near all-time high cash flows.

So we are cognizant of that and certainly are having the appropriate discussions with those franchisees. And to Chris' point, I think now we're at the point where we are looking at organization by organization and seeing where we may need to step in and provide further assistance or make sure that they're getting all the assistance they need from lenders, suppliers, et cetera.  
Related to kind of the loans, I guess, I would just remind everyone, our operators are small independent business owners who are eligible for the loans. They're working with their advisers to determine kind of the needs for their business. Our understanding is that most have been able to get approved and -- which would enable them to keep paying their crew and continue running their businesses. And then we'll certainly continue to work it with them to make sure that they've got the liquidity to keep running their businesses. So I think we feel pretty comfortable in general about franchisees, but there certainly will be a few that we need to just think about how they get further assistance if they need."

This is not a large majority of operators or a large piece of the operators. It's generally maybe a few operators in each market that we're working with. So it isn't a widespread issue that we're dealing with.  
Related to cash flow, and let me try and put that in some context, and I'll go back and just -- I may repeat some of the things I had mentioned in my remarks, but remember, we entered the crisis certainly from a position of financial strength. From a corporate standpoint, we're obviously -- we have a strong investment-grade credit rating, that's always been important to us, so we've been maintaining that. And I talked about our franchisees also entered into the year pretty strong financially. As we got into this year and the impact of COVID was growing, you would have seen that we acted pretty quickly to bolster our cash position, certainly in anticipation of the changing macroeconomic and business conditions around the world. We secured $6.5 billion of new financing in March, which was about 5.5 -- well, which was $5.5 billion of bonds and $1 billion of line of credit. And then we also still have full access to a committed line of credit of $3.5 billion. So I know cash burn is a frequent topic of discussion lately. We certainly keep our eye on that, but we do have confidence in our liquidity position based on our current cash balance and our ability to get further access if we need it in the markets. We ended the first quarter a little over $5 billion of cash on our balance sheet. And again, remember, we still have that $3.5 billion line of credit that's untapped if we ever should need it. I'd say our cash outflows right now are fairly consistent month-to-month for things like G&A and capital and lease expense costs. In this environment, the big variable is the cash inflows because, as you know, we operate in over 100 countries. We've given some of that -- those rent and royalty deferrals of over $1 billion. And now we're looking at those individual operator organizations that may need something further. 
Having said all that, between the temporary restaurant closures and the deferrals, our cash inflows certainly will be significantly less in the second quarter than normal. So we're likely to have negative free cash flow in the second quarter. But assuming that the countries continue to reopen on the schedules that we're seeing right now, and again most of those are in the European markets, and assuming franchisees then can have the ability to pay their rents and royalties, we would expect that the free cash flow would turn back to positive in the third quarter. So we do think second quarter will be a rougher quarter in terms of cash flow. But right now, based on current plans, we would expect that to turn around back to positive in the third quarter."

So before January and February, you noted that comp was balanced between traffic and ticket in the U.S. I guess if you could just talk a little bit about does that account for leap year? Effectively, you haven't had positive traffic in the U.S. in a while. I'm trying to understand what the drivers might have been. And then after the emergence of the pandemic, you've talked about global delivery sales being up significant. Could you just quantify share of sales or year-over-year growth in delivery? Maybe give some color on digital ordering as well some -- presumably, even some of the drive-thru orders or carryout would have been digital. So just a little bit more context before and after."

The team was very excited about the U.S. results through February. As you know, we were up over 8% for the first 2 months of the year, and a good amount of that was due to traffic. We were really encouraged by the traffic trends that we were seeing entering into the new year, and that excludes the extra benefit that we then got through leap year. So we were in a good traffic position through the first couple of months in the U.S. Leap year further helped that and then we had COVID and kind of the rest from there in terms of what we've been working through.  
I think from a delivery standpoint, the important thing is the vast majority of our business is still drive-thru driven in the U.S. And so while delivery is up significantly, it's not the predominant thing that is driving our business. The predominant channel is really through the drive-thru. Kevin, I don't know if you have anything else you want to add."

Wondering if maybe you can give some sort of a monthly trend as that market, I think you said, is now down mid-teens. So it seems like it's a 5-point-plus improvement but over multiple months. So it seems like maybe it's slower than some had hoped. I was just wondering maybe if you can list out the primary factors.

A lot of it was around operational elements that I described earlier in the call. We've certainly also been watching and learning as China has been able to approach the digital side of the business. I think they are further ahead than most of our markets in terms of how they use digital. So a lot of good -- but as you mentioned, as we've referenced as well, the pace of recovery in China has been slow. We're not seeing a V-shaped recovery in China. The business trends are improving, but they're still running negative to where we were a year ago. I think there's a couple of things that are worth just noting as to reasons for that. The first is we had substantially more restaurants in China that were fully closed and then have to reopen. So that's a larger disruption than if you're able to kind of continue to be open and then just moderating your channels. So that was one issue.
The second is, just a reminder, in China, only 15% of the restaurants have drive-thru. And I would say one of the things that we have seen as a real strength of our business is drive-thru penetration. And so when you have a strong drive-thru penetration, I think your ability for that business, that market to get -- bounce back, that's certainly an added benefit.

I mean I've got to say that every market is in a different situation based on what's happened from government mandates, just the overall orientation of that market. So difficult to generalize. Certainly, I think you can conclude that in restaurants that are open, comp is still down. Comp is down, reflecting just a lower level of economic activity. People are still largely staying at home, even in markets that are able to remain open. So that is adversely affecting, even in restaurants that are open, comp trends. But again, it varies really market by market.  
I think if you then go to your second question, which is about percent of restaurants primarily in Europe, again, I'll focus there that have drive-thru. The majority of our restaurants have drive-thru in Europe. It does vary market by market, but the majority of our restaurants do have drive-thru. So that certainly is something that we expect to be helpful to us as we emerge out of this. And then, Kevin, I'll flip the other questions over to you."

Part of that or a chunk of that really are U.S. Experience of the Future projects. We've substantially reduced those projects for this year. Now to your point, I view that as, as soon as it's reasonably feasible to keep going on those, many of the franchisees will want to continue doing those. We have gotten some requests even already for some franchisees to continue those projects. So I would expect a lot of those would get pushed into 2021. But I think the franchisees, and rightly so, want to understand that the business is back to operating, I'll say, more normally before they go invest substantial dollars and close their restaurants for a period of time also. So that's a piece of it. We're also reducing openings in many of the markets outside the U.S., again, partly because if you think about several of those countries, they've been closed for a period of time now. They're just getting back up and running now, the normal operations. And so the disruption of going and opening new restaurants right now at a maybe quicker pace probably isn't the right thing to do for a lot of the franchisees there. So that pace will slow in 2020. But again, I think that's relatively easy to continue picking up. And we certainly still see opportunities for growth in most of those markets. So it isn't a long-term change in opportunity, but it is a pause in 2020 for a lot of that."

And so part of the work that we're going through is really thinking about our strategy kind of in this post-COVID world. We've got a great foundation to build on with Velocity Growth Plan, but I think it's probably fair to say that we're not just going to pick up the Velocity Growth Plan playbook and kind of resume business as usual. There are going to need to be adjustments to that.

But at the same time, we also have, as I mentioned, we have a few kind of nonrecurring costs. We have the cancellation of our Worldwide Convention that cost us about $40 million. We have some contractual obligations we needed to pay for stopping some R&D work that cost us about $20 million. And then we also have an unusual dynamic where there's a portion of our people costs that are capitalized related to restaurant openings. And as we reduce our restaurant openings, less of those costs will be able to be capitalized. That will likely cost us another $30 million to $35 million of G&A. Now that's not additional cash because we were paying those folks already, but it's the accounting of them where it may end up in G&A instead of where it would have been capitalized on development. So we've got some offsetting things going on in G&A for the year."

But I want to start by acknowledging the human toll of this pandemic. Let me express our deepest sympathies to those inside and outside of McDonald's who have been affected by this virus. In particular, I want to extend heartfelt thanks and gratitude to health care professionals, first responders and other essential workers around the world who have put their own lives at risk to help others.  
The global crisis has impacted people and communities everywhere. In the face of such enormous challenges, I'm immensely proud of the entire McDonald's system and the tireless efforts of our franchisees, crew members, suppliers and company employees. Where we've been able to stay open safely and responsible, they've made it possible for McDonald's to continue offering great-tasting, affordable and convenient food amidst widespread change and disruption.  
Turning now to our performance for the quarter. Our Velocity Growth Plan drove strong results in 2019. That momentum carried into January and February. Since then, the outbreak of coronavirus around the world has created a major business disruption that adversely impacted our performance.  
Beginning in mid-March, we experienced a significant decline in our business due to the pandemic, dragging down our Q1 global comparable sales by 3.4%. We're now operating in a completely different world, and we expect these changes to persist long after the crisis is over.  
In times like these, we take strength from the resilience and experiences we've developed over our 65-year history. While we're not immune to the immediate pressures threatening our global community, we came into the situation better positioned than most, and we believe that we will strengthen our competitive advantages following the crisis.  
Entering the crisis, our system was in great shape. In addition to McDonald's strong balance sheet, franchisee cash flows in most of our major markets were at or near record highs in 2019. Our global restaurant estate had been largely modernized. And we've made significant investments to build new capabilities and delivery in digital that have proven to be critical to our business during the pandemic.  
We now navigate through the crisis. McDonald's unmatched global footprint, scale and deep operational expertise are also proving to be significant strengths for us. Specifically, with a presence in over 100 markets, we've been able to develop insights and best practices as countries move through different phases of the outbreak.  
In China, where the outbreak began, we quickly learned how to adjust our operations to enhance crew and customer safety. We developed new positioning guides and piloted contactless delivery. These solutions, along with many others, were then shared around the globe. As each country develops their own innovations, these are quickly shared by our global restaurant solutions group across all markets. Our system's ability to quickly adapt operations across 40,000 restaurants has been incredible to see.  
The size and scale of our supply chain has also proven to be a significant advantage during this crisis. To date, despite the disruption to our business, we have had no break in supply for any food, packaging materials, toys, equipment, logistics or other solutions globally.  
I want to give particular recognition to our supply chain team for sourcing vital PPE materials such as masks. To give you just some sense of the scale with which we operate, our global supply chain team has sourced over 120 million masks to meet the needs of the McDonald's system. And of course, McDonald's strong drive-thru development has continued to allow us to safely serve millions of customers each day while adhering to social distancing mandates or guidelines. In the U.S., nearly 95% of our locations have drive-thru, and virtually all are open to serve health care professionals, first responders, other essential workers and customers looking for their McDonald's moment. Similarly, Australia and Canada have been able to safely remain open.  
Finally, I should note that our global delivery sales are up significantly versus pre-COVID. Our restaurant footprint and customers' love for our brand make us an essential partner for any third-party operator.  
Once we emerge from this crisis, our expectation is that McDonald's can further extend its leadership in every market where we operate. To do this, it's essential that our franchisees have the financial wherewithal to capitalize on the opportunities we think will be available to our system. For that reason, we've taken several steps to help our franchisees and developmental licensees maintain their liquidity and financial strength. While there will continue to be difficult decisions along the way, we are providing timely, targeted and temporary financial support, which Kevin will walk through in a few minutes.  
From a customer perspective, we're encouraged by some of our early learnings that lead us to believe customers will be seeking known brands and familiar routines. We're also seeking -- seeing a heightened focus on value and convenience. In China, this was reflected in the response to our recent Big Mac promotion, showed that after a prolonged disruption to their daily lives, customers are craving comfort in our iconic core menu items. We've also seen this where we've been able to safely remain open in cities like Tokyo, Berlin and Chicago and in Northern France, where we slowly began reopening restaurants last week.  
As I mentioned earlier, our reopening efforts in our European markets will be phased and grounded in what's best for the safety of our customers and crew. Similar to what we did in U.S. and Canada, we'll be serving a limited menu in many markets, focused primarily on our core items when we reopen in countries around the world. Through this, we will focus on what McDonald's has done so well for decades, serving great-tasting food fast.  
This is a challenging and unpredictable time. Looking at comparable sales, we expect the second quarter as a whole to be significantly worse than what we experienced for the full month of March. Kevin will talk about what we've seen in the month of April.  
As things stand, we believe we reached the trough in terms of number of restaurants closed in late March. We are planning for limited reopenings in markets in the near future. The exact trajectory of our recovery, however, is highly uncertain and dependent on many factors outside our control such as government mandates, the risk of a second wave of infection to the availability of testing and the overall economic backdrop. We're developing contingency plans for a wide variety of scenarios.  
From our experience in China as well as from our experience closing and opening 10,000 restaurants as part of our EOTF remodel program in the U.S., we do know that customers will not immediately revert back to their pre-shutdown routines. For example, we know that breakfast will be the most challenged daypart. We know that a focus on core menu will be critical due to both customer interest in familiar favorites and operational ease. We know that value will be a necessary element to reengage our customers. Each market is rebuilding their marketing calendar to reflect these learnings and many others so we can reignite our business momentum.  
But our first priority has been and will continue to be safeguarding the health and safety of our people and customers. The trust the McDonald's brand has developed over the last 65 years is our most precious asset, and we will never put that at risk. We remain closely aligned with the expert judgment of scientific and government leaders in our various markets, and we support the focus on widespread testing as a central element to broader recovery efforts.  
Whatever the cadence of reopening markets, we know we can adapt. McDonald's is a remarkable system, and I'm confident that the strengths we've exhibited both before and during the crisis will be even more apparent as we emerge into a new post-coronavirus world.  
I'll now turn it over to Kevin to talk about our first quarter results."
139488,662236749,2020026,"McDonald's Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",2020-04-30,"Earnings Calls","McDonald's Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Chris. We began 2020 with strong top line momentum. Global comp sales were up 7.2% through February, reflecting strong performance in most countries around the world and the benefit of leap year. Beginning in mid-March, consumer traffic began to d",1715,"Thanks, Chris. We began 2020 with strong top line momentum. Global comp sales were up 7.2% through February, reflecting strong performance in most countries around the world and the benefit of leap year. Beginning in mid-March, consumer traffic began to decline significantly due to the impact of COVID-19 as we temporarily closed some restaurants and shifted to limited operations and others when many parts of the world experienced government restrictions and shelter-in-place guidelines. As a result, global comp sales were down 22% in the month of March and down 3.4% in the first quarter.  
Today, I'll walk through March and April trends to provide perspective on how comp sales have progressed over the past few months.  
International Operated Market comp sales were down 35% for the month of March. In the second half of March, comp sales were down roughly 70% as several markets like France, Italy, Spain and the U.K. temporarily closed all restaurants, and other markets like Australia, Canada and Germany had drive-thru, delivery and takeaway only or limited hours and menus. Comp sales have continued to be down about 70% through April in this segment, as many of the fully closed markets are now just beginning to reopen.  
Turning to the U.S. Comp sales were negative 13% for the month of March. Beginning in mid-March and continuing through mid-April, U.S. comp sales were consistently down about 25%. However, we have begun to see some improvement in the last couple of weeks. We expect April comp sales to be down about 20%.  
Also, over the last several weeks, the U.S. has experienced a significant increase in average check across all channels. This is due to an increase in party size as well as evolving consumer behavior, with daily routines interrupted and fewer transactions at the breakfast daypart.  
Not surprisingly, the U.S. has also seen sales impacted on weekends more than weekdays, as consumers leave their houses only when necessary. And we've seen a shift in sales mix by order channel, as nearly all restaurants are operating drive-thru, delivery and takeaway only.  
Prior to the impact of COVID-19, the drive-thru accounted for about 2/3 of all sales in the U.S. As consumers shifted from in-person ordering to drive-thru and delivery channels, drive-thru now accounts for nearly 90% of sales in the U.S.  
We're also seeing an uptick in delivery and digital transactions per restaurant. And all of these trends are similar to what we've seen in China and other markets.  
Comp sales in the International Developmental Licensed segment were down 19% for the month of March. Similar to the other segments, in the second half of March, comp sales were down even more significantly, reflecting the impact of COVID-19 as it's spread throughout the segment.  
In China, approximately 25% of restaurants were closed in early February. By the end of March, substantially all restaurants had reopened. However, the market continues to experience a reduced level of demand as consumers have not fully returned to their pre-COVID routines, resulting in negative comp sales since the initial outbreak in late January.  
Comp sales were down over 20% in the first quarter, and trends have improved in April to negative mid-teens.  
In terms of new unit development, China opened over 100 restaurants in the quarter. We remain confident in new restaurant growth opportunities in China. However, we expect time lines to be delayed due to the crisis.  
I want to transition to some areas that are most relevant to understanding the impact of COVID-19 on our results, including flow-through considerations on the P&L, corporate liquidity and franchisee financial health.  
Starting with the P&L. As we've become a more heavily franchised business over the last several years, our operating model is designed to tap into the entrepreneurial spirit of our local business owners and for efficient conversion of top line growth to the bottom line. In other words, as comp sales grow, the fixed nature of our franchise cost structure results in strong flow-through to the bottom line. Conversely, in the current environment of declining sales, we see less flow-through to franchise margin dollars.  
Our company-operated restaurant expenses are more variable in areas such as food and paper and labor costs. So the flow-through to margin dollars is a bit better in our company-operated restaurants in the current environment.  
For perspective, in March with a comp sales of negative 22%, our total restaurant margin dollars declined $350 million, with about 75% of the decline driven by franchise margin dollars. Most of the decline was in the IOM segment due to the significant number of temporary restaurant closures.  
Turning to G&A. We saw an increase of about $95 million in constant currencies or 19% versus first quarter last year. About 2/3 of the increase relates to nonrecurring costs, including $40 million for the cancellation of our biennial worldwide convention and roughly $20 million related to payments of contractual obligations as we reduce the scope and ongoing spend in R&D work of certain restaurant technology. The remaining increase relates to the run costs associated with our acquisitions of Dynamic Yield and Apprente as well as continued depreciation and amortization costs related to technology. As a reminder, both of these acquisitions occurred subsequent to first quarter 2019, so we're not lapping those acquisitions yet.  
Our investment in digital customer engagement remains a priority for our business. And as I mentioned before, we've already seen the benefits of Dynamic Yield in our operating results. These digital investments enable us to give customers more choice and flexibility in how they order, pay and receive their food during this unprecedented time and will remain important in serving customers as we think about our business beyond this crisis.  
As we navigate through uncharted waters, we're taking a disciplined approach to decision making. This includes reviewing all investments and reducing or delaying spending as we rescope priorities in some areas and redirect dollars to other priorities. We're focusing resources on projects and initiatives that can reasonably be implemented and executed in the near term, both in terms of cost and time and will also benefit the system for the long term.  
As we make these assessments, we'll also prioritize our resources against the most critical needs of the business. Due to COVID-19, we expect a few lines of the other operating section of the P&L to be impacted in 2020 as well. Gains on restaurant sales are expected to be down about $100 million as a result of minimal restaurant sale activity for the rest of the year. Our equity and earnings of affiliates is expected to be down substantially, and we expect to have some additional reserves for bad debts related to rent and royalty deferrals subsequent to March.  
The result of all of this is that we expect our operating cash flow to be down significantly this year. We entered the crisis with a strong balance sheet, and we've taken a number of actions to preserve financial flexibility. In addition to currently reviewing our G&A costs, we suspended our share repurchase program in early March. We secured $6.5 billion of new financing in March, including $5.5 billion of debt issuances at various maturities and a new $1 billion line of credit that we drew upon immediately.  
In terms of capital expenditures, we've taken a very practical approach to development activity. We suspended Experience of the Future groundbreaks in the U.S. and new restaurant openings around the world as COVID-19 began to spread. Given that our first quarter CapEx is typically about 20% of the full year and many projects are delayed or on hold, we now have some flexibility with decisions for the majority of our planned capital spend for the year. As a result, we're reducing our 2020 spending by about $1 billion from our initial expectation of $2.4 billion.  
I also want to acknowledge our dividend. We paid our first quarter dividend at the beginning of March, prior to the widespread impact of COVID. McDonald's remains financially strong, and our capital allocation priorities remain investing in the business for growth and prioritizing dividends to our shareholders. We will continue to manage and utilize our funds in a judicious manner that focuses on ensuring the company is able to grow the business and our franchisees remain financially strong.  
As I mentioned earlier, we've taken a number of actions to ensure that the company is in a sound financial position and to put our franchisees and developmental licensee partners around the world in a position to be successful in running their businesses. As COVID spread quickly around the world, our first step was determining operating procedures, resulting in temporary closures of all restaurants in some countries and limited operations in others, as I've mentioned. That was quickly followed by providing broad-based financial liquidity assistance in the form of rent and royalty deferrals that were generally applicable to all franchisees within various markets because we needed to make quick decisions to alleviate franchisee concerns and put them in the best position to maintain their businesses. Generally, we've deferred the collection of rent and royalties earned in March and April in most markets around the world. Cash is collected on a 1-month lag, so the cash impact of these deferrals occurs in April and May. This deferral amounts to roughly $1 billion of liquidity assistance that we committed to our franchisees and developmental licensee partners across the system. We also work closely with lenders, suppliers and distributors to extend payment terms to franchisees where necessary.  
Now we're assessing the financial health and liquidity of specific at-risk franchisee and developmental licensee organizations. This assessment includes various sales projection scenarios and takes into account the impact of liquidity assistance measures provided by the company, suppliers, lenders and governments. We've developed an objective framework for making decisions regarding which specific franchisee and DL organizations may need further liquidity assistance and how we may support them. This will help ensure a consistent and equitable approach to decision-making across all of our markets. As Chris mentioned, our general philosophy is for any assistance to be timely, targeted and temporary. The financial health and strength of our franchisees has been a competitive advantage for McDonald's for years, and we expect that to continue post COVID-19.  
Now I'll turn it back to Chris."

While there's much we don't know about the future course of this pandemic, we are taking the necessary actions to ensure we will emerge from this crisis in a position of strength. Looking ahead, we know these unprecedented times will bring about some fundamental changes to the way businesses, including ours, operate. What will remain constant is our commitment to maintaining the strong level of trust our customers have in the business.  
We're also beginning to think about our strategy in the aftermath of COVID-19. While elements of Velocity Growth Plan will continue to be important, we're making adjustments in real time and there will likely need to be further changes. We'll look to provide updates on our overall progress later in the year.  
In these challenging times, I'm immensely proud of the way our system has banded together to stay true to our purpose to feed and foster community. The countless inspiring examples of this around the world showcase the real impact McDonald's has in the communities in which we operate. I'm proud to share a handful of these stories.  
In the U.S., our restaurants are offering our appreciation with free Thank You Meal boxes to first responders and health care workers to thank them for their tireless efforts to protect us all. These include favorite breakfast and lunch menu items packaged in and Happy Meal boxes with a thank you note in place of a toy. We're in the middle of this 2-week show of appreciation, and we've already provided nearly 4 million Thank You Meals.  
Across Europe, many markets are providing free drinks, coffee and meals to first responders and health care workers on the front lines. In Madrid, a restaurant just reopened solely to serve frontline workers at the nearby hospital.  
In Australia, we've added staples of milk, eggs and bread to our menus, enabling customers to use McDonald's contactless drive-thru and takeaway to shop for basics, providing a safe and easy way for customers to shop.  
And in many of the communities around the world that we call home, extra food within the supply chain is being redistributed through nonprofit organizations and local food banks to feed communities in need.  
We've also donated nearly 1.5 million masks to COVID relief efforts.  
As I said earlier, we entered this crisis with a solid foundation. While we face significant disruptions and challenges, we remain confident in our ability to adapt, as we've done throughout our 65 years to secure our long-term success. And now we'll begin Q&A."

But I would also imagine that those would be more vulnerable to COVID-type formats, like higher walk-in mix, and there might be other economic and structural factors that might linger. So can you give us a sense about how things look in those markets as you get back to reopening? Do you see the snapback as strong as it's been in the U.S.? And then perhaps you can dig into that comment about the support you're offering to franchisees, especially in those hardest hit markets."

In the international, particularly in our IOM markets in Europe, we have a number of countries that are completely closed based on government mandates. We are just beginning the process of reopening on a limited basis in a number of those markets. And so it's probably a little premature for us to give you any indication of what the overall trajectory is going to be. But I would say we've been really encouraged when we do start to open limited restaurants by the demand. You may have seen in the last week, as we've opened up in a few of these markets, we had a 3-hour wait at one of our restaurants in France. For people to get through the drive-thru in Austria, we had a 2-mile line of people looking to get into the drive-thru. And I think our overall view is, as markets start to open up, this desire to really return to familiar favorites, to brands that are known is very, very powerful. And I think the fact that we also have a strong orientation toward convenience and value, that I think are also 2 key elements. We are optimistic. We certainly are expecting that we're going to be able to take share in those markets. And so I think, we, like everybody else, are closely watching what the overall level of customer demand is going to be. We do feel like we're well positioned on that, but probably too soon to say.  
In terms of financial support that we're providing to franchisees, let me pass it over to Kevin to address."

David, related to the franchisee assistance, I'd say it's similar to what we've done in the U.S. As I talked about in my remarks, at the beginning, what we really did was kind of this broad-based assistance that was deferring a couple of months of rent and royalties, generally, for most franchisees around the world. The other thing that's happened is essentially, we've converted our rent to variable rent based on sales. So the restaurants that have been closed effectively aren't paying rent because they don't have sales. The only other thing I would point out is, there's various different forms of government assistance in each country. So certain countries provide more assistance related to kind of workers who aren't working temporarily, which means that in some of the markets, they've been able to effectively help the franchisees in terms of being able to keep their workers, but not if the -- that payment doesn't come out of the franchisees' pockets while the restaurants are closed. And then in several markets, we've actually been working with other companies to actually even find places where employees have been able to work. So in a couple of them, we've partnered up with companies like ALDI and others to provide temporary employment for our workers while our restaurants are closed. So I wouldn't say that our assistance is substantially different on the international side. Again, we started at the broad base, and now we're looking at individual organizations to see where we may need to step in, both internationally and in the U.S."

Has there been part of the strategy that you'd be leaned more into around digital value or resumed advertising? Or would you call out that maybe the improvement that you're seeing thus far is a result of stimulus checks and consumers growing more comfortable venturing outside the home as a contributor?"

So maybe let me take it in 2 different pieces there. I think in terms of the best practices, we have learned a lot around how we adjust operations to really make sure that we're providing a safe environment for our crew and for our customers. In almost every market where we operate, the U.S. included, there are dedicated teams that are meeting daily and reviewing procedures and connected to our global restaurant solutions group to understand these best practices. In the case of the U.S., they've made 50 different changes to operating procedures as we've learned more. And it's everything from positioning guides to protective barriers to other things like masks, how often, how frequently we are sanitizing surfaces, just a variety of different things. So that has been really helpful for us in terms of just making sure that our restaurant continue to be a safe environment for both customers as well as for our crew. I think that certainly does help with the demand that we're seeing. I think as people get confident about our ability to continue to offer food in a safe way, that certainly helps, but there is a benefit that I think you could attribute to the stimulus checks. I think there's probably also, as customers are starting to venture out a little bit more, this desire to really go to familiar brands. You saw it in -- in the -- away from -- or in the at-home occasion, center of the store, familiar brands in grocery really benefited as people were staying home. I think that same dynamic is going to be at play as people start to come out looking for familiar brands. So I think there's a variety of different things that play there in the U.S., but certainly, we've been more encouraged by what we've seen in the last couple of weeks in the U.S."

And it also seems like a lot of operators have increased debt loads quite significantly to cover the remodels and tech upgrades.

And that was the broad-based deferrals that Kevin referenced. Now as we've had more time, we've essentially been able to go through and do stress test, if you will, for every single franchisee organization and have developed a sense of what we think their liquidity needs are under a variety of different scenarios in terms of how this business recovers. I think the important point that Kevin talked about in terms of the principles of timely, targeted and temporary is, we will provide the support when it's apparent that what the scenario is that we're dealing with. So that's the timely element which is, who knows how any of this progresses. But we certainly have a sense of, depending on which trajectory we go, who's going to be at risk.

So we are cognizant of that and certainly are having the appropriate discussions with those franchisees. And to Chris' point, I think now we're at the point where we are looking at organization by organization and seeing where we may need to step in and provide further assistance or make sure that they're getting all the assistance they need from lenders, suppliers, et cetera.  
Related to kind of the loans, I guess, I would just remind everyone, our operators are small independent business owners who are eligible for the loans. They're working with their advisers to determine kind of the needs for their business. Our understanding is that most have been able to get approved and -- which would enable them to keep paying their crew and continue running their businesses. And then we'll certainly continue to work it with them to make sure that they've got the liquidity to keep running their businesses.

This is not a large majority of operators or a large piece of the operators. It's generally maybe a few operators in each market that we're working with. So it isn't a widespread issue that we're dealing with.  
Related to cash flow, and let me try and put that in some context, and I'll go back and just -- I may repeat some of the things I had mentioned in my remarks, but remember, we entered the crisis certainly from a position of financial strength. From a corporate standpoint, we're obviously -- we have a strong investment-grade credit rating, that's always been important to us, so we've been maintaining that. And I talked about our franchisees also entered into the year pretty strong financially. As we got into this year and the impact of COVID was growing, you would have seen that we acted pretty quickly to bolster our cash position, certainly in anticipation of the changing macroeconomic and business conditions around the world. We secured $6.5 billion of new financing in March, which was about 5.5 -- well, which was $5.5 billion of bonds and $1 billion of line of credit. And then we also still have full access to a committed line of credit of $3.5 billion. So I know cash burn is a frequent topic of discussion lately. We certainly keep our eye on that, but we do have confidence in our liquidity position based on our current cash balance and our ability to get further access if we need it in the markets. We ended the first quarter a little over $5 billion of cash on our balance sheet. And again, remember, we still have that $3.5 billion line of credit that's untapped if we ever should need it. I'd say our cash outflows right now are fairly consistent month-to-month for things like G&A and capital and lease expense costs. In this environment, the big variable is the cash inflows because, as you know, we operate in over 100 countries. We've given some of that -- those rent and royalty deferrals of over $1 billion. And now we're looking at those individual operator organizations that may need something further. 
Having said all that, between the temporary restaurant closures and the deferrals, our cash inflows certainly will be significantly less in the second quarter than normal. So we're likely to have negative free cash flow in the second quarter. But assuming that the countries continue to reopen on the schedules that we're seeing right now, and again most of those are in the European markets, and assuming franchisees then can have the ability to pay their rents and royalties, we would expect that the free cash flow would turn back to positive in the third quarter. So we do think second quarter will be a rougher quarter in terms of cash flow. But right now, based on current plans, we would expect that to turn around back to positive in the third quarter."

Effectively, you haven't had positive traffic in the U.S. in a while. I'm trying to understand what the drivers might have been. And then after the emergence of the pandemic, you've talked about global delivery sales being up significant. Could you just quantify share of sales or year-over-year growth in delivery? Maybe give some color on digital ordering as well some -- presumably, even some of the drive-thru orders or carryout would have been digital. So just a little bit more context before and after."

We were really encouraged by the traffic trends that we were seeing entering into the new year, and that excludes the extra benefit that we then got through leap year. So we were in a good traffic position through the first couple of months in the U.S. Leap year further helped that and then we had COVID and kind of the rest from there in terms of what we've been working through.  
I think from a delivery standpoint, the important thing is the vast majority of our business is still drive-thru driven in the U.S. And so while delivery is up significantly, it's not the predominant thing that is driving our business.

I think they are further ahead than most of our markets in terms of how they use digital. So a lot of good -- but as you mentioned, as we've referenced as well, the pace of recovery in China has been slow. We're not seeing a V-shaped recovery in China. The business trends are improving, but they're still running negative to where we were a year ago. I think there's a couple of things that are worth just noting as to reasons for that. The first is we had substantially more restaurants in China that were fully closed and then have to reopen. So that's a larger disruption than if you're able to kind of continue to be open and then just moderating your channels. So that was one issue.
The second is, just a reminder, in China, only 15% of the restaurants have drive-thru. And I would say one of the things that we have seen as a real strength of our business is drive-thru penetration. And so when you have a strong drive-thru penetration, I think your ability for that business, that market to get -- bounce back, that's certainly an added benefit.

Certainly, I think you can conclude that in restaurants that are open, comp is still down. Comp is down, reflecting just a lower level of economic activity. People are still largely staying at home, even in markets that are able to remain open. So that is adversely affecting, even in restaurants that are open, comp trends. But again, it varies really market by market.  
I think if you then go to your second question, which is about percent of restaurants primarily in Europe, again, I'll focus there that have drive-thru.

Part of that or a chunk of that really are U.S. Experience of the Future projects. We've substantially reduced those projects for this year. Now to your point, I view that as, as soon as it's reasonably feasible to keep going on those, many of the franchisees will want to continue doing those. We have gotten some requests even already for some franchisees to continue those projects. So I would expect a lot of those would get pushed into 2021. But I think the franchisees, and rightly so, want to understand that the business is back to operating, I'll say, more normally before they go invest substantial dollars and close their restaurants for a period of time also. So that's a piece of it. We're also reducing openings in many of the markets outside the U.S., again, partly because if you think about several of those countries, they've been closed for a period of time now. They're just getting back up and running now, the normal operations. And so the disruption of going and opening new restaurants right now at a maybe quicker pace probably isn't the right thing to do for a lot of the franchisees there. So that pace will slow in 2020. But again, I think that's relatively easy to continue picking up. And we certainly still see opportunities for growth in most of those markets. So it isn't a long-term change in opportunity, but it is a pause in 2020 for a lot of that."

And so part of the work that we're going through is really thinking about our strategy kind of in this post-COVID world. We've got a great foundation to build on with Velocity Growth Plan, but I think it's probably fair to say that we're not just going to pick up the Velocity Growth Plan playbook and kind of resume business as usual. There are going to need to be adjustments to that. And so my team and I are planning on doing that work over the next several months as we start to formulate our point of view and determine what continues, what changes.

We have some contractual obligations we needed to pay for stopping some R&D work that cost us about $20 million. And then we also have an unusual dynamic where there's a portion of our people costs that are capitalized related to restaurant openings. And as we reduce our restaurant openings, less of those costs will be able to be capitalized. That will likely cost us another $30 million to $35 million of G&A. Now that's not additional cash because we were paying those folks already, but it's the accounting of them where it may end up in G&A instead of where it would have been capitalized on development.

As I reflect back to our first quarter earnings call, a short 90 days ago, I talked about uncertainty in the world amidst the COVID pandemic and our methodical approach to reopening, grounded in what's best for the safety of o",1395,"Thank you, and good morning. As I reflect back to our first quarter earnings call, a short 90 days ago, I talked about uncertainty in the world amidst the COVID pandemic and our methodical approach to reopening, grounded in what's best for the safety of our customers and crew. 
During the second quarter, the dedication of the McDonald's System was on display as we worked together to safely reopen nearly all of McDonald's restaurants that had temporarily closed in late March, leading to continued improvement in our sales results. As of today, nearly all our restaurants globally are open for business. Almost all markets are operating with drive-thru and delivery, and many markets have also begun to reopen dining rooms. I want to say a huge thank you to franchisees crew members, suppliers and company employees. Without their continued hard work and dedication, this would not have been possible. 
We have said that since the start of the pandemic that we entered from a position of strength. Over the last several years, our Velocity Growth Plan drove broad-based strength in markets around the world. More importantly, however, we believe McDonald's possesses several unique advantages that ensure our success is built to last. These advantages have been evident throughout the crisis. 
First is our iconic brand. McDonald's is one of the world's leading brands and the trust customers have in McDonald's has proven to be a significant advantage during these uncertain times. Customers have been seeking known and familiar brands they can count on. And for our customers, while safety is a top concern, the need for value and convenience is also on the rise, playing to McDonald's historic strengths. 
Second, McDonald's is an execution machine. We know how to run great restaurants and that operating prowess has been put to the ultimate test during the pandemic. Within a matter of weeks, the McDonald's system made operational modifications across 30,000 restaurants, while closing and then reopening another 9,000 restaurants. We introduced new safety procedures in all our restaurants, modified our menus and developed new contactless ways to serve our customers. 
Amidst all these changes, customer satisfaction actually improved across almost every major market, and the U.S. has hit new all-time highs for customer satisfaction. Drive-thru times have also improved across most major markets, averaging 15 to 20 seconds of improvement. 
And speaking of drive-thrus, our unmatched drive-thru penetration has allowed us to continue serving more customers in more markets than anyone else. Across our big 5 IOM markets, Australia, Canada, France, Germany and the U.K., about 70% of our restaurants offer drive-thru, and this safe and convenient service channel has been particularly appealing to our customers during the pandemic. We've seen significant increases in drive-thru sales in these markets during COVID. 
Finally, the strength of our System, our franchisees, employees and suppliers has been and always will be our secret sauce. Our 3-legged stool is committed to feeding and fostering the nearly 40,000 communities where we operate, and the pandemic has demonstrated our System's unwavering commitment. There have been countless examples of our System going above and beyond to be there for those communities who needed us most, from health care workers to truck drivers to people working 3 shifts to make masks and respirators, we stayed open, so they could keep going. 
Every franchisee comes from and is rooted in the local community. They take responsibility for building the local community, which is why our brand is strongest at the local level. Thanks to market and franchisee leadership, we are able to identify opportunities to be good neighbors in ways that are the most meaningful to customers, and this has been especially important in the last few months. 
Our suppliers ensured that we had no breaks in supply for food, packaging, material, toys, equipment or other strategic categories globally. This is an incredible feat, given some of the significant challenges experienced in the past few months and a testament to our strong supply chain teams, both globally and locally, and the partnership that they have with our suppliers. 
At the same time, in just a matter of weeks, our teams built a global supply chain for PPE virtually from scratch. 
Turning to our Q2 operating results. I'll provide a few headlines and observations, and then Kevin will provide more details, including key financials. 
In the U.S., virtually all restaurants remained open, and we saw results improved sequentially through the quarter. To ensure we kept our crew and customers safe while remaining open, we've changed nearly 50 operating procedures in accordance with guidance from state and local health experts. 
In Q2, we also ran a highly successful thank you meal program to recognize the extraordinary dedication and selflessness of first responders. 
In our International Operated Markets segment, when we last spoke, about 45% of our restaurants were open in some manner. Several of our largest markets, including the U.K., Spain, France and Italy, were completely closed for prolonged periods during the quarter. With a methodical approach, however, our teams have reopened restaurants across this segment and nearly all restaurants are now open to serve customers. We've seen strong pent-up customer demand, which is driving encouraging sequential sales improvement. 
Finally, our international developmental licensed segment experienced several challenges throughout the quarter. Our Latin America business was severely pressured due to the high incidence of coronavirus in several countries and has less developed drive-thru penetration. 
In China, after early signs suggesting a solid recovery, our pace of improvement has slowed as customers remain wary of social activities, and we now expect this more subdued pattern to continue into 2021. 
Worth noting that Japan had positive comp sales for the quarter, partly thanks to our brand's reputation for cleanliness and convenience with Japanese customers. 
As you can see, it remains a dynamic situation as the threat of COVID-19 continues to depress consumer sentiment and the vagaries of the pandemic create an unpredictable operating environment. In many markets around the world, most notably in the U.S., the public health situation appears to be worsening. Nonetheless, I believe that Q2 represents the trough in our performance as McDonald's has learned to adjust our operations to this new environment. 
Regardless of the overall level of industry growth, I believe our markets and franchisees are well positioned to grow market share going forward. Three factors give me confidence. 
First, the financial health of our System is strong. As you know, we moved quickly to defer rent and royalties for franchisees, injecting nearly $1 billion of liquidity into our System at the outset of the pandemic. When necessary, we're providing timely, targeted and temporary assistance to franchisees needing additional support. Government programs such as the PPP program in the U.S. and the [indiscernible] program in the U.K. also provided strong financial relief to our franchisees. And the menu and operational modifications we introduced have further supported franchisee P&L. Collectively, these actions have significantly reduced the adverse cash flow impact of COVID-19 on the average McDonald's restaurant. 
Second, we have amassed a sizable marketing war chest to invest in the back half of 2020. During Q2, most major markets significantly reduced their marketing spend and value activities. As an example, in the U.S., marketing spend was down 70% as we chose to conserve our resources until the situation stabilized. These funds will now be reinvested in Q3 and Q4. 
Additionally, as we previously announced, McDonald's will also invest an incremental $200 million in marketing spend across our U.S. and International Operated Markets in the second half to accelerate recovery, roughly equivalent to 1 additional month of media in every owned market. 
Together, these actions will result in a sizable increase in our marketing spend for the balance of the year. 
And third, our laser-like focus on what we call the 3 Ds, drive-thru, delivery and digital. Thanks to our strategic foresight, McDonald's is well-developed in each of these channels, and we see opportunities to extend our 3D advantage. You'll hear more about the 3 Ds and our strategic plans later in the year. 
Again, I want to thank our System for the extraordinary dedication and resilience they demonstrated in Q2. And to our customers, I want to thank you for your trust in McDonald's. We're ready to serve. 
I'll now turn it over to Kevin to talk in more detail about our second quarter results."
139488,673882582,2047672,"McDonald's Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2020",2020-07-28,"Earnings Calls","McDonald's Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Chris. I'll start by walking through our comp performance for the quarter and an early read on July, move on to some items on the P&L and then end with an update on our financial position.

I'll start by walking through our comp performance for the quarter and an early read on July, move on to some items on the P&L and then end with an update on our financial position. 
While this quarter was not without its challenges, we're encouraged by our global comp sales improvement throughout the quarter and into July. Comps improved sequentially throughout Q2 as markets reopened and restrictions were eased. 
Global comp sales were down 24% for the quarter and improved as we progressed through the quarter, with the month of June down 12%. 
We entered the quarter with about 75% of our restaurants open. And as Chris noted, today, nearly all have reopened to serve customers. 
While in June, we recovered nearly 90% of our 2019 sales, performance across the markets is varied and uneven, depending on external factors, such as government restrictions and consumer sentiment given concerns of resurgence. For as long as the virus is present, this is the likely operating environment, especially as we also consider government assistance to consumers rolling off in many markets and general economic uncertainty, and we believe we're well positioned to navigate through it all. 
That said, some consistent themes have emerged. Comp sales continue to be heavily reliant on check growth from larger orders with guest counts negative. The number of drive-thrus impacts the market's pace of recovery. As Chris mentioned, our drive-thrus overall have proven to be a competitive advantage for us and markets with a higher percentage of drive-thrus are showing quicker recovery. 
Markets with a higher concentration of city center and mall restaurants are seeing heavier impact from reduced foot traffic. 
And travel- or tourist-dependent locations are slower to recover as mobility remains suppressed. 
In looking at performance across the segments, the International Operated Markets segment experienced a sharp decline, with more than half of the restaurants temporarily closed early in the quarter. Comp sales were down 41% for the quarter, improving to down 18% for the month of June, as key markets like France began reopening in May and the U.K. began reopening in June. 
Australia delivered positive comp sales for both May and June, bolstered by strong drive-thru and delivery performance. Australia has doubled its delivery sales mix to nearly 10% of sales, a trend we're seeing across several of our international markets. 
While we've seen a significant uptick in drive-thru as a percentage of total sales throughout the segment, a crucial step in our recovery is the reopening of dining rooms. Pre-Covid, nearly 70% of customer orders were in-restaurant across our larger markets. So closing the dining area or even limiting dine-in capacity has a substantial impact on results. 
Today, almost all restaurants and about 2/3 of the dining rooms have reopened in the segment, although many restaurants are still operating with restrictions, such as limited hours or channels based on local regulations. 
In July, comp sales in the IOM segment have continued to improve, although they remain negative in the high single digits. 
Turning to the U.S. Comp sales for the quarter were down 8.7% and improved as we progressed through the quarter, with June down 2.3%. Breakfast continues to be disproportionately impacted by disruptions to commuting routines. And while weekend recovery is still lagging weekday recovery, the gap is narrowing. 
Throughout the pandemic, we benefited greatly from nearly all of our restaurants remaining open to serve customers, particularly with drive-thrus in nearly 95% of our locations. As customers shifted to a more contactless experience, drive-thru accounted for nearly 90% of our sales again this quarter. 
We also continue to see an uptick in delivery and digital transactions per restaurant. 
Mid-quarter, we began to reopen dining rooms in the U.S. with reduced seating capacity for customers who want to enjoy their food on-premise. In early July, we paused as we've seen resurgences across the country. And today, we have about 2,000 dining rooms open. 
Together with our franchisees, we're taking a thoughtful and responsible approach to determine the right time to reopen the remaining dining rooms. 
The U.S. has continued to see improving comp sales through July, with comps turning slightly positive during the month. 
Comp sales in the international developmental licensed segment were down 24% for the quarter, with the months of May and June, both down about 20%. As Chris mentioned, Latin America was the hardest hit geography across the segment, while Japan delivered positive comp sales for the quarter. And in China, recovery has been somewhat uneven as consumers remain cautious on resuming pre-Covid routines, especially in light of resurgence concerns. Increased competitive activity and the fact that schools have been closed also are impacting the pace of recovery. 
In terms of new unit development, China has opened about 150 restaurants through June. We remain confident in new restaurant growth opportunities in China, with a plan to open about 400 new restaurants this year. 
While we expect recovery to continue to be somewhat gradual and uneven for many markets around the globe in the near term, we're proud of our teams and the way we've responded to the pandemic. 
Moving to the P&L. As we become a more heavily franchised business over the last several years, our operating model is designed to tap into the entrepreneurial spirit of our local business owners and efficiently convert top line growth to the bottom line. Despite the challenging environment, McDonald's restaurants generated over $19 billion in systemwide sales for the quarter. Franchise margins represented about 90% of overall margin dollars and were a key component of operating income. 
There are a couple of P&L lines specifically impacted by COVID-19-related items. First, G&A increased $114 million or 22% in constant currencies for the quarter. As Chris mentioned, the company is making an incremental marketing contribution to the U.S. and IOM markets. The amount related to that contribution included in G&A for Q2 was about $160 million, which more than offset lower travel costs and lower incentive compensation accruals. 
Turning to the other operating income and expense section. Gains on restaurant sales for the full year are still expected to be down significantly versus last year as we anticipate a minimal amount of restaurant sale activity for the remainder of the year. Our equity and earnings of affiliates for the full year is projected to be down substantially. 
We recorded an additional $45 million for reserves for bad debt related to rent and royalty deferrals for Q2. 
And finally, in further supporting our franchisees, we made onetime payments of about $30 million to distribution centers for obsolete inventory. This was a result of the abrupt reduction in consumer demand and product mix shifts early in the pandemic. 
As I've mentioned before, the financial health of our System was an underlying strength of our business coming into the pandemic, and we've taken actions to preserve financial flexibility. As a reminder, we suspended our share repurchase program in early March. We also bolstered our financial position by securing $6.5 billion of new financing back in Q1. This enabled us to invest in the System in several ways. We provided nearly $1 billion of broad-based financial liquidity assistance to our franchisees, primarily in the form of rent and royalty deferrals. As a result, free cash flow was negative in the second quarter and positive for the first half of the year. Based on our current operating performance and our anticipated collection of a majority of the deferrals in Q3 and Q4, we still expect free cash flow to be positive for the remainder of the year. 
Further building on the broad-based liquidity support, we're also assessing the financial health of specific at-risk franchisee and developmental licensee organizations. We're using an objective framework for decision-making, and we expect that only a small percent of organizations will require further assistance. The financial health and strength of our franchisees has been a competitive advantage for McDonald's for years, and we expect that to continue. 
Finally, as we've mentioned, we invested in incremental marketing across the U.S. and IOM markets to further accelerate recovery and drive growth. 
In terms of capital expenditures, we took a very practical approach to development activity during the onset of the pandemic by pausing most project work. As many franchisees are willing and able to invest and some work has resumed, our expected capital spend for 2020 is now about $1.6 billion versus the original $2.4 billion. About half of the $1.6 billion will be dedicated to the U.S. business, including completing roughly 900 EOTF projects. 
Additionally, we now plan to open about 950 gross and 350 net new restaurants this year. 
The U.S. is accelerating some restaurant closings previously planned for future years. Of the 200 U.S. closures for this year, over half are low-volume restaurants in Walmart store locations. 
Consistent with enhancing financial flexibility and our franchising strategy, we're planning to divest a portion of our stake in McDonald's Japan. As a result of the strong performance of the McDonald's Japan business over the past few years and our confidence in the local management team, we believe it's the right time to gradually reduce our ownership stake in the market. This will take some time because of the low trading volume of McDonald's Japan shares. As a reminder, we currently own about 49% of the business, and we will retain at least 35% ownership. This decision provides us with additional financial flexibility to execute our capital allocation strategy while also demonstrating our commitment to our Japanese business. 
Regarding uses of cash, our top priorities remain the same: First, investing in the business for growth; and second, prioritizing dividends to our shareholders. After that, we'll look to reduce debt in the near term to lower our elevated leverage ratios. We will continue to manage and utilize our funds in a judicious manner that focuses on ensuring the company is able to grow the business, our franchisees remain financially strong and our shareholders are duly rewarded. 
Now I'll turn it back to Chris."

And on the breakfast point, certainly, as we've talked about on prior calls, breakfast has been one of the more challenged daypart due to coronavirus. You mentioned and you alluded to the fact that we have had challenges in breakfast over a longer period of time. I think there's been a couple of areas there that have driven that. Certainly, one has been the much more increased level of competitive activity that we've seen in breakfast. Breakfast, as you know, prior to the pandemic, was the only daypart that was growing. And so as a result, there were a lot of new competitors that were flooding into the breakfast daypart. That certainly was one area of pressure for us. 
And then I would also just honestly say some of it was around focus. And we were not as focused as we were rolling out other things like hot off the grill, the other dayparts for us took on more time and energy and investment. 
And so as we emerge out of this, I think part of it is certainly going to be a rededication from a marketing and investment standpoint to go after breakfast. I think our ability through the drive-thrus right now to be fast at breakfast is certainly an advantage that we're looking for going forward. 
And then we will have innovation in breakfast as well. If you look at how we've performed through the pandemic, even though breakfast is certainly in the U.S. still the most challenged daypart, we're actually growing our breakfast share. And so while it is a drag from an overall standpoint, we're gaining share at breakfast, and I know the U.S. operators and Joe are hopeful to continue that trend.

I'll talk about July primarily since it's our most recent information. We talked about Australia being positive, and I'll give a quick round of the big 5 markets, if you will. 
Australia, we talked about being positive in May and June. They continue to be positive in July. Now remember, Australia was one of the few markets around the world, in addition to Canada and U.S., that remained open through all this. So they've got a little different profile, certainly than the European markets. 
Canada, I'd say, is relatively similar to how the U.S. is behaving, meaning that they are just turning slightly positive in July. And again, remember, they remained open. So I'd use the U.S. kind of profile as a proxy for Canada. 
Europe, that is obviously a little different, France, Germany and U.K. France and the U.K. were completely closed, remember, so they're a little slower to return. I mentioned that France began reopening in May. U.K. began reopening in June. U.K. is just beginning to reopen dining rooms. So you've got those different dynamics going on in the European markets. 
If I look at those 3 markets in total, they're roughly, I'll call them negative high single digits to low double digits. So that overall, when you look at those 5 markets in July, we're running probably high -- I'm sorry, mid negative single digits for that group of 5 in July. 
As far as the factors that are impacting those, a couple of things. I think one is the fact that several of those markets, as I mentioned, were fully closed. So it just -- while there's an immediate rush back and we all see the lines and the drive-thrus, et cetera, the reality is after a week or a couple of weeks and things settle down, it does take a little bit of time to kind of build up and get back to more closer to normal, I'll say. 
Dining rooms is a big thing, as I mentioned in my script, going into COVID, about 70% of our orders were in restaurant. And so I think in order to fully get certainly guest counts back, it will be getting the dining rooms open in all of those markets. 
And then the other thing that goes on in some of those European markets is specific locations, whether that's travel centers or tourist locations. Some countries, certainly the Frances, Spains, Italys are more dependent on tourism. And so you see some of those markets being impacted more than others."

Thanks, John.

And so that's why we're seeing, I'll say, reduced openings this year. That doesn't change our belief in the opportunity going forward, especially, I'd say, in Europe, where I think there may be some independent restaurant units that are having some bigger challenges, which may present some further opportunities for us. 
So our expectation is that beginning next year, we go back to kind of where we thought we would have been for unit growth in 2021. And again, especially in Europe, we believe there's a lot of opportunity for growth. 
I mentioned in our script that China is continuing to grow. So we think that they'll still open about 400 units this year. But Europe, which we have slowed down a little bit this year because of the near-term disruption, our expectation right now, and obviously that's all dependent on what happens with the pandemic going forward, but right now, our expectation is to get back to having significant unit growth in Europe.

It was largely our core menu in the U.S. and a number of other major markets around the world had a number of benefits to us.

It also had a very positive benefit around productivity and margins. All of that was also very helpful as we navigated through the second quarter. 
As we come out of it, as I've said in prior times, I think it is a safe bet that you are going to see us add items back to the menu. I think it's also equally a safe bet that we're not going to go all the way back to where we were. And so how that evolution looks is going to vary market to market. 
In the U.S., I do know that there is innovation that is planned for later this year. That's going to bring some menu items on. And then what the U.S. operators have talked about with our team has been, ""Let's just make sure every item that we add earns its way back on to the menu."" And I think that mentality of that mindset is how not just the U.S., but every market is sort of looking at it."

But I think overall, what you're talking about is accurate or certainly something that is worth paying attention to in Europe, which is in Europe, we do face a different competitive set. It tends to be, in many cases, smaller operators, bakeries, kind of places that are much more dependent on the walk-in business. Those competitors in countries like France and Germany are certainly under quite a bit of pressure, and we're seeing that right now from a variety of different media that we're hearing about some of the difficulty that exists in those markets. That does create for us an opportunity to take share because of our drive-thru business. 
I won't get into sort of the by format details. But I would just say, in general, and Kevin laid it out in his opening remarks, when we have a drive-thru business, you do tend to see those businesses come back faster. Consumers are more in the habit of going to that restaurant, and then they see the dining rooms open, and that leads to a faster recovery on the dining room business. But now, with basically almost all of our dining rooms open in Europe, even if you didn't have a drive-thru, we're seeing a nice recovery there.

Start with the fact that in China, only about 15% of the restaurants there have drive-thru. And so for all the reasons that we've already been talking about, it's a different dynamic and a more challenging dynamic when you don't have a drive-thru business. So I think that's one big difference. 
I think also, you mentioned, you touched on, there has been kind of a variety of different government actions and I'd say sort of several different waves of the coronavirus. All of that, when you take it in combination with the fact that there have been other epidemics in China, I think all of that is weighing on the minds of the Chinese consumer and definitely making them more wary. What you're seeing in China is you're seeing many of the kind of non-Western restaurants go to very aggressive value programs right now, trying to stimulate some demand in the market. And we do think that, that market is going to be more promotional, certainly through the balance of this year, again, as -- as competitors are all trying to get some traffic stimulated there and encourage people to come out of the house. So long-winded way of saying, I think China, there's a number of factors that are going on in China that don't allow it to really be a good readthrough to other markets. 
As to the U.S. and the difference between weekdays and weekends, certainly earlier in the pandemic, we were seeing a bigger hit on weekend. As we've now moved through that and getting to, I guess, I'd say more of a steady state in terms of where we're at, that disparity between the weekend and weekdays is evening out, and it's not as pronounced as it was earlier. Weekend still does provide a tougher comp, a tougher lap than the weekday. But again, the disparity that we saw between weekend and weekdays is leveling out."

But as I said earlier, when I talked about menu, we are going to have some menu innovation in the U.S. in the back half of the year. So it may get some, but I wouldn't think about that war chest as being deployed largely against innovation. It is going to be largely against the base business because our view is, right now, consumers are still looking for sort of the trusted favorites, which is why core menu makes sense for us."

And in terms of what that looks like going forward, we are starting to see it rebalance to what you would imagine are more normal or sustaining levels, meaning that traffic is improving. As traffic is improving, you're seeing check come down in terms of its contribution to growth. But still, we are in a negative traffic environment. And it is being driven largely by check, but just the trajectory of it is starting to look a little bit more as you would expect."

Well, one of the things that we do is, we do, every week, a tracking survey of consumers across most of our major markets. And I would say one of the things that we have that definitely pops in that is concern, the anxiety that exists out there around the economy and consumers believe that we are in a sort of recessionary type of dynamic. It's been interesting in many cases. And I think our most recent poll that we did, you see economic concerns eclipse public health, public safety concerns. And so as I look at all of that, I'm certainly not qualified to make any predictions around whether we're going to be in recession or not, but I'd certainly say there's a lot of warning signs out there that would suggest that the consumer sentiment and consumer concerns about the economy is negative and going in the wrong direction. 
As we think about what that means for our business, and Kevin can talk more about this, but our business tends to be pretty resilient, whether it's through recessionary times or through times of growth, and so we feel well positioned during those types of periods. But I think you're touching on something that's important, which is, as you go into potentially a more recessionary type of environment in a number of major markets, having good affordability and making sure that, that is a key component of your marketing mix is really important. And that's a conversation that I know our leadership teams in markets around the world, including in the U.S., are having with our franchisees right now. One of the things that we need to make sure is that coming out of Q2, and I think maybe some of the -- just the shock that sort of went through the System as the pandemic spread, we ended up, as I talked about, in terms of our reduction of marketing support, we went into more of a defensive posture. Now as we kind of go into a more normal or what we're kind of saying new normal, next normal, whatever the phrase you want to use, operating environment, it's time for us to get back on the front foot, that's why we have the marketing war chest, but it also means that we are going to need to be thinking about how affordability and value can play for all the reasons you were mentioning in your question."

In other words, separating the temporary change from consumer behavior using dining rooms and sitting next to each other, what have you, to more permanent ones. 
And the second part of the question is from an organizational perspective, Chris, I mean, you've obviously -- you got the head seat at McDonald's at a very auspicious time, with such a major disruptive event coming shortly after you took the job. Where are you in terms of thinking about the right organizational structure from an efficiency and effectiveness point of view of the overall McDonald's organization as we look forward?"

On the dine-in, I'm very happy that -- and I mentioned this, I think, on our last earnings call, that we are almost completely through our EOTF remodel program. I think that has positioned us very well for the future. Certainly, one of the questions that I get from franchisees is, ""Hey, we spent on the dining rooms as we went into the pandemic. Do we still feel good about that?"" And my answer is absolutely. In fact, if you look at some of the markets like Australia, for example, that have remained open, that have had dining rooms open, one of the interesting things is we're seeing kiosk usage in Australia is up by a meaningful amount. And so I think some of the things that we did with Experience of the Future and the order modifications or the new order channels like kiosk are playing right to this. 
Now certainly, what we're seeing overall, and Kevin mentioned this, is that dine-in, as a percent of our business, is a smaller amount today because of the growth of drive-thru. I think our view is, as you look out over a longer period of time, we do believe that dine-in is still going to be an important part of the mix. We're not going to be able to get to growing traffic without getting our dine-ins opened. So I think we're still going to see dine-ins as being an important part of the business. 
But in terms of enduring behavior, I think whether it's the use of kiosks, the use of mobile, the use of delivery, the use of drive-thru, certainly one of the things is that customers are looking for more of a contactless type of experience. They're looking for more of a digital type of experience, one that they can navigate on their own. I do think that, that behavior is going to be an enduring change, which is why I mentioned that the 3 Ds for us, delivery, drive-thru and digital, are going to be important strategic priorities for us for the foreseeable future, and we'll have more to share about that. 
In terms of work changes, I must admit I've not heard my coming in as being described as auspicious, but I'll take auspicious, so thank you for that. But for us, there have been certainly a lot of twists and turn in -- in the Covid road. We are looking at what does all of this mean for the longer term. But I don't anticipate that there is going to be any major changes that we would do as a result. As all of you know, we went through a pretty significant G&A rationalization over the last several years, not just in the U.S., but globally. And I think that, that put us in a very good position for where we're at now. And when I look at spans and layers and all the typical things that you look at from a G&A perspective, I think we're in pretty good shape there. 
But there are going to be areas that we're going to need to think about, and I'll just highlight one, as we move to more virtual learning. How do we think about training and development? And what does that organization need to look like? What's going to be the balance of in-person training that we do versus training that might be done virtually? So there will be some things that we need to think about organizationally. But I would say that those are on the margins. I don't anticipate anything substantive for the broader group."

I think all of that is credit to the operational modifications that we've made.

And that's the marketing war chest that I talked about earlier, but that's getting on the front foot -- foot on things like affordability. And and so that conversation does vary market by market, depending on what's going on. But I think the mentality for us now is that we have gotten the business to a good position.

So we're not seeing either drive-thru take away from delivery or delivery take away from drive-thru, both are growing significantly.

Now whether a rolling off of -- it went from $600 to $200, I don't know if we're that good to parse the details to that degree.

As I reflect back to our first quarter earnings call, a short 90 days ago, I talked about uncertainty in the world amidst the COVID pandemic and our methodical approach to reopening, grounded in what's best for the safety of o",1396,"Thank you, and good morning. As I reflect back to our first quarter earnings call, a short 90 days ago, I talked about uncertainty in the world amidst the COVID pandemic and our methodical approach to reopening, grounded in what's best for the safety of our customers and crew.  
During the second quarter, the dedication of the McDonald's System was on display as we worked together to safely reopen nearly all of McDonald's restaurants that had temporarily closed in late March, leading to continued improvement in our sales results. As of today, nearly all our restaurants globally are open for business. Almost all markets are operating with drive-thru and delivery, and many markets have also begun to reopen dining rooms. I want to say a huge thank you to franchisees, crew members, suppliers and company employees. Without their continued hard work and dedication, this would not have been possible.  
We have said that since the start of the pandemic that we entered from a position of strength. Over the last several years, our Velocity Growth Plan drove broad-based strength in markets around the world. More importantly, however, we believe McDonald's possesses several unique advantages that ensure our success is built to last. These advantages have been evident throughout the crisis.  
First is our iconic brand. McDonald's is one of the world's leading brands, and the trust customers have in McDonald's has proven to be a significant advantage during these uncertain times. Customers have been seeking known and familiar brands they can count on. And for our customers, while safety is a top concern, the need for value and convenience is also on the rise, playing to McDonald's historic strengths.  
Second, McDonald's is an execution machine. We know how to run great restaurants, and that operating prowess has been put to the ultimate test during the pandemic. Within a matter of weeks, the McDonald's System made operational modifications across 30,000 restaurants, while closing and then reopening another 9,000 restaurants. We introduced new safety procedures in all our restaurants, modified our menus and developed new contactless ways to serve our customers.  
Amidst all these changes, customer satisfaction actually improved across almost every major market, and the U.S. has hit new all-time highs for customer satisfaction. Drive-thru times have also improved across most major markets, averaging 15 to 20 seconds of improvement.  
And speaking of drive-thrus, our unmatched drive-thru penetration has allowed us to continue serving more customers in more markets than anyone else. Across our big 5 IOM markets, Australia, Canada, France, Germany and the U.K., about 70% of our restaurants offer drive-thru. And this safe and convenient service channel has been particularly appealing to our customers during the pandemic. We've seen significant increases in drive-thru sales in these markets during COVID.  
Finally, the strength of our system, our franchisees, employees and suppliers has been and always will be our secret sauce. Our 3-legged stool is committed to feeding and fostering the nearly 40,000 communities where we operate, and the pandemic has demonstrated our system's unwavering commitment. There have been countless examples of our system going above and beyond to be there for those communities who needed us most, from health care workers to truck drivers, to people working 3 shifts to make masks and respirators, we stayed open so they could keep going.  
Every franchisee comes from and is rooted in the local community. They take responsibility for building the local community, which is why our brand is strongest at the local level. Thanks to market and franchisee leadership, we are able to identify opportunities to be good neighbors in ways that are the most meaningful to customers, and this has been especially important in the last few months.
Our suppliers ensured that we had no breaks in supply for food, packaging, material, toys, equipment or other strategic categories globally. This is an incredible feat, given some of the significant challenges experienced in the past few months, and a testament to our strong supply chain teams, both globally and locally, and the partnership that they have with our suppliers. At the same time, in just a matter of weeks, our teams built a global supply chain for PPE virtually from scratch.  
Turning to our Q2 operating results. I'll provide a few headlines and observations, and then Kevin will provide more details, including key financials. In the U.S., virtually all restaurants remained open, and we saw results improve sequentially through the quarter. To ensure we kept our crew and customers safe while remaining open, we've changed nearly 50 operating procedures in accordance with guidance from state and local health experts. In Q2, we also ran a highly successful Thank You Meal program to recognize the extraordinary dedication and selflessness of first responders.  
In our International Operated Markets segment, when we last spoke, about 45% of our restaurants were open in some manner. Several of our largest markets, including the U.K., Spain, France and Italy, were completely closed for prolonged periods during the quarter. With a methodical approach, however, our teams have reopened restaurants across this segment and nearly all restaurants are now open to serve customers. We've seen strong pent-up customer demand, which is driving encouraging sequential sales improvement.  
Finally, our International Developmental Licensed segment experienced several challenges throughout the quarter. Our Latin America business was severely pressured due to the high incidence of coronavirus in several countries and has less developed drive-thru penetration. In China, after early signs suggesting a solid recovery, our pace of improvement has slowed as customers remain wary of social activities, and we now expect this more subdued pattern to continue into 2021. Worth noting that Japan had positive comp sales for the quarter, partly thanks to our brand's reputation for cleanliness and convenience with Japanese customers. 
As you can see, it remains a dynamic situation as the threat of COVID-19 continues to depress consumer sentiment, and the vagaries of the pandemic create an unpredictable operating environment. In many markets around the world, most notably in the U.S., the public health situation appears to be worsening. Nonetheless, I believe that Q2 represents the trough in our performance as McDonald's has learned to adjust our operations to this new environment.  
Regardless of the overall level of industry growth, I believe our markets and franchisees are well positioned to grow market share going forward. Three factors give me confidence.  
First, the financial health of our system is strong. As you know, we moved quickly to defer rent and royalties for franchisees, injecting nearly $1 billion of liquidity into our system at the outset of the pandemic. When necessary, we're providing timely, targeted and temporary assistance to franchisees needing additional support. Government programs such as the PPP program in the U.S. and the Chancellor's  program in the U.K. also provided strong financial relief to our franchisees. And the menu and operational modifications we introduced have further supported franchisee P&L. Collectively, these actions have significantly reduced the adverse cash flow impact of COVID-19 on the average McDonald's restaurant.  
Second, we have amassed a sizable marketing war chest to invest in the back half of 2020. During Q2, most major markets significantly reduced their marketing spend and value activities. As an example, in the U.S., marketing spend was down 70% as we chose to conserve our resources until the situation stabilized. These funds will now be reinvested in Q3 and Q4. Additionally, as we previously announced, McDonald's will also invest an incremental $200 million in marketing spend across our U.S. and International Operated Markets in the second half to accelerate recovery, roughly equivalent to 1 additional month of media in every owned market. Together, these actions will result in a sizable increase in our marketing spend for the balance of the year.  
And third, our laser-like focus on what we call the 3 Ds: drive-thru, delivery and digital. Thanks to our strategic foresight, McDonald's is well developed in each of these channels, and we see opportunities to extend our 3-D advantage. You'll hear more about the 3 Ds in our strategic plans later in the year.  
Again, I want to thank our system for the extraordinary dedication and resilience they demonstrated in Q2. And to our customers, I want to thank you for your trust in McDonald's. We're ready to serve.  
I'll now turn it over to Kevin to talk in more detail about our second quarter results."
139488,673882582,2047801,"McDonald's Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2020",2020-07-28,"Earnings Calls","McDonald's Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Chris. I'll start by walking through our comp performance for the quarter and an early read on July, move on to some items on the P&L and then end with an update on our financial position.  While this quarter was not without its challenges, we'r",1665,"Thanks, Chris. I'll start by walking through our comp performance for the quarter and an early read on July, move on to some items on the P&L and then end with an update on our financial position.  
While this quarter was not without its challenges, we're encouraged by our global comp sales improvement throughout the quarter and into July. Comps improved sequentially throughout Q2 as markets reopened and restrictions were eased. Global comp sales were down 24% for the quarter and improved as we progressed through the quarter, with the month of June down 12%. We entered the quarter with about 75% of our restaurants open. And as Chris noted, today, nearly all have reopened to serve customers.  
While in June, we recovered nearly 90% of our 2019 sales, performance across the markets is varied and uneven, depending on external factors, such as government restrictions and consumer sentiment, given concerns of resurgence. For as long as the virus is present, this is the likely operating environment, especially as we also consider government assistance to consumers rolling off in many markets and general economic uncertainty. And we believe we're well positioned to navigate through it all.  
That said, some consistent themes have emerged. Comp sales continue to be heavily reliant on check growth from larger orders with guest counts negative. The number of drive-thrus impacts the market's pace of recovery. As Chris mentioned, our drive-thrus overall have proven to be a competitive advantage for us, and markets with a higher percentage of drive-thrus are showing quicker recovery. Markets with a higher concentration of city center and mall restaurants are seeing heavier impact from reduced foot traffic. And travel- or tourist-dependent locations are slower to recover as mobility remains suppressed.  
In looking at performance across the segments, the International Operated Markets segment experienced a sharp decline with more than half of the restaurants temporarily closed early in the quarter. Comp sales were down 41% for the quarter, improving to down 18% for the month of June, as key markets like France began reopening in May and the U.K. began reopening in June. Australia delivered positive comp sales for both May and June, bolstered by strong drive-thru and delivery performance. Australia has doubled its delivery sales mix to nearly 10% of sales, a trend we're seeing across several of our international markets.  
While we've seen a significant uptick in drive-thru as a percentage of total sales throughout the segment, a crucial step in our recovery is the reopening of dining rooms. Pre-COVID, nearly 70% of customer orders were in-restaurant across our larger markets. So closing the dining area or even limiting dine-in capacity has a substantial impact on results.  
Today, almost all restaurants and about 2/3 of the dining rooms have reopened in the segment, although many restaurants are still operating with restrictions, such as limited hours or channels based on local regulations. In July, comp sales in the IOM segment have continued to improve, although they remain negative in the high-single digits.  
Turning to the U.S. Comp sales for the quarter were down 8.7% and improved as we progressed through the quarter, with June down 2.3%. Breakfast continues to be disproportionately impacted by disruptions to commuting routines. And while weekend recovery is still lagging weekday recovery, the gap is narrowing.  
Throughout the pandemic, we benefited greatly from nearly all of our restaurants remaining open to serve customers, particularly with drive-thrus in nearly 95% of our locations. As customers shifted to a more contactless experience, drive-thru accounted for nearly 90% of our sales again this quarter. We also continue to see an uptick in delivery and digital transactions per restaurant.  
Mid-quarter, we began to reopen dining rooms in the U.S. with reduced seating capacity for customers who want to enjoy their food on-premise. In early July, we paused as we've seen resurgences across the country. And today, we have about 2,000 dining rooms open. Together with our franchisees, we're taking a thoughtful and responsible approach to determine the right time to reopen the remaining dining rooms. The U.S. has continued to see improving comp sales through July with comps turning slightly positive during the month. 
Comp sales in the International Developmental Licensed segment were down 24% for the quarter, with the months of May and June both down about 20%. As Chris mentioned, Latin America was the hardest-hit geography across the segment, while Japan delivered positive comp sales for the quarter. And in China, recovery has been somewhat uneven as consumers remain cautious on resuming pre-COVID routines, especially in light of resurgence concerns. Increased competitive activity and the fact that schools have been closed also are impacting the pace of recovery.  
In terms of new unit development, China has opened about 150 restaurants through June. We remain confident in new restaurant growth opportunities in China with a plan to open about 400 new restaurants this year. While we expect recovery to continue to be somewhat gradual and uneven for many markets around the globe in the near term, we're proud of our teams and the way we've responded to the pandemic.  
Moving to the P&L. As we become a more heavily franchised business over the last several years, our operating model is designed to tap into the entrepreneurial spirit of our local business owners and efficiently convert top line growth to the bottom line. Despite the challenging environment, McDonald's restaurants generated over $19 billion in systemwide sales for the quarter. Franchise margins represented about 90% of overall margin dollars and were a key component of operating income.  
There are a couple of P&L lines specifically impacted by COVID-19-related items. First, G&A increased $114 million or 22% in constant currencies for the quarter. As Chris mentioned, the company is making an incremental marketing contribution to the U.S. and IOM markets. The amount related to that contribution included in G&A for Q2 was about $160 million, which more than offset lower travel costs and lower incentive compensation accruals.  
Turning to the other operating income and expense section. Gains on restaurant sales for the full year are still expected to be down significantly versus last year as we anticipate a minimal amount of restaurant sale activity for the remainder of the year. Our equity in earnings of affiliates for the full year is projected to be down substantially. We recorded an additional $45 million for reserves for bad debt related to rent and royalty deferrals for Q2.  
And finally, in further supporting our franchisees, we made onetime payments of about $30 million to distribution centers for obsolete inventory. This was a result of the abrupt reduction in consumer demand and product mix shifts early in the pandemic.  
As I've mentioned before, the financial health of our system was an underlying strength of our business coming into the pandemic, and we've taken actions to preserve financial flexibility. As a reminder, we suspended our share repurchase program in early March. We also bolstered our financial position by securing $6.5 billion of new financing back in Q1. This enabled us to invest in the system in several ways. We provided nearly $1 billion of broad-based financial liquidity assistance to our franchisees, primarily in the form of rent and royalty deferrals. As a result, free cash flow was negative in the second quarter and positive for the first half of the year. Based on our current operating performance and our anticipated collection of a majority of the deferrals in Q3 and Q4, we still expect free cash flow to be positive for the remainder of the year.  
Further building on the broad-based liquidity support, we're also assessing the financial health of specific at-risk franchisee and developmental licensee organizations. We're using an objective framework for decision-making, and we expect that only a small percent of organizations will require further assistance. The financial health and strength of our franchisees has been a competitive advantage for McDonald's for years, and we expect that to continue. Finally, as we've mentioned, we invested in incremental marketing across the U.S. and IOM markets to further accelerate recovery and drive growth.  
In terms of capital expenditures, we took a very practical approach to development activity during the onset of the pandemic by pausing most project work. As many franchisees are willing and able to invest and some work has resumed, our expected capital spend for 2020 is now about $1.6 billion versus the original $2.4 billion. About half of the $1.6 billion will be dedicated to the U.S. business, including completing roughly 900 EOTF projects. Additionally, we now plan to open about 950 gross and 350 net new restaurants this year. The U.S. is accelerating some restaurant closings previously planned for future years. Of the 200 U.S. closures for this year, over half are low-volume restaurants in Walmart store locations.  
Consistent with enhancing financial flexibility and our franchising strategy, we're planning to divest a portion of our stake in McDonald's Japan. As a result of the strong performance of the McDonald's Japan business over the past few years and our confidence in the local management team, we believe it's the right time to gradually reduce our ownership stake in the market. This will take some time because of the low trading volume of McDonald's Japan shares. As a reminder, we currently own about 49% of the business, and we will retain at least 35% ownership. This decision provides us with additional financial flexibility to execute our capital allocation strategy while also demonstrating our commitment to our Japanese business.  
Regarding uses of cash, our top priorities remain the same: first, investing in the business for growth; and second, prioritizing dividends to our shareholders. After that, we'll look to reduce debt in the near term to lower our elevated leverage ratios. We will continue to manage and utilize our funds in a judicious manner that focuses on ensuring the company is able to grow the business, our franchisees remain financially strong and our shareholders are duly rewarded.  
Now I'll turn it back to Chris."

And on the breakfast point, certainly, as we've talked about on prior calls, breakfast has been one of the more challenged daypart due to coronavirus. You mentioned and you alluded to the fact that we have had challenges in breakfast over a longer period of time. I think there's been a couple of areas there that have driven that. Certainly, one has been the much more increased level of competitive activity that we've seen in breakfast. Breakfast, as you know, prior to the pandemic, was the only daypart that was growing. And so as a result, there were a lot of new competitors that were flooding into the breakfast daypart. That certainly was one area of pressure for us.  
And then I would also just honestly say some of it was around focus. And we were not as focused as we were rolling out other things like hot off the grill. The other dayparts for us took on more time and energy and investment. And so as we emerge out of this, I think part of it is certainly going to be a rededication from a marketing and investment standpoint to go after breakfast. I think our ability through the drive-thrus right now to be fast at breakfast is certainly an advantage that we're looking for going forward.  
And then we will have innovation in breakfast as well. If you look at how we've performed through the pandemic, even though breakfast is certainly in the U.S. still the most challenged daypart, we're actually growing our breakfast share. And so while it is a drag from an overall standpoint, we're gaining share at breakfast, and I know the U.S. operators and Joe are hopeful to continue that trend.

I'll talk about July primarily since it's our most recent information. We talked about Australia being positive, and I'll give a quick round of the big 5 markets, if you will. Australia, we talked about being positive in May and June. They continue to be positive in July. Now remember, Australia was one of the few markets around the world, in addition to Canada and U.S., that remained open through all this. So they've got a little different profile certainly than the European markets.  
Canada, I'd say, is relatively similar to how the U.S. is behaving, meaning that they are just turning slightly positive in July. And again, remember, they remained open. So I'd use the U.S. kind of profile as a proxy for Canada.  
Europe, that is obviously a little different, France, Germany and the U.K. France and the U.K. were completely closed, remember, so they're a little slower to return. I mentioned that France began reopening in May. U.K. began reopening in June. U.K. is just beginning to reopen dining rooms. So you've got those different dynamics going on in the European markets.  
If I look at those 3 markets in total, they're roughly, I'll call them, negative high single digits to low double digits. So that overall, when you look at those 5 markets in July, we're running probably high -- I'm sorry, mid-negative single digits for that group of 5 in July.  
As far as the factors that are impacting those, a couple of things. I think one is the fact that several of those markets, as I mentioned, were fully closed. So it just -- while there's an immediate rush back and we all see the lines at the drive-thru, et cetera, the reality is after a week or a couple of weeks and things settle down, it does take a little bit of time to kind of build up and get back to more closer to normal, I'll say.  
Dining rooms is a big thing. As I mentioned in my script, going into COVID, about 70% of our orders were in-restaurant. And so I think in order to fully get certainly guest counts back, it will be getting the dining rooms open in all of those markets.  
And then the other thing that goes on in some of those European markets is specific locations, whether that's travel centers or tourist locations. Some countries, certainly the Frances, Spains, Italys, are more dependent on tourism, and so you see some of those markets being impacted more than others."

And so that's why you're seeing -- why we are seeing, I'll say, reduced openings this year. That doesn't change our belief in the opportunity going forward, especially, I'd say, in Europe where I think there may be some independent restaurant units that are having some bigger challenges, which may present some further opportunities for us.  
So our expectation is that beginning next year, we go back to kind of where we thought we would have been for unit growth in 2021. And again, especially in Europe, we believe there's a lot of opportunity for growth. I mentioned in our script that China is continuing to grow. So we think that they'll still open about 400 units this year.
But Europe, which we have slowed down a little bit this year because of the near-term disruption, our expectation right now, and obviously that's all dependent on what happens with the pandemic going forward, but right now, our expectation is to get back to having significant unit growth in Europe.

I'll take the first part of that, and then if Kevin has anything else to add, I'll pass it off to him. But I think overall, what you're talking about is accurate or certainly something that is worth paying attention to in Europe, which is in Europe, we do face a different competitive set. It tends to be, in many cases, smaller operators, bakeries, kind of places that are much more dependent on the walk-in business. Those competitors in countries like France and Germany are certainly under quite a bit of pressure. And we're seeing that right now from a variety of different media that we're hearing about some of the difficulty that exists in those markets. That does create for us an opportunity to take share because of our drive-thru business. 
I won't get into sort of the by-format details. But I would just say, in general, and Kevin laid it out in his opening remarks, when we have a drive-thru business, you do tend to see those businesses come back faster. Consumers are more in the habit of going to that restaurant, and then they see the dining rooms open, and that leads to a faster recovery on the dining room business. But now, with basically almost all of our dining rooms open in Europe, even if you didn't have a drive-thru, we're seeing a nice recovery there. It's just not as fast as if you had a drive-thru that was allowing you to operate as well. 
And Kevin, I'll pass it off to you for anything else you want to add."

And if we think about pre-COVID, about 1/3 of our sales in those markets were through the drive-thru pre-COVID. Now about 2/3 of our sales are through the drive-thru. So we've certainly seen the advantage of having drive-thrus in those markets. And as Chris mentioned, that -- those do tend to come back quicker than the restaurants without drive-thru."

We've heard there maybe more lockdowns in some of the cities than what we've seen in other countries. Just trying to understand kind of if we would -- if you'd expect to see a similar retrenchment in other markets. 
And I guess related to that, in the U.S., if you could just talk about the difference in dayparts or what you're seeing between weekends and weekdays, if there are any kind of different behavior patterns that you can tell us about that.

I do think China is probably more unique and, therefore, probably not a good proxy to think about for the other markets, start with the fact that in China, only about 15% of the restaurants there have drive-thru. And so for all the reasons that we've already been talking about, it's a different dynamic and a more challenging dynamic when you don't have a drive-thru business. So I think that's one big difference. 
I think also, you mentioned -- you've touched on, there has been kind of a variety of different government actions and I'd say sort of several different waves of the coronavirus. All of that, when you take it in combination with the fact that there have been other epidemics in China, I think all of that is weighing on the minds of the Chinese consumer and definitely making them more wary.
What you're seeing in China is you're seeing many of the kind of non-Western restaurants go to very aggressive value programs right now, trying to stimulate some demand in the market. And we do think that, that market is going to be more promotional, certainly through the balance of this year, again, as competitors are all trying to get some traffic stimulated there and encourage people to come out of the house. So long-winded way of saying, I think China, there's a number of factors that are going on in China that don't allow it to really be a good readthrough to other markets. 
As to the U.S. and the difference between weekdays and weekends, certainly earlier in the pandemic, we were seeing a bigger hit on weekend. As we've now moved through that and getting to, I guess, I'd say more of a steady state in terms of where we're at, that disparity between the weekend and weekdays is evening out, and it's not as pronounced as it was earlier. Weekend still does provide a tougher comp, a tougher lap than the weekday. But again, the disparity that we saw between weekend and weekdays is leveling out."

Well, one of the things that we do is we do, every week, a tracking survey of consumers across most of our major markets. And I would say, one of the things that we have that definitely pops in that is concern, the anxiety that exists out there around the economy and consumers' belief that we are in a sort of recessionary type of dynamic. It's been interesting in many cases. And I think in our most recent poll that we did, you see economic concerns eclipse public health or public safety concerns.
And so as I look at all of that, I'm certainly not qualified to make any predictions around whether we're going to be in recession or not, but I'd certainly say there's a lot of warning signs out there that would suggest that the consumer sentiment and consumer concern about the economy is negative and going in the wrong direction. 
As we think about what that means for our business, and Kevin can talk more about this, but our business tends to be pretty resilient, whether it's through recessionary times or through times of growth. And so we feel well positioned during those types of periods. But I think you're touching on something that's important, which is, as you go into potentially a more recessionary type of environment in a number of major markets, having good affordability and making sure that, that is a key component of your marketing mix is really important. And that's a conversation that I know our leadership teams in markets around the world, including in the U.S., are having with our franchisees right now.
One of the things that we need to make sure is that coming out of Q2, and I think maybe some of the -- just the shock that sort of went through the system as the pandemic spread, we ended up, as I talked about, in terms of our reduction of marketing support, we went into more of a defensive posture. Now as we kind of go into a more normal or what we're kind of saying new normal, next normal, whatever the phrase you want to use, operating environment, it's time for us to get back on the front foot. That's why we have the marketing war chest, but it also means that we are going to need to be thinking about how affordability and value can play for all the reasons you were mentioning in your question."

And if any of that is basically leading you to reconsider the way that some of your dining rooms are going to be used, in other words, separating the temporary change from consumer behavior using dining rooms and sitting next to each other, what have you, to more permanent ones. 
And the second part of the question is from an organizational perspective. Chris, I mean, you -- obviously, you've got the head seat at McDonald's at a very auspicious time with such a major disruptive event coming shortly after you took the job. Where are you in terms of thinking about the right organizational structure from an efficiency and effectiveness point of view of the overall McDonald's organization as we look forward?"

On the dine-in, I'm very happy that -- and I mentioned this, I think, on our last earnings call, that we are almost completely through our EOTF remodel program. I think that has positioned us very well for the future. Certainly, one of the questions that I get from franchisees is, hey, we spent on the dining rooms as we went into the pandemic. Do we still feel good about that? And my answer is absolutely. In fact, if you look at some of the markets like Australia, for example, that have remained open, that have had dining rooms open, one of the interesting things is we're seeing kiosk usage in Australia is up by a meaningful amount. And so I think some of the things that we did with Experience of the Future and the order modifications or the new order channels like kiosk are playing right to this. 
Now certainly, what we're seeing overall, and Kevin mentioned this, is that dine-in, as a percent of our business, is a smaller amount today because of the growth of drive-thru. I think our view is, as you look out over a longer period of time, we do believe that dine-in is still going to be an important part of the mix. We're not going to be able to get to growing traffic without getting our dine-ins opened. So I think we're still going to see dine-ins as being an important part of the business. 
But in terms of enduring behavior, I think whether it's the use of kiosk, the use of mobile, the use of delivery, the use of drive-thru, certainly one of the things is that customers are looking for more of a contactless type of experience. They're looking for more of a digital type of experience, one that they can navigate on their own. I do think that, that behavior is going to be an enduring change, which is why I mentioned that the 3 Ds for us, delivery, drive-thru and digital, are going to be important strategic priorities for us for the foreseeable future, and we'll have more to share about that. 
In terms of org changes, I must admit I've not heard my coming in as being described as auspicious, but I'll take auspicious. So thank you for that. But for us, there have been certainly a lot of twists and turns in the COVID road. We are looking at what does all of this mean for the longer term. But I don't anticipate that there is going to be any major changes that we would do as a result. As all of you know, we went through a pretty significant G&A rationalization over the last several years, not just in the U.S., but globally. And I think that, that put us in a very good position for where we're at now. And when I look at spans and layers and all the typical things that you look at from a G&A perspective, I think we're in pretty good shape there. 
But there are going to be areas that we're going to need to think about, and I'll just highlight one. As we move to more virtual learning, how do we think about training and development? And what does that organization need to look like? What's going to be the balance of in-person training that we do versus training that might be done virtually? So there will be some things that we need to think about organizationally. But I would say that those are on the margins. I don't anticipate anything substantive for the broader group."

I think all of that is credit to the operational modifications that we've made.

And that's the marketing war chest that I talked about earlier, but that's getting on the front foot on things like affordability.
And so that conversation does vary market by market, depending on what's going on. But I think the mentality for us now is that we have gotten the business to a good position. I think regardless of whether we enter a recession, don't enter a recession, whether we have a resurgence, we don't have a resurgence of the virus, all of those things are going to vary by country.

So we're not seeing either drive-thru take away from delivery or delivery take away from drive-thru. Both are growing significantly.

Now whether a rolling off of -- it went from $600 to $200, I don't know if we're that good to parse the details to that degree. But there certainly was a benefit, not just in the U.S., but we've seen it in a number of other markets around the world, that the government fiscal policy has had a positive benefit on comp.

They've got cash flow, they have access to capital and are willing to invest. So we haven't seen any drying up of financing pretty much around the world.
I'd say that, but I'd also say we do have some international markets where, again, they were closed for potentially a couple of months even at a time, and some individual franchisees would have taken on some heavy debt over the last several years between EOTF projects, potentially purchasing restaurants, et cetera. So there are individual organizations that I'd say are a little stretched, but it isn't the lack of access to capital. It's really just kind of working through their ratios."

As I reflect back to our first quarter earnings call, a short 90 days ago, I talked about uncertainty in the world amidst the COVID pandemic and our methodical approach to reopening, grounded in what's best for the safety of our customers and crew. 
During the second quarter, the dedication of the McDonald's System was on display as we worked together to safely reopen nearly all of McDonald's restaurants that had temporarily closed in late March, leading to continued improvement in our sales results. As of today, nearly all our restaurants globally are open for business. Almost all markets are operating with drive-thru and delivery, and many markets have also begun to reopen dining rooms. I want to say a huge thank you to franchisees, crew members, suppliers and company employees. Without their continued hard work and dedication, this would not have been possible. 
We have said that since the start of the pandemic that we entered from a position of strength. Over the last several years, our Velocity Growth Plan drove broad-based strength in markets around the world. More importantly, however, we believe McDonald's possesses several unique advantages that ensure our success is built to last. These advantages have been evident throughout the crisis. 
First is our iconic brand. McDonald's is one of the world's leading brands, and the trust customers have in McDonald's has proven to be a significant advantage during these uncertain times. Customers have been seeking known and familiar brands they can count on. And for our customers, while safety is a top concern, the need for value and convenience is also on the rise, playing to McDonald's historic strengths. 
Second, McDonald's is an execution machine. We know how to run great restaurants, and that operating prowess has been put to the ultimate test during the pandemic. Within a matter of weeks, the McDonald's System made operational modifications across 30,000 restaurants, while closing and then reopening another 9,000 restaurants. We introduced new safety procedures in all our restaurants, modified our menus and developed new contactless ways to serve our customers. 
Amidst all these changes, customer satisfaction actually improved across almost every major market, and the U.S. has hit new all-time highs for customer satisfaction. Drive-thru times have also improved across most major markets, averaging 15 to 20 seconds of improvement. 
And speaking of drive-thrus, our unmatched drive-thru penetration has allowed us to continue serving more customers in more markets than anyone else. Across our big 5 IOM markets, Australia, Canada, France, Germany and the U.K., about 70% of our restaurants offer drive-thru. And this safe and convenient service channel has been particularly appealing to our customers during the pandemic. We've seen significant increases in drive-thru sales in these markets during COVID. 
Finally, the strength of our system, our franchisees, employees and suppliers has been and always will be our secret sauce. Our 3-legged stool is committed to feeding and fostering the nearly 40,000 communities where we operate, and the pandemic has demonstrated our system's unwavering commitment. There have been countless examples of our system going above and beyond to be there for those communities who needed us most, from health care workers to truck drivers, to people working 3 shifts to make masks and respirators, we stayed open so they could keep going. 
Every franchisee comes from and is rooted in the local community. They take responsibility for building the local community, which is why our brand is strongest at the local level. Thanks to market and franchisee leadership, we are able to identify opportunities to be good neighbors in ways that are the most meaningful to customers, and this has been especially important in the last few months.
Our suppliers ensured that we had no breaks in supply for food, packaging, material, toys, equipment or other strategic categories globally. This is an incredible feat, given some of the significant challenges experienced in the past few months, and a testament to our strong supply chain teams, both globally and locally, and the partnership that they have with our suppliers. At the same time, in just a matter of weeks, our teams built a global supply chain for PPE virtually from scratch. 
Turning to our Q2 operating results. I'll provide a few headlines and observations, and then Kevin will provide more details, including key financials. In the U.S., virtually all restaurants remained open, and we saw results improve sequentially through the quarter. To ensure we kept our crew and customers safe while remaining open, we've changed nearly 50 operating procedures in accordance with guidance from state and local health experts. In Q2, we also ran a highly successful Thank You Meal program to recognize the extraordinary dedication and selflessness of first responders. 
In our International Operated Markets segment, when we last spoke, about 45% of our restaurants were open in some manner. Several of our largest markets, including the U.K., Spain, France and Italy, were completely closed for prolonged periods during the quarter. With a methodical approach, however, our teams have reopened restaurants across this segment and nearly all restaurants are now open to serve customers. We've seen strong pent-up customer demand, which is driving encouraging sequential sales improvement. 
Finally, our International Developmental Licensed segment experienced several challenges throughout the quarter. Our Latin America business was severely pressured due to the high incidence of coronavirus in several countries and has less developed drive-thru penetration. In China, after early signs suggesting a solid recovery, our pace of improvement has slowed as customers remain wary of social activities, and we now expect this more subdued pattern to continue into 2021. Worth noting that Japan had positive comp sales for the quarter, partly thanks to our brand's reputation for cleanliness and convenience with Japanese customers. 
As you can see, it remains a dynamic situation as the threat of COVID-19 continues to depress consumer sentiment, and the vagaries of the pandemic create an unpredictable operating environment. In many markets around the world, most notably in the U.S., the public health situation appears to be worsening. Nonetheless, I believe that Q2 represents the trough in our performance as McDonald's has learned to adjust our operations to this new environment. 
Regardless of the overall level of industry growth, I believe our markets and franchisees are well positioned to grow market share going forward. Three factors give me confidence. 
First, the financial health of our system is strong. As you know, we moved quickly to defer rent and royalties for franchisees, injecting nearly $1 billion of liquidity into our system at the outset of the pandemic. When necessary, we're providing timely, targeted and temporary assistance to franchisees needing additional support. Government programs such as the PPP program in the U.S. and the Chancellor's program in the U.K. also provided strong financial relief to our franchisees. And the menu and operational modifications we introduced have further supported franchisee P&L. Collectively, these actions have significantly reduced the adverse cash flow impact of COVID-19 on the average McDonald's restaurant. 
Second, we have amassed a sizable marketing war chest to invest in the back half of 2020. During Q2, most major markets significantly reduced their marketing spend and value activities. As an example, in the U.S., marketing spend was down 70% as we chose to conserve our resources until the situation stabilized. These funds will now be reinvested in Q3 and Q4. Additionally, as we previously announced, McDonald's will also invest an incremental $200 million in marketing spend across our U.S. and International Operated Markets in the second half to accelerate recovery, roughly equivalent to 1 additional month of media in every owned market. Together, these actions will result in a sizable increase in our marketing spend for the balance of the year. 
And third, our laser-like focus on what we call the 3 Ds: drive-thru, delivery and digital. Thanks to our strategic foresight, McDonald's is well developed in each of these channels, and we see opportunities to extend our 3-D advantage. You'll hear more about the 3 Ds in our strategic plans later in the year. 
Again, I want to thank our system for the extraordinary dedication and resilience they demonstrated in Q2. And to our customers, I want to thank you for your trust in McDonald's. We're ready to serve. 
I'll now turn it over to Kevin to talk in more detail about our second quarter results."
139488,673882582,2084986,"McDonald's Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2020",2020-07-28,"Earnings Calls","McDonald's Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Chris. I'll start by walking through our comp performance for the quarter and an early read on July, move on to some items on the P&L and then end with an update on our financial position.

I'll start by walking through our comp performance for the quarter and an early read on July, move on to some items on the P&L and then end with an update on our financial position. 
While this quarter was not without its challenges, we're encouraged by our global comp sales improvement throughout the quarter and into July. Comps improved sequentially throughout Q2 as markets reopened and restrictions were eased. Global comp sales were down 24% for the quarter and improved as we progressed through the quarter, with the month of June down 12%. We entered the quarter with about 75% of our restaurants open. And as Chris noted, today, nearly all have reopened to serve customers. 
While in June, we recovered nearly 90% of our 2019 sales, performance across the markets is varied and uneven, depending on external factors, such as government restrictions and consumer sentiment, given concerns of resurgence. For as long as the virus is present, this is the likely operating environment, especially as we also consider government assistance to consumers rolling off in many markets and general economic uncertainty. And we believe we're well positioned to navigate through it all. 
That said, some consistent themes have emerged. Comp sales continue to be heavily reliant on check growth from larger orders with guest counts negative. The number of drive-thrus impacts the market's pace of recovery. As Chris mentioned, our drive-thrus overall have proven to be a competitive advantage for us, and markets with a higher percentage of drive-thrus are showing quicker recovery. Markets with a higher concentration of city center and mall restaurants are seeing heavier impact from reduced foot traffic. And travel- or tourist-dependent locations are slower to recover as mobility remains suppressed. 
In looking at performance across the segments, the International Operated Markets segment experienced a sharp decline with more than half of the restaurants temporarily closed early in the quarter. Comp sales were down 41% for the quarter, improving to down 18% for the month of June, as key markets like France began reopening in May and the U.K. began reopening in June. Australia delivered positive comp sales for both May and June, bolstered by strong drive-thru and delivery performance. Australia has doubled its delivery sales mix to nearly 10% of sales, a trend we're seeing across several of our international markets. 
While we've seen a significant uptick in drive-thru as a percentage of total sales throughout the segment, a crucial step in our recovery is the reopening of dining rooms. Pre-COVID, nearly 70% of customer orders were in-restaurant across our larger markets. So closing the dining area or even limiting dine-in capacity has a substantial impact on results. 
Today, almost all restaurants and about 2/3 of the dining rooms have reopened in the segment, although many restaurants are still operating with restrictions, such as limited hours or channels based on local regulations. In July, comp sales in the IOM segment have continued to improve, although they remain negative in the high-single digits. 
Turning to the U.S. Comp sales for the quarter were down 8.7% and improved as we progressed through the quarter, with June down 2.3%. Breakfast continues to be disproportionately impacted by disruptions to commuting routines. And while weekend recovery is still lagging weekday recovery, the gap is narrowing. 
Throughout the pandemic, we benefited greatly from nearly all of our restaurants remaining open to serve customers, particularly with drive-thrus in nearly 95% of our locations. As customers shifted to a more contactless experience, drive-thru accounted for nearly 90% of our sales again this quarter. We also continue to see an uptick in delivery and digital transactions per restaurant. 
Mid-quarter, we began to reopen dining rooms in the U.S. with reduced seating capacity for customers who want to enjoy their food on-premise. In early July, we paused as we've seen resurgences across the country. And today, we have about 2,000 dining rooms open. Together with our franchisees, we're taking a thoughtful and responsible approach to determine the right time to reopen the remaining dining rooms. The U.S. has continued to see improving comp sales through July with comps turning slightly positive during the month. 
Comp sales in the International Developmental Licensed segment were down 24% for the quarter, with the months of May and June both down about 20%. As Chris mentioned, Latin America was the hardest-hit geography across the segment, while Japan delivered positive comp sales for the quarter. And in China, recovery has been somewhat uneven as consumers remain cautious on resuming pre-COVID routines, especially in light of resurgence concerns. Increased competitive activity and the fact that schools have been closed also are impacting the pace of recovery. 
In terms of new unit development, China has opened about 150 restaurants through June. We remain confident in new restaurant growth opportunities in China with a plan to open about 400 new restaurants this year. While we expect recovery to continue to be somewhat gradual and uneven for many markets around the globe in the near term, we're proud of our teams and the way we've responded to the pandemic. 
Moving to the P&L. As we become a more heavily franchised business over the last several years, our operating model is designed to tap into the entrepreneurial spirit of our local business owners and efficiently convert top line growth to the bottom line. Despite the challenging environment, McDonald's restaurants generated over $19 billion in systemwide sales for the quarter. Franchise margins represented about 90% of overall margin dollars and were a key component of operating income. 
There are a couple of P&L lines specifically impacted by COVID-19-related items. First, G&A increased $114 million or 22% in constant currencies for the quarter. As Chris mentioned, the company is making an incremental marketing contribution to the U.S. and IOM markets. The amount related to that contribution included in G&A for Q2 was about $160 million, which more than offset lower travel costs and lower incentive compensation accruals. 
Turning to the other operating income and expense section. Gains on restaurant sales for the full year are still expected to be down significantly versus last year as we anticipate a minimal amount of restaurant sale activity for the remainder of the year. Our equity in earnings of affiliates for the full year is projected to be down substantially. We recorded an additional $45 million for reserves for bad debt related to rent and royalty deferrals for Q2. 
And finally, in further supporting our franchisees, we made onetime payments of about $30 million to distribution centers for obsolete inventory. This was a result of the abrupt reduction in consumer demand and product mix shifts early in the pandemic. 
As I've mentioned before, the financial health of our system was an underlying strength of our business coming into the pandemic, and we've taken actions to preserve financial flexibility. As a reminder, we suspended our share repurchase program in early March. We also bolstered our financial position by securing $6.5 billion of new financing back in Q1. This enabled us to invest in the system in several ways. We provided nearly $1 billion of broad-based financial liquidity assistance to our franchisees, primarily in the form of rent and royalty deferrals. As a result, free cash flow was negative in the second quarter and positive for the first half of the year. Based on our current operating performance and our anticipated collection of a majority of the deferrals in Q3 and Q4, we still expect free cash flow to be positive for the remainder of the year. 
Further building on the broad-based liquidity support, we're also assessing the financial health of specific at-risk franchisee and developmental licensee organizations. We're using an objective framework for decision-making, and we expect that only a small percent of organizations will require further assistance. The financial health and strength of our franchisees has been a competitive advantage for McDonald's for years, and we expect that to continue. Finally, as we've mentioned, we invested in incremental marketing across the U.S. and IOM markets to further accelerate recovery and drive growth. 
In terms of capital expenditures, we took a very practical approach to development activity during the onset of the pandemic by pausing most project work. As many franchisees are willing and able to invest and some work has resumed, our expected capital spend for 2020 is now about $1.6 billion versus the original $2.4 billion. About half of the $1.6 billion will be dedicated to the U.S. business, including completing roughly 900 EOTF projects. Additionally, we now plan to open about 950 gross and 350 net new restaurants this year. The U.S. is accelerating some restaurant closings previously planned for future years. Of the 200 U.S. closures for this year, over half are low-volume restaurants in Walmart store locations. 
Consistent with enhancing financial flexibility and our franchising strategy, we're planning to divest a portion of our stake in McDonald's Japan. As a result of the strong performance of the McDonald's Japan business over the past few years and our confidence in the local management team, we believe it's the right time to gradually reduce our ownership stake in the market. This will take some time because of the low trading volume of McDonald's Japan shares. As a reminder, we currently own about 49% of the business, and we will retain at least 35% ownership. This decision provides us with additional financial flexibility to execute our capital allocation strategy while also demonstrating our commitment to our Japanese business. 
Regarding uses of cash, our top priorities remain the same: first, investing in the business for growth; and second, prioritizing dividends to our shareholders. After that, we'll look to reduce debt in the near term to lower our elevated leverage ratios. We will continue to manage and utilize our funds in a judicious manner that focuses on ensuring the company is able to grow the business, our franchisees remain financially strong and our shareholders are duly rewarded. 
Now I'll turn it back to Chris."

And on the breakfast point, certainly, as we've talked about on prior calls, breakfast has been one of the more challenged daypart due to coronavirus. You mentioned and you alluded to the fact that we have had challenges in breakfast over a longer period of time. I think there's been a couple of areas there that have driven that. Certainly, one has been the much more increased level of competitive activity that we've seen in breakfast. Breakfast, as you know, prior to the pandemic, was the only daypart that was growing. And so as a result, there were a lot of new competitors that were flooding into the breakfast daypart. That certainly was one area of pressure for us. 
And then I would also just honestly say some of it was around focus. And we were not as focused as we were rolling out other things like hot off the grill. The other dayparts for us took on more time and energy and investment. And so as we emerge out of this, I think part of it is certainly going to be a rededication from a marketing and investment standpoint to go after breakfast. I think our ability through the drive-thrus right now to be fast at breakfast is certainly an advantage that we're looking for going forward. 
And then we will have innovation in breakfast as well. If you look at how we've performed through the pandemic, even though breakfast is certainly in the U.S. still the most challenged daypart, we're actually growing our breakfast share. And so while it is a drag from an overall standpoint, we're gaining share at breakfast, and I know the U.S. operators and Joe are hopeful to continue that trend.

All right, a couple of things. Let's talk about July. I'll talk about July primarily since it's our most recent information. We talked about Australia being positive, and I'll give a quick round of the big 5 markets, if you will. Austr",435,"Yes. Thanks, David. All right, a couple of things. Let's talk about July. I'll talk about July primarily since it's our most recent information. We talked about Australia being positive, and I'll give a quick round of the big 5 markets, if you will. Australia, we talked about being positive in May and June. They continue to be positive in July. Now remember, Australia was one of the few markets around the world, in addition to Canada and U.S., that remained open through all this. So they've got a little different profile certainly than the European markets. 
Canada, I'd say, is relatively similar to how the U.S. is behaving, meaning that they are just turning slightly positive in July. And again, remember, they remained open. So I'd use the U.S. kind of profile as a proxy for Canada. 
Europe, that is obviously a little different, France, Germany and the U.K. France and the U.K. were completely closed, remember, so they're a little slower to return. I mentioned that France began reopening in May. U.K. began reopening in June. U.K. is just beginning to reopen dining rooms. So you've got those different dynamics going on in the European markets. 
If I look at those 3 markets in total, they're roughly, I'll call them, negative high single digits to low double digits. So that overall, when you look at those 5 markets in July, we're running probably high -- I'm sorry, mid-negative single digits for that group of 5 in July. 
As far as the factors that are impacting those, a couple of things. I think one is the fact that several of those markets, as I mentioned, were fully closed. So it just -- while there's an immediate rush back and we all see the lines at the drive-thru, et cetera, the reality is after a week or a couple of weeks and things settle down, it does take a little bit of time to kind of build up and get back to more closer to normal, I'll say. 
Dining rooms is a big thing. As I mentioned in my script, going into COVID, about 70% of our orders were in-restaurant. And so I think in order to fully get certainly guest counts back, it will be getting the dining rooms open in all of those markets. 
And then the other thing that goes on in some of those European markets is specific locations, whether that's travel centers or tourist locations. Some countries, certainly the Frances, Spains, Italys, are more dependent on tourism, and so you see some of those markets being impacted more than others."

Do you think that opportunity has changed? Has it gotten better? When you talk about reducing unit growth this year, what's the primary factor? Is it franchisee lack of willingness because there's a distraction? Or is it just the construction?
What -- how do we think about unit growth going forward? What are the causes for the delay? And is this even a bigger opportunity, as many other restaurants have talked about, in terms of opportunity to gain share and gain better real estate as a result of COVID?"

Thanks, John. So let me -- yes, first, let me talk about this year, which, to your point, I think this year, what we are seeing is there was certainly immediate or near-term disruption, both with our franchisees and in the construction industry, in a lot of those markets. And so that's why you're seeing -- why we are seeing, I'll say, reduced openings this year. That doesn't change our belief in the opportunity going forward, especially, I'd say, in Europe where I think there may be some independent restaurant units that are having some bigger challenges, which may present some further opportunities for us. 
So our expectation is that beginning next year, we go back to kind of where we thought we would have been for unit growth in 2021. And again, especially in Europe, we believe there's a lot of opportunity for growth. I mentioned in our script that China is continuing to grow. So we think that they'll still open about 400 units this year.
But Europe, which we have slowed down a little bit this year because of the near-term disruption, our expectation right now, and obviously that's all dependent on what happens with the pandemic going forward, but right now, our expectation is to get back to having significant unit growth in Europe. We do think there's a lot of opportunities in our key markets in Europe."

It also had a very positive benefit around productivity and margins. All of that was also very helpful as we navigated through the second quarter. 
As we come out of it, as I've said in prior times, I think it is a safe bet that you are going to see us add items back to the menu. I think it's also equally a safe bet that we're not going to go all the way back to where we were. And so how that evolution looks is going to vary market to market. In the U.S., I do know that there is innovation that is planned for later this year. That's going to bring some menu items on. And then what the U.S. operators have talked about with our team has been, let's just make sure every item that we add earns its way back on to the menu. And I think that mentality, that mindset is how, not just the U.S., but every market is sort of looking at it."

But I think overall, what you're talking about is accurate or certainly something that is worth paying attention to in Europe, which is in Europe, we do face a different competitive set. It tends to be, in many cases, smaller operators, bakeries, kind of places that are much more dependent on the walk-in business. Those competitors in countries like France and Germany are certainly under quite a bit of pressure. And we're seeing that right now from a variety of different media that we're hearing about some of the difficulty that exists in those markets. That does create for us an opportunity to take share because of our drive-thru business. 
I won't get into sort of the by-format details. But I would just say, in general, and Kevin laid it out in his opening remarks, when we have a drive-thru business, you do tend to see those businesses come back faster. Consumers are more in the habit of going to that restaurant, and then they see the dining rooms open, and that leads to a faster recovery on the dining room business. But now with basically almost all of our dining rooms open in Europe, even if you didn't have a drive-thru, we're seeing a nice recovery there. It's just not as fast as if you had a drive-thru that was allowing you to operate as well.

I do think China is probably more unique and, therefore, probably not a good proxy to think about for the other markets, start with the fact that in China, only about 15% of the restaurants there have drive-thru. And so for all the reasons that we've already been talking about, it's a different dynamic and a more challenging dynamic when you don't have a drive-thru business. So I think that's one big difference. 
I think also, you mentioned -- you've touched on, there has been kind of a variety of different government actions and I'd say sort of several different waves of the coronavirus. All of that, when you take it in combination with the fact that there have been other epidemics in China, I think all of that is weighing on the minds of the Chinese consumer and definitely making them more wary.
What you're seeing in China is you're seeing many of the kind of non-Western restaurants go to very aggressive value programs right now, trying to stimulate some demand in the market. And we do think that, that market is going to be more promotional, certainly through the balance of this year, again, as competitors are all trying to get some traffic stimulated there and encourage people to come out of the house. So long-winded way of saying, I think China, there's a number of factors that are going on in China that don't allow it to really be a good read-through to other markets. 
As to the U.S. and the difference between weekdays and weekends, certainly earlier in the pandemic, we were seeing a bigger hit on weekend. As we've now moved through that and getting to, I guess, I'd say more of a steady state in terms of where we're at, that disparity between the weekend and weekdays is evening out, and it's not as pronounced as it was earlier. Weekend still does provide a tougher comp, a tougher lap than the weekday. But again, the disparity that we saw between weekend and weekdays is leveling out."

Well, one of the things that we do is we do, every week, a tracking survey of consumers across most of our major markets. And I would say, one of the things that we have that definitely pops in that is concern, the anxiety that exists out there around the economy and consumers' belief that we are in a sort of recessionary type of dynamic. It's been interesting in many cases. And I think in our most recent poll that we did, you see economic concerns eclipse public health or public safety concerns.
And so as I look at all of that, I'm certainly not qualified to make any predictions around whether we're going to be in recession or not, but I'd certainly say there's a lot of warning signs out there that would suggest that the consumer sentiment and consumer concern about the economy is negative and going in the wrong direction. 
As we think about what that means for our business, and Kevin can talk more about this, but our business tends to be pretty resilient, whether it's through recessionary times or through times of growth. And so we feel well positioned during those types of periods. But I think you're touching on something that's important, which is, as you go into potentially a more recessionary type of environment in a number of major markets, having good affordability and making sure that, that is a key component of your marketing mix is really important. And that's a conversation that I know our leadership teams in markets around the world, including in the U.S., are having with our franchisees right now.
One of the things that we need to make sure is that coming out of Q2, and I think maybe some of the -- just the shock that sort of went through the system as the pandemic spread, we ended up, as I talked about, in terms of our reduction of marketing support, we went into more of a defensive posture. Now as we kind of go into a more normal or what we're kind of saying new normal, next normal, whatever the phrase you want to use, operating environment, it's time for us to get back on the front foot. That's why we have the marketing war chest, but it also means that we are going to need to be thinking about how affordability and value can play for all the reasons you were mentioning in your question."

Do we still feel good about that? And my answer is absolutely. In fact, if you look at some of the markets like Australia, for example, that have remained open, that have had dining rooms open, one of the interesting things is we're seeing kiosk usage in Australia is up by a meaningful amount. And so I think some of the things that we did with Experience of the Future and the order modifications or the new order channels like kiosk are playing right to this. 
Now certainly, what we're seeing overall, and Kevin mentioned this, is that dine-in, as a percent of our business, is a smaller amount today because of the growth of drive-thru. I think our view is, as you look out over a longer period of time, we do believe that dine-in is still going to be an important part of the mix. We're not going to be able to get to growing traffic without getting our dine-ins opened. So I think we're still going to see dine-ins as being an important part of the business. 
But in terms of enduring behavior, I think whether it's the use of kiosk, the use of mobile, the use of delivery, the use of drive-thru, certainly one of the things is that customers are looking for more of a contactless type of experience. They're looking for more of a digital type of experience, one that they can navigate on their own. I do think that, that behavior is going to be an enduring change, which is why I mentioned that the 3 Ds for us, delivery, drive-thru and digital, are going to be important strategic priorities for us for the foreseeable future, and we'll have more to share about that. 
In terms of org changes, I must admit I've not heard my coming in as being described as auspicious, but I'll take auspicious. So thank you for that. But for us, there have been certainly a lot of twists and turns in the COVID road. We are looking at what does all of this mean for the longer term. But I don't anticipate that there is going to be any major changes that we would do as a result. As all of you know, we went through a pretty significant G&A rationalization over the last several years, not just in the U.S., but globally. And I think that, that put us in a very good position for where we're at now. And when I look at spans and layers and all the typical things that you look at from a G&A perspective, I think we're in pretty good shape there. 
But there are going to be areas that we're going to need to think about, and I'll just highlight one. As we move to more virtual learning, how do we think about training and development? And what does that organization need to look like? What's going to be the balance of in-person training that we do versus training that might be done virtually? So there will be some things that we need to think about organizationally. But I would say that those are on the margins. I don't anticipate anything substantive for the broader group."

I think we have done a great job, and credit to franchisees across the globe, around grabbing the opportunity to improve how our restaurants are running. As we were mentioning earlier, we see customer satisfaction scores in, I think, 8 out of our top 11 markets are up and up by pretty significant amounts. I think all of that is credit to the operational modifications that we've made. But as we've now, I think, gotten those embedded, there is an opportunity for us to get aggressive in going after share. And that's the marketing war chest that I talked about earlier, but that's getting on the front foot on things like affordability.
And so that conversation does vary market by market, depending on what's going on. But I think the mentality for us now is that we have gotten the business to a good position. I think regardless of whether we enter a recession, don't enter a recession, whether we have a resurgence, we don't have a resurgence of the virus, all of those things are going to vary by country. Our mindset needs to be now pivoted strongly toward going after share because I think that's the opportunity that we have."

So we're not seeing either drive-thru take away from delivery or delivery take away from drive-thru. Both are growing significantly.

I'd say that, but I'd also say we do have some international markets where, again, they were closed for potentially a couple of months even at a time, and some individual franchisees would have taken on some heavy debt over the last several years between EOTF projects, potentially purchasing restaurants, et cetera. So there are individual organizations that I'd say are a little stretched, but it isn't the lack of access to capital. It's really just kind of working through their ratios."

As I reflect back to our first quarter earnings call, a short 90 days ago, I talked about uncertainty in the world amidst the COVID pandemic and our methodical approach to reopening, grounded in what's best for the safety of our customers and crew. 
During the second quarter, the dedication of the McDonald's System was on display as we worked together to safely reopen nearly all of McDonald's restaurants that had temporarily closed in late March, leading to continued improvement in our sales results. As of today, nearly all our restaurants globally are open for business. Almost all markets are operating with drive-thru and delivery, and many markets have also begun to reopen dining rooms. I want to say a huge thank you to franchisees, crew members, suppliers and company employees. Without their continued hard work and dedication, this would not have been possible. 
We have said that since the start of the pandemic that we entered from a position of strength. Over the last several years, our Velocity Growth Plan drove broad-based strength in markets around the world. More importantly, however, we believe McDonald's possesses several unique advantages that ensure our success is built to last. These advantages have been evident throughout the crisis. 
First is our iconic brand. McDonald's is one of the world's leading brands, and the trust customers have in McDonald's has proven to be a significant advantage during these uncertain times. Customers have been seeking known and familiar brands they can count on. And for our customers, while safety is a top concern, the need for value and convenience is also on the rise, playing to McDonald's historic strengths. 
Second, McDonald's is an execution machine. We know how to run great restaurants, and that operating prowess has been put to the ultimate test during the pandemic. Within a matter of weeks, the McDonald's System made operational modifications across 30,000 restaurants, while closing and then reopening another 9,000 restaurants. We introduced new safety procedures in all our restaurants, modified our menus and developed new contactless ways to serve our customers. 
Amidst all these changes, customer satisfaction actually improved across almost every major market, and the U.S. has hit new all-time highs for customer satisfaction. Drive-thru times have also improved across most major markets, averaging 15 to 20 seconds of improvement. 
And speaking of drive-thrus, our unmatched drive-thru penetration has allowed us to continue serving more customers in more markets than anyone else. Across our big 5 IOM markets, Australia, Canada, France, Germany and the U.K., about 70% of our restaurants offer drive-thru. And this safe and convenient service channel has been particularly appealing to our customers during the pandemic. We've seen significant increases in drive-thru sales in these markets during COVID. 
Finally, the strength of our system, our franchisees, employees and suppliers has been and always will be our secret sauce. Our 3-legged stool is committed to feeding and fostering the nearly 40,000 communities where we operate, and the pandemic has demonstrated our system's unwavering commitment. There have been countless examples of our system going above and beyond to be there for those communities who needed us most, from health care workers to truck drivers, to people working 3 shifts to make masks and respirators, we stayed open so they could keep going. 
Every franchisee comes from and is rooted in the local community. They take responsibility for building the local community, which is why our brand is strongest at the local level. Thanks to market and franchisee leadership, we are able to identify opportunities to be good neighbors in ways that are the most meaningful to customers, and this has been especially important in the last few months.
Our suppliers ensured that we had no breaks in supply for food, packaging, material, toys, equipment or other strategic categories globally. This is an incredible feat, given some of the significant challenges experienced in the past few months, and a testament to our strong supply chain teams, both globally and locally, and the partnership that they have with our suppliers. At the same time, in just a matter of weeks, our teams built a global supply chain for PPE virtually from scratch. 
Turning to our Q2 operating results. I'll provide a few headlines and observations, and then Kevin will provide more details, including key financials. In the U.S., virtually all restaurants remained open, and we saw results improve sequentially through the quarter. To ensure we kept our crew and customers safe while remaining open, we've changed nearly 50 operating procedures in accordance with guidance from state and local health experts. In Q2, we also ran a highly successful Thank You Meal program to recognize the extraordinary dedication and selflessness of first responders. 
In our International Operated Markets segment, when we last spoke, about 45% of our restaurants were open in some manner. Several of our largest markets, including the U.K., Spain, France and Italy, were completely closed for prolonged periods during the quarter. With a methodical approach, however, our teams have reopened restaurants across this segment and nearly all restaurants are now open to serve customers. We've seen strong pent-up customer demand, which is driving encouraging sequential sales improvement. 
Finally, our International Developmental Licensed segment experienced several challenges throughout the quarter. Our Latin America business was severely pressured due to the high incidence of coronavirus in several countries and has less developed drive-thru penetration. In China, after early signs suggesting a solid recovery, our pace of improvement has slowed as customers remain wary of social activities, and we now expect this more subdued pattern to continue into 2021. Worth noting that Japan had positive comp sales for the quarter, partly thanks to our brand's reputation for cleanliness and convenience with Japanese customers. 
As you can see, it remains a dynamic situation as the threat of COVID-19 continues to depress consumer sentiment, and the vagaries of the pandemic create an unpredictable operating environment. In many markets around the world, most notably in the U.S., the public health situation appears to be worsening. Nonetheless, I believe that Q2 represents the trough in our performance as McDonald's has learned to adjust our operations to this new environment. 
Regardless of the overall level of industry growth, I believe our markets and franchisees are well positioned to grow market share going forward. Three factors give me confidence. 
First, the financial health of our system is strong. As you know, we moved quickly to defer rent and royalties for franchisees, injecting nearly $1 billion of liquidity into our system at the outset of the pandemic. When necessary, we're providing timely, targeted and temporary assistance to franchisees needing additional support. Government programs such as the PPP program in the U.S. and the Chancellor's program in the U.K. also provided strong financial relief to our franchisees. And the menu and operational modifications we introduced have further supported franchisee P&L. Collectively, these actions have significantly reduced the adverse cash flow impact of COVID-19 on the average McDonald's restaurant. 
Second, we have amassed a sizable marketing war chest to invest in the back half of 2020. During Q2, most major markets significantly reduced their marketing spend and value activities. As an example, in the U.S., marketing spend was down 70% as we chose to conserve our resources until the situation stabilized. These funds will now be reinvested in Q3 and Q4. Additionally, as we previously announced, McDonald's will also invest an incremental $200 million in marketing spend across our U.S. and International Operated Markets in the second half to accelerate recovery, roughly equivalent to 1 additional month of media in every owned market. Together, these actions will result in a sizable increase in our marketing spend for the balance of the year. 
And third, our laser-like focus on what we call the 3 Ds: drive-thru, delivery and digital. Thanks to our strategic foresight, McDonald's is well developed in each of these channels, and we see opportunities to extend our 3-D advantage. You'll hear more about the 3 Ds in our strategic plans later in the year. 
Again, I want to thank our system for the extraordinary dedication and resilience they demonstrated in Q2. And to our customers, I want to thank you for your trust in McDonald's. We're ready to serve. 
I'll now turn it over to Kevin to talk in more detail about our second quarter results."
139488,673882582,2084987,"McDonald's Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2020",2020-07-28,"Earnings Calls","McDonald's Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Chris. I'll start by walking through our comp performance for the quarter and an early read on July, move on to some items on the P&L and then end with an update on our financial position. While this quarter was not without its challenges, we're",1665,"Thanks, Chris. I'll start by walking through our comp performance for the quarter and an early read on July, move on to some items on the P&L and then end with an update on our financial position. 
While this quarter was not without its challenges, we're encouraged by our global comp sales improvement throughout the quarter and into July. Comps improved sequentially throughout Q2 as markets reopened and restrictions were eased. Global comp sales were down 24% for the quarter and improved as we progressed through the quarter, with the month of June down 12%. We entered the quarter with about 75% of our restaurants open. And as Chris noted, today, nearly all have reopened to serve customers. 
While in June, we recovered nearly 90% of our 2019 sales, performance across the markets is varied and uneven, depending on external factors, such as government restrictions and consumer sentiment, given concerns of resurgence. For as long as the virus is present, this is the likely operating environment, especially as we also consider government assistance to consumers rolling off in many markets and general economic uncertainty. And we believe we're well positioned to navigate through it all. 
That said, some consistent themes have emerged. Comp sales continue to be heavily reliant on check growth from larger orders with guest counts negative. The number of drive-thrus impacts the market's pace of recovery. As Chris mentioned, our drive-thrus overall have proven to be a competitive advantage for us, and markets with a higher percentage of drive-thrus are showing quicker recovery. Markets with a higher concentration of city center and mall restaurants are seeing heavier impact from reduced foot traffic. And travel- or tourist-dependent locations are slower to recover as mobility remains suppressed. 
In looking at performance across the segments, the International Operated Markets segment experienced a sharp decline with more than half of the restaurants temporarily closed early in the quarter. Comp sales were down 41% for the quarter, improving to down 18% for the month of June, as key markets like France began reopening in May and the U.K. began reopening in June. Australia delivered positive comp sales for both May and June, bolstered by strong drive-thru and delivery performance. Australia has doubled its delivery sales mix to nearly 10% of sales, a trend we're seeing across several of our international markets. 
While we've seen a significant uptick in drive-thru as a percentage of total sales throughout the segment, a crucial step in our recovery is the reopening of dining rooms. Pre-COVID, nearly 70% of customer orders were in-restaurant across our larger markets. So closing the dining area or even limiting dine-in capacity has a substantial impact on results. 
Today, almost all restaurants and about 2/3 of the dining rooms have reopened in the segment, although many restaurants are still operating with restrictions, such as limited hours or channels based on local regulations. In July, comp sales in the IOM segment have continued to improve, although they remain negative in the high-single digits. 
Turning to the U.S. Comp sales for the quarter were down 8.7% and improved as we progressed through the quarter, with June down 2.3%. Breakfast continues to be disproportionately impacted by disruptions to commuting routines. And while weekend recovery is still lagging weekday recovery, the gap is narrowing. 
Throughout the pandemic, we benefited greatly from nearly all of our restaurants remaining open to serve customers, particularly with drive-thrus in nearly 95% of our locations. As customers shifted to a more contactless experience, drive-thru accounted for nearly 90% of our sales again this quarter. We also continue to see an uptick in delivery and digital transactions per restaurant. 
Mid-quarter, we began to reopen dining rooms in the U.S. with reduced seating capacity for customers who want to enjoy their food on-premise. In early July, we paused as we've seen resurgences across the country. And today, we have about 2,000 dining rooms open. Together with our franchisees, we're taking a thoughtful and responsible approach to determine the right time to reopen the remaining dining rooms. The U.S. has continued to see improving comp sales through July with comps turning slightly positive during the month. 
Comp sales in the International Developmental Licensed segment were down 24% for the quarter, with the months of May and June both down about 20%. As Chris mentioned, Latin America was the hardest-hit geography across the segment, while Japan delivered positive comp sales for the quarter. And in China, recovery has been somewhat uneven as consumers remain cautious on resuming pre-COVID routines, especially in light of resurgence concerns. Increased competitive activity and the fact that schools have been closed also are impacting the pace of recovery. 
In terms of new unit development, China has opened about 150 restaurants through June. We remain confident in new restaurant growth opportunities in China with a plan to open about 400 new restaurants this year. While we expect recovery to continue to be somewhat gradual and uneven for many markets around the globe in the near term, we're proud of our teams and the way we've responded to the pandemic. 
Moving to the P&L. As we become a more heavily franchised business over the last several years, our operating model is designed to tap into the entrepreneurial spirit of our local business owners and efficiently convert top line growth to the bottom line. Despite the challenging environment, McDonald's restaurants generated over $19 billion in systemwide sales for the quarter. Franchise margins represented about 90% of overall margin dollars and were a key component of operating income. 
There are a couple of P&L lines specifically impacted by COVID-19-related items. First, G&A increased $114 million or 22% in constant currencies for the quarter. As Chris mentioned, the company is making an incremental marketing contribution to the U.S. and IOM markets. The amount related to that contribution included in G&A for Q2 was about $160 million, which more than offset lower travel costs and lower incentive compensation accruals. 
Turning to the other operating income and expense section. Gains on restaurant sales for the full year are still expected to be down significantly versus last year as we anticipate a minimal amount of restaurant sale activity for the remainder of the year. Our equity in earnings of affiliates for the full year is projected to be down substantially. We recorded an additional $45 million for reserves for bad debt related to rent and royalty deferrals for Q2. 
And finally, in further supporting our franchisees, we made onetime payments of about $30 million to distribution centers for obsolete inventory. This was a result of the abrupt reduction in consumer demand and product mix shifts early in the pandemic. 
As I've mentioned before, the financial health of our system was an underlying strength of our business coming into the pandemic, and we've taken actions to preserve financial flexibility. As a reminder, we suspended our share repurchase program in early March. We also bolstered our financial position by securing $6.5 billion of new financing back in Q1. This enabled us to invest in the system in several ways. We provided nearly $1 billion of broad-based financial liquidity assistance to our franchisees, primarily in the form of rent and royalty deferrals. As a result, free cash flow was negative in the second quarter and positive for the first half of the year. Based on our current operating performance and our anticipated collection of a majority of the deferrals in Q3 and Q4, we still expect free cash flow to be positive for the remainder of the year. 
Further building on the broad-based liquidity support, we're also assessing the financial health of specific at-risk franchisee and developmental licensee organizations. We're using an objective framework for decision-making, and we expect that only a small percent of organizations will require further assistance. The financial health and strength of our franchisees has been a competitive advantage for McDonald's for years, and we expect that to continue. Finally, as we've mentioned, we invested in incremental marketing across the U.S. and IOM markets to further accelerate recovery and drive growth. 
In terms of capital expenditures, we took a very practical approach to development activity during the onset of the pandemic by pausing most project work. As many franchisees are willing and able to invest and some work has resumed, our expected capital spend for 2020 is now about $1.6 billion versus the original $2.4 billion. About half of the $1.6 billion will be dedicated to the U.S. business, including completing roughly 900 EOTF projects. Additionally, we now plan to open about 950 gross and 350 net new restaurants this year. The U.S. is accelerating some restaurant closings previously planned for future years. Of the 200 U.S. closures for this year, over half are low-volume restaurants in Walmart store locations. 
Consistent with enhancing financial flexibility and our franchising strategy, we're planning to divest a portion of our stake in McDonald's Japan. As a result of the strong performance of the McDonald's Japan business over the past few years and our confidence in the local management team, we believe it's the right time to gradually reduce our ownership stake in the market. This will take some time because of the low trading volume of McDonald's Japan shares. As a reminder, we currently own about 49% of the business, and we will retain at least 35% ownership. This decision provides us with additional financial flexibility to execute our capital allocation strategy while also demonstrating our commitment to our Japanese business. 
Regarding uses of cash, our top priorities remain the same: first, investing in the business for growth; and second, prioritizing dividends to our shareholders. After that, we'll look to reduce debt in the near term to lower our elevated leverage ratios. We will continue to manage and utilize our funds in a judicious manner that focuses on ensuring the company is able to grow the business, our franchisees remain financially strong and our shareholders are duly rewarded. 
Now I'll turn it back to Chris."

And on the breakfast point, certainly, as we've talked about on prior calls, breakfast has been one of the more challenged daypart due to coronavirus. You mentioned and you alluded to the fact that we have had challenges in breakfast over a longer period of time. I think there's been a couple of areas there that have driven that. Certainly, one has been the much more increased level of competitive activity that we've seen in breakfast. Breakfast, as you know, prior to the pandemic, was the only daypart that was growing. And so as a result, there were a lot of new competitors that were flooding into the breakfast daypart. That certainly was one area of pressure for us. 
And then I would also just honestly say some of it was around focus. And we were not as focused as we were rolling out other things like hot off the grill. The other dayparts for us took on more time and energy and investment. And so as we emerge out of this, I think part of it is certainly going to be a rededication from a marketing and investment standpoint to go after breakfast. I think our ability through the drive-thrus right now to be fast at breakfast is certainly an advantage that we're looking for going forward. 
And then we will have innovation in breakfast as well. If you look at how we've performed through the pandemic, even though breakfast is certainly in the U.S. still the most challenged daypart, we're actually growing our breakfast share. And so while it is a drag from an overall standpoint, we're gaining share at breakfast, and I know the U.S. operators and Joe are hopeful to continue that trend.

I'll talk about July primarily since it's our most recent information. We talked about Australia being positive, and I'll give a quick round of the big 5 markets, if you will. Australia, we talked about being positive in May and June. They continue to be positive in July. Now remember, Australia was one of the few markets around the world, in addition to Canada and U.S., that remained open through all this. So they've got a little different profile certainly than the European markets. 
Canada, I'd say, is relatively similar to how the U.S. is behaving, meaning that they are just turning slightly positive in July. And again, remember, they remained open. So I'd use the U.S. kind of profile as a proxy for Canada. 
Europe, that is obviously a little different, France, Germany and the U.K. France and the U.K. were completely closed, remember, so they're a little slower to return. I mentioned that France began reopening in May. U.K. began reopening in June. U.K. is just beginning to reopen dining rooms. So you've got those different dynamics going on in the European markets. 
If I look at those 3 markets in total, they're roughly, I'll call them, negative high single digits to low double digits. So that overall, when you look at those 5 markets in July, we're running probably high -- I'm sorry, mid-negative single digits for that group of 5 in July. 
As far as the factors that are impacting those, a couple of things. I think one is the fact that several of those markets, as I mentioned, were fully closed. So it just -- while there's an immediate rush back and we all see the lines at the drive-thru, et cetera, the reality is after a week or a couple of weeks and things settle down, it does take a little bit of time to kind of build up and get back to more closer to normal, I'll say. 
Dining rooms is a big thing. As I mentioned in my script, going into COVID, about 70% of our orders were in-restaurant. And so I think in order to fully get certainly guest counts back, it will be getting the dining rooms open in all of those markets. 
And then the other thing that goes on in some of those European markets is specific locations, whether that's travel centers or tourist locations. Some countries, certainly the Frances, Spains, Italys, are more dependent on tourism, and so you see some of those markets being impacted more than others."

And so that's why you're seeing -- why we are seeing, I'll say, reduced openings this year. That doesn't change our belief in the opportunity going forward, especially, I'd say, in Europe where I think there may be some independent restaurant units that are having some bigger challenges, which may present some further opportunities for us. 
So our expectation is that beginning next year, we go back to kind of where we thought we would have been for unit growth in 2021. And again, especially in Europe, we believe there's a lot of opportunity for growth. I mentioned in our script that China is continuing to grow. So we think that they'll still open about 400 units this year.
But Europe, which we have slowed down a little bit this year because of the near-term disruption, our expectation right now, and obviously that's all dependent on what happens with the pandemic going forward, but right now, our expectation is to get back to having significant unit growth in Europe.

I think it's also equally a safe bet that we're not going to go all the way back to where we were. And so how that evolution looks is going to vary market to market.

But I think overall, what you're talking about is accurate or certainly something that is worth paying attention to in Europe, which is in Europe, we do face a different competitive set. It tends to be, in many cases, smaller operators, bakeries, kind of places that are much more dependent on the walk-in business. Those competitors in countries like France and Germany are certainly under quite a bit of pressure. And we're seeing that right now from a variety of different media that we're hearing about some of the difficulty that exists in those markets. That does create for us an opportunity to take share because of our drive-thru business. 
I won't get into sort of the by-format details. But I would just say, in general, and Kevin laid it out in his opening remarks, when we have a drive-thru business, you do tend to see those businesses come back faster. Consumers are more in the habit of going to that restaurant, and then they see the dining rooms open, and that leads to a faster recovery on the dining room business. But now with basically almost all of our dining rooms open in Europe, even if you didn't have a drive-thru, we're seeing a nice recovery there.

And so for all the reasons that we've already been talking about, it's a different dynamic and a more challenging dynamic when you don't have a drive-thru business. So I think that's one big difference. 
I think also, you mentioned -- you've touched on, there has been kind of a variety of different government actions and I'd say sort of several different waves of the coronavirus. All of that, when you take it in combination with the fact that there have been other epidemics in China, I think all of that is weighing on the minds of the Chinese consumer and definitely making them more wary.
What you're seeing in China is you're seeing many of the kind of non-Western restaurants go to very aggressive value programs right now, trying to stimulate some demand in the market. And we do think that, that market is going to be more promotional, certainly through the balance of this year, again, as competitors are all trying to get some traffic stimulated there and encourage people to come out of the house. So long-winded way of saying, I think China, there's a number of factors that are going on in China that don't allow it to really be a good read-through to other markets. 
As to the U.S. and the difference between weekdays and weekends, certainly earlier in the pandemic, we were seeing a bigger hit on weekend. As we've now moved through that and getting to, I guess, I'd say more of a steady state in terms of where we're at, that disparity between the weekend and weekdays is evening out, and it's not as pronounced as it was earlier. Weekend still does provide a tougher comp, a tougher lap than the weekday. But again, the disparity that we saw between weekend and weekdays is leveling out."

And so all of that we're seeing average checks going up, call it, I don't know, 30% increase in average check in the U.S. 
And in terms of what that looks like going forward, we are starting to see it rebalance to what you would imagine are more normal or sustaining levels, meaning that traffic is improving. As traffic is improving, you're seeing check come down in terms of its contribution to growth. But still, we are in a negative traffic environment. And it is being driven largely by check, but just the trajectory of it is starting to look a little bit more as you would expect."

Well, one of the things that we do is we do, every week, a tracking survey of consumers across most of our major markets. And I would say, one of the things that we have that definitely pops in that is concern, the anxiety that exists out there around the economy and consumers' belief that we are in a sort of recessionary type of dynamic. It's been interesting in many cases. And I think in our most recent poll that we did, you see economic concerns eclipse public health or public safety concerns.
And so as I look at all of that, I'm certainly not qualified to make any predictions around whether we're going to be in recession or not, but I'd certainly say there's a lot of warning signs out there that would suggest that the consumer sentiment and consumer concern about the economy is negative and going in the wrong direction. 
As we think about what that means for our business, and Kevin can talk more about this, but our business tends to be pretty resilient, whether it's through recessionary times or through times of growth. And so we feel well positioned during those types of periods. But I think you're touching on something that's important, which is, as you go into potentially a more recessionary type of environment in a number of major markets, having good affordability and making sure that, that is a key component of your marketing mix is really important. And that's a conversation that I know our leadership teams in markets around the world, including in the U.S., are having with our franchisees right now.
One of the things that we need to make sure is that coming out of Q2, and I think maybe some of the -- just the shock that sort of went through the system as the pandemic spread, we ended up, as I talked about, in terms of our reduction of marketing support, we went into more of a defensive posture. Now as we kind of go into a more normal or what we're kind of saying new normal, next normal, whatever the phrase you want to use, operating environment, it's time for us to get back on the front foot. That's why we have the marketing war chest, but it also means that we are going to need to be thinking about how affordability and value can play for all the reasons you were mentioning in your question."

And I was curious as what behaviors that you think will come back to normal to 2019, for example. And if any of that is basically leading you to reconsider the way that some of your dining rooms are going to be used, in other words, separating the temporary change from consumer behavior using dining rooms and sitting next to each other, what have you, to more permanent ones. 
And the second part of the question is from an organizational perspective. Chris, I mean, you -- obviously, you've got the head seat at McDonald's at a very auspicious time with such a major disruptive event coming shortly after you took the job. Where are you in terms of thinking about the right organizational structure from an efficiency and effectiveness point of view of the overall McDonald's organization as we look forward?"

On the dine-in, I'm very happy that -- and I mentioned this, I think, on our last earnings call, that we are almost completely through our EOTF remodel program. I think that has positioned us very well for the future. Certainly, one of the questions that I get from franchisees is, hey, we spent on the dining rooms as we went into the pandemic. Do we still feel good about that? And my answer is absolutely. In fact, if you look at some of the markets like Australia, for example, that have remained open, that have had dining rooms open, one of the interesting things is we're seeing kiosk usage in Australia is up by a meaningful amount. And so I think some of the things that we did with Experience of the Future and the order modifications or the new order channels like kiosk are playing right to this. 
Now certainly, what we're seeing overall, and Kevin mentioned this, is that dine-in, as a percent of our business, is a smaller amount today because of the growth of drive-thru. I think our view is, as you look out over a longer period of time, we do believe that dine-in is still going to be an important part of the mix. We're not going to be able to get to growing traffic without getting our dine-ins opened. So I think we're still going to see dine-ins as being an important part of the business. 
But in terms of enduring behavior, I think whether it's the use of kiosk, the use of mobile, the use of delivery, the use of drive-thru, certainly one of the things is that customers are looking for more of a contactless type of experience. They're looking for more of a digital type of experience, one that they can navigate on their own. I do think that, that behavior is going to be an enduring change, which is why I mentioned that the 3 Ds for us, delivery, drive-thru and digital, are going to be important strategic priorities for us for the foreseeable future, and we'll have more to share about that. 
In terms of org changes, I must admit I've not heard my coming in as being described as auspicious, but I'll take auspicious. So thank you for that. But for us, there have been certainly a lot of twists and turns in the COVID road. We are looking at what does all of this mean for the longer term. But I don't anticipate that there is going to be any major changes that we would do as a result. As all of you know, we went through a pretty significant G&A rationalization over the last several years, not just in the U.S., but globally. And I think that, that put us in a very good position for where we're at now. And when I look at spans and layers and all the typical things that you look at from a G&A perspective, I think we're in pretty good shape there. 
But there are going to be areas that we're going to need to think about, and I'll just highlight one. As we move to more virtual learning, how do we think about training and development? And what does that organization need to look like? What's going to be the balance of in-person training that we do versus training that might be done virtually? So there will be some things that we need to think about organizationally. But I would say that those are on the margins. I don't anticipate anything substantive for the broader group."

I think we have done a great job, and credit to franchisees across the globe, around grabbing the opportunity to improve how our restaurants are running. As we were mentioning earlier, we see customer satisfaction scores in, I think, 8 out of our top 11 markets are up and up by pretty significant amounts. I think all of that is credit to the operational modifications that we've made. But as we've now, I think, gotten those embedded, there is an opportunity for us to get aggressive in going after share. And that's the marketing war chest that I talked about earlier, but that's getting on the front foot on things like affordability.
And so that conversation does vary market by market, depending on what's going on. But I think the mentality for us now is that we have gotten the business to a good position. I think regardless of whether we enter a recession, don't enter a recession, whether we have a resurgence, we don't have a resurgence of the virus, all of those things are going to vary by country. Our mindset needs to be now pivoted strongly toward going after share because I think that's the opportunity that we have."

So we're not seeing either drive-thru take away from delivery or delivery take away from drive-thru. Both are growing significantly.

I'd say that, but I'd also say we do have some international markets where, again, they were closed for potentially a couple of months even at a time, and some individual franchisees would have taken on some heavy debt over the last several years between EOTF projects, potentially purchasing restaurants, et cetera. So there are individual organizations that I'd say are a little stretched, but it isn't the lack of access to capital. It's really just kind of working through their ratios."

Since March, we've reminded everyone that we entered the pandemic from a position of strength with unique advantages that help ensure our success is built to last. This has only become more evident as we look at t",1899,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Since March, we've reminded everyone that we entered the pandemic from a position of strength with unique advantages that help ensure our success is built to last. This has only become more evident as we look at the significant progress our markets around the world made in the third quarter. 
Global comparable sales improved sequentially from Q2 and throughout Q3, with sales down 2.2%, including month-over-month improvement across all segments. Our success comes from leveraging our competitive advantages: the trust our customers have in our brand; our operational strength, including our significant drive-thru presence and delivery capabilities; and the unwavering commitment across our system, all grounded in an intense focus on the safety of our customers and crew. 
We're pleased with our recovery to date, but we also understand there inevitably will be more starts and stops with virus resurgences. We're already seeing this in many markets in all parts of the world. 
As a reminder, we started the third quarter with nearly all of our global restaurants open for business, and they remain open today. However, with the resurgences I mentioned, there are numerous instances of government restrictions on operating hours, limited dining capacity in most countries, and in some cases, mandated dining room closures. 
Around the world, comp sales continue to be driven by check growth from larger orders. This is particularly true with our drive-thru business, which continues to be one of our biggest areas of strength. In most markets, our drive-thru sales percentage peaked during the second quarter and remains elevated when compared to historical norms. This safe and convenient service channel has been especially appealing to customers during the pandemic. Similarly, delivery sales have also increased meaningfully across substantially all of our major markets. 
We provided an update on our third quarter comp sales in early October. I'd like to take time now to walk through some of the details for the quarter followed by a look at October sales trends. 
Starting with the U.S. Comparable sales were up 4.6% with positive comps in each month of the quarter, including low double digits in September, marking our highest monthly comp in nearly a decade. Sales comps were also positive across all dayparts for the month of September with continued strength at dinner. 
As we mentioned on our Q2 call, we had a sizable marketing war chest to invest in the back half of 2020 to further accelerate recovery. The U.S. began to leverage this marketing investment in a big way to launch our famous orders platform during a pivotal time when consumers were looking for reasons to eat out again. The platform was launched with 2 multicultural brand advocates: first, the Travis Scott meal in September and building on that success, our second with J. Balvin, and there are more to come. The success of this platform demonstrates how powerful it can be when our brand, digital engagement and affordability are all working together. 
The U.S. also introduced a twist on a familiar favorite, the Chicken McNuggets. For the first time since the debut of the Chicken McNuggets in 1983, we built on the success seen in many other markets around the world by introducing a spicy flavor profile to a core menu item, all while keeping it simple in our kitchens. 
And at the end of October, we introduced a new McCafé bakery line to our menu. Customers can enjoy an apple fritter, blueberry muffin or a cinnamon roll for breakfast or an afternoon snack with our McCafé coffee. 
As a reminder, virtually all restaurants in the U.S. have remained open throughout the pandemic. And today, we have about 2,000 dining rooms open. Together with our franchisees, we're taking a thoughtful and responsible approach to determine the right time to reopen the remaining dining rooms. 
Moving to our International Operated Markets segment. Comp sales were down 4.4% in Q3, with significant improvement over our Q2 comps of negative 41%. Performance varied across markets as negative comp sales in France, Spain, Germany and the U.K. were partially offset by positive comp sales in Australia. Despite restricted operating conditions due to a virus resurgence in the State of Victoria, strong drive-thru and delivery sales drove roughly 3/4 of Australia sales, and they grew market share. Australia has also seen an increase in other digital channels such as our mobile app and self-order kiosks as customers use contactless ways to order and pay. Comp sales were positive across all major dayparts for the quarter. 
In Canada, while comp sales were negative for the quarter, we generated momentum and grew market share as nearly all restaurants reopened in the market. Breakfast recovery continues to lag with positive comps across dinner, evening and late night. And delivery sales have nearly doubled compared to last year. 
In the IOM segment, the European markets were impacted the most by the initial wave of the pandemic earlier this year. The U.K., France, Italy and Spain had all restaurants closed for a period of time. And other markets like Germany and Russia were operating with restricted operating hours and limited channels. While all markets were open heading into the third quarter, performance was mixed. And we continue to see slower recovery in city centers and other areas that are heavily reliant on tourism in markets like Spain and Italy. 
Looking at the U.K. Sales improved throughout the quarter, and comp sales turned positive in August. The U.K. has been one of our strongest delivery markets for the last couple of years, and that was a key performance driver for the third quarter. We accelerated rollout with a new delivery partner Just Eat and complemented it with a marketing activation plan. Over the past several months, our delivery sales percentage has increased in the U.K. from high single digits to mid-teens. 
In France and Germany, both markets outperformed broader QSR and gained market share, although sales trends remain negative. In comparison to other markets, France and Germany are more heavily reliant on dine-in sales, with about 70% of their sales from in-restaurant purchases pre-COVID. France is also heavily dependent on travel and tourism, which, as I mentioned, has been suppressed throughout the pandemic. 
And finally, comp sales in the International Developmental License segment were down 10.1%. Comps sequentially improved month-over-month for the quarter, with September down just over 5%. Latin America remained the most challenged geography in this segment due to high incidences of COVID in several countries and its less developed drive-thru penetration. 
Japan once again delivered strong positive comp sales for the quarter. The market captured heightened demand by growing delivery as well as running successful promotions and value offerings. 
And in China, we renewed our focus on driving our core menu, along with increasing delivery sales and digital memberships. These efforts led to improved results for the quarter, although we still expect recovery to take some time as consumer confidence has been slow to return. 
In terms of new unit development, China has opened over 300 new restaurants through September. We remain confident in restaurant growth opportunities in China, with a plan to open over 400 new restaurants this year. 
Turning to October. In the U.S., sales comps were strong, up mid-single digits with growth across all dayparts. IOM comp sales remained in the negative low single digits. Australia and the U.K. both delivered strong comp sales, while France, Spain and Italy weighed on the segment. We expect performance will continue to vary across the IOM markets, given the recent increase in local restrictions in most markets. 
As I've mentioned before, we expect these starts and stops to be the likely operating environment for as long as the virus is present. Given the safety measures we've put in place and the operational changes we've made to adjust to this new environment, we believe we're well positioned to successfully navigate through it. 
Moving to the P&L. Adjusted earnings per share of $2.22 grew 4% in constant currencies for the quarter after excluding gains on the sale of about 3% of our ownership in McDonald's Japan. A lower effective tax rate and lower G&A compared to last year contributed to the EPS growth. Foreign currency translation also benefited results by $0.03 per share. While restaurant margin dollars were down 2% in constant currencies, that's a significant recovery compared to second quarter when restaurant margin dollars were down nearly 40% over last year. As the U.S. business returned to positive comps in the quarter, we also grew both franchised and company-owned restaurant margin dollars in the U.S., which benefited from higher gross profit. 
G&A decreased 3% in constant currencies for the quarter primarily driven by lower incentive compensation accruals and lower travel costs, while we continue to invest in strategic technology initiatives. When looking at the cadence of our G&A spend over the past few years, we've historically spent about 30% of our full year G&A in the fourth quarter. We expect the Q4 G&A percentage this year to be slightly higher than that, given some onetime investments we're making in renewed brand communications and in actions we're taking to have an even greater impact with our purpose to feed and foster community. 
Turning to other operating income and expense. Gains on restaurant sales for the full year are still expected to be down significantly versus last year, with minimal restaurant sales expected for the fourth quarter. Our equity and earnings of affiliates for the full year is projected to be down substantially. 
And finally, as a reminder, we provided nearly $1 billion of short-term liquidity deferrals to franchisees at the onset of the pandemic. We've now collected roughly half of the deferrals and expect that we'll collect most of the remaining balance over the fourth quarter of 2020 and first quarter of 2021. As a result, in the third quarter, we reduced $27 million of our bad debt reserve related to rent and royalty deferrals. We expect our full year effective tax rate to be about 23%, resulting in a fourth quarter tax rate of about 25%. 
Capital expenditures for 2020 are still expected to be around $1.6 billion as we plan to open about 950 gross and 300 net new restaurants by year-end. About half of the $1.6 billion is dedicated to the U.S. business, and we remain on track to complete roughly 900 EOTF projects this year. 
In October, our Board of Directors approved a 3% dividend increase to the equivalent of $5.16 annually. This marked over 40 consecutive years of increasing our dividend for shareholders and further reinforces our confidence in the company's long-term strategy. We will continue to manage and utilize our funds in a judicious manner that focuses on ensuring we grow our business, our franchisees remain financially strong and our shareholders are duly rewarded. 
Our Velocity Growth Plan served us well over the past few years and gave us confidence in our ability to successfully navigate through this crisis. As our customers' needs have evolved, so too have elements of our path forward. We'll continue to further draw on our solid foundation unique advantages and core equities to meet the needs of today while building towards a better tomorrow. 
We look forward to sharing the evolution of our growth strategy later this morning at our virtual investor update. Now I'll turn it back to Mike for a few closing comments."

139488,690347415,2134767,"McDonald's Corporation, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Nov 09, 2020",2020-11-09,"Earnings Calls","McDonald's Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Since March, we've reminded everyone that we entered the pandemic from a position of strength with unique advantages that help ensure our success is built to last. This has only become more evident as we look at t",1900,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Since March, we've reminded everyone that we entered the pandemic from a position of strength with unique advantages that help ensure our success is built to last. This has only become more evident as we look at the significant progress our markets around the world made in the third quarter. Global comparable sales improved sequentially from Q2 and throughout Q3, with sales down 2.2%, including month-over-month improvement across all segments. 
Our success comes from leveraging our competitive advantages: the trust our customers have in our brand; our operational strength, including our significant drive-thru presence and delivery capabilities; and the unwavering commitment across our system, all grounded in an intense focus on the safety of our customers and crew. We're pleased with our recovery to date, but we also understand there inevitably will be more starts and stops with virus resurgences. We're already seeing this in many markets in all parts of the world. 
As a reminder, we started the third quarter with nearly all of our global restaurants open for business, and they remain open today. However, with the resurgences I mentioned, there are numerous instances of government restrictions on operating hours, limited dining capacity in most countries and in some cases, mandated dining room closures. 
Around the world, comp sales continue to be driven by check growth from larger orders. This is particularly true with our drive-thru business, which continues to be one of our biggest areas of strength. In most markets, our drive-thru sales percentage peaked during the second quarter and remains elevated when compared to historical norms. This safe and convenient service channel has been especially appealing to customers during the pandemic. Similarly, delivery sales have also increased meaningfully across substantially all of our major markets. 
We provided an update on our third quarter comp sales in early October. I'd like to take time now to walk through some of the details for the quarter followed by a look at October sales trends. 
Starting with the U.S. Comparable sales were up 4.6% with positive comps in each month of the quarter, including low double digits in September, marking our highest monthly comp in nearly a decade. Sales comps were also positive across all dayparts for the month of September with continued strength at dinner. 
As we mentioned on our Q2 call, we had a sizable marketing war chest to invest in the back half of 2020 to further accelerate recovery. The U.S. began to leverage this marketing investment in a big way to launch our famous orders platform during a pivotal time when consumers were looking for reasons to eat out again. The platform was launched with 2 multicultural brand advocates: first, the Travis Scott meal in September; and building on that success, our second with J Balvin. And there are more to come. The success of this platform demonstrates how powerful it can be when our brand, digital engagement and affordability are all working together. 
The U.S. also introduced a twist on a familiar favorite, the Chicken McNuggets. For the first time since the debut of the Chicken McNuggets in 1983, we built on the success seen in many other markets around the world by introducing a spicy flavor profile to a core menu item, all while keeping it simple in our kitchens. And at the end of October, we introduced a new McCafé bakery line to our menu. Customers can enjoy an apple fritter, blueberry muffin or a cinnamon roll for breakfast or an afternoon snack with our McCafé coffee. 
As a reminder, virtually all restaurants in the U.S. have remained open throughout the pandemic. And today, we have about 2,000 dining rooms open. Together with our franchisees, we're taking a thoughtful and responsible approach to determine the right time to reopen the remaining dining rooms. 
Moving to our International Operated Markets segment. Comp sales were down 4.4% in Q3, with significant improvement over our Q2 comps of negative 41%. Performance varied across markets as negative comp sales in France, Spain, Germany and the U.K. were partially offset by positive comp sales in Australia. 
Despite restricted operating conditions due to a virus resurgence in the state of Victoria, strong drive-thru and delivery sales drove roughly 3/4 of Australia sales, and they grew market share. Australia has also seen an increase in other digital channels such as our mobile app and self-order kiosks as customers use contactless ways to order and pay. Comp sales were positive across all major dayparts for the quarter. 
In Canada, while comp sales were negative for the quarter, we generated momentum and grew market share as nearly all restaurants reopened in the market. Breakfast recovery continues to lag with positive comps across dinner, evening and late night. And delivery sales have nearly doubled compared to last year.
