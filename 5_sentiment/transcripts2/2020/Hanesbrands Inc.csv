HanesBrands delivered a solid fourth quarter with record cash flow overall results were once again, right in line with our guidance and demonstrate that our multiyear strategy to improve our business is working. Key highlights in the quart",1039,"Thank you, T.C. HanesBrands delivered a solid fourth quarter with record cash flow overall results were once again, right in line with our guidance and demonstrate that our multiyear strategy to improve our business is working. Key highlights in the quarter include operating cash flow that exceeded the high-end of our guidance for both the quarter and the full year. We delivered on our commitment to bring our leverage back within our target range. We saw continued strong performances in international, consumer-direct and Champion. And adjusted gross margin improved 130 basis points over prior year, driven by increases in both our U.S. Innerwear and U.S. Activewear segments. And U.S. Innerwear's operating profit and operating margin increased over prior year, with both metrics exceeding our guidance in the quarter despite lower-than-expected revenue. We believe this is an indication that U.S. Innerwear's profit has begun to stabilize. 
In addition to U.S. Innerwear's fourth quarter profit performance, we saw 2 additional developments that point to improving revenue and profit trends in 2020. First, our intimates business improved sequentially and was in line with our expectation for the quarter. The strong performance was driven by our Bra business, which increased over the prior year, as our revitalization efforts and product innovations, such as Easy Lift and Dreamwire continued to gain traction. And second, while early store resets by a major retailer had a short-term impact on basic sales in the quarter. We're pleased with the longer-term potential this reset holds for our business. Within these [indiscernible] that have been reset, we're gaining shelf space, and we're gaining market share. Once completed, we believe this reset should have a positive impact on our basics business beginning in the second half of this year. 
Over the past several years, we have executed a strategy to diversify our business and position the company for increased earnings growth and shareholder returns. To accomplish this, we set 5 specific goals, and we've delivered on each, as highlighted by our fourth quarter and full year results. 
First, we have diversified our revenue. International revenue now accounts for 36% of sales, up from 11% in 2013. Consumer-direct revenue, which represented 30% of fourth quarter sales and 25% of full year sales is up from 9% in 2013. And on a constant currency basis, global Champion excluding C9, generated more than $1.9 billion of revenue in 2019, an increase of more than $1.1 billion in just 3 years. 
Second, we've consistently delivered organic revenue growth. The fourth quarter marked our tenth consecutive quarter of constant currency growth. And we accomplished this despite challenges in our U.S. business that included a muted holiday and a $46 million headwind from exited programs. 
Third, we position the business for higher levels of profitability over the next several years by exiting unprofitable businesses and restructuring our supply chain to lower cost. We believe our supply chain restructuring initiatives have positioned U.S. Innerwear and the company for improving margins over the next 2 years. We also believe this represents an important milestone for U.S. Innerwear as it remains a critical driver of our strong cash flow. 
Fourth, we are generating higher levels of operating cash flow. In 2019, operating cash flow increased 25% over prior year to more than $800 million. This is approximately $200 million higher than our cash flow from just 3 years ago. 
And fifth, we have reduced our net debt by more than $1.1 billion in less than 2 years. We ended the year at 2.9x levered on a net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA basis, which is a full turn lower than our peak. Now that we're back within our long-term range of 2 to 3x, our priority for 2020 is to use our excess free cash to buy back stock. The focus of our entire organization for the past several years has been on strengthening our business to return to a model that is able to magnify sales growth into faster operating profit growth and ultimately even faster EPS growth. With a lot of heavy lifting done, and our program exits behind us, we believe 2020 represents an inflection point for our company. One that reveals the underlying strength of our ongoing business and unleashes the full potential of our capital allocation model to drive accelerated shareholder returns. 
Turning to our 2020 guidance. Through the remainder of my remarks and for comparison purposes, I'll be referencing our rebased 2019 results, which adjust for the exits of C9 at Target and our DKNY intimates license. This will provide a clearer view of the underlying trends within our business. Using the midpoint, our 2020 guidance implies approximately 3% revenue growth. This is driven by strong performances in international, consumer-direct and Champion. And while we continue to plan conservatively with respect to our U.S. Innerwear business, we expect improved revenue trends in 2020 in both basics and intimates. Our guidance for U.S. Innerwear assumes revenue growth ranging from down 1% to up 1% for the full year. And for the total company, we expect adjusted operating profit growth of 7% as our investment spending normalizes and cost savings from our supply chain restructuring flow through, particularly within our U.S. Innerwear segment, where we expect operating profit to be up over prior year. With lower interest expense and lower share count, we expect adjusted earnings per share growth to accelerate to 15%. Embedded in our guidance is $200 million of share repurchases, and we expect to generate between $700 million and $800 million of operating cash flow. 
So in closing, we delivered solid performances for the quarter and the full year. And as our 2020 outlook suggests, we believe we've reached an inflection point in our business model. With our exited programs behind us and all of our capital allocation tools at our disposal, we believe we are well positioned for accelerating earnings growth and shareholder returns over the next several years. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Scott Lewis, our Chief Accounting Officer, who is serving as interim Chief Financial Officer. Scott has held leading roles in our strong global finance organization since the company went public and is providing us with a seamless leadership transition to support our goals and strategies.

Before I discuss our fourth quarter results, I want to highlight a supplemental document on our IR website that reflects revisions to our prior period results. These revisions primarily relate to adjustments to our income tax balances. The revisions had a minor cumulative earnings per share impact of $0.01 over the 3-year period from 2017 to 2019. Additional information can be found in our FAQ document as well as in our 10-K. 
Now let me discuss the quarter. Overall, we reported solid fourth quarter results. Revenue, adjusted operating profit and earnings per share were in line with our guidance, while cash flow from operations exceeded the high end of our range. For the quarter, sales were $1.75 billion. On a constant currency basis, sales increased slightly over prior year. results reflect $46 million expected headwinds in our Activewear segment from the exit of commodity programs in the mass channel as well as the planned wind down of C9 at Target. Adjusted gross margin increased 130 basis points over last year to 41.4%, driven by higher margins in both our Innerwear and Activewear segments. Adjusted operating profit in the quarter was $263 million and included $3 million of currency headwinds as compared to last year. Our adjusted operating margin of 15% increased approximately 40 basis points over prior year, as our strong gross margin performance more than offset higher distribution costs and an unexpected bad debt charge of $3 million related to our retailer bankruptcy in Australia. Both adjusted and GAAP earnings per share were $0.51, an increase over prior year of 13% and 24%, respectively. 
In the quarter, we generated $559 million in cash flow from operations, an increase of $57 million compared to prior year. For the full year, we generated a record $803 million in cash flow from operations. With respect to the balance sheet, as compared to last year, we reduced our inventory balance by more than $150 million, and we paid down over $600 million of debt. Our leverage at the end of the quarter was 2.9x on a net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA basis. This is down 1 full turn from our peak in the first quarter of 2018 and bring us back within our target range of 2x to 3x. 
With that summary, let me take you through our fourth quarter segment performance. As compared to last year, U.S. Innerwear sales declined 4%. However, operating profit increased 5% as our operating margin expanded 210 basis points to 24.6%. As operating profit and margin exceeded our forecast in the quarter as a benefit from earlier price increases and lower distribution expenses more than offset higher commodity cost and lower unit volume. For the quarter, basics revenue declined 5% due to the impact from door closings and an earlier-than-planned disruption from store resets at a large mass retailer. While these resets are causing short-term fluctuations, we believe, once completed, this should have a positive impact on our basics business beginning in the second half of this year. 
And with respect to our intimates business, as expected, our trends improved sequentially, driven by our Bra business. For the quarter, Bra revenue increased slightly, and operating margins improved nearly 300 basis points over last year. As our revitalization efforts and new product innovations gain traction. 
Turning to our U.S. Activewear segment. Sales declined nearly 7% over last year and were slightly better than our forecast. The segment's results reflect the $46 million of expected year-over-year headwinds I referenced earlier. As compared to prior year, Champion Activewear sales, excluding C9, increased 14%. C9 revenue declined 26% or $26 million and sales in the remainder of our Activewear segment declined approximately $30 million, which was better than our forecast. Activewear's operating margin of 15.8% declined 30 basis points over prior year. Activewear's gross margin increased in the quarter, driven by the benefits of our remixing activity, including a higher mix of Champion sales. This was more than offset by higher SG&A expense, including higher distribution costs. 
In our International segment, revenue increased nearly 7% and was above our forecast, driven by stronger-than-expected results in both our Activewear and Innerwear businesses. On a constant currency basis, international sales increased 10% or $60 million over prior year, with mid-single-digit growth in Innerwear and 22% growth in Champion. International's operating margin of 14.9% declined 130 basis points over last year as the benefits from higher sales were more than offset by short-term FX transaction cost pressures as well as the $3 million Australia bad debt expense I referenced earlier. 
Touching briefly on our global Champion business. Excluding C9, constant currency sales increased 22% over last year and were in line with our expectation. This consisted of 22% growth in both our domestic and international Champion businesses. 
And now turning to guidance, to present a more representative comparison of our ongoing business between 2020 and 2019, we provided a supplemental table on our IR website. This table provides a rebased financial information for 2019 that adjust for the excess of C9 at Target and the DKNY Intimate license. 
During my guidance discussion, all year-over-year comparisons will reference our rebased 2019 results. I'll also point you to our press release and FAQ document for additional guidance details. However, I would like to share a few thoughts to frame our 2020 outlook. We expect solid growth with enhanced profitability, even though the first quarter is expected to see difficult comparisons. With a strong balance sheet, our capital allocation strategy is expected to drive accelerating earnings per share growth, and we've identified additional cost reduction actions to those we've begun last year that should generate further profit improvement in 2021 and beyond. Our 2020 guidance demonstrates accelerating growth rates as you move down the P&L. At the midpoint, our full year guidance implies revenue growth that's approaching 3%, and adjusted operating profit growth approximately 7%. With expected benefits from lower interest expense and $200 million of share repurchases planned early in the year, we expect adjusted earnings per share growth of approximately 15%. We  expect to generate $700 million to $800 million in cash flow from operations. Absent any additional capital allocation initiatives this year, we expect our leverage to decline to 2.7x by year-end. With respect to our restructuring and other actions, we expect approximately $50 million of charges in 2020. Approximately $10 million of these charges are costs related to the exits of C9 and the DKNY license. Approximately $10 million related to our 2019 supply chain restructuring, which were previously planned. The remainder of the charges are focused on additional actions to further reduce cost, primarily with our supply chain. In isolation, we expect these additional restructuring actions to deliver approximately $40 million of incremental profit, but $30 million coming in 2021 and remaining $10 million coming in 2022. 
Touching on the first quarter. We expect muted revenue and operating profit growth due to transitory and timing issues in the international and U.S. Innerwear segments. Within U.S. Innerwear, we're facing headwinds from a large sock shipment in last year's first quarter as we displaced a competitor at a large value retailer. We also expect continued short-term disruption in our basics business from the previously discussed store reset at a large mass retailer. International constant currency revenue growth is expected to slow to 2% in the quarter before returning to mid-single-digit growth in the second quarter due to the timing of the Asia expansion this year compared to last year. And International's first quarter operating profit is expected to decline due to the increased investments to support our Asia expansion as well as short-term FX transactional cost pressures. 
For the rest of the year, we expect revenue and operating profit growth as we benefit from the continued momentum in our intimates business, the completion of store resets in the mass channel, expanded distribution in Asia, cost savings from our supply chain restructuring and price increases in certain international markets to offset the cost pressures from foreign exchange rates. 
So in closing, we delivered solid results for both the quarter and full year, we delivered on a number of initiatives to improve our business model, and as our outlook suggests, we believe we've reached an inflection point now that our program exits are behind us, and we've brought back our leverage within our targeted range. We believe the combination of our strength and business model, our strong balance sheet and all of our capital allocation tools position us for accelerating earnings growth and total shareholder returns in 2020 and beyond. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to T.C."

Our record cash flow and double-digit EPS growth, and our in-line guidance really speaks to what we've been doing to improve our business model. We really do look to 2020 as a an inflection point for this business. And an important part of that is the underlying strength of our ongoing businesses. And then part of that is innerwear. And we did see improvement from a profitability standpoint, certainly, at the end of of 2019. As we look to 2020, we do expect the revenue to improve as we work through the store resets in the large retailer. The large retailers started to reset at the end of last year, in 2019, a little earlier than we had expected. and as you see with resets or sell-off of exited SKUs and businesses and so forth that can create some short-term interruption. But what we do see and what we like is our space is expanding and with that space expansion. We're seeing our share expand. So the balance of the chain resets through the first part of 2020. And but we expect, as we get past that, that as we get to the second half, we'll pick up the tail end of that on our innerwear business and the benefit we saw from share expansion in their initial reset along with the improving trends we're seeing out of our intimates business, on the revenue side, we expect to also then pick up the additional restructure cost restructure benefits that we implemented in 2019 to flow through the second half. So we really do expect a stabilization of of our revenue line as we work through the balance of 2020, and we expect the operating profit to be up. And so we're very encouraged by that, and that's an important punctuation on our strong cash flow as well when we see our profit growing within Innerwear."

It's in the rebates numbers that we looked at on the basics or the innerwear side of things. It was approximately $42 million of sales. It was in innerwear basics. We have recovered the vast majority of that, but it's a bit masked in the rebase numbers because as we plan for 2020, we also assumed there would be the impact of door closures of about $35 million to $40 million. So they offset in the numbers, but I think you should take that we have planned conservatively on the innerwear side. And as we begin to hear about door closures in other places. We have those covered in our guidance as we look towards 2020. So we feel we've appropriately planned the innerwear business from the standpoint of being conservative yet and know the phasing of that business as we also see the revenue and profitability ramp throughout the year. So we feel good about that business and where it's positioned and appropriately planned from a conservative standpoint. From the Asia, Champion, just kind of how the year may be unfolds for growth. Yes, from the Champion business, first of all, let me just say, last year, Champion had another -- we finished really well in the fourth quarter. Champion was up 22% in the fourth quarter again, and it was 22% domestically and 22% internationally. And just to give you a sense of how big that business has become, it's about $460 million globally in the quarter, and it finished up 40% for the year. So as we look at to 2020, we expect to surpass the $2 billion mark. We expect to do another year of double-digit growth for Champion. We are overlapping some very large comps in the first part of the year. So we planned a mid- to high single-digit growth rate for Champion in the first half of the year and a double-digit growth in the second half of the year, low double-digit growth in the second half of the year. So we're continuing to be very bullish on Champion, and its ability to continue to grow. We've seen strong POS. We saw strong POS through the holiday periods around the world as well, and we are well on our way as, obviously, to reach our $2 billion goal in 2020, 2 years early, and we believe we can add the next $1 billion in the next 4 to 5 years."

Just curious if you could let us know how that impacts your multiyear view of Innerwear, how tied to those 125 doors you are? Just anything there over the next 3 years would be helpful as well."

Let me start with the C9 part of the question, C9 has continued to perform well right through the balance of 2019 really exceeded our expectations through the balance of 2019. And it's clear to us that there's a strong consumer base out there that's very loyal to that brand. We are in the final stages of discussions with a new partner, and we expect to launch that program, an initial program in the second half of this year. Relatively small to start with. And as you noted, it is in our guidance at this point in time. But it has the potential to ramp nicely over time as we get the program going. So we'll provide some more specifics on that in the coming months, but we're very pleased to have the opportunity to keep that brand in the market and satisfy those consumers. From the standpoint of the department store information. The vast majority of the business we do in Macy's is it  on macys.com and then their largest stores, and that's where all of our really growth comes from in that account. As noted in the announcement, the stores targeted for closures are a small part of their total business. And while the closure list has not yet been fully communicated, we believe the doors targeted for closure do not represent a material part of our business. In regards to 2020, as I noted in my earlier comments, we had planned the possibility of additional door closures in the market, and we feel that we have the initial 30 covered in our guidance. And as the list develops, we'll continue to assess that. But we feel we've got it covered in our guidance for 2020. I think once again, it reinforces what we've been focused on for a while is the consumer's choice of where they shop and their shopping habits continue to evolve, and we've been focusing over the last few years on diversifying our revenue base and where we sell and particularly developing our consumer direct piece of the business, which is, as we noted in our comments, was 25% of our business in the last year. And so macy's.com is part of that as well as pure plays and as well as our own site. So we'll continue to diversify where we sell to meet the shifting needs of the consumer. So we feel good about where we have Innerwear going and that will continue. And Innerwear is one of our fastest-growing consumer direct businesses."

We  [indiscernible] good improvement in our cash cycle days. We feel this takes us to a new level and reinforces our ability to generate cash flows. Our operating cash flows in '19, we accomplished that through strong GAAP net income and working capital management. And as you think about the 2020 cash flow levels, our guidance is the $700 million to $800 million. You can arrive at that in a couple of ways. And 1 way is looking at our 2020 GAAP net income, the midpoint is around $585 million if you add back our noncash items like depreciation and amortization and stock compensation, which is typically around $180 million to $190 million. You may right in the midpoint within that guidance range. Another way of thinking about it is, if you look our 2019 cash flow level of $803 million. Our 2020 GAAP net income is at the midpoint. It's around $20 million lower than '19, as we talked about the program exits. And just using the same working capital assumption that we had in '19, which is actually flat of that year. We -- you're right within that guidance range again. So we thought this is a prudent way of looking at cash flows in 2020. And it's like, again, we're in a really good position to drive strong cash flows in 2020 and beyond, and this is helping with strong returns. And again, like Joe mentioned earlier, this gives us opportunities to continue to delever for share repurchases and really drive shareholder returns."

We've generally seen that pricing in the market is settled out around it and so forth. What we're seeing now, though, is as the pricing continues to lap itself, the peak of the commodities is passed, and we're actually seeing margin improvement as the commodity costs begin to ramp down and the pricing overlaps that. So we're seeing that. And as we look to Innerwear in the second half of 2020, we get the added benefit of the supply chain restructurings that we had executed in 2019, we'll work there off the balance sheet and give us added improvement in our operating margins and profit within Innerwear, in particular, from the standpoint of the international bad debt, that was a bankruptcy in Australia, and we would expect that to be an individual event, not something that's ongoing there."

HanesBrands delivered a solid fourth quarter with record cash flow. Overall results were once again right in line with our guidance and demonstrate that our multiyear strategy to improve our business is working. Key highlights in the qua",1040,"Thank you, T.C. 
HanesBrands delivered a solid fourth quarter with record cash flow. Overall results were once again right in line with our guidance and demonstrate that our multiyear strategy to improve our business is working. Key highlights in the quarter include operating cash flow that exceeded the high end of our guidance for both the quarter and the full year. We delivered on our commitment to bring our leverage back within our target range. We saw continued strong performances in International, consumer-direct and Champion. And adjusted gross margin improved 130 basis points over prior year, driven by increases in both our U.S. Innerwear and U.S. Activewear segments. And U.S. Innerwear's operating profit and operating margin increased over prior year, with both metrics exceeding our guidance in the quarter despite lower-than-expected revenue. We believe this is an indication that U.S. Innerwear's profit has begun to stabilize. 
In addition to U.S. Innerwear's fourth quarter profit performance, we saw 2 additional developments that point to improving revenue and profit trends in 2020. First, our intimates business improved sequentially and was in line with our expectation for the quarter. The strong performance was driven by our bra business, which increased over the prior year, as our revitalization efforts and product innovations, such as EasyLight and Dream Wire, continued to gain traction. 
And second, while early store resets by a major retailer had a short-term impact on basic sales in the quarter, we're pleased with the longer-term potential this reset holds for our business. Within the stores that have been reset, we're gaining shelf space and we're gaining market share. Once completed, we believe this reset should have a positive impact on our basics business beginning in the second half of this year. 
Over the past several years, we have executed a strategy to diversify our business and position the company for increased earnings growth and shareholder returns. To accomplish this, we set 5 specific goals, and we've delivered on each, as highlighted by our fourth quarter and full year results. 
First, we have diversified our revenue. International revenue now accounts for 36% of sales, up from 11% in 2013. Consumer-direct revenue, which represented 30% of fourth quarter sales and 25% of full year sales, is up from 9% in 2013. And on a constant currency basis, global Champion, excluding C9, generated more than $1.9 billion of revenue in 2019, an increase of more than $1.1 billion in just 3 years. 
Second, we've consistently delivered organic revenue growth. The fourth quarter marked our tenth consecutive quarter of constant currency growth. And we accomplished this despite challenges in our U.S. business that included a muted holiday and a $46 million headwind from exited programs. 
Third, we position the business for higher levels of profitability over the next several years by exiting unprofitable businesses and restructuring our supply chain to lower cost. We believe our supply chain restructuring initiatives have positioned U.S. Innerwear and the company for improving margins over the next 2 years. We also believe this represents an important milestone for U.S. Innerwear as it remains a critical driver of our strong cash flow. 
Fourth, we are generating higher levels of operating cash flow. In 2019, operating cash flow increased 25% over prior year to more than $800 million. This is approximately $200 million higher than our cash flow from just 3 years ago. 
And fifth, we have reduced our net debt by more than $1.1 billion in less than 2 years. We ended the year at 2.9x levered on a net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA basis which is a full turn lower than our peak. Now that we're back within our long-term range of 2 to 3x, our priority for 2020 is to use our excess free cash to buy back stock. 
The focus of our entire organization for the past several years has been on strengthening our business to return to a model that is able to magnify sales growth into faster operating profit growth and ultimately even faster EPS growth. With a lot of heavy lifting done and our program exits behind us, we believe 2020 represents an inflection point for our company, one that reveals the underlying strength of our ongoing business and unleashes the full potential of our capital allocation model to drive accelerated shareholder returns. 
Turning to our 2020 guidance. Through the remainder of my remarks and for comparison purposes, I'll be referencing our rebased 2019 results which adjust for the exits of C9 at Target and our DKNY intimates license. This will provide a clearer view of the underlying trends within our business. Using the midpoint, our 2020 guidance implies approximately 3% revenue growth. This is driven by strong performances in International, consumer-direct and Champion. 
And while we continue to plan conservatively with respect to our U.S. Innerwear business, we expect improved revenue trends in 2020 in both basics and intimates. Our guidance for U.S. Innerwear assumes revenue growth ranging from down 1% to up 1% for the full year. 
And for the total company, we expect adjusted operating profit growth of 7% as our investment spending normalizes and cost savings from our supply chain restructuring flow through, particularly within our U.S. Innerwear segment, where we expect operating profit to be up over prior year. 
With lower interest expense and lower share count, we expect adjusted earnings per share growth to accelerate to 15%. Embedded in our guidance is $200 million of share repurchases, and we expect to generate between $700 million and $800 million of operating cash flow. 
So in closing, we delivered solid performances for the quarter and the full year. And as our 2020 outlook suggests, we believe we've reached an inflection point in our business model. With our exited programs behind us and all of our capital allocation tools at our disposal, we believe we are well positioned for accelerating earnings growth and shareholder returns over the next several years. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Scott Lewis, our Chief Accounting Officer, who is serving as Interim Chief Financial Officer. Scott has held leading roles in our strong global finance organization since the company went public and is providing us with a seamless leadership transition to support our goals and strategies.

Before I discuss our fourth quarter results, I want to highlight a supplemental document on our IR website that reflects revisions to our prior period results.

Before I discuss our fourth quarter results, I want to highlight a supplemental document on our IR website that reflects revisions to our prior period results. These revisions primarily relate to adjustments to our income tax balances. The revisions had a minor cumulative earnings per share impact of $0.01 over the 3-year period from 2017 to 2019. Additional information can be found in our FAQ document as well as in our 10-K.
Now let me discuss the quarter. Overall, we reported solid fourth quarter results. Revenue, adjusted operating profit and earnings per share were in line with our guidance, while cash flow from operations exceeded the high end of our range. 
For the quarter, sales were $1.75 billion. On a constant currency basis, sales increased slightly over prior year. I'll note that our results reflect $46 million expected headwinds in our Activewear segment from the exit of commodity programs in the mass channel as well as the planned wind down of C9 at Target. 
Adjusted gross margin increased 130 basis points over last year to 41.4%, driven by higher margins in both our Innerwear and Activewear segments. Adjusted operating profit in the quarter was $263 million and included $3 million of currency headwinds as compared to last year. Our adjusted operating margin of 15% increased approximately 40 basis points over prior year as our strong gross margin performance more than offset higher distribution costs and an unexpected bad debt charge of $3 million related to a retailer bankruptcy in Australia. Both adjusted and GAAP earnings per share were $0.51, an increase of -- over prior year of 13% and 24%, respectively. 
In the quarter, we generated $559 million in cash flow from operations, an increase of $57 million compared to prior year. For the full year, we generated a record $803 million in cash flow from operations. 
With respect to the balance sheet, as compared to last year, we reduced our inventory balance by more than $150 million, and we paid down over $600 million of debt. Our leverage at the end of the quarter was 2.9x on a net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA basis. This is down 1 full turn from our peak in the first quarter of 2018 and brings us back within our target range of 2x to 3x. 
With that summary, let me take you through our fourth quarter segment performance. As compared to last year, U.S. Innerwear sales declined 4%. However, operating profit increased 5% as our operating margin expanded 210 basis points to 24.6%. The operating profit and margin exceeded our forecast in the quarter as it benefits from earlier price increases and lower distribution expenses, more than offset higher commodity cost and lower unit volume. 
For the quarter, basics revenue declined 5% due to the impact from door closings and an earlier-than-planned disruption from store resets at a large mass retailer. While these resets are causing short-term fluctuations, we believe, once completed, this should have a positive impact on our basics business beginning in the second half of this year. 
And with respect to our intimates business, as expected, our trends improved sequentially, driven by our bra business. For the quarter, bra revenue increased slightly and operating margins improved nearly 300 basis points over last year as our revitalization efforts and new product innovations gain traction. 
Turning to our U.S. Activewear segment. Sales declined nearly 7% over last year and were slightly better than our forecast. The segment's results reflect the $46 million of expected year-over-year headwinds I referenced earlier. As compared to prior year, Champion Activewear sales, excluding C9, increased 14%. C9 revenue declined 26% or $26 million and sales in the remainder of our Activewear segment declined approximately $30 million, which was better than our forecast. 
Activewear's operating margin of 15.8% declined 30 basis points over prior year. Activewear's gross margin increased in the quarter, driven by the benefits of our remixing activity, including a higher mix of Champion sales. This was more than offset by higher SG&A expense, including higher distribution cost. 
In our International segment, revenue increased nearly 7% and was above our forecast, driven by stronger-than-expected results in both our Activewear and Innerwear businesses. On a constant currency basis, international sales increased 10% or $60 million over prior year, with mid-single-digit growth in Innerwear and 22% growth in Champion. International's operating margin of 14.9% declined 130 basis points over last year as the benefits from higher sales were more than offset by short-term FX transaction cost pressures as well as the $3 million Australia bad debt expense I referenced earlier. 
Touching briefly on our global Champion business. Excluding C9, constant currency sales increased 22% over last year and were in line with our expectation. This consisted of 22% growth in both our domestic and international Champion businesses. 
And now turning to guidance. To present a more representative comparison of our ongoing business between 2020 and 2019, we provided a supplemental table on our IR website. This table provides rebased financial information for 2019 that adjusts for the exits of C9 at Target and the DKNY intimates license. During my guidance discussion, all year-over-year comparisons will reference our rebased 2019 results. I'll also point you to our press release and FAQ document for additional guidance details. However, I will like to share a few thoughts to frame our 2020 outlook. 
We expect solid growth with enhanced profitability even though the first quarter is expected to see difficult comparisons. With a strong balance sheet, our capital allocation strategy is expected to drive accelerating earnings per share growth, and we've identified additional cost-reduction actions to those we've begun last year that should generate further profit improvement in 2021 and beyond. 
Our 2020 guidance demonstrates accelerating growth rates as you move down the P&L. At the midpoint, our full year guidance implies revenue growth that's approaching 3% and adjusted operating profit growth approximately 7%. With expected benefits from lower interest expense and $200 million of share repurchases planned early in the year, we expect adjusted earnings per share growth of approximately 15%. We expect to generate $700 million to $800 million in cash flow from operations. Absent any additional capital allocation initiatives this year, we expect our leverage to decline to 2.7x by year-end. 
With respect to our restructuring and other actions, we expect approximately $50 million of charges in 2020. Approximately $10 million of these charges are costs related to the exits of C9 and the DKNY license. Approximately $10 million relate to our 2019 supply chain restructuring which were previously planned. The remainder of the charges are focused on additional actions to further reduce cost, primarily within our supply chain. In isolation, we expect these additional restructuring actions to deliver approximately $40 million of incremental profit, but $30 million coming in 2021 and the remaining $10 million coming in 2022. 
Touching on the first quarter. We expect muted revenue and operating profit growth due to transitory and timing issues in the international and U.S. Innerwear segments. Within U.S. Innerwear, we're facing headwinds from a large sock shipment in last year's first quarter as we displaced a competitor at a large value retailer. We also expect continued short-term disruption in our basics business from the previously discussed store reset at a large mass retailer. 
International constant currency revenue growth is expected to slow to 2% in the quarter before returning to mid-single-digit growth in the second quarter due to the timing of the Asia expansion this year compared to last year. And International's first quarter operating profit is expected to decline due to the increased investments to support our Asia expansion as well as short-term FX transactional cost pressures. 
For the rest of the year, we expect revenue and operating profit growth as we benefit from the continued momentum in our intimates business, the completion of store resets in the mass channel, expanded distribution in Asia, cost savings from our supply chain restructuring and price increases in certain international markets to offset the cost pressures from foreign exchange rates. 
So in closing, we delivered solid results for both the quarter and full year. We delivered on a number of initiatives to improve our business model. And as our outlook suggests, we believe we've reached an inflection point now that our program exits are behind us and we've brought back our leverage within our targeted range. We believe the combination of our strengthened business model, our strong balance sheet and all of our capital allocation tools position us for accelerating earnings growth and total shareholder returns in 2020 and beyond. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to T.C."

Our record cash flow and double-digit EPS growth, and our in-line guidance really speak to what we've been doing to improve our business model. We really do look to 2020 as a an inflection point for this business. And an important part of that is the underlying strength of our ongoing businesses. 
And then part of that is innerwear. And we did see improvement from a profitability standpoint certainly at the end of 2019. As we look to 2020, we do expect the revenue to improve as we work through the store resets in the large retailer. The large retailer's started the reset at the end of last year, in 2019, a little earlier than we had expected. And as you see with resets, there's sell-off of exited SKUs and businesses and so forth that can create some short-term interruption. But what we do see and what we like is our space is expanding. And with that space expansion, we're seeing our share expand. 
So the balance of the chain resets through the first part of 2020. But we expect, as we get past that, that as we get to the second half, we'll pick up the tailwind of that on our Innerwear business and the benefit we saw from share expansion in their initial reset, along with the improving trends we're seeing out of our intimates business. On the revenue side, we expect to also then pick up the additional restructure -- cost restructure benefits that we implemented in 2019 to flow through the second half. 
So we really do expect a stabilization of our revenue line as we work through the balance of 2020, and we expect our operating profit to be up. And so we're very encouraged by that, and that's an important punctuation on our strong cash flow as well when we see our profit growing within Innerwear."

We discovered the issue as we were preparing our year-end financial statements this year. And the issue revolves around or relates to the tax treatment of intercompany inventory transactions and ultimately impacted our prior period tax balances. Now when we identified this, we've -- we had -- we quantified it and we've revised prior period financial statements to correct for these errors. And we also addressed it for other immaterial out-of-period items at the same time.

But I think you should take solace in knowing that we have planned conservatively on the Innerwear side. And as we begin to hear about door closures in other places, we have those covered in our guidance as we look toward 2020. So we feel we've appropriately planned the Innerwear business from the standpoint of being conservative, yet -- and know the phasing of that business as we also see the revenue and profitability ramp throughout the year. So we feel good about that business and where it's positioned and appropriately planned from a conservative standpoint.

So as we look at to 2020, we expect to surpass the $2 billion mark. We expect to do another year of double-digit growth for Champion. We are overlapping some very large comps in the first part of the year. So we've planned a mid- to high single-digit growth rate for Champion in the first half of the year and a double-digit growth in the second half of the year -- low double-digit growth in the second half of the year. 
So we're continuing to be very bullish on Champion and its ability to continue to grow. We're seeing strong POS, we saw strong POS through the holiday periods around the world as well. And we are well on our way, obviously, to reach our $2 billion goal in 2020 2 years early. And we believe we can add the next $1 billion in the next 4 to 5 years."

C9 has continued to perform well right through the balance of 2019, really, exceeded our expectations through the balance of 2019. And it's clear to us that there's a strong consumer base out there that's very loyal to that brand. We are in the final stages of discussions with a new partner, and we expect to launch that program, an initial program, in the second half of this year. 
Relatively small to start with. And as you noted, it is in our guidance at this point in time. But it has the potential to ramp nicely over time as we get the program going. So we'll provide some more specifics on that in the coming months, but we're very pleased to have the opportunity to keep that brand in the market and satisfy those consumers. 
From the standpoint of the department store information. The vast majority of the business we do in Macy's is at -- on macys.com and in their largest stores. And that's where all of our, really, growth comes from in that account. As noted in the announcement, the stores targeted for closures are a small part of their total business. And while the closure list has not yet been fully communicated, we believe the doors targeted for closure do not represent a material part of our business. 
In regards to 2020, as I noted in my earlier comments, we had planned the possibility of additional door closures in the market, and we feel that we have the initial 30 covered in our guidance. And as the list develops, we'll continue to assess that. But we feel we've got it covered in our guidance for 2020. 
I think, once again, it reinforces what we've been focused on for a while, is the consumer's choice of where they shop and their shopping habits continue to evolve. And we've been focusing over the last few years on diversifying our revenue base and where we sell, and particularly developing our consumer-direct piece of the business, which is -- as we noted in our comments, was 25% of our business in the last year. And so macys.com is part of that as well as pure plays and as well as our own site. So we'll continue to diversify where we sell to meet the shifting needs of the consumer. 
So we feel good about where we have Innerwear going and that will continue. And Innerwear is one of our fastest-growing consumer-direct businesses."

So we expect both the Activewear and Innerwear elements of our Champion business to grow. 
We -- as we've said before, we've been very successful in the men's business. We still have room to grow as we develop a greater share in the women's business as well as the kids business, and outerwear represents a new category for us as well. So we see multiple areas that we can continue to expand the business as well as continue to grow, of course, where we have distribution today.

The team did a fantastic job this year. We had a good improvement in our cash cycle days. We feel this takes us to a new level from a -- and reinforces our ability to generate cash flows. Our operating cash flows in '19, we accomplished that through strong GAAP net income and working capital management.
And as you think about the 2020 cash flow levels, our guidance is the $700 million to $800 million, you can arrive at that in a couple of ways. And one way is looking at our 2020 GAAP net income, the midpoint is around $585 million. If you add back our noncash items like depreciation and amortization and stock compensation, which is typically around $180 million to $190 million, you land right in the midpoint within that guidance range. 
Another way of thinking about it is if you look our 2019 cash flow level of $803 million. Our 2020 GAAP net income is at the midpoint, it's around $20 million lower than '19 as we talked about the program exits. And just using the same working capital assumption that we had in '19, which is actually flat of that year. We -- you arrive right within that guidance range again. 
So we thought this was a prudent way of looking at cash flows in 2020. And we felt like, again, we're in a really good position to drive strong cash flows in 2020 and beyond, and this is helping with strong returns. And again, like Gerald mentioned earlier, this gives us opportunities to continue to delever for share repurchases and really drive shareholder return."

From the pricing question, we implemented our pricing in Innerwear really last February, so February of 2019. You may recall at the time, we were pricing because commodities had peaked ahead of that pricing and we put that pricing in place. So it's been in place a long time. We've generally seen that the pricing in the market has settled out around it and so forth. 
What we're seeing now, though, is as the pricing continues to lap itself, the peak of the commodities is past, and we're actually seeing margin improvement as the commodity costs begin to ramp down and the pricing overlaps that. So we're seeing that now. 
As we look to Innerwear in the second half of 2020, we get the added benefit of the supply chain restructurings that we had executed in 2019 will work their way off the balance sheet and give us added improvement in our operating margins and profit within Innerwear, in particular. 
From the standpoint of the international bad debt, that was a bankruptcy in Australia. And we would expect that to be an individual event, not something that's ongoing there."

HanesBrands delivered a solid fourth quarter with record cash flow. Overall results were once again right in line with our guidance and demonstrate that our multiyear strategy to improve our business is working. Key highlights in the quarter include operating cash flow that exceeded the high end of our guidance for both the quarter and the full year. We delivered on our commitment to bring our leverage back within our target range. We saw continued strong performances in International, consumer-direct and Champion. And adjusted gross margin improved 130 basis points over prior year, driven by increases in both our U.S. Innerwear and U.S. Activewear segments. And U.S. Innerwear's operating profit and operating margin increased over prior year, with both metrics exceeding our guidance in the quarter despite lower-than-expected revenue. We believe this is an indication that U.S. Innerwear's profit has begun to stabilize. 
In addition to U.S. Innerwear's fourth quarter profit performance, we saw 2 additional developments that point to improving revenue and profit trends in 2020. First, our intimates business improved sequentially and was in line with our expectation for the quarter. The strong performance was driven by our bra business, which increased over the prior year, as our revitalization efforts and product innovations, such as EasyLight and Dream Wire, continued to gain traction. 
And second, while early store resets by a major retailer had a short-term impact on basic sales in the quarter, we're pleased with the longer-term potential this reset holds for our business. Within the stores that have been reset, we're gaining shelf space and we're gaining market share. Once completed, we believe this reset should have a positive impact on our basics business beginning in the second half of this year. 
Over the past several years, we have executed a strategy to diversify our business and position the company for increased earnings growth and shareholder returns. To accomplish this, we set 5 specific goals, and we've delivered on each, as highlighted by our fourth quarter and full year results. 
First, we have diversified our revenue. International revenue now accounts for 36% of sales, up from 11% in 2013. Consumer-direct revenue, which represented 30% of fourth quarter sales and 25% of full year sales, is up from 9% in 2013. And on a constant currency basis, global Champion, excluding C9, generated more than $1.9 billion of revenue in 2019, an increase of more than $1.1 billion in just 3 years. 
Second, we've consistently delivered organic revenue growth. The fourth quarter marked our tenth consecutive quarter of constant currency growth. And we accomplished this despite challenges in our U.S. business that included a muted holiday and a $46 million headwind from exited programs. 
Third, we position the business for higher levels of profitability over the next several years by exiting unprofitable businesses and restructuring our supply chain to lower cost. We believe our supply chain restructuring initiatives have positioned U.S. Innerwear and the company for improving margins over the next 2 years. We also believe this represents an important milestone for U.S. Innerwear as it remains a critical driver of our strong cash flow. 
Fourth, we are generating higher levels of operating cash flow. In 2019, operating cash flow increased 25% over prior year to more than $800 million. This is approximately $200 million higher than our cash flow from just 3 years ago. 
And fifth, we have reduced our net debt by more than $1.1 billion in less than 2 years. We ended the year at 2.9x levered on a net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA basis which is a full turn lower than our peak. Now that we're back within our long-term range of 2 to 3x, our priority for 2020 is to use our excess free cash to buy back stock. 
The focus of our entire organization for the past several years has been on strengthening our business to return to a model that is able to magnify sales growth into faster operating profit growth and ultimately even faster EPS growth. With a lot of heavy lifting done and our program exits behind us, we believe 2020 represents an inflection point for our company, one that reveals the underlying strength of our ongoing business and unleashes the full potential of our capital allocation model to drive accelerated shareholder returns. 
Turning to our 2020 guidance. Through the remainder of my remarks and for comparison purposes, I'll be referencing our rebased 2019 results which adjust for the exits of C9 at Target and our DKNY intimates license. This will provide a clearer view of the underlying trends within our business. Using the midpoint, our 2020 guidance implies approximately 3% revenue growth. This is driven by strong performances in International, consumer-direct and Champion. 
And while we continue to plan conservatively with respect to our U.S. Innerwear business, we expect improved revenue trends in 2020 in both basics and intimates. Our guidance for U.S. Innerwear assumes revenue growth ranging from down 1% to up 1% for the full year. 
And for the total company, we expect adjusted operating profit growth of 7% as our investment spending normalizes and cost savings from our supply chain restructuring flow through, particularly within our U.S. Innerwear segment, where we expect operating profit to be up over prior year. 
With lower interest expense and lower share count, we expect adjusted earnings per share growth to accelerate to 15%. Embedded in our guidance is $200 million of share repurchases, and we expect to generate between $700 million and $800 million of operating cash flow. 
So in closing, we delivered solid performances for the quarter and the full year. And as our 2020 outlook suggests, we believe we've reached an inflection point in our business model. With our exited programs behind us and all of our capital allocation tools at our disposal, we believe we are well positioned for accelerating earnings growth and shareholder returns over the next several years. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Scott Lewis, our Chief Accounting Officer, who is serving as Interim Chief Financial Officer. Scott has held leading roles in our strong global finance organization since the company went public and is providing us with a seamless leadership transition to support our goals and strategies.

Before I discuss our fourth quarter results, I want to highlight a supplemental document on our IR website that reflects revisions to our prior period results. These revisions primarily relate to adjustments to our income tax balances. The revisions had a minor cumulative earnings per share impact of $0.01 over the 3-year period from 2017 to 2019. Additional information can be found in our FAQ document as well as in our 10-K.
Now let me discuss the quarter. Overall, we reported solid fourth quarter results. Revenue, adjusted operating profit and earnings per share were in line with our guidance, while cash flow from operations exceeded the high end of our range. 
For the quarter, sales were $1.75 billion. On a constant currency basis, sales increased slightly over prior year. I'll note that our results reflect $46 million expected headwinds in our Activewear segment from the exit of commodity programs in the mass channel as well as the planned wind down of C9 at Target. 
Adjusted gross margin increased 130 basis points over last year to 41.4%, driven by higher margins in both our Innerwear and Activewear segments. Adjusted operating profit in the quarter was $263 million and included $3 million of currency headwinds as compared to last year. Our adjusted operating margin of 15% increased approximately 40 basis points over prior year as our strong gross margin performance more than offset higher distribution costs and an unexpected bad debt charge of $3 million related to a retailer bankruptcy in Australia. Both adjusted and GAAP earnings per share were $0.51, an increase of -- over prior year of 13% and 24%, respectively. 
In the quarter, we generated $559 million in cash flow from operations, an increase of $57 million compared to prior year. For the full year, we generated a record $803 million in cash flow from operations. 
With respect to the balance sheet, as compared to last year, we reduced our inventory balance by more than $150 million, and we paid down over $600 million of debt. Our leverage at the end of the quarter was 2.9x on a net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA basis. This is down 1 full turn from our peak in the first quarter of 2018 and brings us back within our target range of 2x to 3x. 
With that summary, let me take you through our fourth quarter segment performance. As compared to last year, U.S. Innerwear sales declined 4%. However, operating profit increased 5% as our operating margin expanded 210 basis points to 24.6%. The operating profit and margin exceeded our forecast in the quarter as it benefits from earlier price increases and lower distribution expenses, more than offset higher commodity cost and lower unit volume. 
For the quarter, basics revenue declined 5% due to the impact from door closings and an earlier-than-planned disruption from store resets at a large mass retailer. While these resets are causing short-term fluctuations, we believe, once completed, this should have a positive impact on our basics business beginning in the second half of this year. 
And with respect to our intimates business, as expected, our trends improved sequentially, driven by our bra business. For the quarter, bra revenue increased slightly and operating margins improved nearly 300 basis points over last year as our revitalization efforts and new product innovations gain traction. 
Turning to our U.S. Activewear segment. Sales declined nearly 7% over last year and were slightly better than our forecast. The segment's results reflect the $46 million of expected year-over-year headwinds I referenced earlier. As compared to prior year, Champion Activewear sales, excluding C9, increased 14%. C9 revenue declined 26% or $26 million and sales in the remainder of our Activewear segment declined approximately $30 million, which was better than our forecast. 
Activewear's operating margin of 15.8% declined 30 basis points over prior year. Activewear's gross margin increased in the quarter, driven by the benefits of our remixing activity, including a higher mix of Champion sales. This was more than offset by higher SG&A expense, including higher distribution cost. 
In our International segment, revenue increased nearly 7% and was above our forecast, driven by stronger-than-expected results in both our Activewear and Innerwear businesses. On a constant currency basis, international sales increased 10% or $60 million over prior year, with mid-single-digit growth in Innerwear and 22% growth in Champion. International's operating margin of 14.9% declined 130 basis points over last year as the benefits from higher sales were more than offset by short-term FX transaction cost pressures as well as the $3 million Australia bad debt expense I referenced earlier. 
Touching briefly on our global Champion business. Excluding C9, constant currency sales increased 22% over last year and were in line with our expectation. This consisted of 22% growth in both our domestic and international Champion businesses. 
And now turning to guidance. To present a more representative comparison of our ongoing business between 2020 and 2019, we provided a supplemental table on our IR website. This table provides rebased financial information for 2019 that adjusts for the exits of C9 at Target and the DKNY intimates license. During my guidance discussion, all year-over-year comparisons will reference our rebased 2019 results. I'll also point you to our press release and FAQ document for additional guidance details. However, I will like to share a few thoughts to frame our 2020 outlook. 
We expect solid growth with enhanced profitability even though the first quarter is expected to see difficult comparisons. With a strong balance sheet, our capital allocation strategy is expected to drive accelerating earnings per share growth, and we've identified additional cost-reduction actions to those we've begun last year that should generate further profit improvement in 2021 and beyond. 
Our 2020 guidance demonstrates accelerating growth rates as you move down the P&L. At the midpoint, our full year guidance implies revenue growth that's approaching 3% and adjusted operating profit growth approximately 7%. With expected benefits from lower interest expense and $200 million of share repurchases planned early in the year, we expect adjusted earnings per share growth of approximately 15%. We expect to generate $700 million to $800 million in cash flow from operations. Absent any additional capital allocation initiatives this year, we expect our leverage to decline to 2.7x by year-end. 
With respect to our restructuring and other actions, we expect approximately $50 million of charges in 2020. Approximately $10 million of these charges are costs related to the exits of C9 and the DKNY license. Approximately $10 million relate to our 2019 supply chain restructuring which were previously planned. The remainder of the charges are focused on additional actions to further reduce cost, primarily within our supply chain. In isolation, we expect these additional restructuring actions to deliver approximately $40 million of incremental profit, but $30 million coming in 2021 and the remaining $10 million coming in 2022. 
Touching on the first quarter. We expect muted revenue and operating profit growth due to transitory and timing issues in the international and U.S. Innerwear segments. Within U.S. Innerwear, we're facing headwinds from a large sock shipment in last year's first quarter as we displaced a competitor at a large value retailer. We also expect continued short-term disruption in our basics business from the previously discussed store reset at a large mass retailer. 
International constant currency revenue growth is expected to slow to 2% in the quarter before returning to mid-single-digit growth in the second quarter due to the timing of the Asia expansion this year compared to last year. And International's first quarter operating profit is expected to decline due to the increased investments to support our Asia expansion as well as short-term FX transactional cost pressures. 
For the rest of the year, we expect revenue and operating profit growth as we benefit from the continued momentum in our intimates business, the completion of store resets in the mass channel, expanded distribution in Asia, cost savings from our supply chain restructuring and price increases in certain international markets to offset the cost pressures from foreign exchange rates. 
So in closing, we delivered solid results for both the quarter and full year. We delivered on a number of initiatives to improve our business model. And as our outlook suggests, we believe we've reached an inflection point now that our program exits are behind us and we've brought back our leverage within our targeted range. We believe the combination of our strengthened business model, our strong balance sheet and all of our capital allocation tools position us for accelerating earnings growth and total shareholder returns in 2020 and beyond. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to T.C."

Our record cash flow and double-digit EPS growth, and our in-line guidance really speak to what we've been doing to improve our business model. We really do look to 2020 as a an inflection point for this business. And an important part of that is the underlying strength of our ongoing businesses. 
And then part of that is innerwear. And we did see improvement from a profitability standpoint certainly at the end of 2019. As we look to 2020, we do expect the revenue to improve as we work through the store resets in the large retailer. The large retailer's started the reset at the end of last year, in 2019, a little earlier than we had expected. And as you see with resets, there's sell-off of exited SKUs and businesses and so forth that can create some short-term interruption. But what we do see and what we like is our space is expanding. And with that space expansion, we're seeing our share expand. 
So the balance of the chain resets through the first part of 2020. But we expect, as we get past that, that as we get to the second half, we'll pick up the tailwind of that on our Innerwear business and the benefit we saw from share expansion in their initial reset, along with the improving trends we're seeing out of our intimates business. On the revenue side, we expect to also then pick up the additional restructure -- cost restructure benefits that we implemented in 2019 to flow through the second half. 
So we really do expect a stabilization of our revenue line as we work through the balance of 2020, and we expect our operating profit to be up. And so we're very encouraged by that, and that's an important punctuation on our strong cash flow as well when we see our profit growing within Innerwear."

We discovered the issue as we were preparing our year-end financial statements this year. And the issue revolves around or relates to the tax treatment of intercompany inventory transactions and ultimately impacted our prior period tax balances. Now when we identified this, we've -- we had -- we quantified it and we've revised prior period financial statements to correct for these errors.

We have recovered the vast majority of that, but it's a bit masked in the rebased numbers because as we planned for 2020, we also assumed there would be the impact of door closures of about $35 million to $40 million, so they offset in the numbers. 
But I think you should take solace in knowing that we have planned conservatively on the Innerwear side. And as we begin to hear about door closures in other places, we have those covered in our guidance as we look toward 2020. So we feel we've appropriately planned the Innerwear business from the standpoint of being conservative, yet -- and know the phasing of that business as we also see the revenue and profitability ramp throughout the year. So we feel good about that business and where it's positioned and appropriately planned from a conservative standpoint.

So as we look at to 2020, we expect to surpass the $2 billion mark. We expect to do another year of double-digit growth for Champion. We are overlapping some very large comps in the first part of the year. So we've planned a mid- to high single-digit growth rate for Champion in the first half of the year and a double-digit growth in the second half of the year -- low double-digit growth in the second half of the year. 
So we're continuing to be very bullish on Champion and its ability to continue to grow. We're seeing strong POS, we saw strong POS through the holiday periods around the world as well. And we are well on our way, obviously, to reach our $2 billion goal in 2020 2 years early. And we believe we can add the next $1 billion in the next 4 to 5 years."

C9 has continued to perform well right through the balance of 2019, really, exceeded our expectations through the balance of 2019. And it's clear to us that there's a strong consumer base out there that's very loyal to that brand. We are in the final stages of discussions with a new partner, and we expect to launch that program, an initial program, in the second half of this year. 
Relatively small to start with. And as you noted, it is in our guidance at this point in time. But it has the potential to ramp nicely over time as we get the program going. So we'll provide some more specifics on that in the coming months, but we're very pleased to have the opportunity to keep that brand in the market and satisfy those consumers. 
From the standpoint of the department store information. The vast majority of the business we do in Macy's is at -- on macys.com and in their largest stores. And that's where all of our, really, growth comes from in that account. As noted in the announcement, the stores targeted for closures are a small part of their total business. And while the closure list has not yet been fully communicated, we believe the doors targeted for closure do not represent a material part of our business. 
In regards to 2020, as I noted in my earlier comments, we had planned the possibility of additional door closures in the market, and we feel that we have the initial 30 covered in our guidance. And as the list develops, we'll continue to assess that. But we feel we've got it covered in our guidance for 2020. 
I think, once again, it reinforces what we've been focused on for a while, is the consumer's choice of where they shop and their shopping habits continue to evolve. And we've been focusing over the last few years on diversifying our revenue base and where we sell, and particularly developing our consumer-direct piece of the business, which is -- as we noted in our comments, was 25% of our business in the last year. And so macys.com is part of that as well as pure plays and as well as our own site. So we'll continue to diversify where we sell to meet the shifting needs of the consumer. 
So we feel good about where we have Innerwear going and that will continue. And Innerwear is one of our fastest-growing consumer-direct businesses."

The team did a fantastic job this year. We had a good improvement in our cash cycle days. We feel this takes us to a new level from a -- and reinforces our ability to generate cash flows. Our operating cash flows in '19, we accomplished that through strong GAAP net income and working capital management.
And as you think about the 2020 cash flow levels, our guidance is the $700 million to $800 million, you can arrive at that in a couple of ways. And one way is looking at our 2020 GAAP net income, the midpoint is around $585 million. If you add back our noncash items like depreciation and amortization and stock compensation, which is typically around $180 million to $190 million, you land right in the midpoint within that guidance range. 
Another way of thinking about it is if you look our 2019 cash flow level of $803 million. Our 2020 GAAP net income is at the midpoint, it's around $20 million lower than '19 as we talked about the program exits. And just using the same working capital assumption that we had in '19, which is actually flat of that year. We -- you arrive right within that guidance range again. 
So we thought this was a prudent way of looking at cash flows in 2020. And we felt like, again, we're in a really good position to drive strong cash flows in 2020 and beyond, and this is helping with strong returns.

And as you may recall, we paired that with both online, our digital support as well as TV support in the case of the Bali EasyLight. 
So we saw nice traction from the standpoint of those launches and we've seen it ramp.

From the pricing question, we implemented our pricing in Innerwear really last February, so February of 2019. You may recall at the time, we were pricing because commodities had peaked ahead of that pricing and we put that pricing in place. So it's been in place a long time. We've generally seen that the pricing in the market has settled out around it and so forth. 
What we're seeing now, though, is as the pricing continues to lap itself, the peak of the commodities is past, and we're actually seeing margin improvement as the commodity costs begin to ramp down and the pricing overlaps that. So we're seeing that now. 
As we look to Innerwear in the second half of 2020, we get the added benefit of the supply chain restructurings that we had executed in 2019 will work their way off the balance sheet and give us added improvement in our operating margins and profit within Innerwear, in particular. 
From the standpoint of the international bad debt, that was a bankruptcy in Australia. And we would expect that to be an individual event, not something that's ongoing there."

HanesBrands delivered a solid fourth quarter with record cash flow. Overall results were once again right in line with our guidance and demonstrate that our multiyear strategy to improve our business is working. Key highlights in the qua",1040,"Thank you, T.C. 
HanesBrands delivered a solid fourth quarter with record cash flow. Overall results were once again right in line with our guidance and demonstrate that our multiyear strategy to improve our business is working. Key highlights in the quarter include operating cash flow that exceeded the high end of our guidance for both the quarter and the full year. We delivered on our commitment to bring our leverage back within our target range. We saw continued strong performances in International, consumer-direct and Champion. And adjusted gross margin improved 130 basis points over prior year, driven by increases in both our U.S. Innerwear and U.S. Activewear segments. And U.S. Innerwear's operating profit and operating margin increased over prior year, with both metrics exceeding our guidance in the quarter despite lower-than-expected revenue. We believe this is an indication that U.S. Innerwear's profit has begun to stabilize. 
In addition to U.S. Innerwear's fourth quarter profit performance, we saw 2 additional developments that point to improving revenue and profit trends in 2020. First, our intimates business improved sequentially and was in line with our expectation for the quarter. The strong performance was driven by our bra business, which increased over the prior year, as our revitalization efforts and product innovations, such as EasyLight and Dream Wire, continued to gain traction. 
And second, while early store resets by a major retailer had a short-term impact on basic sales in the quarter, we're pleased with the longer-term potential this reset holds for our business. Within the stores that have been reset, we're gaining shelf space and we're gaining market share. Once completed, we believe this reset should have a positive impact on our basics business beginning in the second half of this year. 
Over the past several years, we have executed a strategy to diversify our business and position the company for increased earnings growth and shareholder returns. To accomplish this, we set 5 specific goals, and we've delivered on each, as highlighted by our fourth quarter and full year results. 
First, we have diversified our revenue. International revenue now accounts for 36% of sales, up from 11% in 2013. Consumer-direct revenue, which represented 30% of fourth quarter sales and 25% of full year sales, is up from 9% in 2013. And on a constant currency basis, global Champion, excluding C9, generated more than $1.9 billion of revenue in 2019, an increase of more than $1.1 billion in just 3 years. 
Second, we've consistently delivered organic revenue growth. The fourth quarter marked our tenth consecutive quarter of constant currency growth. And we accomplished this despite challenges in our U.S. business that included a muted holiday and a $46 million headwind from exited programs. 
Third, we position the business for higher levels of profitability over the next several years by exiting unprofitable businesses and restructuring our supply chain to lower cost. We believe our supply chain restructuring initiatives have positioned U.S. Innerwear and the company for improving margins over the next 2 years. We also believe this represents an important milestone for U.S. Innerwear as it remains a critical driver of our strong cash flow. 
Fourth, we are generating higher levels of operating cash flow. In 2019, operating cash flow increased 25% over prior year to more than $800 million. This is approximately $200 million higher than our cash flow from just 3 years ago. 
And fifth, we have reduced our net debt by more than $1.1 billion in less than 2 years. We ended the year at 2.9x levered on a net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA basis which is a full turn lower than our peak. Now that we're back within our long-term range of 2 to 3x, our priority for 2020 is to use our excess free cash to buy back stock. 
The focus of our entire organization for the past several years has been on strengthening our business to return to a model that is able to magnify sales growth into faster operating profit growth and ultimately even faster EPS growth. With a lot of heavy lifting done and our program exits behind us, we believe 2020 represents an inflection point for our company, one that reveals the underlying strength of our ongoing business and unleashes the full potential of our capital allocation model to drive accelerated shareholder returns. 
Turning to our 2020 guidance. Through the remainder of my remarks and for comparison purposes, I'll be referencing our rebased 2019 results which adjust for the exits of C9 at Target and our DKNY intimates license. This will provide a clearer view of the underlying trends within our business. Using the midpoint, our 2020 guidance implies approximately 3% revenue growth. This is driven by strong performances in International, consumer-direct and Champion. 
And while we continue to plan conservatively with respect to our U.S. Innerwear business, we expect improved revenue trends in 2020 in both basics and intimates. Our guidance for U.S. Innerwear assumes revenue growth ranging from down 1% to up 1% for the full year. 
And for the total company, we expect adjusted operating profit growth of 7% as our investment spending normalizes and cost savings from our supply chain restructuring flow through, particularly within our U.S. Innerwear segment, where we expect operating profit to be up over prior year. 
With lower interest expense and lower share count, we expect adjusted earnings per share growth to accelerate to 15%. Embedded in our guidance is $200 million of share repurchases, and we expect to generate between $700 million and $800 million of operating cash flow. 
So in closing, we delivered solid performances for the quarter and the full year. And as our 2020 outlook suggests, we believe we've reached an inflection point in our business model. With our exited programs behind us and all of our capital allocation tools at our disposal, we believe we are well positioned for accelerating earnings growth and shareholder returns over the next several years. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Scott Lewis, our Chief Accounting Officer, who is serving as Interim Chief Financial Officer. Scott has held leading roles in our strong global finance organization since the company went public and is providing us with a seamless leadership transition to support our goals and strategies. Scott?"

Before I discuss our fourth quarter results, I want to highlight a supplemental document on our IR website that reflects revisions to our prior period results. These revisions primarily relate to adjustments to our income tax balances. The revisions had a minor cumulative earnings per share impact of $0.01 over the 3-year period from 2017 to 2019. Additional information can be found in our FAQ document as well as in our 10-K.
Now let me discuss the quarter. Overall, we reported solid fourth quarter results. Revenue, adjusted operating profit and earnings per share were in line with our guidance, while cash flow from operations exceeded the high end of our range. 
For the quarter, sales were $1.75 billion. On a constant currency basis, sales increased slightly over prior year. I'll note that our results reflect $46 million expected headwinds in our Activewear segment from the exit of commodity programs in the mass channel as well as the planned wind down of C9 at Target. 
Adjusted gross margin increased 130 basis points over last year to 41.4%, driven by higher margins in both our Innerwear and Activewear segments. Adjusted operating profit in the quarter was $263 million and included $3 million of currency headwinds as compared to last year. Our adjusted operating margin of 15% increased approximately 40 basis points over prior year as our strong gross margin performance more than offset higher distribution costs and an unexpected bad debt charge of $3 million related to a retailer bankruptcy in Australia. Both adjusted and GAAP earnings per share were $0.51, an increase of -- over prior year of 13% and 24%, respectively. 
In the quarter, we generated $559 million in cash flow from operations, an increase of $57 million compared to prior year. For the full year, we generated a record $803 million in cash flow from operations. 
With respect to the balance sheet, as compared to last year, we reduced our inventory balance by more than $150 million, and we paid down over $600 million of debt. Our leverage at the end of the quarter was 2.9x on a net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA basis. This is down 1 full turn from our peak in the first quarter of 2018 and brings us back within our target range of 2x to 3x. 
With that summary, let me take you through our fourth quarter segment performance. As compared to last year, U.S. Innerwear sales declined 4%. However, operating profit increased 5% as our operating margin expanded 210 basis points to 24.6%. The operating profit and margin exceeded our forecast in the quarter as it benefits from earlier price increases and lower distribution expenses, more than offset higher commodity cost and lower unit volume. 
For the quarter, basics revenue declined 5% due to the impact from door closings and an earlier-than-planned disruption from store resets at a large mass retailer. While these resets are causing short-term fluctuations, we believe, once completed, this should have a positive impact on our basics business beginning in the second half of this year. 
And with respect to our intimates business, as expected, our trends improved sequentially, driven by our bra business. For the quarter, bra revenue increased slightly and operating margins improved nearly 300 basis points over last year as our revitalization efforts and new product innovations gain traction. 
Turning to our U.S. Activewear segment. Sales declined nearly 7% over last year and were slightly better than our forecast. The segment's results reflect the $46 million of expected year-over-year headwinds I referenced earlier. As compared to prior year, Champion Activewear sales, excluding C9, increased 14%. C9 revenue declined 26% or $26 million and sales in the remainder of our Activewear segment declined approximately $30 million, which was better than our forecast. 
Activewear's operating margin of 15.8% declined 30 basis points over prior year. Activewear's gross margin increased in the quarter, driven by the benefits of our remixing activity, including a higher mix of Champion sales. This was more than offset by higher SG&A expense, including higher distribution cost. 
In our International segment, revenue increased nearly 7% and was above our forecast, driven by stronger-than-expected results in both our Activewear and Innerwear businesses. On a constant currency basis, international sales increased 10% or $60 million over prior year, with mid-single-digit growth in Innerwear and 22% growth in Champion. International's operating margin of 14.9% declined 130 basis points over last year as the benefits from higher sales were more than offset by short-term FX transaction cost pressures as well as the $3 million Australia bad debt expense I referenced earlier. 
Touching briefly on our global Champion business. Excluding C9, constant currency sales increased 22% over last year and were in line with our expectation. This consisted of 22% growth in both our domestic and international Champion businesses. 
And now turning to guidance. To present a more representative comparison of our ongoing business between 2020 and 2019, we provided a supplemental table on our IR website. This table provides rebased financial information for 2019 that adjusts for the exits of C9 at Target and the DKNY intimates license. During my guidance discussion, all year-over-year comparisons will reference our rebased 2019 results. I'll also point you to our press release and FAQ document for additional guidance details. However, I will like to share a few thoughts to frame our 2020 outlook. 
We expect solid growth with enhanced profitability even though the first quarter is expected to see difficult comparisons. With a strong balance sheet, our capital allocation strategy is expected to drive accelerating earnings per share growth, and we've identified additional cost-reduction actions to those we've begun last year that should generate further profit improvement in 2021 and beyond. 
Our 2020 guidance demonstrates accelerating growth rates as you move down the P&L. At the midpoint, our full year guidance implies revenue growth that's approaching 3% and adjusted operating profit growth approximately 7%. With expected benefits from lower interest expense and $200 million of share repurchases planned early in the year, we expect adjusted earnings per share growth of approximately 15%. We expect to generate $700 million to $800 million in cash flow from operations. Absent any additional capital allocation initiatives this year, we expect our leverage to decline to 2.7x by year-end. 
With respect to our restructuring and other actions, we expect approximately $50 million of charges in 2020. Approximately $10 million of these charges are costs related to the exits of C9 and the DKNY license. Approximately $10 million relate to our 2019 supply chain restructuring which were previously planned. The remainder of the charges are focused on additional actions to further reduce cost, primarily within our supply chain. In isolation, we expect these additional restructuring actions to deliver approximately $40 million of incremental profit, but $30 million coming in 2021 and the remaining $10 million coming in 2022. 
Touching on the first quarter. We expect muted revenue and operating profit growth due to transitory and timing issues in the international and U.S. Innerwear segments. Within U.S. Innerwear, we're facing headwinds from a large sock shipment in last year's first quarter as we displaced a competitor at a large value retailer. We also expect continued short-term disruption in our basics business from the previously discussed store reset at a large mass retailer. 
International constant currency revenue growth is expected to slow to 2% in the quarter before returning to mid-single-digit growth in the second quarter due to the timing of the Asia expansion this year compared to last year. And International's first quarter operating profit is expected to decline due to the increased investments to support our Asia expansion as well as short-term FX transactional cost pressures. 
For the rest of the year, we expect revenue and operating profit growth as we benefit from the continued momentum in our intimates business, the completion of store resets in the mass channel, expanded distribution in Asia, cost savings from our supply chain restructuring and price increases in certain international markets to offset the cost pressures from foreign exchange rates. 
So in closing, we delivered solid results for both the quarter and full year. We delivered on a number of initiatives to improve our business model. And as our outlook suggests, we believe we've reached an inflection point now that our program exits are behind us and we've brought back our leverage within our targeted range. We believe the combination of our strengthened business model, our strong balance sheet and all of our capital allocation tools position us for accelerating earnings growth and total shareholder returns in 2020 and beyond. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to T.C."

Our record cash flow and double-digit EPS growth, and our in-line guidance really speak to what we've been doing to improve our business model. We really do look to 2020 as a an inflection point for this business. And an important part of that is the underlying strength of our ongoing businesses. 
And then part of that is innerwear. And we did see improvement from a profitability standpoint certainly at the end of 2019. As we look to 2020, we do expect the revenue to improve as we work through the store resets in the large retailer. The large retailer's started the reset at the end of last year, in 2019, a little earlier than we had expected. And as you see with resets, there's sell-off of exited SKUs and businesses and so forth that can create some short-term interruption. But what we do see and what we like is our space is expanding. And with that space expansion, we're seeing our share expand. 
So the balance of the chain resets through the first part of 2020. But we expect, as we get past that, that as we get to the second half, we'll pick up the tailwind of that on our Innerwear business and the benefit we saw from share expansion in their initial reset, along with the improving trends we're seeing out of our intimates business. On the revenue side, we expect to also then pick up the additional restructure -- cost restructure benefits that we implemented in 2019 to flow through the second half. 
So we really do expect a stabilization of our revenue line as we work through the balance of 2020, and we expect our operating profit to be up. And so we're very encouraged by that, and that's an important punctuation on our strong cash flow as well when we see our profit growing within Innerwear."

We discovered the issue as we were preparing our year-end financial statements this year. And the issue revolves around or relates to the tax treatment of intercompany inventory transactions and ultimately impacted our prior period tax balances. Now when we identified this, we've -- we had -- we quantified it and we've revised prior period financial statements to correct for these errors. And we also addressed it for other immaterial out-of-period items at the same time.

We have recovered the vast majority of that, but it's a bit masked in the rebased numbers because as we planned for 2020, we also assumed there would be the impact of door closures of about $35 million to $40 million, so they offset in the numbers. 
But I think you should take solace in knowing that we have planned conservatively on the Innerwear side. And as we begin to hear about door closures in other places, we have those covered in our guidance as we look toward 2020. So we feel we've appropriately planned the Innerwear business from the standpoint of being conservative, yet -- and know the phasing of that business as we also see the revenue and profitability ramp throughout the year. So we feel good about that business and where it's positioned and appropriately planned from a conservative standpoint.

So as we look at to 2020, we expect to surpass the $2 billion mark. We expect to do another year of double-digit growth for Champion. We are overlapping some very large comps in the first part of the year. So we've planned a mid- to high single-digit growth rate for Champion in the first half of the year and a double-digit growth in the second half of the year -- low double-digit growth in the second half of the year. 
So we're continuing to be very bullish on Champion and its ability to continue to grow. We're seeing strong POS, we saw strong POS through the holiday periods around the world as well. And we are well on our way, obviously, to reach our $2 billion goal in 2020 2 years early. And we believe we can add the next $1 billion in the next 4 to 5 years."

C9 has continued to perform well right through the balance of 2019, really, exceeded our expectations through the balance of 2019. And it's clear to us that there's a strong consumer base out there that's very loyal to that brand. We are in the final stages of discussions with a new partner, and we expect to launch that program, an initial program, in the second half of this year. 
Relatively small to start with. And as you noted, it is in our guidance at this point in time. But it has the potential to ramp nicely over time as we get the program going. So we'll provide some more specifics on that in the coming months, but we're very pleased to have the opportunity to keep that brand in the market and satisfy those consumers. 
From the standpoint of the department store information. The vast majority of the business we do in Macy's is at -- on macys.com and in their largest stores. And that's where all of our, really, growth comes from in that account. As noted in the announcement, the stores targeted for closures are a small part of their total business. And while the closure list has not yet been fully communicated, we believe the doors targeted for closure do not represent a material part of our business. 
In regards to 2020, as I noted in my earlier comments, we had planned the possibility of additional door closures in the market, and we feel that we have the initial 30 covered in our guidance. And as the list develops, we'll continue to assess that. But we feel we've got it covered in our guidance for 2020. 
I think, once again, it reinforces what we've been focused on for a while, is the consumer's choice of where they shop and their shopping habits continue to evolve. And we've been focusing over the last few years on diversifying our revenue base and where we sell, and particularly developing our consumer-direct piece of the business, which is -- as we noted in our comments, was 25% of our business in the last year. And so macys.com is part of that as well as pure plays and as well as our own site. So we'll continue to diversify where we sell to meet the shifting needs of the consumer. 
So we feel good about where we have Innerwear going and that will continue. And Innerwear is one of our fastest-growing consumer-direct businesses."

The team did a fantastic job this year. We had a good improvement in our cash cycle days. We feel this takes us to a new level from a -- and reinforces our ability to generate cash flows. Our operating cash flows in '19, we accomplished that through strong GAAP net income and working capital management.
And as you think about the 2020 cash flow levels, our guidance is the $700 million to $800 million, you can arrive at that in a couple of ways. And one way is looking at our 2020 GAAP net income, the midpoint is around $585 million. If you add back our noncash items like depreciation and amortization and stock compensation, which is typically around $180 million to $190 million, you land right in the midpoint within that guidance range. 
Another way of thinking about it is if you look our 2019 cash flow level of $803 million. Our 2020 GAAP net income is at the midpoint, it's around $20 million lower than '19 as we talked about the program exits. And just using the same working capital assumption that we had in '19, which is actually flat of that year. We -- you arrive right within that guidance range again. 
So we thought this was a prudent way of looking at cash flows in 2020. And we felt like, again, we're in a really good position to drive strong cash flows in 2020 and beyond, and this is helping with strong returns. And again, like Gerald mentioned earlier, this gives us opportunities to continue to delever for share repurchases and really drive shareholder return."

What we're seeing now, though, is as the pricing continues to lap itself, the peak of the commodities is past, and we're actually seeing margin improvement as the commodity costs begin to ramp down and the pricing overlaps that. So we're seeing that now. 
As we look to Innerwear in the second half of 2020, we get the added benefit of the supply chain restructurings that we had executed in 2019 will work their way off the balance sheet and give us added improvement in our operating margins and profit within Innerwear, in particular.

It would obviously include an important ramping in markets like Asia, where we think there's tremendous opportunity; further expansion in our Europe markets.

4212820,665299410,1965910,"Hanesbrands Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",2020-04-30,"Earnings Calls","Hanesbrands Inc.","Executives","Thank you, T.C. Good morning, and thank you for joining our first quarter earnings call. Given the uncertainty in the market, we understand that investors are more focused on how our business is positioned to perform in both the current and post-pandemic",1393,"Thank you, T.C. Good morning, and thank you for joining our first quarter earnings call. Given the uncertainty in the market, we understand that investors are more focused on how our business is positioned to perform in both the current and post-pandemic environment. While we'll discuss our first quarter results, including our better-than-expected Innerwear performance through mid-March, our focus for today's call will be on our current business trends, our cost reduction initiatives, the creation of a new business line for cloth mask and personal protection garments and our substantial liquidity position, which we believe provides ample capital cushion even under a prolonged shelter in place scenario. This combination maximizes our operating flexibility in the current environment, strengthens our long-term earnings growth profile and positions us to take advantage of current and future opportunities. 
Before I speak to the quarter's results, I want to recognize the efforts and sacrifices being made by HanesBrands employees around the world. They have allowed us to continue to serve our customers and consumers from these uncertain times. They are also the driving force behind HanesBrands' established reputation for corporate citizenship and social responsibility. As an organization, we have committed to help fight this global pandemic, which includes shifting our manufacturing to produce cotton face masks. Our employees are our greatest asset, which is why I would like to personally thank each one of them for their contributions. 
Turning to our results. The first quarter was marked by 2 radically different periods as the global spread of the coronavirus accelerated in March. We experienced an unprecedented sudden drop in sales and profit late in the quarter. Although, we have seen orders resume in April. Our global shipments and sales essentially stopped in the last 2 weeks of the quarter as our customers reacted aggressively to shelter in place announcements by delaying or canceling their orders. This abrupt reaction by our customers more than offset the strong revenue and profit performance across our businesses through the second week of March, particularly within U.S. Innerwear and U.S. Activewear. Through mid-March, U.S. Innerwear revenue was down less than 1% over prior year, well ahead of our initial forecast as our turnaround initiatives were gaining momentum. During this period, point-of-sale at our top 10 customers, which is where we focused our new innovations and revitalization efforts, increased 3% in both basics and intimates. And our market share improved meaningfully in basics, bras and shapewear. And in U.S. Activewear, revenue through mid-March was up mid- to high-single digits, driven by Champion. 
For the quarter, our cash flow performance was strong and ahead of our plan despite the sudden COVID-related fall off late in the quarter. Inventory reduction initiatives, timely supply chain actions and strong working capital management delivered a year-over-year improvement in cash flow from operations of more than $100 million. 
In the quarter, we estimate that COVID-19 impacted revenue by approximately $181 million, operating profit by approximately $86 million and earnings per share by approximately $0.20. In adjusting for the COVID-related impact, first quarter revenue would have increased 1.6% on a constant currency basis. Operating profit and operating margin would have been consistent with prior year and earnings per share would have increased 14%. 
Make no mistake, the COVID-19 environment is a true challenge. However, we're encouraged by our pre-COVID performance and underlying business trends. This underscores the health of our brands, the building momentum in our U.S. Innerwear business, the continued consumer demand for Champion and the strength of our cash flow model. Given the long-term stability of our categories, we're confident our business can return to these performance levels in time. We have seen orders resume in April as consumers and retailers have begun to adapt. 
Online growth has rapidly accelerated each week, reaching triple-digit growth rates across a number of our customers, online platforms as well as our own champion.com and maidenform.com site. Consumers are also buying our categories at stores within the mass, hypermarket, dollar store and drugs or channels. The basics reset at a large mass retailer is progressing, and we have back-to-school orders from some of our large customers. Over our 120-year history, we have faced a number of significant challenges. Each time, we've adapted our model, improved our position and emerged a stronger company, and we expect to do the same in light of this recent challenge. Given the uncertainty around the reopening of global economies as well as the level of consumer spending, we modeled a number of financial scenarios. These range from a late May reopening of retail doors to an early July reopening. And we even ran a stress test scenario that assumes doors do not reopen until early October. As a result, we developed a pandemic strategy designed to maximize our operating flexibility under any of our modeling scenarios, while also strengthening our long-term business model and positioning us to take advantage of opportunities. 
This strategy consists of 4 initiatives: one, support our current customers; two, reduce cash-based expenditures; three, ramp new revenue opportunities; and four, ensure we have ample liquidity, even under our conservative stress test scenario. 
Touching on each of these initiatives. First, we're supporting our existing customers that remain open in a safety-first manner. We're starting to see a new baseline of orders within this customer set, and we're focused on aligning our inventory and production to be able to meet their back-to-school and holiday plans. 
The second initiative is to reduce cash-based expenditures. We've reduced our CapEx to critical needs as well as suspended share repurchases. We're aggressively managing our working capital. We've taken a number of timely actions to reduce inventory. We're working with our suppliers to extend our payable term and many of our largest customers continue to pay on schedule. We have also implemented approximately $200 million of cost reduction initiatives. The majority of these savings are from the temporary salary reductions and furloughs that began in mid-April. The remainder are a mix of discretionary spending areas, including media and marketing. However, we're continuing to invest media and marketing dollars within the digital channels as the pandemic is driving further penetration of online shopping. 
The third initiative in our pandemic strategy is to ramp our mask and protective garment business. We believe this has the potential to be a substantial contributor of incremental profit and cash flow over the next several years. Our ability to quickly shift our manufacturing operations to produce new products underscores the competitive advantages of owning our manufacturing network that is balanced across hemispheres. We are currently manufacturing reusable face masks for the U.S. government as well as launching a HanesBrands' consumer program for several customers. Combined, we believe these programs can generate well over [ $300 billion  ]of sales in 2020. 
Looking forward, there is an expectation that the COVID-19 pandemic will result in more widespread mask usage by consumers and businesses globally. Over the past several weeks, we have seen a strong influx of inquiries across a number of geographies from governments, retailers, large corporations and individual consumers. Based on the current interest from potential customers as well as the anticipated change in consumer behavior around the world, we believe our mask and protective garment business could be a sizable revenue opportunity with growth potential over the next several years. 
And the fourth initiative in our pandemic strategy is to further strengthen our substantial liquidity position. While this may prove to be overly conservative, we want to be prudent and proactive, given the unpredictability of the virus. Subject to market conditions, we intend to secure approximately $500 million in debt financing with the proceeds used to repay our revolver, thereby increasing our liquidity to nearly $1.6 billion. We believe this level of liquidity provides us with an ample capital cushion even under stress test modeling scenarios. 
So in closing, our brand positions are strong. Our supply chain continues to create substantial value. The combination of our pre-COVID performance and the addition of a new protective garment business points to a strong growth profile once the environment stabilizes. And we are a strong cash flow generator with ample liquidity. We believe all of this positions us to once again emerge from a challenging environment as an even stronger company, one that is well positioned to take advantage of opportunities. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Scott."

Despite the unprecedented rapid falloff in consumer demand in March due to the global pandemic, we're still able to reduce inventory, a 12% over prior year, improved cash flow from operations of more than $100 million and demonstrate that",1209,"Thanks, Gerald. Despite the unprecedented rapid falloff in consumer demand in March due to the global pandemic, we're still able to reduce inventory, a 12% over prior year, improved cash flow from operations of more than $100 million and demonstrate that we have the right turnaround plan in place for U.S. Innerwear. In addition, we identified and ramped a new business line in less than 30 days in the midst of the crisis. These are all indications of the strength and the flexibility of our business model. 
Turning to our results. First quarter sales declined 12% over prior year to $1.32 billion with foreign exchange rates accounting for 135 basis points of the decline. Excluding the COVID-related impact, we estimate first quarter sales would have increased 1.6% over prior year on a constant currency basis. Adjusted gross margin of 37.6% decreased approximately 300 basis points over last year, and more than half of the decline due to the impact from COVID-19 and foreign exchange rates. The remainder of the decline was driven by the expected transactional FX and mix related headwinds. Adjusted operating margin of 4.8% declined approximately 520 basis points. All the decline was due to the estimated $86 million impact from COVID-19, which includes an accrual for anticipated bankruptcies of approximately $11 million or $0.03 per share. 
Interest and other expense declined $12 million to approximately $43 million due to lower average debt balances throughout the quarter. Restructuring and other related charges were approximately $29 million. Recall that the majority of our full year supply chain restructuring actions and program exit costs were planned for the first quarter. Our full year restructuring and other related action plans remain unchanged. In the quarter, we repurchased approximately 14.5 million shares with a vast majority purchased in February. For the remaining 3 quarters of the year, we expect average diluted shares of approximately $353 million. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.05, while GAAP earnings per share was a loss of $0.02. Excluding the estimated $0.20 per share impact from COVID-19, adjusted EPS would have increased 14% over prior year. 
Let me take you through our segment performance. In each of our segments, revenue and profit trends were at or above our expectations through early to mid-March. This performance, however, was more than offset by the sudden COVID-related falloff, particularly in the last 2 weeks of the quarter as our customers postponed or canceled orders and reaction to shelter in place orders around the world. 
Looking at the pre-COVID trends in our segments, our U.S. Innerwear segment performed well above our expectations through the second week of March as revenue was down less than 1% over prior year. During this period, we're experiencing solid trends across all channels, including strong basics outperformance within the test stores at a large mass retailer. We believe our pre-COVID performance, including point-of-sale and market share trends, demonstrate our innovations and intimates revitalization efforts are working. 
Turning to U.S. Activewear. In the second week of March, revenue was tracking up mid- to high-single digits compared to prior year and was ahead of our expectations. The strong performance during this period was driven by continued demand for Champion as well as growth in our other Activewear brands, led by sports licensing in the mass and mid-tier channels and seasonal Activewear in the online channel. 
Switching to our International segment. The timing of the coronavirus impact varied by country and region. On a constant currency basis, revenue through February increased at a low single-digit rate in nearly all of our main geographies. Growth in Latin America and Australia was Innerwear-driven, while Europe's growth over this time was led by Champion. 
Touching briefly on our global Champion business, excluding C9, constant currency revenue for the quarter declined from prior year, both domestically and internationally. Adjusted for the estimated COVID-related impact, global Champion sales would have increased approximately 7% over prior year. 
Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. We delivered a strong cash flow performance in the quarter. Cash flow from operations improved by $111 million over the prior year and was ahead of our forecast. The strong performance was driven by previously planned inventory reduction efforts, continued working capital discipline and timely actions taken within our manufacturing network, including planned capacity reductions as well as our [indiscernible] manufacturing facemask. 
With respect to our balance sheet, inventory declined approximately $270 million or 12% compared to last year. We ended the quarter  with nearly $1.1 billion of cash on hand and leverage was 3.6x on a net debt to adjusted EBITDA basis as compared to 3.5x last year. Our current liquidity position is strong. However, given the unpredictability of COVID-19, we want to be prudent. Therefore, we have taken 2 proactive steps to maximize our operating flexibility and further strengthen our substantial liquidity position: First, we closed on a 15-month covenant amendment on our senior secured credit facility, which includes the suspension of our leverage covenant until the end of the second quarter of 2021; and second, subject to market conditions, we intend to secure approximately $500 million of debt financing with the proceeds used to repay our revolver, therefore increasing our liquidity to nearly $1.6 billion. While these precautions may prove to be overly conservative, we want to ensure that even under our stress test scenario, we had a significant capital cushion and that we're able to maximize our operating flexibility and be well positioned to take advantage of opportunities. Due to the uncertainty and unpredictability of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the current lack of visibility in our business environment, we are not providing second quarter or full year 2020 guidance at this time. However, I would like to share a few thoughts to help frame some of our key levers within our business model. 
Currently, stores that represent approximately half of our sales are closed. We have modeled several different financial scenarios driven by the timing of these doors reopening. In our base case, we assume these stores gradually reopen beginning in late May. In our downside scenario, we assume doors began gradually reopening in early July. We even ran a stress test scenario that assumed these doors did not reopen until early October. Each one of our financial modeling scenarios indicate that the second quarter is expected to be the low point for revenue, profit and cash flow, and we're able to generate positive cash flow for the second half. 
Some of the other key assumptions that are consistent across our various modeling scenarios include: Our mass revenue comes primarily in the second quarter; we have a high 30% decremental operating margin; a tax rate of 14.5%; extended payment terms for roughly half of our receivables balance; and a net neutral effect from working capital. 
So in closing, we're in a strong position to navigate the COVID-19 environment. We have taken a number of proactive steps in terms of cost and cash flow management, identifying and ramping new source of revenue and further strengthening our substantial liquidity position, all of which we believe maximizes our operating flexibility, strengthens our long-term business model and positioned us to take advantage of current and future opportunities.

We do think that the effort we've put into building a direct business is paying back for us right now, and we're on course. And I think that we're all convinced that it's going to be an increasingly important part of our business as we go forward. So we're very pleased with that. It tells us the consumer is out there, and they're looking for our products. And I think specifically, Champion, that's a great example. Some of the the brick-and-mortar outlets went down, they found our site, and they've been buying very aggressively and that channel, looking for the brand they love. From the standpoint of the mask program, we are very pleased with the mass program as well. We got, initially, as a way to supplement a shortage of supply, working with government consortium. And much of the number that we discussed in the call was that program, which we've ramped very rapidly now, and we're  distributing to the government. We have though identified an opportunity for a consumer program as well. We've been getting questions from some of our retailers and so forth. So we're launching a Hanes mask program right now. There is a modest amount of volume in the number we quoted, which is that program as well. But looking forward, we think there is potential for this business to not only to a permanent business, but be a bigger business over time. We see the changing in consumer behavior. We see the fragmentation in the supply base, and we're getting lots of inquiries from governments around the world. This is just not American thing, this is a global need. We're getting it from governments, we're getting it from businesses as they begin to think about opening up, and we're getting it from retail and wanting to reach consumers, and there is an online possibility here as well. So these are the kind of categories that when they emerge that we think we're uniquely qualified to take and manage and, frankly, drive sales and margin. When we look across it, the opportunity to bring a trusted brand like Hanes in combination with innovation and run it through our large-scale production and sell it through our international network, really tells us this is a business to build upon."

On the supply chain side, we saw the March sort of abrupt into sales or this lockdown of markets come, we took very aggressive action in taking on our supply chain to keep our inventory in line. And as you can see from the strong cash flow and our inventory positions, inventory was an important part of delivering that cash flow. That did create some additional deleverage in the quarter, about $12 million of variances did come through as we took the time to take that down and protect the cash flow. We've since now pivoted our supply chain to making mask in many cases as well as we have demand adjusted in some of our facilities to protect the facilities and the production so that as we see demand ramping back up, we're prepared to ramp back up into that back-to-school period. And like everything else, we're planning a number of scenarios to ensure that we're ready to service the businesses around the world as they ramp up. The cash flow was an important achievement for us. We came in over $100 million lower in usage this year than last year on cash flow. And if you look at that on a 12-month basis, now that would put our operating cash flow at over $900 million, which was the objective we set out in our 2018 Investor Day. So a very important milestone, speaks very strongly to the underlying strength of the business as we emerge from this pandemic. 
From the standpoint of C9, we did launch C9 mid-March. So just not too long ago now, and it's off to a good start. We launched it fairly smally -- on a small basis with Amazon. We've seen it perform. I think we're both very -- we're both pleased with where it is, and we'll see how it ramps. It did get a little masked by all the other noise in the market, but I think it's performing up to expectations at this point."

But what I would say beyond that, as we look over the horizon, we've been thoughtful as we look in the Activewear business into narrowing our offering, working specifically with the customers that we think will reopen and ensuring that we have the sets for them, but we're not taking any risk on overhang. If we don't believe the product is going to be sold, while we are not producing it at this point in time. So we don't feel that we're going to have a lot of Activewear overhang or seasonal overhang as we look to the next season. In the instance of our bookstore business and so forth, we produce that to order for the accounts. We produce small run productions to meet the individual needs of the bookstores. So again, we feel that we're well positioned there in inventory. And as we look at our global businesses, and I'll use bonds as a great example, that's a business that is heavily retail in our own stores as well as online, and we flow goods frequently through that model. So as a result, we don't hold a lot of one specific line at any point in time. We made the appropriate adjustments. So we think we're well positioned from an inventory standpoint to ramp back up without having any real trailing inventory to deal with of any significance."

We see that the -- from the profile of it going forward, there is a very large consumer usage opportunity that's emerging. There is always been more of the medical side and so forth, but what we see is consumer behavior changing that on a global basis. And in fact, it's a mandate that's emerging for some of these markets to reopen consumer usage. So we like what we see there.

So that does give us a ramping into that back-to-school period that we would count on.

Good morning, and thank you for joining our first quarter earnings call.

Good morning, and thank you for joining our first quarter earnings call. Given the uncertainty in the market, we understand that investors are more focused on how our business is positioned to perform in both the current and post-pandemic environments. While we'll discuss our first quarter results, including our better-than-expected Innerwear performance through mid-March, our focus for today's call will be on our current business trends, our cost reduction initiatives, the creation of a new business line for cloth mask and personal protection garments and our substantial liquidity position, which we believe provides ample capital cushion even under a prolonged shelter in place scenario. This combination maximizes our operating flexibility in the current environment, strengthens our long-term earnings growth profile and positions us to take advantage of current and future opportunities. Before I speak to the quarter's results, I want to recognize the efforts and sacrifices being made by HanesBrands' employees around the world. They have allowed us to continue to serve our customers and consumers from these uncertain times. They are also the driving force behind HanesBrands' established reputation for corporate citizenship and social responsibility. As an organization, we have committed to help fight this global pandemic, which includes shipping our manufacturing to produce cotton face masks. Our employees are our greatest asset, which is why I would like to personally thank each one of them for their contributions.
Turning to our results. The first quarter was marked by 2 radically different periods as the global spread of the coronavirus accelerated in March. We experienced an unprecedented sudden drop in sales and profit late in the quarter. Although, we have seen orders resume in April. Our global shipments and sales essentially stopped in the last 2 weeks of the quarter as our customers reacted aggressively to shelter in place announcements by delaying or canceling their orders. This abrupt reaction by our customers more than offset the strong revenue and profit performance across our businesses through the second week of March, particularly within U.S. Innerwear and U.S. Activewear. Through mid-March, U.S. Innerwear revenue was down less than 1% over prior year, well ahead of our initial forecast as our turnaround initiatives were gaining momentum. During this period, point-of-sale at our top 7 customers, which is where we focused our new innovations and revitalization efforts, increased 3% in both basics and intimates. And our market share improved meaningfully in basics, bras and shapewear. And in U.S. Activewear, revenue through mid-March was up mid- to high-single digits, driven by Champion.
For the quarter, our cash flow performance was strong and ahead of our plan despite the sudden COVID-related fall off late in the quarter. Inventory reduction initiatives, timely supply chain actions and strong working capital management delivered a year-over-year improvement in cash flow from operations of more than $100 million. In the quarter, we estimate that COVID-19 impacted revenue by approximately $181 million, operating profit by approximately $86 million and earnings per share by approximately $0.20. Adjusting for the COVID-related impact, first quarter revenue would have increased 1.6% on a constant currency basis. Operating profit and operating margin would have been consistent with prior year and earnings per share would have increased 14%. Make no mistake, the COVID-19 environment is a true challenge. However, we're encouraged by our pre-COVID performance and underlying business trends. This underscores the health of our brands, the building momentum in our U.S. Innerwear business, the continued consumer demand for Champion and the strength of our cash flow model. Given the long-term stability of our categories, we're confident our business can return to these performance levels in time.
We have seen orders resume in April as consumers and retailers have begun to adapt. Online growth has rapidly accelerated each week, reaching triple-digit growth rates across a number of our customers, online platforms as well as our own champion.com and maidenform.com sites. Consumers are also buying our categories at stores within the mass, hypermarket, dollar store and drugs store channels. The basics reset at a large mass retailer is progressing, and we have back-to-school orders from some of our large customers. Over our 120-year history, we have faced a number of significant challenges. Each time, we've adapted our model, improved our position and emerged a stronger company, and we expect to do the same in light of this recent challenge.
Given the uncertainty around the reopening of global economies as well as the level of consumer spending, we modeled a number of financial scenarios. These range from a late May reopening of retail doors to an early July reopening. And we even ran a stress test scenario that assumes doors do not reopen until early October. As a result, we developed a pandemic strategy designed to maximize our operating flexibility under any of our modeling scenarios, while also strengthening our long-term business model and positioning us to take advantage of opportunities. This strategy consists of 4 initiatives: one, support our current customers; two, reduce cash-based expenditures; three, ramp new revenue opportunities; and four, ensure we have ample liquidity, even under our conservative stress test scenario.
Touching on each of these initiatives. First, we're supporting our existing customers that remain open in a safety-first manner. We're starting to see a new baseline of orders within this customer set, and we're focused on aligning our inventory and production to be able to meet their back-to-school and holiday plans. The second initiative is to reduce cash-based expenditures. We've reduced our CapEx to critical needs as well as suspended share repurchases. We're aggressively managing our working capital. We've taken a number of timely actions to reduce inventory. We're working with our suppliers to extend our payable terms and many of our largest customers continue to pay on schedule. We have also implemented approximately $200 million of cost reduction initiatives. The majority of these savings are from the temporary salary reductions and furloughs that began in mid-April. The remainder are a mix of discretionary spending areas, including media and marketing. However, we're continuing to invest media and marketing dollars within the digital channels as the pandemic is driving further penetration of online shopping. The third initiative in our pandemic strategy is to ramp our mask and protective garment business. We believe this has the potential to be a substantial contributor of incremental profit and cash flow over the next several years. Our ability to quickly shift our manufacturing operations to produce new products underscores the competitive advantages of owning our manufacturing network that is balanced across hemispheres. We are currently manufacturing reusable face masks for the U.S. government as well as launching a HanesBranded consumer program for several customers. Combined, we believe these programs can generate well over $300 million of sales in 2020.
Looking forward, there is an expectation that the COVID-19 pandemic will result in more widespread mask usage by consumers and businesses globally. Over the past several weeks, we have seen a strong influx of inquiries across a number of geographies from governments, retailers, large corporations and individual consumers. Based on the current interest from potential customers as well as the anticipated change in consumer behavior around the world, we believe our mask and protective garment business could be a sizable revenue opportunity with growth potential over the next several years.
And the fourth initiative in our pandemic strategy is to further strengthen our substantial liquidity position. While this may prove to be overly conservative, we want to be prudent and proactive, given the unpredictability of the virus. Subject to market conditions, we intend to secure approximately $500 million in debt financing with the proceeds used to repay our revolver, thereby increasing our liquidity to nearly $1.6 billion. We believe this level of liquidity provides us with an ample capital cushion even under stress test modeling scenarios.
So in closing, our brand positions are strong. Our supply chain continues to create substantial value. The combination of our pre-COVID performance and the addition of a new protective garment business points to a strong growth profile once the environment stabilizes. And we are a strong cash flow generator with ample liquidity. We believe all of this positions us to once again emerge from a challenging environment as an even stronger company, one that is well positioned to take advantage of opportunities.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Scott."

Despite the unprecedented rapid falloff in consumer demand in March due to the global pandemic, we're still able to reduce inventory, at 12% over prior year, improved cash flow from operations of more than $100 million and demonstrate that",1213,"Thanks, Gerald. Despite the unprecedented rapid falloff in consumer demand in March due to the global pandemic, we're still able to reduce inventory, at 12% over prior year, improved cash flow from operations of more than $100 million and demonstrate that we have the right turnaround plan in place for U.S. Innerwear. In addition, we identified and ramped a new business line in less than 30 days in the midst of the crisis. These are all indications of the strength and the flexibility of our business model.
Turning to our results. First quarter sales declined 12% over prior year to $1.32 billion with foreign exchange rates accounting for 135 basis points of the decline. Excluding the COVID-related impact, we estimate first quarter sales would have increased 1.6% over prior year on a constant currency basis. Adjusted gross margin of 37.6% decreased approximately 300 basis points over the last year, and more than half of the decline due to the impact from COVID-19 and foreign exchange rates. The remainder of the decline was driven by the expected transactional FX and mix related headwinds. Adjusted operating margin of 4.8% declined approximately 520 basis points. All the decline was due to the estimated $86 million impact from COVID-19, which includes an accrual for anticipated bankruptcies of approximately $11 million or $0.03 per share.
Interest and other expense declined $12 million to approximately $43 million due to lower average debt balances throughout the quarter. Restructuring and other related charges were approximately $29 million. Recall that the majority of our full year supply chain restructuring actions and program exit costs were planned for the first quarter. Our full year restructuring and other related action plans remain unchanged. In the quarter, we repurchased approximately 14.5 million shares with a vast majority purchased in February. For the remaining 3 quarters of the year, we expect average diluted shares of approximately $353 million. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.05, while GAAP earnings per share was a loss of $0.02. Excluding the estimated $0.20 per share impact from COVID-19, adjusted EPS would have increased 14% over prior year.
Now let me take you through our segment performance. In each of our segments, revenue and profit trends were at or above our expectations through early to mid-March. This performance, however, was more than offset by the sudden COVID-related falloff, particularly in the last 2 weeks of the quarter as our customers postponed or canceled orders, a reaction to shelter in place orders around the world.
Looking at the pre-COVID trends in our segments, our U.S. Innerwear segment performed well above our expectations through the second week of March as revenue was down less than 1% over prior year. During this period, we were experiencing solid trends across all channels, including strong basics outperformance within the test stores at a large mass retailer. We believe our pre-COVID performance, including point-of-sale and market share trends, demonstrate our innovations and intimates revitalization efforts are working.
Turning to U.S. Activewear. In the second week of March, revenue was tracking up mid- to high-single digits compared to prior year and was ahead of our expectations. The strong performance during this period was driven by continued demand for Champion as well as growth in our other Activewear brands, led by sports licensing in the mass and mid-tier channels and seasonal Activewear in the online channel.
Switching to our International segment. The timing of the coronavirus impact varied by country and region. On a constant currency basis, revenue through February increased at a low single-digit rate in nearly all of our main geographies. Growth in Latin America and Australia was Innerwear-driven, while Europe's growth over this time was led by Champion.
Touching briefly on our global Champion business, excluding C9, constant currency revenue for the quarter declined over prior year, both domestically and internationally. Adjusted for the estimated COVID-related impact, global Champion sales would have increased approximately 7% over prior year.
Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. We delivered a strong cash flow performance in the quarter. Cash flow from operations improved by $111 million over the prior year and was ahead of our forecast. The strong performance was driven by previously planned inventory reduction efforts, continued working capital discipline and timely actions taken within our manufacturing network, including planned capacity reductions as well as our [indiscernible] manufacturing facemask.
With respect to our balance sheet, inventory declined approximately $270 million or 12% compared to last year. We ended the quarter with nearly $1.1 billion of cash on hand and leverage was 3.6x on a net debt to adjusted EBITDA basis as compared to 3.5x last year. Our current liquidity position is strong. However, given the unpredictability of COVID-19, we want to be prudent. Therefore, we have taken 2 proactive steps to maximize our operating flexibility and further strengthen our substantial liquidity position: First, we closed on a 15-month covenant amendment on our senior secured credit facility, which includes the suspension of our leverage covenant until the end of the second quarter of 2021; and second, subject to market conditions, we intend to secure approximately $500 million of debt financing with the proceeds used to repay our revolver, therefore increasing our liquidity to nearly $1.6 billion. While these precautions may prove to be overly conservative, we want to ensure that even under our stress test scenario, we had a significant capital cushion and that we're able to maximize our operating flexibility and be well positioned to take advantage of opportunities. Due to the uncertainty and unpredictability of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the current lack of visibility in our business environment, we are not providing second quarter or full year 2020 guidance at this time. However, I would like to share a few thoughts to help frame some of our key levers within our business model.
Currently, stores that represent approximately half of our sales are closed. We have modeled several different financial scenarios driven by the timing of these doors reopening. In our base case, we assumed these doors gradually reopen beginning in late May. In our downside scenario, we assumed doors began gradually reopening in early July. We even ran a stress test scenario that assumed these doors did not reopen until early October. Each one of our financial modeling scenarios indicates that the second quarter is expected to be the low point for revenue, profit and cash flow, and that we're able to generate positive cash flow for the second half.
Some of the other key assumptions that are consistent across our various modeling scenarios include: Our mass revenue comes primarily in the second quarter; we have a high 30% decremental operating margin; a tax rate of 14.5%; extended payment terms for roughly half of our receivables balance; and a net neutral effect from working capital.
So in closing, we're in a strong position to navigate the COVID-19 environment. We have taken a number of proactive steps in terms of cost and cash flow management, identifying and ramping new source of revenue and further strengthening our substantial liquidity position, all of which we believe maximizes our operating flexibility, strengthens our long-term business model and positions us to take advantage of current and future opportunities.
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to T.C."

Maybe give us a little update there, what's happening on the Hanes side.
And then just a little bit more color on the mask program. It sounds like you think it's both a near end, maybe a more medium or long-term opportunity. Some color there in terms of what you're able to do? What types of customers you'd be working with? And is the number you put out there for this year, is that all government programs?

We are -- as we came out of April -- out of March and April, we did see orders resume with our -- in the doors that we're opening. We did see consumer behavior beginning normalize where we were selling products. And we've seen nice improvement in trends in our doors that are open across the mass channels and dollar stores and so forth. And importantly, online, to your -- specifically to your question, we've seen strong increase in sales across our categories, and I'm talking to you really globally here. We've seen generally a doubling of sales over the last few weeks to a normal level on our online sites. And in the case of champion.com, for example, we've seen a tripling of rate, and we're getting the rates that are at the Black Friday or Cyber Monday range. So we see a real strength coming. And to your -- and hanes.com as well has been delivering extraordinary results and maidenform.com as well that we just ramped last year. So we're very pleased with how they're performing. We do think that the effort we've put into building a direct business is paying back for us right now, and we're on course. And I think that we're all convinced that it's going to be an increasingly important part of our business as we go forward. So we're very pleased with that. It tells us the consumer is out there, and they're looking for our products. And I think specifically, in Champion, that's a great example. As some of the brick-and-mortar outlets went down, they found our site, and they've been buying very aggressively and that channel, looking for the brand they love.
From the standpoint of the mask program, we are very pleased with the mask program as well. We got, initially, as a way to supplement a shortage of supply, working with government consortium. And much of the number that we discussed in the call was that program, which we've ramped very rapidly now, and we're distributing to the government. We have though identified an opportunity for a consumer program as well. We've been getting questions from some of our retailers and so forth. So we're launching a Hanes mask program right now. So there is a modest amount of volume in the number we quoted, which is that program as well. But looking forward, we think there is potential for this business to not only to a permanent business, but be a bigger business over time. We see the changing in consumer behavior. We see the fragmentation in the supply base, and we're getting lots of inquiries from governments around the world. This is just not an American thing, this is a global need. We're getting it from governments, we're getting it from businesses as they begin to think about opening up, and we're getting it from retailers wanting to reach consumers, and there is an online possibility here as well. So these are the kind of categories that when they emerge that we think we're uniquely qualified to take and manage and, frankly, drive sales and margin. When we look across it, the opportunity to bring a trusted brand like Hanes in combination with innovation and run it through our large-scale production and sell it through our international network, really tells us this is a business to build upon."

On the supply chain side, we saw the March sort of abrupt end of sales or this lockdown of markets come, we took very aggressive action in taking on our supply chain to keep our inventory in line. And as you can see from the strong cash flow and our inventory positions, inventory was an important part of delivering that cash flow. That did create some additional deleverage in the quarter, about $12 million of variances did come through as we took the time to take that down and protect the cash flow. We've since now pivoted our supply chain to making mask in many cases as well as we have demand adjusted in some of our facilities to protect the facilities and the production so that as we see demand ramping back up, we're prepared to ramp back up into that back-to-school period. And like everything else, we're planning a number of scenarios to ensure that we're ready to service the businesses around the world as they ramp up. The cash flow was an important achievement for us. We came in over $100 million lower in usage this year than last year on cash flow. And if you look at that on a 12-month basis, now that would put our operating cash flow at over $900 million, which was the objective we set out in our 2018 Investor Day. So a very important milestone, speaks very strongly to this underlying strength of the business as we emerge from this pandemic.
From the standpoint of C9, we did launch C9 mid-March. So just not too long ago now, and it's off to a good start. We launched it fairly smally -- on a small basis with Amazon. We've seen it perform. I think we're both very -- we're both pleased with where it is, and we'll see how it ramps. It did get a little masked by all the other noise in the market, but I think it's performing up to expectations at this point."

But what I would say beyond that, as we look over the horizon, we've been thoughtful as we look in the Activewear business into narrowing our offering, working specifically with the customers that we think will reopen and ensuring that we have the sets for them, but we're not taking any risk on overhang. If we don't believe the product is going to be sold, while we are not producing it at this point in time. So we don't feel that we're going to have a lot of Activewear overhang or seasonal overhang as we look to the next season. In the instance of our bookstore business and so forth, we produce that to order for the accounts. We produce small run productions to meet the individual needs of the bookstores. So again, we feel that we're well positioned there in inventory. And as we look at our global businesses, and I'll use bonds as a great example, that's a business that is heavily retailed in our own stores as well as online, and we flow goods frequently through that model. So as a result, we don't hold a lot of one specific line at any point in time. We made the appropriate adjustments. So we think we're well positioned from an inventory standpoint to ramp back up without having any real trailing inventory to deal with of any significance."

From the standpoint of looking at back-to-school, as we noted in our comments, about half of our doors are open at this point in time. Certainly, the mass channels and so forth are open the dollar stores, and they are very actively planning back-to-school with us. It's a fluid situation from a standpoint of the entire account base that we have because some are still shut down at this point. But the ones that are open are very actively planning for back-to-school. We're in dialogue with the ones that are still closed and looking at multiple scenarios with those accounts as well. And as I noted in one of my prior comments, we're aligning our production under various scenarios to be able to ramp up to take advantage of that. So early days to know exactly how big back-to-school will be in total, but I think with our our key customers that are open, we're expecting a good back-to-school, and we'll plan with the others as they ramp back up.
Scott, do you want to take the second part of that question?"

So we feel we've adequately covered it from the channel standpoint. From the profile of the mask business and so forth, I'm not sure if you're asking me the size or the opportunity. We see that the -- from the profile of it going forward, there is a very large consumer usage opportunity that's emerging. There is always been more of the medical side and so forth, but what we see is consumer behavior changing that on a global basis. And in fact, it's a mandate that's emerging for some of these markets to reopen as consumer usage. So we like what we see there. And the margin profile, we think, as we run it through our our mass production capabilities could be in line with the corporate average."

The covenant does contain some additional financial covenants by maintaining minimum liquidity balance and EBITDA levels, but we're very confident that we'll maintain compliance with these covenant requirements over that period. Like Gerald mentioned earlier, we ran several different scenarios, including a stress test model, which had a prolonged shelter in place with stores not reopening until October, and we meet that covenant threshold even under that stress test financial scenario.

So that does give us a ramping into that back-to-school period that we would count on. We have generally seen it in our basics categories rebound the quickest, and these seasonal items like a Champion or something will place as the next season places, so they would place into the fall in that August-September period as well.

Good morning, and thank you for joining our first quarter earnings call.

Good morning, and thank you for joining our first quarter earnings call. Given the uncertainty in the market, we understand that investors are more focused on how our business is positioned to perform in both the current and post-pandemic environments. While we'll discuss our first quarter results, including our better-than-expected Innerwear performance through mid-March, our focus for today's call will be on our current business trends, our cost reduction initiatives, the creation of a new business line for cloth mask and personal protection garments and our substantial liquidity position, which we believe provides ample capital cushion even under a prolonged shelter in place scenario. This combination maximizes our operating flexibility in the current environment, strengthens our long-term earnings growth profile and positions us to take advantage of current and future opportunities. Before I speak to the quarter's results, I want to recognize the efforts and sacrifices being made by HanesBrands' employees around the world. They have allowed us to continue to serve our customers and consumers from these uncertain times. They are also the driving force behind HanesBrands' established reputation for corporate citizenship and social responsibility. As an organization, we have committed to help fight this global pandemic, which includes shipping our manufacturing to produce cotton face masks. Our employees are our greatest asset, which is why I would like to personally thank each one of them for their contributions.
Turning to our results. The first quarter was marked by 2 radically different periods as the global spread of the coronavirus accelerated in March. We experienced an unprecedented sudden drop in sales and profit late in the quarter. Although, we have seen orders resume in April. Our global shipments and sales essentially stopped in the last 2 weeks of the quarter as our customers reacted aggressively to the shelter in place announcements by delaying or canceling their orders. This abrupt reaction by our customers more than offset the strong revenue and profit performance across our businesses through the second week of March, particularly within U.S. Innerwear and U.S. Activewear. Through mid-March, U.S. Innerwear revenue was down less than 1% over prior year, well ahead of our initial forecast as our turnaround initiatives were gaining momentum. During this period, point-of-sale at our top 7 customers, which is where we focused our new innovations and revitalization efforts, increased 3% in both basics and intimates. And our market share improved meaningfully in basics, bras and shapewear. And in U.S. Activewear, revenue through mid-March was up mid- to high-single digits, driven by Champion.
For the quarter, our cash flow performance was strong and ahead of our plan despite the sudden COVID-related fall off late in the quarter. Inventory reduction initiatives, timely supply chain actions and strong working capital management delivered a year-over-year improvement in cash flow from operations of more than $100 million. In the quarter, we estimate that COVID-19 impacted revenue by approximately $181 million, operating profit by approximately $86 million and earnings per share by approximately $0.20. 
Adjusting for the COVID-related impact, first quarter revenue would have increased 1.6% on a constant currency basis. Operating profit and operating margin would have been consistent with prior year and earnings per share would have increased 14%. Make no mistake, the COVID-19 environment is a true challenge. However, we're encouraged by our pre-COVID performance and underlying business trends. This underscores the health of our brands, the building momentum in our U.S. Innerwear business, the continued consumer demand for Champion and the strength of our cash flow model. Given the long-term stability of our categories, we're confident our business can return to these performance levels in time.
We have seen orders resume in April as consumers and retailers have begun to adapt. Online growth has rapidly accelerated each week, reaching triple-digit growth rates across a number of our customers, online platforms as well as our own champion.com and maidenform.com sites. Consumers are also buying our categories at stores within the mass, hypermarket, dollar store and drug store channels. The basics reset at a large mass retailer is progressing and we have back-to-school orders from some of our large customers. Over our 120-year history, we have faced a number of significant challenges. Each time, we've adapted our model, improved our position and emerged a stronger company and we expect to do the same in light of this recent challenge.
Given the uncertainty around the reopening of global economies as well as the level of consumer spending, we modeled a number of financial scenarios. These range from a late May reopening of retail doors to an early July reopening. And we even ran a stress test scenario that assumes doors do not reopen until early October. As a result, we developed a pandemic strategy designed to maximize our operating flexibility under any of our modeling scenarios, while also strengthening our long-term business model and positioning us to take advantage of opportunities. This strategy consists of 4 initiatives: one, support our current customers; two, reduce cash-based expenditures; three, ramp new revenue opportunities; and four, ensure we have ample liquidity, even under our conservative stress test scenario.
Touching on each of these initiatives. First, we're supporting our existing customers that remain open in a safety-first manner. We're starting to see a new baseline of orders within this customer set and we're focused on aligning our inventory and production to be able to meet their back-to-school and holiday plans. The second initiative is to reduce cash-based expenditures. We've reduced our CapEx to critical needs as well as suspended share repurchases. We're aggressively managing our working capital. We've taken a number of timely actions to reduce inventory. We're working with our suppliers to extend our payable terms and many of our largest customers continue to pay on schedule. We have also implemented approximately $200 million of cost reduction initiatives. The majority of these savings are from the temporary salary reductions and furloughs that began in mid-April. The remainder are a mix of discretionary spending areas, including media and marketing. However, we're continuing to invest media and marketing dollars within the digital channels as the pandemic is driving further penetration of online shopping. The third initiative in our pandemic strategy is to ramp our mask and protective garment business. We believe this has the potential to be a substantial contributor of incremental profit and cash flow over the next several years. Our ability to quickly shift our manufacturing operations to produce new products underscores the competitive advantages of owning our manufacturing network that is balanced across hemispheres. We are currently manufacturing reusable face masks for the U.S. government as well as launching a HanesBranded consumer program for several customers. Combined, we believe these programs can generate well over $300 million of sales in 2020.
Looking forward, there is an expectation that the COVID-19 pandemic will result in more widespread mask usage by consumers and businesses globally. Over the past several weeks, we have seen a strong influx of inquiries across a number of geographies from governments, retailers, large corporations and individual consumers. Based on the current interest from potential customers as well as the anticipated change in consumer behavior around the world, we believe our mask and protective garment business could be a sizable revenue opportunity with growth potential over the next several years.
And the fourth initiative in our pandemic strategy is to further strengthen our substantial liquidity position. While this may prove to be overly conservative, we want to be prudent and proactive, given the unpredictability of the virus. Subject to market conditions, we intend to secure approximately $500 million in debt financing with the proceeds used to repay our revolver, thereby increasing our liquidity to nearly $1.6 billion. We believe this level of liquidity provides us with an ample capital cushion even under stress test modeling scenarios.
So in closing, our brand positions are strong. Our supply chain continues to create substantial value. The combination of our pre-COVID performance and the addition of a new protective garment business points to a strong growth profile once the environment stabilizes. And we are a strong cash flow generator with ample liquidity. We believe all of this positions us to once again emerge from a challenging environment as an even stronger company, one that is well positioned to take advantage of opportunities.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Scott."

Despite the unprecedented rapid falloff in consumer demand in March due to the global pandemic, we're still able to reduce inventory at 12% over prior year, improved cash flow from operations of more than $100 million and demonstrate that",1214,"Thanks, Gerald. Despite the unprecedented rapid falloff in consumer demand in March due to the global pandemic, we're still able to reduce inventory at 12% over prior year, improved cash flow from operations of more than $100 million and demonstrate that we have the right turnaround plan in place for U.S. Innerwear. In addition, we identified a ramped, a new business line in less than 30 days in the midst of the crisis. These are all indications of the strength and the flexibility of our business model.
Turning to our results. First quarter sales declined 12% over prior year to $1.32 billion with foreign exchange rates accounting for 135 basis points of the decline. Excluding the COVID-related impact, we estimate first quarter sales would have increased 1.6% over prior year on a constant currency basis. Adjusted gross margin of 37.6% decreased approximately 300 basis points over the last year and more than half of the decline due to the impact from COVID-19 and foreign exchange rates. The remainder of the decline was driven by the expected transactional FX and mix related headwinds. Adjusted operating margin of 4.8% declined approximately 520 basis points. All the decline was due to the estimated $86 million impact from COVID-19, which includes an accrual for anticipated bankruptcies of approximately $11 million or $0.03 per share.
Interest and other expense declined $12 million to approximately $43 million due to lower average debt balances throughout the quarter. Restructuring and other related charges were approximately $29 million. Recall that the majority of our full year supply chain restructuring actions and program exit costs were planned for the first quarter. Our full year restructuring and other related action plans remain unchanged. In the quarter, we repurchased approximately 14.5 million shares with a vast majority purchased in February. For the remaining 3 quarters of the year, we expect average diluted shares of approximately $353 million. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.05, while GAAP earnings per share was a loss of $0.02. Excluding the estimated $0.20 per share impact from COVID-19, adjusted EPS would have increased 14% over prior year.
Now let me take you through our segment performance. In each of our segments, revenue and profit trends were at or above our expectations through early to mid-March. This performance, however, was more than offset by the sudden COVID-related falloff, particularly in the last 2 weeks of the quarter as our customers postponed or canceled orders, a reaction to shelter in place orders around the world.
Looking at the pre-COVID trends in our segments, our U.S. Innerwear segment performed well above our expectations through the second week of March as revenue was down less than 1% over prior year. During this period, we were experiencing solid trends across all channels, including strong basics outperformance within the test stores at a large mass retailer. We believe our pre-COVID performance, including point-of-sale and market share trends, demonstrate our innovations and intimates revitalization efforts are working.
Turning to U.S. Activewear. In the second week of March, revenue was tracking up mid- to high-single digits compared to prior year and was ahead of our expectations. The strong performance during this period was driven by continued demand for Champion as well as growth in our other Activewear brands, led by sports licensing in the mass and mid-tier channels and seasonal Activewear in the online channel.
Switching to our International segment. The timing of the coronavirus impact varied by country and region. On a constant currency basis, revenue through February increased at a low single-digit rate in nearly all of our main geographies. Growth in Latin America and Australia was Innerwear-driven, while Europe's growth over this time was led by Champion.
Touching briefly on our global Champion business, excluding C9, constant currency revenue for the quarter declined over prior year, both domestically and internationally. Adjusted for the estimated COVID-related impact, global Champion sales would have increased approximately 7% over prior year.
Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet, we delivered a strong cash flow performance in the quarter. Cash flow from operations improved about $111 million over the prior year and was ahead of our forecast. The strong performance was driven by previously planned inventory reduction efforts, continued working capital discipline and timely actions taken within our manufacturing network, including planned capacity reductions as well as our [indiscernible] to manufacturing facemask.
With respect to our balance sheet, inventory declined approximately $270 million or 12% compared to last year. We ended the quarter with nearly $1.1 billion of cash on hand and leverage was 3.6x on a net debt to adjusted EBITDA basis as compared to 3.5x last year. Our current liquidity position is strong. However, given the unpredictability of COVID-19, we want to be prudent. Therefore, we have taken 2 proactive steps to maximize our operating flexibility and further strengthen our substantial liquidity position: First, we closed on a 15-month covenant amendment on our senior secured credit facility, which includes the suspension of our leverage covenant until the end of the second quarter of 2021; and second, subject to market conditions, we intend to secure approximately $500 million of debt financing with the proceeds used to repay our revolver, therefore increasing our liquidity to nearly $1.6 billion. While these precautions may prove to be overly conservative, we want to ensure that even under our stress test scenario, we had a significant capital cushion and that we're able to maximize our operating flexibility and be well positioned to take advantage of opportunities. Due to the uncertainty and unpredictability of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the current lack of visibility in our business environment, we are not providing second quarter or full year 2020 guidance at this time. However, I would like to share a few thoughts to help frame some of our key levers within our business model.
Currently, stores that represent approximately half of our sales are closed. We have modeled several different financial scenarios driven by the timing of these doors reopening. In our base case, we assumed these doors gradually reopen beginning in late May. In our downside scenario, we assumed doors began gradually reopening in early July. We even ran a stress test scenario that assumed these doors did not reopen until early October. Each one of our financial modeling scenarios indicates that the second quarter is expected to be the low point for revenue, profit and cash flow and that we're able to generate positive cash flow for the second half.
Some of the other key assumptions that are consistent across our various modeling scenarios include: Our mass revenue comes primarily in the second quarter; we have a high 30% decremental operating margin; a tax rate of 14.5%; extended payment terms for roughly half of our receivables balance; and a net neutral effect from working capital.
So in closing, we're in a strong position to navigate the COVID-19 environment. We have taken a number of proactive steps in terms of cost and cash flow management, identifying and ramping new source of revenue and further strengthening our substantial liquidity position, all of which we believe maximizes our operating flexibility, strengthens our long-term business model and positions us to take advantage of current and future opportunities.
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to T.C."

Maybe give us a little update there, what's happening on the Hanes side.
And then just a little bit more color on the mask program. It sounds like you think it's both a near end, maybe a more medium or long-term opportunity.

We are -- as we came out of April -- out of March and April, we did see orders resume with our -- in the doors that we're opening. We did see consumer behavior beginning normalize where we were selling products. And we've seen nice improvement in trends in our doors that are open across the mass channels and dollar stores and so forth. And importantly, online, to your -- specifically to your question, we've seen strong increase in sales across our categories and I'm talking to you really globally here. We've seen generally a doubling of sales over the last few weeks to a normal level on our online sites. And in the case of champion.com, for example, we've seen a tripling of rate and we're getting the rates that are at the Black Friday or Cyber Monday range. So we see a real strength coming. And to your -- and hanes.com as well has been delivering extraordinary results and maidenform.com as well that we just ramped last year. So we're very pleased with how they're performing. We do think that the effort we've put into building a direct business is paying back for us right now, and we're on course. And I think that we're all convinced that it's going to be an increasingly important part of our business as we go forward. So we're very pleased with that. It tells us the consumer is out there, and they're looking for our products. And I think specifically, in Champion, that's a great example. As some of the brick-and-mortar outlets went down, they found our site and they've been buying very aggressively and that channel, looking for the brand they love.
From the standpoint of the mask program, we are very pleased with the mask program as well. We got, initially, as a way to supplement a shortage of supply, working with government consortium. And much of the number that we discussed in the call was that program, which we've ramped very rapidly now and we're distributing to the government. We have though identified an opportunity for a consumer program as well. We've been getting questions from some of our retailers and so forth. So we're launching a Hanes mask program right now. So there is a modest amount of volume in the number we quoted, which is that program as well. But looking forward, we think there is potential for this business to not only to a permanent business, but be a bigger business over time. We see the changing in consumer behavior. We see the fragmentation in the supply base and we're getting lots of inquiries from governments around the world. This is just not an American thing, this is a global need. We're getting it from governments, we're getting it from businesses as they begin to think about opening up and we're getting it from retailers wanting to reach consumers and there is an online possibility here as well. So these are the kind of categories that when they emerge that we think we're uniquely qualified to take and manage and, frankly, drive sales and margin. When we look across the opportunity to bring a trusted brand like Hanes in combination with innovation and run it through our large-scale production and sell it through our international network, really tells us this is a business to build upon."

On the supply chain side, we saw the March sort of abrupt end of sales or this lockdown of markets come, we took very aggressive action in taking down our supply chain to keep our inventory in line. And as you can see from the strong cash flow and our inventory positions, inventory was an important part of delivering that cash flow. That did create some additional deleverage in the quarter, about $12 million of variances did come through as we took the time to take that down and protect the cash flow. We've since now pivoted our supply chain to making mask in many cases as well as we have demand adjusted in some of our facilities to protect the facilities and the production so that as we see demand ramping back up, we're prepared to ramp back up into that back-to-school period. And like everything else, we're planning a number of scenarios to ensure that we're ready to service the businesses around the world as they ramp up. The cash flow was an important achievement for us. We came in over $100 million lower in usage this year than last year on cash flow. And if you look at that on a 12-month basis, now that would put our operating cash flow at over $900 million, which was the objective we set out in our 2018 Investor Day. So a very important milestone, speaks very strongly to this underlying strength of the business as we emerge from this pandemic.
From the standpoint of C9, we did launch C9 mid-March. So just not too long ago now and it's off to a good start. We launched it fairly smally with -- on a small basis with Amazon. We've seen it perform. I think we're both very -- we're both pleased with where it is and we'll see how it ramps. It did get a little masked by all the other noise in the market, but I think it's performing up to expectations at this point."

But what I would say beyond that, as we look over the horizon, we've been thoughtful as we look in the Activewear business into narrowing our offering, working specifically with the customers that we think will reopen and ensuring that we have the sets for them, but we're not taking any risk on overhang. If we don't believe the product is going to be sold, while we are not producing it at this point in time. So we don't feel that we're going to have a lot of Activewear overhang or seasonal overhang as we look to the next season. In the instance of our bookstore business and so forth, we produced that to order for the accounts. We produced small-run productions to meet the individual needs of the bookstores. So we -- again, we feel that we're well positioned there in inventory. And as we look at our global businesses and I'll use bonds as a great example, that's a business that is heavily retailed in our own stores as well as online and we flow goods frequently through that model. So as a result, we don't hold a lot of one specific line at any point in time. We made the appropriate adjustments. So we think we're well positioned from an inventory standpoint to ramp back up without having any real trailing inventory to deal with of any significance."

There is always been more of the medical side and so forth, but what we see is consumer behavior changing that on a global basis.

We have generally seen it in our basics categories rebound the quickest and these seasonal items like a Champion or something will place as the next season places, so they would place into the fall in that August-September period as well. And so we feel good that our categories tend to rebound over time. We've seen consistent usage as we've always said about our categories. And we think that we will recapture that lost ground as the markets open back up."

Walmart.com in the listing of Champion, that was a deliberate focus with Walmart to stage our Champion business. On that website, there were a number of third-party sellers that were selling and positioning the brand we felt inappropriately and we were better positioned to position our brand and offering by working directly with Walmart. So that's how that got on walmart.com."

4212820,665299410,1991501,"Hanesbrands Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",2020-04-30,"Earnings Calls","Hanesbrands Inc.","Executives","Thank you, T.C. Good morning, and thank you for joining our first quarter earnings call. Given the uncertainty in the market, we understand that investors are more focused on how our business is positioned to perform in both the current and post-pandemic",1392,"Thank you, T.C. Good morning, and thank you for joining our first quarter earnings call. Given the uncertainty in the market, we understand that investors are more focused on how our business is positioned to perform in both the current and post-pandemic environments. While we'll discuss our first quarter results, including our better-than-expected Innerwear performance through mid-March, our focus for today's call will be on our current business trends, our cost reduction initiatives, the creation of a new business line for cloth mask and personal protection garments and our substantial liquidity position, which we believe provides ample capital cushion even under a prolonged shelter in place scenario. This combination maximizes our operating flexibility in the current environment, strengthens our long-term earnings growth profile and positions us to take advantage of current and future opportunities. 
Before I speak to the quarter's results, I want to recognize the efforts and sacrifices being made by HanesBrands' employees around the world. They have allowed us to continue to serve our customers and consumers from these uncertain times. They are also the driving force behind HanesBrands' established reputation for corporate citizenship and social responsibility. As an organization, we have committed to help fight this global pandemic, which includes shipping our manufacturing to produce cotton face masks. Our employees are our greatest asset, which is why I would like to personally thank each one of them for their contributions.
Turning to our results. The first quarter was marked by 2 radically different periods as the global spread of the coronavirus accelerated in March. We experienced an unprecedented sudden drop in sales and profit late in the quarter. Although, we have seen orders resume in April. Our global shipments and sales essentially stopped in the last 2 weeks of the quarter as our customers reacted aggressively to the shelter in place announcements by delaying or canceling their orders. 
This abrupt reaction by our customers more than offset the strong revenue and profit performance across our businesses through the second week of March, particularly within U.S. Innerwear and U.S. Activewear. Through mid-March, U.S. Innerwear revenue was down less than 1% over prior year, well ahead of our initial forecast as our turnaround initiatives were gaining momentum. During this period, point-of-sale at our top 7 customers, which is where we focused our new innovations and revitalization efforts, increased 3% in both basics and intimates. And our market share improved meaningfully in basics, bras and shapewear. And in U.S. Activewear, revenue through mid-March was up mid- to high-single digits, driven by Champion.
For the quarter, our cash flow performance was strong and ahead of our plan despite the sudden COVID-related fall off late in the quarter. Inventory reduction initiatives, timely supply chain actions and strong working capital management delivered a year-over-year improvement in cash flow from operations of more than $100 million. In the quarter, we estimate that COVID-19 impacted revenue by approximately $181 million, operating profit by approximately $86 million and earnings per share by approximately $0.20. 
Adjusting for the COVID-related impact, first quarter revenue would have increased 1.6% on a constant currency basis. Operating profit and operating margin would have been consistent with prior year and earnings per share would have increased 14%. Make no mistake, the COVID-19 environment is a true challenge. However, we're encouraged by our pre-COVID performance and underlying business trends. This underscores the health of our brands, the building momentum in our U.S. Innerwear business, the continued consumer demand for Champion and the strength of our cash flow model. Given the long-term stability of our categories, we're confident our business can return to these performance levels in time.
We have seen orders resume in April as consumers and retailers have begun to adapt. Online growth has rapidly accelerated each week, reaching triple-digit growth rates across a number of our customers, online platforms as well as our own champion.com and maidenform.com sites. Consumers are also buying our categories at stores within the mass, hypermarket, dollar store and drug store channels. The basics reset at a large mass retailer is progressing and we have back-to-school orders from some of our large customers. Over our 120-year history, we have faced a number of significant challenges. Each time, we've adapted our model, improved our position and emerged a stronger company and we expect to do the same in light of this recent challenge.
Given the uncertainty around the reopening of global economies as well as the level of consumer spending, we modeled a number of financial scenarios. These range from a late May reopening of retail doors to an early July reopening. And we even ran a stress test scenario that assumes doors do not reopen until early October. As a result, we developed a pandemic strategy designed to maximize our operating flexibility under any of our modeling scenarios, while also strengthening our long-term business model and positioning us to take advantage of opportunities. This strategy consists of 4 initiatives: one, support our current customers; two, reduce cash-based expenditures; three, ramp new revenue opportunities; and four, ensure we have ample liquidity, even under our conservative stress test scenario.
Touching on each of these initiatives. First, we're supporting our existing customers that remain open in a safety-first manner. We're starting to see a new baseline of orders within this customer set and we're focused on aligning our inventory and production to be able to meet their back-to-school and holiday plans. The second initiative is to reduce cash-based expenditures. We've reduced our CapEx to critical needs as well as suspended share repurchases. We're aggressively managing our working capital. We've taken a number of timely actions to reduce inventory. We're working with our suppliers to extend our payable terms and many of our largest customers continue to pay on schedule. 
We have also implemented approximately $200 million of cost reduction initiatives. The majority of these savings are from the temporary salary reductions and furloughs that began in mid-April. The remainder are a mix of discretionary spending areas, including media and marketing. However, we're continuing to invest media and marketing dollars within the digital channels as the pandemic is driving further penetration of online shopping. The third initiative in our pandemic strategy is to ramp our mask and protective garment business. We believe this has the potential to be a substantial contributor of incremental profit and cash flow over the next several years. Our ability to quickly shift our manufacturing operations to produce new products underscores the competitive advantages of owning our manufacturing network that is balanced across hemispheres. We are currently manufacturing reusable face masks for the U.S. government as well as launching a HanesBranded consumer program for several customers. Combined, we believe these programs can generate well over $300 million of sales in 2020.
Looking forward, there is an expectation that the COVID-19 pandemic will result in more widespread mask usage by consumers and businesses globally. Over the past several weeks, we have seen a strong influx of inquiries across a number of geographies from governments, retailers, large corporations and individual consumers. Based on the current interest from potential customers as well as the anticipated change in consumer behavior around the world, we believe our mask and protective garment business could be a sizable revenue opportunity with growth potential over the next several years.
And the fourth initiative in our pandemic strategy is to further strengthen our substantial liquidity position. While this may prove to be overly conservative, we want to be prudent and proactive, given the unpredictability of the virus. Subject to market conditions, we intend to secure approximately $500 million in debt financing with the proceeds used to repay our revolver, thereby increasing our liquidity to nearly $1.6 billion. We believe this level of liquidity provides us with an ample capital cushion even under stress test modeling scenarios.
So in closing, our brand positions are strong. Our supply chain continues to create substantial value. The combination of our pre-COVID performance and the addition of a new protective garment business points to a strong growth profile once the environment stabilizes. And we are a strong cash flow generator with ample liquidity. We believe all of this positions us to once again emerge from a challenging environment as an even stronger company, one that is well positioned to take advantage of opportunities.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Scott."
4212820,665299410,1991501,"Hanesbrands Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",2020-04-30,"Earnings Calls","Hanesbrands Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Gerald. Despite the unprecedented rapid falloff in consumer demand in March due to the global pandemic, we're still able to reduce inventory at 12% over prior year, improved cash flow from operations of more than $100 million and demonstrate that",1214,"Thanks, Gerald. Despite the unprecedented rapid falloff in consumer demand in March due to the global pandemic, we're still able to reduce inventory at 12% over prior year, improved cash flow from operations of more than $100 million and demonstrate that we have the right turnaround plan in place for U.S. Innerwear. In addition, we identified a ramped, a new business line in less than 30 days in the midst of the crisis. These are all indications of the strength and the flexibility of our business model.
Turning to our results. First quarter sales declined 12% over prior year to $1.32 billion with foreign exchange rates accounting for 135 basis points of the decline. Excluding the COVID-related impact, we estimate first quarter sales would have increased 1.6% over prior year on a constant currency basis. Adjusted gross margin of 37.6% decreased approximately 300 basis points over the last year and more than half of the decline due to the impact from COVID-19 and foreign exchange rates. The remainder of the decline was driven by the expected transactional FX and mix related headwinds. Adjusted operating margin of 4.8% declined approximately 520 basis points. All the decline was due to the estimated $86 million impact from COVID-19, which includes an accrual for anticipated bankruptcies of approximately $11 million or $0.03 per share.
Interest and other expense declined $12 million to approximately $43 million due to lower average debt balances throughout the quarter. Restructuring and other related charges were approximately $29 million. Recall that the majority of our full year supply chain restructuring actions and program exit costs were planned for the first quarter. Our full year restructuring and other related action plans remain unchanged. In the quarter, we repurchased approximately 14.5 million shares with a vast majority purchased in February. For the remaining 3 quarters of the year, we expect average diluted shares of approximately $353 million. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.05, while GAAP earnings per share was a loss of $0.02. Excluding the estimated $0.20 per share impact from COVID-19, adjusted EPS would have increased 14% over prior year.
Now let me take you through our segment performance. In each of our segments, revenue and profit trends were at or above our expectations through early to mid-March. This performance, however, was more than offset by the sudden COVID-related falloff, particularly in the last 2 weeks of the quarter as our customers postponed or canceled orders, a reaction to shelter in place orders around the world.
Looking at the pre-COVID trends in our segments, our U.S. Innerwear segment performed well above our expectations through the second week of March as revenue was down less than 1% over prior year. During this period, we were experiencing solid trends across all channels, including strong basics outperformance within the test stores at a large mass retailer. We believe our pre-COVID performance, including point-of-sale and market share trends, demonstrate our innovations and intimates revitalization efforts are working.
Turning to U.S. Activewear. In the second week of March, revenue was tracking up mid- to high-single digits compared to prior year and was ahead of our expectations. The strong performance during this period was driven by continued demand for Champion as well as growth in our other Activewear brands, led by sports licensing in the mass and mid-tier channels and seasonal Activewear in the online channel.
Switching to our International segment. The timing of the coronavirus impact varied by country and region. On a constant currency basis, revenue through February increased at a low single-digit rate in nearly all of our main geographies. Growth in Latin America and Australia was Innerwear-driven, while Europe's growth over this time was led by Champion.
Touching briefly on our global Champion business, excluding C9, constant currency revenue for the quarter declined over prior year, both domestically and internationally. Adjusted for the estimated COVID-related impact, global Champion sales would have increased approximately 7% over prior year.
Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet, we delivered a strong cash flow performance in the quarter. Cash flow from operations improved about $111 million over the prior year and was ahead of our forecast. The strong performance was driven by previously planned inventory reduction efforts, continued working capital discipline and timely actions taken within our manufacturing network, including planned capacity reductions as well as our [indiscernible] to manufacturing facemask.
With respect to our balance sheet, inventory declined approximately $270 million or 12% compared to last year. We ended the quarter with nearly $1.1 billion of cash on hand and leverage was 3.6x on a net debt to adjusted EBITDA basis as compared to 3.5x last year. Our current liquidity position is strong. However, given the unpredictability of COVID-19, we want to be prudent. Therefore, we have taken 2 proactive steps to maximize our operating flexibility and further strengthen our substantial liquidity position: First, we closed on a 15-month covenant amendment on our senior secured credit facility, which includes the suspension of our leverage covenant until the end of the second quarter of 2021; and second, subject to market conditions, we intend to secure approximately $500 million of debt financing with the proceeds used to repay our revolver, therefore increasing our liquidity to nearly $1.6 billion. 
While these precautions may prove to be overly conservative, we want to ensure that even under our stress test scenario, we had a significant capital cushion and that we're able to maximize our operating flexibility and be well positioned to take advantage of opportunities. Due to the uncertainty and unpredictability of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the current lack of visibility in our business environment, we are not providing second quarter or full year 2020 guidance at this time. However, I would like to share a few thoughts to help frame some of our key levers within our business model.
Currently, stores that represent approximately half of our sales are closed. We have modeled several different financial scenarios driven by the timing of these doors reopening. In our base case, we assumed these doors gradually reopen beginning in late May. In our downside scenario, we assumed doors began gradually reopening in early July. We even ran a stress test scenario that assumed these doors did not reopen until early October. Each one of our financial modeling scenarios indicates that the second quarter is expected to be the low point for revenue, profit and cash flow and that we're able to generate positive cash flow for the second half.
Some of the other key assumptions that are consistent across our various modeling scenarios include: Our mass revenue comes primarily in the second quarter; we have a high 30% decremental operating margin; a tax rate of 14.5%; extended payment terms for roughly half of our receivables balance; and a net neutral effect from working capital.
So in closing, we're in a strong position to navigate the COVID-19 environment. We have taken a number of proactive steps in terms of cost and cash flow management, identifying and ramping new source of revenue and further strengthening our substantial liquidity position, all of which we believe maximizes our operating flexibility, strengthens our long-term business model and positions us to take advantage of current and future opportunities.
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to T.C."

We are -- as we came out of April -- out of March and April, we did see orders resume with our -- in the doors that we're opening. We did see consumer behavior beginning normalize where we were selling products. And we've seen nice improvement in trends in our doors that are open across the mass channels and dollar stores and so forth. And importantly, online, to your -- specifically to your question, we've seen strong increase in sales across our categories and I'm talking to you really globally here. We've seen generally a doubling of sales over the last few weeks to a normal level on our online sites. 
And in the case of champion.com, for example, we've seen a tripling of rate and we're getting the rates that are at the Black Friday or Cyber Monday range. So we see a real strength coming. And to your -- and hanes.com as well has been delivering extraordinary results and maidenform.com as well that we just ramped last year. So we're very pleased with how they're performing. We do think that the effort we've put into building a direct business is paying back for us right now, and we're on course. And I think that we're all convinced that it's going to be an increasingly important part of our business as we go forward. So we're very pleased with that. It tells us the consumer is out there, and they're looking for our products. And I think specifically, in Champion, that's a great example. As some of the brick-and-mortar outlets went down, they found our site and they've been buying very aggressively and that channel, looking for the brand they love.
From the standpoint of the mask program, we are very pleased with the mask program as well. We got, initially, as a way to supplement a shortage of supply, working with government consortium. And much of the number that we discussed in the call was that program, which we've ramped very rapidly now and we're distributing to the government. We have though identified an opportunity for a consumer program as well. We've been getting questions from some of our retailers and so forth. So we're launching a Hanes mask program right now. So there is a modest amount of volume in the number we quoted, which is that program as well. 
But looking forward, we think there is potential for this business to not only to a permanent business, but be a bigger business over time. We see the changing in consumer behavior. We see the fragmentation in the supply base and we're getting lots of inquiries from governments around the world. This is just not an American thing, this is a global need. We're getting it from governments, we're getting it from businesses as they begin to think about opening up and we're getting it from retailers wanting to reach consumers and there is an online possibility here as well. So these are the kind of categories that when they emerge that we think we're uniquely qualified to take and manage and, frankly, drive sales and margin. When we look across the opportunity to bring a trusted brand like Hanes in combination with innovation and run it through our large-scale production and sell it through our international network, really tells us this is a business to build upon."

On the supply chain side, we saw the March sort of abrupt end of sales or this lockdown of markets come, we took very aggressive action in taking down our supply chain to keep our inventory in line. And as you can see from the strong cash flow and our inventory positions, inventory was an important part of delivering that cash flow. That did create some additional deleverage in the quarter, about $12 million of variances did come through as we took the time to take that down and protect the cash flow. We've since now pivoted our supply chain to making mask in many cases as well as we have demand adjusted in some of our facilities to protect the facilities and the production so that as we see demand ramping back up, we're prepared to ramp back up into that back-to-school period. 
And like everything else, we're planning a number of scenarios to ensure that we're ready to service the businesses around the world as they ramp up. The cash flow was an important achievement for us. We came in over $100 million lower in usage this year than last year on cash flow. And if you look at that on a 12-month basis, now that would put our operating cash flow at over $900 million, which was the objective we set out in our 2018 Investor Day. So a very important milestone, speaks very strongly to this underlying strength of the business as we emerge from this pandemic.
From the standpoint of C9, we did launch C9 mid-March. So just not too long ago now and it's off to a good start. We launched it fairly smally with -- on a small basis with Amazon. We've seen it perform. I think we're both very -- we're both pleased with where it is and we'll see how it ramps. It did get a little masked by all the other noise in the market, but I think it's performing up to expectations at this point."

But what I would say beyond that, as we look over the horizon, we've been thoughtful as we look in the Activewear business into narrowing our offering, working specifically with the customers that we think will reopen and ensuring that we have the sets for them, but we're not taking any risk on overhang. If we don't believe the product is going to be sold, while we are not producing it at this point in time. So we don't feel that we're going to have a lot of Activewear overhang or seasonal overhang as we look to the next season. 
In the instance of our bookstore business and so forth, we produced that to order for the accounts. We produced small-run productions to meet the individual needs of the bookstores. So we -- again, we feel that we're well positioned there in inventory. And as we look at our global businesses and I'll use bonds as a great example, that's a business that is heavily retailed in our own stores as well as online and we flow goods frequently through that model. So as a result, we don't hold a lot of one specific line at any point in time. We made the appropriate adjustments. So we think we're well positioned from an inventory standpoint to ramp back up without having any real trailing inventory to deal with of any significance."

But the ones that are open are very actively planning for back-to-school. We're in dialogue with the ones that are still closed and looking at multiple scenarios with those accounts as well.

From the profile of the mask business and so forth, I'm not sure if you're asking me the size or the opportunity. We see that the -- from the profile of it going forward, there is a very large consumer usage opportunity that's emerging. There is always been more of the medical side and so forth, but what we see is consumer behavior changing that on a global basis. And in fact, it's a mandate that's emerging for some of these markets to reopen as consumer usage. So we like what we see there.

The covenant does contain some additional financial covenants by maintaining minimum liquidity balance and EBITDA levels, but we're very confident that we'll maintain compliance with these covenant requirements over that period. Like Gerald mentioned earlier, we ran several different scenarios, including a stress test model, which had a prolonged shelter in place with stores not reopening until October and we meet that covenant threshold even under that stress test financial scenario.

So that does give us a ramping into that back-to-school period that we would count on. We have generally seen it in our basics categories rebound the quickest and these seasonal items like a Champion or something will place as the next season places, so they would place into the fall in that August-September period as well.

Given the uncertainty in the market, we understand that investors are more focused on how our business is positioned to perform in both the current and post-pandemic",1392,"Thank you, T.C. Good morning, and thank you for joining our first quarter earnings call. Given the uncertainty in the market, we understand that investors are more focused on how our business is positioned to perform in both the current and post-pandemic environments. While we'll discuss our first quarter results, including our better-than-expected Innerwear performance through mid-March, our focus for today's call will be on our current business trends, our cost reduction initiatives, the creation of a new business line for cloth mask and personal protection garments and our substantial liquidity position, which we believe provides ample capital cushion even under a prolonged shelter in place scenario. This combination maximizes our operating flexibility in the current environment, strengthens our long-term earnings growth profile and positions us to take advantage of current and future opportunities. 
Before I speak to the quarter's results, I want to recognize the efforts and sacrifices being made by HanesBrands' employees around the world. They have allowed us to continue to serve our customers and consumers from these uncertain times. They are also the driving force behind HanesBrands' established reputation for corporate citizenship and social responsibility. As an organization, we have committed to help fight this global pandemic, which includes shipping our manufacturing to produce cotton face masks. Our employees are our greatest asset, which is why I would like to personally thank each one of them for their contributions.
Turning to our results. The first quarter was marked by 2 radically different periods as the global spread of the coronavirus accelerated in March. We experienced an unprecedented sudden drop in sales and profit late in the quarter. Although, we have seen orders resume in April. Our global shipments and sales essentially stopped in the last 2 weeks of the quarter as our customers reacted aggressively to the shelter in place announcements by delaying or canceling their orders. 
This abrupt reaction by our customers more than offset the strong revenue and profit performance across our businesses through the second week of March, particularly within U.S. Innerwear and U.S. Activewear. Through mid-March, U.S. Innerwear revenue was down less than 1% over prior year, well ahead of our initial forecast as our turnaround initiatives were gaining momentum. During this period, point-of-sale at our top 7 customers, which is where we focused our new innovations and revitalization efforts, increased 3% in both basics and intimates. And our market share improved meaningfully in basics, bras and shapewear. And in U.S. Activewear, revenue through mid-March was up mid- to high-single digits, driven by Champion.
For the quarter, our cash flow performance was strong and ahead of our plan despite the sudden COVID-related fall off late in the quarter. Inventory reduction initiatives, timely supply chain actions and strong working capital management delivered a year-over-year improvement in cash flow from operations of more than $100 million. In the quarter, we estimate that COVID-19 impacted revenue by approximately $181 million, operating profit by approximately $86 million and earnings per share by approximately $0.20. 
Adjusting for the COVID-related impact, first quarter revenue would have increased 1.6% on a constant currency basis. Operating profit and operating margin would have been consistent with prior year and earnings per share would have increased 14%. Make no mistake, the COVID-19 environment is a true challenge. However, we're encouraged by our pre-COVID performance and underlying business trends. This underscores the health of our brands, the building momentum in our U.S. Innerwear business, the continued consumer demand for Champion and the strength of our cash flow model. Given the long-term stability of our categories, we're confident our business can return to these performance levels in time.
We have seen orders resume in April as consumers and retailers have begun to adapt. Online growth has rapidly accelerated each week, reaching triple-digit growth rates across a number of our customers, online platforms as well as our own champion.com and maidenform.com sites. Consumers are also buying our categories at stores within the mass, hypermarket, dollar store and drug store channels. The basics reset at a large mass retailer is progressing and we have back-to-school orders from some of our large customers. Over our 120-year history, we have faced a number of significant challenges. Each time, we've adapted our model, improved our position and emerged a stronger company and we expect to do the same in light of this recent challenge.
Given the uncertainty around the reopening of global economies as well as the level of consumer spending, we modeled a number of financial scenarios. These range from a late May reopening of retail doors to an early July reopening. And we even ran a stress test scenario that assumes doors do not reopen until early October. As a result, we developed a pandemic strategy designed to maximize our operating flexibility under any of our modeling scenarios, while also strengthening our long-term business model and positioning us to take advantage of opportunities. This strategy consists of 4 initiatives: one, support our current customers; two, reduce cash-based expenditures; three, ramp new revenue opportunities; and four, ensure we have ample liquidity, even under our conservative stress test scenario.
Touching on each of these initiatives. First, we're supporting our existing customers that remain open in a safety-first manner. We're starting to see a new baseline of orders within this customer set and we're focused on aligning our inventory and production to be able to meet their back-to-school and holiday plans. The second initiative is to reduce cash-based expenditures. We've reduced our CapEx to critical needs as well as suspended share repurchases. We're aggressively managing our working capital. We've taken a number of timely actions to reduce inventory. We're working with our suppliers to extend our payable terms and many of our largest customers continue to pay on schedule. 
We have also implemented approximately $200 million of cost reduction initiatives. The majority of these savings are from the temporary salary reductions and furloughs that began in mid-April. The remainder are a mix of discretionary spending areas, including media and marketing. However, we're continuing to invest media and marketing dollars within the digital channels as the pandemic is driving further penetration of online shopping. The third initiative in our pandemic strategy is to ramp our mask and protective garment business. We believe this has the potential to be a substantial contributor of incremental profit and cash flow over the next several years. Our ability to quickly shift our manufacturing operations to produce new products underscores the competitive advantages of owning our manufacturing network that is balanced across hemispheres. We are currently manufacturing reusable face masks for the U.S. government as well as launching a HanesBranded consumer program for several customers. Combined, we believe these programs can generate well over $300 million of sales in 2020.
Looking forward, there is an expectation that the COVID-19 pandemic will result in more widespread mask usage by consumers and businesses globally. Over the past several weeks, we have seen a strong influx of inquiries across a number of geographies from governments, retailers, large corporations and individual consumers. Based on the current interest from potential customers as well as the anticipated change in consumer behavior around the world, we believe our mask and protective garment business could be a sizable revenue opportunity with growth potential over the next several years.
And the fourth initiative in our pandemic strategy is to further strengthen our substantial liquidity position. While this may prove to be overly conservative, we want to be prudent and proactive, given the unpredictability of the virus. Subject to market conditions, we intend to secure approximately $500 million in debt financing with the proceeds used to repay our revolver, thereby increasing our liquidity to nearly $1.6 billion. We believe this level of liquidity provides us with an ample capital cushion even under stress test modeling scenarios.
So in closing, our brand positions are strong. Our supply chain continues to create substantial value. The combination of our pre-COVID performance and the addition of a new protective garment business points to a strong growth profile once the environment stabilizes. And we are a strong cash flow generator with ample liquidity. We believe all of this positions us to once again emerge from a challenging environment as an even stronger company, one that is well positioned to take advantage of opportunities.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Scott."
4212820,665299410,2019956,"Hanesbrands Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",2020-04-30,"Earnings Calls","Hanesbrands Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Gerald. Despite the unprecedented rapid falloff in consumer demand in March due to the global pandemic, we're still able to reduce inventory at 12% over prior year, improved cash flow from operations of more than $100 million and demonstrate that",1214,"Thanks, Gerald. Despite the unprecedented rapid falloff in consumer demand in March due to the global pandemic, we're still able to reduce inventory at 12% over prior year, improved cash flow from operations of more than $100 million and demonstrate that we have the right turnaround plan in place for U.S. Innerwear. In addition, we identified a ramped, a new business line in less than 30 days in the midst of the crisis. These are all indications of the strength and the flexibility of our business model.
Turning to our results. First quarter sales declined 12% over prior year to $1.32 billion with foreign exchange rates accounting for 135 basis points of the decline. Excluding the COVID-related impact, we estimate first quarter sales would have increased 1.6% over prior year on a constant currency basis. Adjusted gross margin of 37.6% decreased approximately 300 basis points over the last year and more than half of the decline due to the impact from COVID-19 and foreign exchange rates. The remainder of the decline was driven by the expected transactional FX and mix related headwinds. Adjusted operating margin of 4.8% declined approximately 520 basis points. All the decline was due to the estimated $86 million impact from COVID-19, which includes an accrual for anticipated bankruptcies of approximately $11 million or $0.03 per share.
Interest and other expense declined $12 million to approximately $43 million due to lower average debt balances throughout the quarter. Restructuring and other related charges were approximately $29 million. Recall that the majority of our full year supply chain restructuring actions and program exit costs were planned for the first quarter. Our full year restructuring and other related action plans remain unchanged. In the quarter, we repurchased approximately 14.5 million shares with a vast majority purchased in February. For the remaining 3 quarters of the year, we expect average diluted shares of approximately $353 million. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.05, while GAAP earnings per share was a loss of $0.02. Excluding the estimated $0.20 per share impact from COVID-19, adjusted EPS would have increased 14% over prior year.
Now let me take you through our segment performance. In each of our segments, revenue and profit trends were at or above our expectations through early to mid-March. This performance, however, was more than offset by the sudden COVID-related falloff, particularly in the last 2 weeks of the quarter as our customers postponed or canceled orders, a reaction to shelter in place orders around the world.
Looking at the pre-COVID trends in our segments, our U.S. Innerwear segment performed well above our expectations through the second week of March as revenue was down less than 1% over prior year. During this period, we were experiencing solid trends across all channels, including strong basics outperformance within the test stores at a large mass retailer. We believe our pre-COVID performance, including point-of-sale and market share trends, demonstrate our innovations and intimates revitalization efforts are working.
Turning to U.S. Activewear. In the second week of March, revenue was tracking up mid- to high-single digits compared to prior year and was ahead of our expectations. The strong performance during this period was driven by continued demand for Champion as well as growth in our other Activewear brands, led by sports licensing in the mass and mid-tier channels and seasonal Activewear in the online channel.
Switching to our International segment. The timing of the coronavirus impact varied by country and region. On a constant currency basis, revenue through February increased at a low single-digit rate in nearly all of our main geographies. Growth in Latin America and Australia was Innerwear-driven, while Europe's growth over this time was led by Champion.
Touching briefly on our global Champion business, excluding C9, constant currency revenue for the quarter declined over prior year, both domestically and internationally. Adjusted for the estimated COVID-related impact, global Champion sales would have increased approximately 7% over prior year.
Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet, we delivered a strong cash flow performance in the quarter. Cash flow from operations improved about $111 million over the prior year and was ahead of our forecast. The strong performance was driven by previously planned inventory reduction efforts, continued working capital discipline and timely actions taken within our manufacturing network, including planned capacity reductions as well as our [indiscernible] to manufacturing facemask.
With respect to our balance sheet, inventory declined approximately $270 million or 12% compared to last year. We ended the quarter with nearly $1.1 billion of cash on hand and leverage was 3.6x on a net debt to adjusted EBITDA basis as compared to 3.5x last year. Our current liquidity position is strong. However, given the unpredictability of COVID-19, we want to be prudent. Therefore, we have taken 2 proactive steps to maximize our operating flexibility and further strengthen our substantial liquidity position: First, we closed on a 15-month covenant amendment on our senior secured credit facility, which includes the suspension of our leverage covenant until the end of the second quarter of 2021; and second, subject to market conditions, we intend to secure approximately $500 million of debt financing with the proceeds used to repay our revolver, therefore increasing our liquidity to nearly $1.6 billion. 
While these precautions may prove to be overly conservative, we want to ensure that even under our stress test scenario, we had a significant capital cushion and that we're able to maximize our operating flexibility and be well positioned to take advantage of opportunities. Due to the uncertainty and unpredictability of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the current lack of visibility in our business environment, we are not providing second quarter or full year 2020 guidance at this time. However, I would like to share a few thoughts to help frame some of our key levers within our business model.
Currently, stores that represent approximately half of our sales are closed. We have modeled several different financial scenarios driven by the timing of these doors reopening. In our base case, we assumed these doors gradually reopen beginning in late May. In our downside scenario, we assumed doors began gradually reopening in early July. We even ran a stress test scenario that assumed these doors did not reopen until early October. Each one of our financial modeling scenarios indicates that the second quarter is expected to be the low point for revenue, profit and cash flow and that we're able to generate positive cash flow for the second half.
Some of the other key assumptions that are consistent across our various modeling scenarios include: Our mass revenue comes primarily in the second quarter; we have a high 30% decremental operating margin; a tax rate of 14.5%; extended payment terms for roughly half of our receivables balance; and a net neutral effect from working capital.
So in closing, we're in a strong position to navigate the COVID-19 environment. We have taken a number of proactive steps in terms of cost and cash flow management, identifying and ramping new source of revenue and further strengthening our substantial liquidity position, all of which we believe maximizes our operating flexibility, strengthens our long-term business model and positions us to take advantage of current and future opportunities.
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to T.C."

We are -- as we came out of April -- out of March and April, we did see orders resume with our -- in the doors that we're opening. We did see consumer behavior beginning normalize where we were selling products. And we've seen nice improvement in trends in our doors that are open across the mass channels and dollar stores and so forth. And importantly, online, to your -- specifically to your question, we've seen strong increase in sales across our categories and I'm talking to you really globally here. We've seen generally a doubling of sales over the last few weeks to a normal level on our online sites. 
And in the case of champion.com, for example, we've seen a tripling of rate and we're getting the rates that are at the Black Friday or Cyber Monday range. So we see a real strength coming. And to your -- and hanes.com as well has been delivering extraordinary results and maidenform.com as well that we just ramped last year. So we're very pleased with how they're performing. We do think that the effort we've put into building a direct business is paying back for us right now, and we're on course. And I think that we're all convinced that it's going to be an increasingly important part of our business as we go forward. So we're very pleased with that. It tells us the consumer is out there, and they're looking for our products. And I think specifically, in Champion, that's a great example. As some of the brick-and-mortar outlets went down, they found our site and they've been buying very aggressively and that channel, looking for the brand they love.
From the standpoint of the mask program, we are very pleased with the mask program as well. We got, initially, as a way to supplement a shortage of supply, working with government consortium. And much of the number that we discussed in the call was that program, which we've ramped very rapidly now and we're distributing to the government. We have though identified an opportunity for a consumer program as well. We've been getting questions from some of our retailers and so forth. So we're launching a Hanes mask program right now. So there is a modest amount of volume in the number we quoted, which is that program as well. 
But looking forward, we think there is potential for this business to not only to a permanent business, but be a bigger business over time. We see the changing in consumer behavior. We see the fragmentation in the supply base and we're getting lots of inquiries from governments around the world. This is just not an American thing, this is a global need. We're getting it from governments, we're getting it from businesses as they begin to think about opening up and we're getting it from retailers wanting to reach consumers and there is an online possibility here as well. So these are the kind of categories that when they emerge that we think we're uniquely qualified to take and manage and, frankly, drive sales and margin. When we look across the opportunity to bring a trusted brand like Hanes in combination with innovation and run it through our large-scale production and sell it through our international network, really tells us this is a business to build upon."

On the supply chain side, we saw the March sort of abrupt end of sales or this lockdown of markets come, we took very aggressive action in taking down our supply chain to keep our inventory in line. And as you can see from the strong cash flow and our inventory positions, inventory was an important part of delivering that cash flow. That did create some additional deleverage in the quarter, about $12 million of variances did come through as we took the time to take that down and protect the cash flow. We've since now pivoted our supply chain to making mask in many cases as well as we have demand adjusted in some of our facilities to protect the facilities and the production so that as we see demand ramping back up, we're prepared to ramp back up into that back-to-school period. 
And like everything else, we're planning a number of scenarios to ensure that we're ready to service the businesses around the world as they ramp up. The cash flow was an important achievement for us. We came in over $100 million lower in usage this year than last year on cash flow. And if you look at that on a 12-month basis, now that would put our operating cash flow at over $900 million, which was the objective we set out in our 2018 Investor Day. So a very important milestone, speaks very strongly to this underlying strength of the business as we emerge from this pandemic.
From the standpoint of C9, we did launch C9 mid-March. So just not too long ago now and it's off to a good start. We launched it fairly smally with -- on a small basis with Amazon. We've seen it perform. I think we're both very -- we're both pleased with where it is and we'll see how it ramps. It did get a little masked by all the other noise in the market, but I think it's performing up to expectations at this point."

If we don't believe the product is going to be sold, while we are not producing it at this point in time. So we don't feel that we're going to have a lot of Activewear overhang or seasonal overhang as we look to the next season. 
In the instance of our bookstore business and so forth, we produced that to order for the accounts. We produced small-run productions to meet the individual needs of the bookstores. So we -- again, we feel that we're well positioned there in inventory. And as we look at our global businesses and I'll use bonds as a great example, that's a business that is heavily retailed in our own stores as well as online and we flow goods frequently through that model. So as a result, we don't hold a lot of one specific line at any point in time. We made the appropriate adjustments.

The discretionary spending focus right now is reducing that in every place that we can, especially very focused on media and marketing reducing spending in those areas."

So we feel we've adequately covered it from the channel standpoint. 
From the profile of the mask business and so forth, I'm not sure if you're asking me the size or the opportunity. We see that the -- from the profile of it going forward, there is a very large consumer usage opportunity that's emerging. There is always been more of the medical side and so forth, but what we see is consumer behavior changing that on a global basis. And in fact, it's a mandate that's emerging for some of these markets to reopen as consumer usage. So we like what we see there. And the margin profile, we think, as we run it through our mass production capabilities could be in line with the corporate average."

The covenant does contain some additional financial covenants by maintaining minimum liquidity balance and EBITDA levels, but we're very confident that we'll maintain compliance with these covenant requirements over that period. Like Gerald mentioned earlier, we ran several different scenarios, including a stress test model, which had a prolonged shelter in place with stores not reopening until October and we meet that covenant threshold even under that stress test financial scenario.

So we feel good about back-to-school and those will be well positioned and we anticipate that we'll see some opening of some other of these channels, at least, as you heard in our scenarios, by late -- early July at the latest, which would still reach that back-to-school period. 
So that does give us a ramping into that back-to-school period that we would count on. We have generally seen it in our basics categories rebound the quickest and these seasonal items like a Champion or something will place as the next season places, so they would place into the fall in that August-September period as well. And so we feel good that our categories tend to rebound over time. We've seen consistent usage as we've always said about our categories.

But as you heard me also say that consumers find in Champion online and they're going out and finding that as well. Walmart.com in the listing of Champion, that was a deliberate focus with Walmart to stage our Champion business.

With my retirement next week after 37 years with Hanesbrands, this will be my last quarterly earnings call as CEO. This quarter, I have never been more proud of this organization and our employees' ability to rise to the occasion and meet",1122,"Thank you, T.C. With my retirement next week after 37 years with Hanesbrands, this will be my last quarterly earnings call as CEO. This quarter, I have never been more proud of this organization and our employees' ability to rise to the occasion and meet challenges to deliver exceptional performance, even in the midst of a devastating pandemic. 
Despite the economic disruption of COVID-19 around the globe, Hanesbrands delivered strong second quarter results, driven by better-than-expected performance in both our apparel and our new PPE businesses. For the quarter, revenue increased 6%, operating profit increased 41%, earnings per share increased 58%, and we generated $65 million of operating cash flow. Our strong second quarter performance in one of the most challenging retail and consumer environments in decades underscores the strength of our brand portfolio the agility of our organization, the scale of our company-owned supply chain and the cash-generating power of our business model. 
In my view, there are 4 key highlights in the quarter that speak to the strength of our underlying model. And our ability to grow this business going forward. First, our apparel business outperformed; second, the organization quickly pivoted to create a new PPE business; third, we generated positive cash flow; and fourth, we ended the quarter with $1.8 billion of liquidity. 
Touching on our apparel business performance, which excludes PPE, our strong second quarter results were meaningfully ahead of our base case scenario in each of our 3 main segments: U.S. Innerwear, U.S. Activewear and international. Point-of-sale trends improved sequentially through the second quarter in all of our key geographies, with the positive momentum carrying into July, as consumers settle into new routines, stimulus initiatives were rolled out, and retail doors reopened around the world. In fact, point-of-sale in our U.S. basics and Champion businesses in May and June exceeded pre-COVID levels. 
In U.S. Innerwear, point-of-sale trends accelerated through the quarter. Moving from down 29% in April to up 8% in May and up 11% in June. We experienced strong momentum in our basics business with mid-teens point-of-sale growth, yielding more than 300 basis points of market share gains in the quarter. Within our intimates business, point-of-sale returned to essentially flat in June and improved to up 3% in July, regaining its pre-COVID momentum as the mid-tier and department store channels reopened. 
We experienced a similar trend in our Champion business within the U.S. Activewear segment. In the quarter, Champion point-of-sale accelerated from down 14% in April to up nearly 40% in May and up more than 70% in June as consumers continue to actively seek out the brand, particularly within the online channel. With store reopenings underway in our international business, we saw monthly progression within our Innerwear businesses in Europe and Australia as well as within our Champion businesses in Europe and Asia. 
Strength in our online business continued globally in the second quarter, with sales up more than 70% over prior year. We experienced strong growth across our key regions in the quarter, with triple-digit online growth at some of our largest customers and nearly 200% growth on our newly enhanced champion.com website. Within our apparel business, which excludes PPE, online represented over 30% of total sales in the quarter. 
We are encouraged by the strong POS trends, which we believe points to the improving shipment and revenue trends in our apparel business as we move through the second half and into next year. 
Turning to the second highlight of the quarter. Our newly created PPE business generated over $750 million of revenue. This was well ahead of our initial expectation as we benefited from additional government contracts for both mask and reusable gowns, and we were able to fulfill demand for a number of businesses. 
We recently launched our consumer PPE facemask business at retail. We expect to generate more than $150 million of additional PPE revenue in the second half of the year. Looking forward, we continue to believe this consumer product line represents a meaningful ongoing business opportunity. 
The third highlight of the quarter was cash flow, as we generated $65 million of cash flow from operations. Year-to-date, operating cash flow was $40 million better than last year. With the majority of retail doors closed for half the quarter, this performance speaks to the cash-generating power of our model and the discipline of the organization to aggressively manage operating costs and working capital. We continue to expect to generate positive operating cash flow for the second half of the year. 
And finally, in terms of liquidity, we said on our last call that our focus in this environment was on managing cash while positioning the company to be able to take advantage of opportunities. This focus allowed us to capture stronger-than-expected demand for our products in the quarter as well as maintain our dividend. We ended the quarter with $1.8 billion of liquidity, which we believe provides us ample capital to maximize our operating flexibility and positions us to grow the business going forward. 
Looking ahead, there remains uncertainty about the extent and pace of reopening economies in the midst of COVID-19, and we are planning accordingly. Absent any rollbacks of store reopenings, we expect year-over-year revenue trends in our apparel business to improve sequentially in the second half. Our core brands are healthy. We are gaining market share. Point-of-sale trends remain strong. Our back-to-school and holiday plans are set and initial spring '21 bookings of Global Champion are up meaningfully over prior year in each region. We believe the positive underlying trends in our business, both prior to and during the pandemic, positions us for growth in a post pandemic environment. 
So in closing, we delivered a strong quarter in a very challenging global environment. Momentum is building in our apparel business, and we believe we have ample liquidity. We believe our diversified global business model continues to position us to drive growth and take advantage of opportunities over the next several years. 
Before I turn the call over, I'd like to take a moment to wish those of you from the investment community the best in the years ahead. I've enjoyed getting to know you and exchanging points of view over the years. To the Hanesbrands team, it's been an honor to be part of the HBI family for so many years. Together, we built a company and successfully expanded it to be a global leader in our categories. These are things that could only be achieved by the determined efforts of 60,000 team members around the world pulling together. I look forward to watching Hanesbrands continue to prosper under the leadership of Steve Bratspies in the years ahead. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Scott."
4212820,676268949,2051136,"Hanesbrands Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2020",2020-07-30,"Earnings Calls","Hanesbrands Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Gerald. Our strong second quarter results, including double-digit growth and adjusted and GAAP EPS, underscore the earnings and cash flow leverage, our vertically integrated business model can generate. Sales for the quarter were $1.74 billion,",1320,"Thanks, Gerald. Our strong second quarter results, including double-digit growth and adjusted and GAAP EPS, underscore the earnings and cash flow leverage, our vertically integrated business model can generate. 
Sales for the quarter were $1.74 billion, which includes $752 million of PPE revenue. As compared to last year, sales increased 6% on a reported basis and 7% on a constant currency basis. Excluding PPE, apparel revenue declined approximately 40% over prior year. This is well ahead of our expectation and accounted for more than half of the upside in the quarter relative to our base case scenario.
Adjusted gross margin of 37.9% [ decreased ] approximately 180 basis points over last year. Approximately 50 basis points of the decline was the result of deleverage from minimum royalty payments in our sports license business. 
The remainder of the decline was driven by COVID related door closings, which had a greater sales impact on our core international and our Champion U.S. Activewear business. As a reminder, these businesses carry higher gross margins, but they also carry higher SG&A expense. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased approximately 430 basis points over prior year to 17.5%. Higher sales drove meaningful SG&A leverage, which was further benefited by our temporary cost savings initiatives. 
Interest and other expense declined $8 million over prior year to approximately $47 million due primarily to lower average rates in the quarter. Restructuring and other related charges were approximately $63 million in the quarter. Our planned supply chain restructuring actions and program exit costs, which remain unchanged, accounted for $11 million of these costs. The remaining approximately $52 million are nonrecurring COVID related costs in the quarter, which are noncash. These include a $20 million intangible asset write down, $11 million of bad debt expense and approximately $21 million of inventory adjustments primarily related to canceled orders from retailers for seasonal product we already made. 
The tax rate of 17.8% was higher than our expectation as better-than-expected performance in U.S. Innerwear and PPE resulted in a higher mix of U.S. profit in the quarter. Adjusted and GAAP earnings per share increased 58% and 12% over prior year to $0.60 and $0.46, respectively. 
Now let me take you through our segment performance. From a high level, all of our segments experienced a similar progression through the quarter. We saw significant year-over-year pressure in April, as regions sheltered in place. This was followed by sequential improvement in May and June as consumers shifted to open channels, including online and closed stores began to reopen. For the quarter, U.S. Innerwear sales increased approximately 67% over prior year, while the operating margin expanded by 550 basis points to 27.8%. Both revenue and operating profit exceeded our base case scenario, driven by better-than-expected sales in both our core Innerwear and new PPE businesses, a significant fixed cost leverage from higher sales and by lower SG&A expense due to our temporary cost reduction initiatives. 
Adjusting for sales from our PPE business, core U.S. Innerwear performed significantly better than our base case scenario. Core revenue declined approximately 27% over prior year, with basics down 18% and intimates down 52%. These better than base case results were driven by the strong performance of our basics and intimate businesses, within the channels that remain open as well as the reopening of mid-tier and department store channels late in the quarter. On the back and improved point-of-sale during the quarter, we have seen booking trends in both basics and intimate strengthened through July. 
Turning to U.S. Activewear. Revenue declined 52% over prior year, which was better than our base case scenario. The year-over-year decline was due to [indiscernible] related door closures as well as school closings and [indiscernible] group events that significantly impacted our sportsapparel and printwear businesses. As expected, Activewear's operating margin declined over prior year. Deleverage from lower sales, deleveraged from minimum royalty payments in our sports license business. And our decision to hold Champion marketing investment flat over prior year more than offset our temporary cost savings initiatives. 
While Champion experienced headwinds due to COVID related channel closures, we are encouraged by the accelerating point-of-sale trends through the quarter and the continued POS strength in July. We believe this underscores a consumer's ongoing desire for the brand and points to improving revenue trends going forward. 
Switching to our International segment. Revenue is well ahead of our base case scenario. As compared to last year, revenue declined approximately 20% on a reported basis and 17% on a constant currency basis. Adjusting for PPE sales, core international revenue declined 44% as compared to the prior year. The better than base case performance in our core international business was driven by online as well as the performance of our company-owned stores as they reopened. 
The International segment operating margin of 17.3% increased 310 basis points over prior year, driven by lower SG&A costs as we benefited from various temporary cost savings initiatives. 
Touching briefly on our global Champion business. Excluding C9, revenue declined 46% over prior year with declines in both our domestic and international businesses. Like other parts of our business, global Champion was hindered by closures of our company-owned stores and channel partner doors early in the quarter. As doors reopen, global Champion trends improved through the quarter with momentum continuing through July, reinforcing our expectation for sequential improvement in Champion sales through the balance of the year. 
Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. We delivered strong cash flow performance in the quarter, generating $65 million of cash flow from operations. Year-to-date, operating cash flow was approximately $40 million above last year. The strong performance was driven by previously planned inventory reduction efforts, temporary cost savings initiatives, continued working capital discipline and timely actions taken within our manufacturing network. 
With respect to our balance sheet, inventory declined approximately $265 million or 12% compared to last year. Leverage was 3.4x on a net debt to adjusted EBITDA basis, down from 3.5x last year. And we ended the quarter with approximately $1.8 billion of liquidity, which we believe provides us with significant capital cushion in this uncertain environment. 
Due to the uncertainty and unpredictability of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the current lack of visibility in our business environment, we are not providing third quarter or full year 2020 guidance at this time. However, I would like to share a few thoughts to help frame some of the key levers within our business model. 
Looking at our apparel business, which excludes PPE, revenue declined approximately 40% over prior year in the second quarter. After any rollbacks of store reopenings, we currently foresee an environment for the year-over-year decline in our apparel business to improve sequentially in both the third and fourth quarter. With respect to our PPE business, we currently expect more than a $150 million of PPE revenue in the second half, the vast majority of which is expected in the third quarter. 
While we continue to tightly manage SG&A expenses, the amount of temporary cost savings from the second quarter are currently not expected to repeat in the second half. Combined with lower overall unit and sales volume, we believe it is reasonable to assume year-over-year pressure on margins in both the third and fourth quarters. 
With respect to our tax rate, we currently expect a rate of approximately 17.5% for the second half. And in terms of cash flow, we continue to expect to generate positive cash flow in the second half of the year. 
So in closing, we delivered strong second quarter results. Our balance sheet is healthy, and we believe we have ample liquidity. While there remains a significant amount of uncertainty, we are encouraged by the positive underlying momentum in our apparel business, which we believe points to return to pre-COVID levels in our business once the pandemic has passed. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to T.C."

I wanted to ask my one question around PPE, this new business that you have, $752 million. Could you dive in a little bit more? How much of that is government? Was any of that consumer in the quarter? Is there any recurring element to the government side of it? And then how do we think about the consumer piece? Is it mostly a mask business and wholesale versus DTC? And then if you could also talk about on the manufacturing side, how you're able to switch over your manufacturing? Are there kind of nuances and complexities investors should be aware of? And then is it easy to switch it back as the traditional Innerwear business ramps back up again and you need to use that capacity? How easy is it to build additional capacity, kind of all of that kind of discussion around that PPE business, I think, would be really helpful."

And I would just say, first, we're just delighted with how to the quarter came out, and we exceeded our expectations. And certainly, the PPE portion you're asking about, but also meaningfully in our apparel business, and it's just an extraordinary effort by the organization in total. So we're very pleased with it. From the PPE standpoint, that business within the quarter was predominantly government and there was business-to-business element of it as well. We did add some more contracts on the government side in mask and gowns late in the quarter, which caused the over-delivery on that side as well as businesses began to open up, in particular, they were seeking mask for their employees and so forth. As I noted in my comments, as we're moving now into the third quarter, we are focusing on shipping our consumer businesses that are showing up at retail and that was over $150 million number we put out for the balance of the year. Those are in-store now, heavily under the Hanes name, but also under the Champion name, selling through extremely well, very strong reaction to those businesses as well. Our research tells us the consumer is really looking for a trusted brand and innovation, and it's right up our alley and good response. And so we're pleased with that. And I think that alone could be a $200 million to $300 million kind of business on an annualized basis. In the future. Relative to future government business, there certainly could be additional opportunities out there, and we'll certainly seek those as the opportunity emerges. But those would be incremental and opportunistic at this point relative to our guidance on the consumer side of things. 
From the standpoint of manufacturing, certainly, to ramp at the pace we did in Q2, we used internal production and used outside production as well to bring up a very quick ramp to the total production. As it's come down to a more level production for the consumer side of things, we've fallen back into our own manufacturing facilities. And that's not a big switch for us. It's very similar in production to our panty or underwear products, and we make them alongside in the same facilities, and we can certainly support that going forward. There's not a capital-intensive move on our part. So we find it very complementary to what we already do. So with the change in consumer behavior and the emerging mandates by states, we feel this could be a business that goes on for a long period of time."

We completed the placement -- the replacement of their underwear department, and we captured space there and we've seen nice performance as that's come through the placement. I would say, overall, we gained 300 basis points of share in basics, and it was across a number of areas. It was across socks. It was across women's panties, and it was across underwear. And certainly, underwear benefiting from that retail space expansion. So there's a lot of activity there. We can now see our back-to-school bookings, and they're solid as well. And then back-to-school is a very important period for our Innerwear businesses. In addition, we can all see all the way out to holiday, and we see a nice increase in holiday bookings at this point in time.

Certainly, from the standpoint of Champion, early in the second quarter with much of the specialty and department stores channels closed, Champion saw very nice growth online. And as we mentioned, we had a 40% increase, for example, in the U.S. in our POS relative to prior year, driven heavily by online. That's online in third-party brick-and-mortar, where we were seeing sometime triple-digit rates in the U.S. as well as our own champion.com, which you may recall, we just sort of upgraded. It was in the 200% increase level. If I take you internationally, we saw as the markets reopen, the brand also ramped very quickly back to sort of pre-COVID, kind of, momentum and it ramped very nicely. All that momentum is carried for us into early July as we look forward. I did mention in my comments that we can now see farther out, even as far as into next year and our bookings have been very favorable there. And there's no doubt that the retailers witnessed the strength around the world of Champion even online, as markets were closing and has created a lot of interest in our brand. They clearly see that the consumer is pursuing the brand, even when channels are closed. They're pursuing it online. So there's a lot of momentum in that business. And so those bookings were very favorable as we look to the spring of next year, and it was around the world. It was no one market, it was a global market. I would add to that, that we still anticipate our Champion second partner ramping their stores and Champion in the second half of this year. They've already brought our online business on. In China, we've seen very nice growth there online as well. So there's just a lot of energy in Champion. We remain very bullish on our ability to reach our $3 billion goal over time."

If I take the store question first, POS is -- the traffic is generally ramped back at a sequentially improving pace, as we we've opened the doors, most of the doors. And recall, we have Champion doors around the world. So there's no one answer to this. Some are faster than others. But if I give you a couple, for example, in Europe where in Italy stores reopened, late May and June. We saw the traffic began to ramp nicely as soon as they were open. It's not yet and generally back to last year's levels, but it's ramping nicely. In Australia, we have a few Champion stores there as well as many bond stores. As the markets open, we saw a very quick ramp back in traffic there, approaching last year's levels. And the U.S. has been sort of a mix of both of those. It's a little slower. But in our outlet stores -- our U.S. outlet stores, the traffic has been a little slower, but we've seen higher conversion. So the shoppers that come in all those channels are very determined, and they're buying more in general as they come to the stores. So generally, I would summarize a little slower traffic and maybe a little higher conversion in total. 
From the standpoint of capital investment in our online, we don't expect dramatic capital investment to support our growth here. Remember, our growth coming from a combination of working very carefully with the large pure-play and brick-and-mortar players that are out there, and that's always been a wholesale business for us directly to their warehouses, and they handle it. In our surging or growing online here, we have plenty of distribution space. We've done -- we spent the last year or so investing in our systems and upgrading our systems, and we believe those are scalable with a reasonable investment."

Is there any help you could kind of give us for the back half of Q3, Q4? I mean, obviously, you're not going to have as much of an SG&A decline, but should dollars still be down? I mean, just kind of curious on how we should think about the expense dollars in the business that things have reopened? And then just the second question is just on PPE. It's a great revenue stream business for you guys. I guess, just trying to think about that business into next year and beyond. I mean, I think we're probably all hopeful that we're not wearing masks this time next year. Just how do we think about how much of that revenue is really sticky? And how we should think about that revenue base as we move into next year? That would be really helpful."

So regarding our SG&A spending and our cost-saving initiatives, one of our key priorities as the crisis emerged, was reducing our cash-based expenses. So that was really important to us as we manage cash and our liquidity balances. And so as we think about the second half of the year, again, of course, we're not giving specific guidance for the rest of the year because there is a -- we're still in the middle of the pandemic, and there's still a lot of uncertainty there. As you think about SG&A, again, we're going to continue to tightly manage our spending in the second half. And we do expect some of our cost savings to flow through the second half, but they won't be nearly as much as we saw in the second quarter. And it's also important to note, as you think about the back half of the year, and as Gerald was mentioning earlier, with our core apparel trends improving and sequentially improving the rest of the year. As the business improves and continues to recover, we're naturally going to see our spending levels increase to support our business. A good example of that is our investment in our brands."

So from that standpoint, I don't expect that mix to change dramatically in the near term, going forward. The economics of the pure-play and the brick-and-mortar is very similar to our wholesale economics. It's a wholesale sale, as we've so often said, and it's very similar to our wholesale business. We've also worked on the economics of our own sites as well, and they're quite attractive from the standpoint of how we're performing.

But again, we're working closely with our customers and managing the balances there. And we feel really good about the progress that we've made in the quarter with our customers as far as the collection efforts in those balances. We feel really good about that. The reports to the PPE business and the receivable balance, again, the $752 million of revenue that flowed through the quarter, a lot of that was later in the quarter.

From the standpoint of the back-to-school, we've got good view to that. We're right in the middle of it right now. And I think when you think about back-to-school, it's most important to our basics business in Innerwear and from Champion. It's certainly a replenishable item as well. What we saw is even in the worst of the pandemic lockdown, when that online picked up the business for both basics. As you heard in my comments, we were up year-over-year in Champion and in basics in that may, June period. So we have good view to it from the standpoint of bookings. We can see our secondary displays with our retailers, much of the basics business is a mask business. So we feel like we're well fixed to sell the business.

4212820,676268949,2051303,"Hanesbrands Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2020",2020-07-30,"Earnings Calls","Hanesbrands Inc.","Executives","Thank you, T.C. With my retirement next week after 37 years with Hanesbrands, this will be my last quarterly earnings call as CEO. This quarter, I have never been more proud of this organization and our employees' ability to rise to the occasion and meet",1122,"Thank you, T.C. With my retirement next week after 37 years with Hanesbrands, this will be my last quarterly earnings call as CEO. This quarter, I have never been more proud of this organization and our employees' ability to rise to the occasion and meet challenges to deliver exceptional performance, even in the midst of a devastating pandemic.  
Despite the economic disruption of COVID-19 around the globe, Hanesbrands delivered strong second quarter results, driven by better-than-expected performance in both our apparel and our new PPE businesses. 
For the quarter, revenue increased 6%, operating profit increased 41%, earnings per share increased 58%, and we generated $65 million of operating cash flow. Our strong second quarter performance in one of the most challenging retail and consumer environments in decades underscores the strength of our brand portfolio, the agility of our organization, the scale of our company-owned supply chain and the cash-generating power of our business model.  
In my view, there are 4 key highlights in the quarter that speak to the strength of our underlying model. And our ability to grow this business going forward. First, our apparel business outperformed; second, the organization quickly pivoted to create a new PPE business; third, we generated positive cash flow; and fourth, we ended the quarter with $1.8 billion of liquidity.  
Touching on our apparel business performance, which excludes PPE, our strong second quarter results were meaningfully ahead of our base case scenario in each of our 3 main segments: U.S. Innerwear, U.S. Activewear and international. 
Point-of-sale trends improved sequentially through the second quarter in all of our key geographies, with the positive momentum carrying into July, as consumers settled into new routines, stimulus initiatives were rolled out, and retail doors reopened around the world. In fact, point-of-sale in our U.S. Basics and Champion businesses in May and June exceeded pre-COVID levels.  
In U.S. Innerwear, point-of-sale trends accelerated through the quarter. Moving from down 29% in April to up 8% in May and up 11% in June. We experienced strong momentum in our Basics business with mid-teens point-of-sale growth, yielding more than 300 basis points of market share gains in the quarter. Within our Intimates business, point-of-sale returned to essentially flat in June and improved to up 3% in July, regaining its pre-COVID momentum as the mid-tier and department store channels reopened.  
We experienced a similar trend in our Champion business within the U.S. Activewear segment. In the quarter, Champion point-of-sale accelerated from down 14% in April to up nearly 40% in May and up more than 70% in June as consumers continued to actively seek out the brand, particularly within the online channel. With store reopenings underway in our International business, we saw monthly progression within our Innerwear businesses in Europe and Australia as well as within our Champion businesses in Europe and Asia.  
Strength in our Online business continued globally in the second quarter, with sales up more than 70% over prior year. We experienced strong growth across our key regions in the quarter, with triple-digit online growth at some of our largest customers and nearly 200% growth on our newly enhanced champion.com website. Within our Apparel business, which excludes PPE, online represented over 30% of total sales in the quarter.  
We are encouraged by the strong POS trends, which we believe points to the improving shipment and revenue trend in our Apparel business as we move through the second half and into next year.  
Turning to the second highlight of the quarter. Our newly created PPE business generated over $750 million of revenue. This was well ahead of our initial expectation as we benefited from additional government contracts for both mask and reusable gowns, and we were able to fulfill demand for a number of businesses.  
We recently launched our consumer PPE facemask business at retail. We expect to generate more than $150 million of additional PPE revenue in the second half of the year. Looking forward, we continue to believe this consumer product line represents a meaningful ongoing business opportunity.  
The third highlight of the quarter was cash flow, as we generated $65 million of cash flow from operations. Year-to-date, operating cash flow was $40 million better than last year. With the majority of retail doors closed for half the quarter, this performance speaks to the cash-generating power of our model and the discipline of the organization to aggressively manage operating cost and working capital. We continue to expect to generate positive operating cash flow for the second half of the year.  
And finally, in terms of liquidity, we said on our last call that our focus in this environment was on managing cash while positioning the company to be able to take advantage of opportunities. This focus allowed us to capture stronger-than-expected demand for our products in the quarter as well as maintain our dividend. We ended the quarter with $1.8 billion of liquidity, which we believe provides us ample capital to maximize our operating flexibility and positions us to grow the business going forward.  
Looking ahead, there remains uncertainty about the extent and pace of reopening economies in the midst of COVID-19, and we are planning accordingly. Absent any rollbacks of store reopenings, we expect year-over-year revenue trends in our Apparel business to improve sequentially in the second half. Our core brands are healthy. We are gaining market share. Point-of-sale trends remain strong. Our back-to-school and holiday plans are set and initial spring '21 bookings of Global Champion are up meaningfully over prior year in each region. We believe the positive underlying trends in our business, both prior to and during the pandemic, positions us for growth in a post pandemic environment.  
So in closing, we delivered a strong quarter in a very challenging global environment. Momentum is building in our Apparel business, and we believe we have ample liquidity. We believe our diversified global business model continues to position us to drive growth and take advantage of opportunities over the next several years.  
Before I turn the call over, I'd like to take a moment to wish those of you from the investment community, the best in the years ahead. I've enjoyed getting to know you and exchanging points of view over the years. To the Hanesbrands team, it's been an honor to be part of the HBI family for so many years. Together, we built a company and successfully expanded it to be a global leader in our categories. These are things that could only be achieved by the determined efforts of 60,000 team members around the world pulling together. I look forward to watching Hanesbrands continue to prosper under the leadership of Steve Bratspies in the years ahead. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Scott."
4212820,676268949,2051303,"Hanesbrands Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2020",2020-07-30,"Earnings Calls","Hanesbrands Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Gerald. Our strong second quarter results, including double-digit growth and adjusted and GAAP EPS, underscore the earnings and cash flow leverage, our vertically integrated business model can generate.  Sales for the quarter were $1.74 billion,",1329,"Thanks, Gerald. Our strong second quarter results, including double-digit growth and adjusted and GAAP EPS, underscore the earnings and cash flow leverage, our vertically integrated business model can generate.  
Sales for the quarter were $1.74 billion, which includes $752 million of PPE revenue. As compared to last year, sales increased 6% on a reported basis and 7% on a constant currency basis. Excluding PPE, Apparel revenue declined approximately 40% over prior year. This is well ahead of our expectation and accounted for more than half of the upside in the quarter relative to our base case scenario.
Adjusted gross margin of 37.9% decreased approximately 180 basis points over the last year. Approximately 50 basis points of the decline was the result of deleverage from minimum royalty payments in our sports license business.  
The remainder of the decline was driven by COVID related door closings, which had a greater sales impact on our core international and our Champion and U.S. Activewear businesses. As a reminder, these businesses carry higher gross margins, but they also carry higher SG&A expense. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased approximately 430 basis points over prior year to 17.5%. Higher sales drove meaningful SG&A leverage, which was further benefited by our temporary cost savings initiatives.  
Interest and other expense declined $8 million over prior year to approximately $47 million due primarily to lower average rates in the quarter. Restructuring and other related charges were approximately $63 million in the quarter. Our planned supply chain restructuring actions and program exit costs, which remain unchanged, accounted for $11 million of these costs. The remaining approximately $52 million are nonrecurring COVID related costs in the quarter, which are noncash. These include a $20 million intangible asset write down, $11 million of bad debt expense and approximately $21 million of inventory adjustments primarily related to canceled orders from retailers for seasonal product we already made.  
The tax rate of 17.8% was higher than our expectation as better-than-expected performance in U.S. Innerwear and PPE resulted in a higher mix of U.S. profit in the quarter. And adjusted and GAAP earnings per share increased 58% and 12% over prior year to $0.60 and $0.46, respectively.  
Now let me take you through our segment performance. From a high level, all of our segments experienced a similar progression through the quarter. We saw significant year-over-year pressure in April, as regions sheltered in place. This was followed by sequential improvement in May and June as consumers shifted to open channels, including online and closed stores began to reopen. 
For the quarter, U.S. Innerwear sales increased approximately 67% over the prior year, while the operating margin expanded nearly 550 basis points to 27.8%. Both revenue and operating profit exceeded our base case scenario, driven by better-than-expected sales in both our core Innerwear and new PPE businesses, our significant fixed cost leverage from higher sales and by lower SG&A expense due to our temporary cost reduction initiatives.  
Adjusting for sales from our PPE business, core U.S. Innerwear performed significantly better than our base case scenario. Core revenue declined approximately 27% over prior year, with Basics down 18% and Intimates down 52%. These better than base case results were driven by the strong performance of our Basics and Intimates businesses, within the channels that remain open as well as the reopening of mid-tier and department store channels late in the quarter. On the back of improved point-of-sale during the quarter, we have seen booking trends in both Basics and Intimates strengthen through July.  
Turning to U.S. Activewear. Revenue declined 52% over prior year, which was better than our base case scenario. The year-over-year decline was due to COVID related door closures as well as school closings and fewer group events that significantly impacted our Sports Apparel and Printwear businesses. 
As expected, Activewear's operating margin declined over prior year. Deleveraged from lower sales, deleveraged from minimum royalty payments in our Sports License business. And our decision to hold Champion marketing investment flat over prior year more than offset our temporary cost savings initiatives.  
While Champion experienced headwinds due to COVID related channel closures, we were encouraged by the accelerating point-of-sale trends through the quarter and a continued POS strength in July. We believe this underscores the consumers' ongoing desire for the brand and points to improving revenue trends going forward.  
Switching to our International segment. Revenue is well ahead of our base case scenario. As compared to last year, revenue declined approximately 20% on a reported basis and 17% on a constant currency basis. Adjusting for PPE sales, core International revenue declined 44% as compared to the prior year. The better than base case performance in our core International business was driven by online as well as the performance of our company-owned stores as they reopened.  
The International segment's operating margin of 17.3% increased 310 basis points over prior year, driven by lower SG&A costs as we benefited from various temporary cost savings initiatives.  
Touching briefly on our Global Champion business. Excluding C9, revenue declined 46% over prior year with declines in both our domestic and international businesses. Like other parts of our business, Global Champion was hindered by closures of our company-owned stores and channel partner doors early in the quarter. As doors reopened, Global Champion trends improved through the quarter with momentum continuing through July, reinforcing our expectation for sequential improvement in Champion sales through the balance of the year.  
Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. We delivered a strong cash flow performance in the quarter, generating $65 million of cash flow from operations. Year-to-date, operating cash flow was approximately $40 million above last year. The strong performance was driven by previously planned inventory reduction efforts, temporary cost savings initiatives, continued working capital discipline and timely actions taken within our manufacturing network.  
With respect to our balance sheet, inventory declined approximately $265 million or 12% compared to last year. Leverage was 3.4x on a net debt to adjusted EBITDA basis, down from 3.5x last year. And we ended the quarter with approximately $1.8 billion of liquidity, which we believe provides us with significant cash -- capital cushion in this uncertain environment.  
Due to the uncertainty and unpredictability of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the current lack of visibility in our business environment, we are not providing third quarter or full year 2020 guidance at this time. However, I will like to share a few thoughts to help frame some of the key levers within our business model.  
Looking at our Apparel business, which excludes PPE, revenue declined approximately 40% over prior year in the second quarter. Absent any rollbacks of store reopenings, we currently foresee an environment for the year-over-year decline in our Apparel business to improve sequentially in both this third and fourth quarter. With respect to our PPE business, we currently expect more than a $150 million of PPE revenue in the second half, the vast majority of which is expected in the third quarter.  
While we continue to tightly manage SG&A expenses, the amount of temporary cost savings from the second quarter are currently not expected to repeat in the second half. Combined with a lower overall unit and sales volume, we believe it is reasonable to assume year-over-year pressure on margins in both this third and fourth quarters.  
Now with respect to our tax rate, we currently expect a rate of approximately 17.5% for the second half. And in terms of cash flow, we continue to expect to generate positive cash flow in the second half of the year.  
So in closing, we delivered strong second quarter results. Our balance sheet is healthy, and we believe we have ample liquidity. While there remains a significant amount of uncertainty, we are encouraged by the positive underlying momentum in our Apparel business, which we believe points to a return to pre-COVID levels in our business once the pandemic has passed. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to T.C."

I wanted to ask my one question around PPE, this new business that you have, $752 million. Could you dive in a little bit more? How much of that is government? Was any of that consumer in the quarter? Is there any recurring element to the government side of it? And then how do we think about the consumer piece? Is it mostly a mask business and wholesale versus DTC? And then if you could also talk about on the manufacturing side, how you're able to switch over your manufacturing? Are there kind of nuances and complexities investors should be aware of? 
And then is it easy to switch it back as the traditional Innerwear business ramps back up again and you need to use that capacity? How easy is it to build additional capacity, kind of all of that kind of discussion around that PPE business, I think, would be really helpful."

And I would just say, first, we're just delighted with how the big quarter came out, and we exceeded our expectations. And certainly, the PPE portion you're asking about, but also meaningfully in our Apparel business, and it's just an extraordinary effort by the organization in total. 
So we're very pleased with it. From the PPE standpoint, that business within the quarter was predominantly government and there was business-to-business element of it as well. We did add some more contracts on the government side in mask and gowns late in the quarter, which caused the over-delivery on that side as well as businesses began to open up, in particular, they were seeking mask for their employees and so forth. 
As I noted in my comments, as we're moving now into the third quarter, we are focusing on shipping our consumer businesses that are showing up at retail and that was over $150 million number we put out for the balance of the year. Those are in-store now, heavily under the Hanes name, but also under the Champion name, selling through extremely well, very strong reaction to those businesses as well. Our research tells us the consumer is really looking for a trusted brand and innovation, and it's right up our alley and good response. And so we're pleased with that. And I think that alone could be a $200 million to $300 million kind of business on an annualized basis in the future. 
Relative to future government business, there, certainly, could be additional opportunities out there, and we'll certainly seek those as the opportunity emerges. But those would be incremental and opportunistic at this point relative to our guidance on the consumer side of things.  
From the standpoint of manufacturing, certainly, to ramp at the pace we did in Q2, we used internal production and used outside production as well to bring up a very quick ramp to the total production. As it's come down to a more level production for the consumer side of things, we've fallen back into our own manufacturing facilities. And that's not a big switch for us. It's very similar in production to our panty or underwear products, and we make them alongside in the same facilities, and we can certainly support that going forward. This is not a capital-intensive move on our part. So we find it very complementary to what we already do. So with the change in consumer behavior and the emerging mandates by states, we feel this could be a business that goes on for a long period of time."

We completed the placement -- the replacement of their underwear department, and we captured space there and we've seen nice performance as that's come through the placement. 
I would say, overall, we gained 300 basis points of share in Basics, and it was across a number of areas. It was across socks, it was across women's panties, and it was across underwear. And certainly, underwear benefiting from that retail space expansion. So there's a lot of activity there. We can now see our back-to-school bookings, and they're solid as well. And then back-to-school is a very important period for our Innerwear businesses. 
In addition, we can all see all the way out to holiday, and we see a nice increase in holiday bookings at this point in time.

Certainly, from the standpoint of Champion, early in the second quarter with much of the specialty and department stores channels closed, Champion saw very nice growth online. And as we mentioned, we had a 40% increase, for example, in the U.S. in our POS relative to prior year, driven heavily by online. That's online in third-party brick-and-mortar, where we were seeing sometime triple-digit rates in the U.S. as well as our own champion.com, which you may recall, we just sort of upgraded. It was in the 200% increase level. If I take you internationally, we saw as the markets reopened, the brand also ramped very quickly back to sort of pre-COVID, kind of, momentum and it ramped very nicely. 
And all of that momentum is carried for us into early July as we look forward. I did mention in my comments that we can now see farther out, even as far as into next year and our bookings have been very favorable there. And there's no doubt that the retailers witnessed the strength around the world of Champion even online, as markets were closed and it has created a lot of interest in our brand. They clearly see that the consumer is pursuing the brand, even when channels are closed. They're pursuing it online. So there's a lot of momentum in that business. And so those bookings were very favorable as we look to the spring of next year, and it was around the world. It was no one market, it was a global market. 
I would add to that, that we still anticipate our Champion second partner ramping their stores and Champion in the second half of this year. They've already brought our online business on. In China, we've seen very nice growth there online as well. So there's just a lot of energy in Champion. We remain very bullish on our ability to reach our $3 billion goal over time."

So we -- that obviously -- the answer is we would lean on inventory, and we're ramping back up to match demand on the Innerwear side of things.

We're ramping that production as well, and what we expect is a nice sequential improvement in Champion in Q3.

It's -- if I take the store question first, POS is -- or the traffic is generally ramped back at a sequentially improving pace, as we we've opened the doors, most of the doors. And you'll recall, we have Champion doors around the world. So there's no one answer to this. Some are faster than others. But if I give you a couple, for example, in Europe where in Italy stores reopened, late May and the June. We saw the traffic began to ramp nicely as soon as they were open. It's not yet and generally back to last year's levels, but it's ramping nicely. 
In Australia, we have a few Champion stores there as well as many bond stores. As the markets open, we saw a very quick ramp back in traffic there, approaching last year's levels. And the U.S. has been sort of a mix of both of those. It's a little slower. But in our outlet stores -- our U.S. outlet stores, the traffic has been a little slower, but we've seen higher conversion. So the shoppers that come in all those channels are very determined, and they're buying more in general as they come to the stores. So generally, I would summarize a little slower traffic and maybe a little higher conversion in total.  
From the standpoint of capital investment in our online, we don't expect dramatic capital investment to support our growth here. Remember, our growth's coming from a combination of working very carefully with the large pure-play and brick-and-mortar players that are out there, and that's always been a wholesale business for us directly to their warehouses, and they handle it. And our surging or growing online here, we have plenty of distribution space. We've done -- we spent the last year or so investing in our systems and upgrading our systems, and we believe those are scalable with a reasonable investment."

And we do expect some of our cost savings to flow through the second half, but they won't be nearly as much as we saw in the second quarter. And it's also important to note, as you think about the back half of the year, and as Gerald was mentioning earlier, with our core apparel trends improving and sequentially improving the rest of the year. As the business improves and continues to recover, we're naturally going to see our spending levels increase to support our business. A good example of that is our investment in our brands."

So from that standpoint, I don't expect that mix to change dramatically in the near term, going forward. The economics of the pure-play and the brick-and-mortar is very similar to our wholesale economics. It's a wholesale sale, as we've so often said, and it's very similar to our wholesale business. 
We've also worked on the economics of our own sites as well, and they're quite attractive from the standpoint of how we're performing.

But again, we're working closely with our customers and managing the balances there. 
And feel really good about the progress that we've made in the quarter with our customers as far as the collection efforts in those balances. We feel really good about that. The reports that the PPE business and the receivable balance, again, the $752 million of revenue that flowed through the quarter, a lot of that was later in the quarter. And so we do have a larger receivable balance at the end of the quarter. You'll notice that in the cash flow statement, the use for receivables was up more than it normally is.

From the standpoint of the back-to-school, we've got good view to that. We're right in the middle of it right now. And I think when you think about back-to-school, it's most important to our Basics business and Innerwear and from Champion, it's certainly a replenishable item as well. 
What we saw is even in the worst of the pandemic lockdown, when that online picked up the business for both Basics, and as you heard in my comments, we were up year-over-year in Champion and in Basics in that May, June period. So we have good view to it from the standpoint of bookings. We can see our secondary displays with our retailers, much of the Basics business is a mask business. So we feel like we're well fixed to sell the business. In the event -- in the unexpected event that there could be a lockdown of certain channels, we think we're well positioned to pick that up online.

4212820,676268949,2091232,"Hanesbrands Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2020",2020-07-30,"Earnings Calls","Hanesbrands Inc.","Executives","Thank you, T.C. With my retirement next week after 37 years with Hanesbrands, this will be my last quarterly earnings call as CEO. This quarter, I have never been more proud of this organization and our employees' ability to rise to the occasion and meet",1122,"Thank you, T.C. With my retirement next week after 37 years with Hanesbrands, this will be my last quarterly earnings call as CEO. This quarter, I have never been more proud of this organization and our employees' ability to rise to the occasion and meet challenges to deliver exceptional performance, even in the midst of a devastating pandemic. 
Despite the economic disruption of COVID-19 around the globe, Hanesbrands delivered strong second quarter results, driven by better-than-expected performance in both our apparel and our new PPE businesses. 
For the quarter, revenue increased 6%, operating profit increased 41%, earnings per share increased 58%, and we generated $65 million of operating cash flow. Our strong second quarter performance in one of the most challenging retail and consumer environments in decades underscores the strength of our brand portfolio, the agility of our organization, the scale of our company-owned supply chain and the cash-generating power of our business model. 
In my view, there are 4 key highlights in the quarter that speak to the strength of our underlying model. And our ability to grow this business going forward. First, our apparel business outperformed; second, the organization quickly pivoted to create a new PPE business; third, we generated positive cash flow; and fourth, we ended the quarter with $1.8 billion of liquidity. 
Touching on our apparel business performance, which excludes PPE, our strong second quarter results were meaningfully ahead of our base case scenario in each of our 3 main segments: U.S. Innerwear, U.S. Activewear and international. 
Point-of-sale trends improved sequentially through the second quarter in all of our key geographies, with the positive momentum carrying into July, as consumers settled into new routines, stimulus initiatives were rolled out, and retail doors reopened around the world. In fact, point-of-sale in our U.S. Basics and Champion businesses in May and June exceeded pre-COVID levels. 
In U.S. Innerwear, point-of-sale trends accelerated through the quarter. Moving from down 29% in April to up 8% in May and up 11% in June. We experienced strong momentum in our Basics business with mid-teens point-of-sale growth, yielding more than 300 basis points of market share gains in the quarter. Within our Intimates business, point-of-sale returned to essentially flat in June and improved to up 3% in July, regaining its pre-COVID momentum as the mid-tier and department store channels reopened. 
We experienced a similar trend in our Champion business within the U.S. Activewear segment. In the quarter, Champion point-of-sale accelerated from down 14% in April to up nearly 40% in May and up more than 70% in June as consumers continued to actively seek out the brand, particularly within the online channel. With store reopenings underway in our International business, we saw monthly progression within our Innerwear businesses in Europe and Australia as well as within our Champion businesses in Europe and Asia. 
Strength in our Online business continued globally in the second quarter, with sales up more than 70% over prior year. We experienced strong growth across our key regions in the quarter, with triple-digit online growth at some of our largest customers and nearly 200% growth on our newly enhanced champion.com website. Within our Apparel business, which excludes PPE, online represented over 30% of total sales in the quarter. 
We are encouraged by the strong POS trends, which we believe points to the improving shipment and revenue trend in our Apparel business as we move through the second half and into next year. 
Turning to the second highlight of the quarter. Our newly created PPE business generated over $750 million of revenue. This was well ahead of our initial expectation as we benefited from additional government contracts for both mask and reusable gowns, and we were able to fulfill demand for a number of businesses. 
We recently launched our consumer PPE facemask business at retail. We expect to generate more than $150 million of additional PPE revenue in the second half of the year. Looking forward, we continue to believe this consumer product line represents a meaningful ongoing business opportunity. 
The third highlight of the quarter was cash flow, as we generated $65 million of cash flow from operations. Year-to-date, operating cash flow was $40 million better than last year. With the majority of retail doors closed for half the quarter, this performance speaks to the cash-generating power of our model and the discipline of the organization to aggressively manage operating cost and working capital. We continue to expect to generate positive operating cash flow for the second half of the year. 
And finally, in terms of liquidity, we said on our last call that our focus in this environment was on managing cash while positioning the company to be able to take advantage of opportunities. This focus allowed us to capture stronger-than-expected demand for our products in the quarter as well as maintain our dividend. We ended the quarter with $1.8 billion of liquidity, which we believe provides us ample capital to maximize our operating flexibility and positions us to grow the business going forward. 
Looking ahead, there remains uncertainty about the extent and pace of reopening economies in the midst of COVID-19, and we are planning accordingly. Absent any rollbacks of store reopenings, we expect year-over-year revenue trends in our Apparel business to improve sequentially in the second half. Our core brands are healthy. We are gaining market share. Point-of-sale trends remain strong. Our back-to-school and holiday plans are set and initial spring '21 bookings of Global Champion are up meaningfully over prior year in each region. We believe the positive underlying trends in our business, both prior to and during the pandemic, positions us for growth in a post pandemic environment. 
So in closing, we delivered a strong quarter in a very challenging global environment. Momentum is building in our Apparel business, and we believe we have ample liquidity. We believe our diversified global business model continues to position us to drive growth and take advantage of opportunities over the next several years. 
Before I turn the call over, I'd like to take a moment to wish those of you from the investment community, the best in the years ahead. I've enjoyed getting to know you and exchanging points of view over the years. To the Hanesbrands team, it's been an honor to be part of the HBI family for so many years. Together, we built a company and successfully expanded it to be a global leader in our categories. These are things that could only be achieved by the determined efforts of 60,000 team members around the world pulling together. I look forward to watching Hanesbrands continue to prosper under the leadership of Steve Bratspies in the years ahead. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Scott."
4212820,676268949,2091232,"Hanesbrands Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2020",2020-07-30,"Earnings Calls","Hanesbrands Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Gerald. Our strong second quarter results, including double-digit growth and adjusted and GAAP EPS, underscore the earnings and cash flow leverage, our vertically integrated business model can generate. Sales for the quarter were $1.74 billion,",1329,"Thanks, Gerald. Our strong second quarter results, including double-digit growth and adjusted and GAAP EPS, underscore the earnings and cash flow leverage, our vertically integrated business model can generate. 
Sales for the quarter were $1.74 billion, which includes $752 million of PPE revenue. As compared to last year, sales increased 6% on a reported basis and 7% on a constant currency basis. Excluding PPE, Apparel revenue declined approximately 40% over prior year. This is well ahead of our expectation and accounted for more than half of the upside in the quarter relative to our base case scenario.
Adjusted gross margin of 37.9% decreased approximately 180 basis points over the last year. Approximately 50 basis points of the decline was the result of deleverage from minimum royalty payments in our sports license business. 
The remainder of the decline was driven by COVID related door closings, which had a greater sales impact on our core international and our Champion and U.S. Activewear businesses. As a reminder, these businesses carry higher gross margins, but they also carry higher SG&A expense. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased approximately 430 basis points over prior year to 17.5%. Higher sales drove meaningful SG&A leverage, which was further benefited by our temporary cost savings initiatives. 
Interest and other expense declined $8 million over prior year to approximately $47 million due primarily to lower average rates in the quarter. Restructuring and other related charges were approximately $63 million in the quarter. Our planned supply chain restructuring actions and program exit costs, which remain unchanged, accounted for $11 million of these costs. The remaining approximately $52 million are nonrecurring COVID related costs in the quarter, which are noncash. These include a $20 million intangible asset write down, $11 million of bad debt expense and approximately $21 million of inventory adjustments primarily related to canceled orders from retailers for seasonal product we already made. 
The tax rate of 17.8% was higher than our expectation as better-than-expected performance in U.S. Innerwear and PPE resulted in a higher mix of U.S. profit in the quarter. And adjusted and GAAP earnings per share increased 58% and 12% over prior year to $0.60 and $0.46, respectively. 
Now let me take you through our segment performance. From a high level, all of our segments experienced a similar progression through the quarter. We saw significant year-over-year pressure in April, as regions sheltered in place. This was followed by sequential improvement in May and June as consumers shifted to open channels, including online and closed stores began to reopen. 
For the quarter, U.S. Innerwear sales increased approximately 67% over the prior year, while the operating margin expanded nearly 550 basis points to 27.8%. Both revenue and operating profit exceeded our base case scenario, driven by better-than-expected sales in both our core Innerwear and new PPE businesses, our significant fixed cost leverage from higher sales and by lower SG&A expense due to our temporary cost reduction initiatives. 
Adjusting for sales from our PPE business, core U.S. Innerwear performed significantly better than our base case scenario. Core revenue declined approximately 27% over prior year, with Basics down 18% and Intimates down 52%. These better than base case results were driven by the strong performance of our Basics and Intimates businesses, within the channels that remain open as well as the reopening of mid-tier and department store channels late in the quarter. On the back of improved point-of-sale during the quarter, we have seen booking trends in both Basics and Intimates strengthen through July. 
Turning to U.S. Activewear. Revenue declined 52% over prior year, which was better than our base case scenario. The year-over-year decline was due to COVID related door closures as well as school closings and fewer group events that significantly impacted our Sports Apparel and Printwear businesses. 
As expected, Activewear's operating margin declined over prior year. Deleveraged from lower sales, deleveraged from minimum royalty payments in our Sports License business. And our decision to hold Champion marketing investment flat over prior year more than offset our temporary cost savings initiatives. 
While Champion experienced headwinds due to COVID related channel closures, we were encouraged by the accelerating point-of-sale trends through the quarter and a continued POS strength in July. We believe this underscores the consumers' ongoing desire for the brand and points to improving revenue trends going forward. 
Switching to our International segment. Revenue is well ahead of our base case scenario. As compared to last year, revenue declined approximately 20% on a reported basis and 17% on a constant currency basis. Adjusting for PPE sales, core International revenue declined 44% as compared to the prior year. The better than base case performance in our core International business was driven by online as well as the performance of our company-owned stores as they reopened. 
The International segment's operating margin of 17.3% increased 310 basis points over prior year, driven by lower SG&A costs as we benefited from various temporary cost savings initiatives. 
Touching briefly on our Global Champion business. Excluding C9, revenue declined 46% over prior year with declines in both our domestic and international businesses. Like other parts of our business, Global Champion was hindered by closures of our company-owned stores and channel partner doors early in the quarter. As doors reopened, Global Champion trends improved through the quarter with momentum continuing through July, reinforcing our expectation for sequential improvement in Champion sales through the balance of the year. 
Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. We delivered a strong cash flow performance in the quarter, generating $65 million of cash flow from operations. Year-to-date, operating cash flow was approximately $40 million above last year. The strong performance was driven by previously planned inventory reduction efforts, temporary cost savings initiatives, continued working capital discipline and timely actions taken within our manufacturing network. 
With respect to our balance sheet, inventory declined approximately $265 million or 12% compared to last year. Leverage was 3.4x on a net debt to adjusted EBITDA basis, down from 3.5x last year. And we ended the quarter with approximately $1.8 billion of liquidity, which we believe provides us with significant cash -- capital cushion in this uncertain environment. 
Due to the uncertainty and unpredictability of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the current lack of visibility in our business environment, we are not providing third quarter or full year 2020 guidance at this time. However, I will like to share a few thoughts to help frame some of the key levers within our business model. 
Looking at our Apparel business, which excludes PPE, revenue declined approximately 40% over prior year in the second quarter. Absent any rollbacks of store reopenings, we currently foresee an environment for the year-over-year decline in our Apparel business to improve sequentially in both this third and fourth quarter. With respect to our PPE business, we currently expect more than a $150 million of PPE revenue in the second half, the vast majority of which is expected in the third quarter. 
While we continue to tightly manage SG&A expenses, the amount of temporary cost savings from the second quarter are currently not expected to repeat in the second half. Combined with a lower overall unit and sales volume, we believe it is reasonable to assume year-over-year pressure on margins in both this third and fourth quarters. 
Now with respect to our tax rate, we currently expect a rate of approximately 17.5% for the second half. And in terms of cash flow, we continue to expect to generate positive cash flow in the second half of the year. 
So in closing, we delivered strong second quarter results. Our balance sheet is healthy, and we believe we have ample liquidity. While there remains a significant amount of uncertainty, we are encouraged by the positive underlying momentum in our Apparel business, which we believe points to a return to pre-COVID levels in our business once the pandemic has passed. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to T.C."

I wanted to ask my one question around PPE, this new business that you have, $752 million. Could you dive in a little bit more? How much of that is government? Was any of that consumer in the quarter? Is there any recurring element to the government side of it? And then how do we think about the consumer piece? Is it mostly a mask business and wholesale versus DTC? And then if you could also talk about on the manufacturing side, how you're able to switch over your manufacturing? Are there kind of nuances and complexities investors should be aware of? 
And then is it easy to switch it back as the traditional Innerwear business ramps back up again and you need to use that capacity? How easy is it to build additional capacity, kind of all of that kind of discussion around that PPE business, I think, would be really helpful."

And I would just say, first, we're just delighted with how the big quarter came out, and we exceeded our expectations. And certainly, the PPE portion you're asking about, but also meaningfully in our Apparel business, and it's just an extraordinary effort by the organization in total. 
So we're very pleased with it. From the PPE standpoint, that business within the quarter was predominantly government and there was business-to-business element of it as well. We did add some more contracts on the government side in mask and gowns late in the quarter, which caused the over-delivery on that side as well as businesses began to open up, in particular, they were seeking mask for their employees and so forth. 
As I noted in my comments, as we're moving now into the third quarter, we are focusing on shipping our consumer businesses that are showing up at retail and that was over $150 million number we put out for the balance of the year. Those are in-store now, heavily under the Hanes name, but also under the Champion name, selling through extremely well, very strong reaction to those businesses as well. Our research tells us the consumer is really looking for a trusted brand and innovation, and it's right up our alley and good response. And so we're pleased with that. And I think that alone could be a $200 million to $300 million kind of business on an annualized basis in the future. 
Relative to future government business, there, certainly, could be additional opportunities out there, and we'll certainly seek those as the opportunity emerges. But those would be incremental and opportunistic at this point relative to our guidance on the consumer side of things. 
From the standpoint of manufacturing, certainly, to ramp at the pace we did in Q2, we used internal production and used outside production as well to bring up a very quick ramp to the total production. As it's come down to a more level production for the consumer side of things, we've fallen back into our own manufacturing facilities. And that's not a big switch for us. It's very similar in production to our panty or underwear products, and we make them alongside in the same facilities, and we can certainly support that going forward. This is not a capital-intensive move on our part. So we find it very complementary to what we already do. So with the change in consumer behavior and the emerging mandates by states, we feel this could be a business that goes on for a long period of time."

We completed the placement -- the replacement of their underwear department, and we captured space there and we've seen nice performance as that's come through the placement. 
I would say, overall, we gained 300 basis points of share in Basics, and it was across a number of areas. It was across socks, it was across women's panties, and it was across underwear. And certainly, underwear benefiting from that retail space expansion. So there's a lot of activity there. We can now see our back-to-school bookings, and they're solid as well. And then back-to-school is a very important period for our Innerwear businesses. 
In addition, we can all see all the way out to holiday, and we see a nice increase in holiday bookings at this point in time. So there's just a lot of energy in Innerwear that gives us a lot of good feeling about it, and we feel it's on pace to potentially get back to stability as we work to the latter half of the year.

Certainly, from the standpoint of Champion, early in the second quarter with much of the specialty and department stores channels closed, Champion saw very nice growth online. And as we mentioned, we had a 40% increase, for example, in the U.S. in our POS relative to prior year, driven heavily by online. That's online in third-party brick-and-mortar, where we were seeing sometime triple-digit rates in the U.S. as well as our own champion.com, which you may recall, we just sort of upgraded. It was in the 200% increase level. If I take you internationally, we saw as the markets reopened, the brand also ramped very quickly back to sort of pre-COVID, kind of, momentum and it ramped very nicely. 
And all of that momentum is carried for us into early July as we look forward. I did mention in my comments that we can now see farther out, even as far as into next year and our bookings have been very favorable there. And there's no doubt that the retailers witnessed the strength around the world of Champion even online, as markets were closed and it has created a lot of interest in our brand. They clearly see that the consumer is pursuing the brand, even when channels are closed. They're pursuing it online. So there's a lot of momentum in that business. And so those bookings were very favorable as we look to the spring of next year, and it was around the world. It was no one market, it was a global market. 
I would add to that, that we still anticipate our Champion second partner ramping their stores and Champion in the second half of this year. They've already brought our online business on. In China, we've seen very nice growth there online as well. So there's just a lot of energy in Champion. We remain very bullish on our ability to reach our $3 billion goal over time."

And on top of the POS, we've gotten some opportunity to fill up some holes out there. So we -- that obviously -- the answer is we would lean on inventory, and we're ramping back up to match demand on the Innerwear side of things. 
And on the Champion side, as the channels have opened up, we've gotten a clearer view of bookings out of some of the channels that were closed. We're ramping that production as well, and what we expect is a nice sequential improvement in Champion in Q3.

It's -- if I take the store question first, POS is -- or the traffic is generally ramped back at a sequentially improving pace, as we we've opened the doors, most of the doors. And you'll recall, we have Champion doors around the world. So there's no one answer to this. Some are faster than others. But if I give you a couple, for example, in Europe where in Italy stores reopened, late May and the June. We saw the traffic began to ramp nicely as soon as they were open. It's not yet and generally back to last year's levels, but it's ramping nicely. 
In Australia, we have a few Champion stores there as well as many bond stores. As the markets open, we saw a very quick ramp back in traffic there, approaching last year's levels. And the U.S. has been sort of a mix of both of those. It's a little slower. But in our outlet stores -- our U.S. outlet stores, the traffic has been a little slower, but we've seen higher conversion. So the shoppers that come in all those channels are very determined, and they're buying more in general as they come to the stores. So generally, I would summarize a little slower traffic and maybe a little higher conversion in total. 
From the standpoint of capital investment in our online, we don't expect dramatic capital investment to support our growth here. Remember, our growth's coming from a combination of working very carefully with the large pure-play and brick-and-mortar players that are out there, and that's always been a wholesale business for us directly to their warehouses, and they handle it. And our surging or growing online here, we have plenty of distribution space. We've done -- we spent the last year or so investing in our systems and upgrading our systems, and we believe those are scalable with a reasonable investment."

Our own sites are performing well, but there's tremendous business being built in those pure plays in brick-and-mortars. So from that standpoint, I don't expect that mix to change dramatically in the near term, going forward. The economics of the pure-play and the brick-and-mortar is very similar to our wholesale economics. It's a wholesale sale, as we've so often said, and it's very similar to our wholesale business. 
We've also worked on the economics of our own sites as well, and they're quite attractive from the standpoint of how we're performing. So we feel good about the mix we have in that, should it mix a little more toward our sites or the other way, I think we're equally happy with that mix at this time."

From the standpoint of the back-to-school, we've got good view to that. We're right in the middle of it right now. And I think when you think about back-to-school, it's most important to our Basics business and Innerwear and from Champion, it's certainly a replenishable item as well. 
What we saw is even in the worst of the pandemic lockdown, when that online picked up the business for both Basics, and as you heard in my comments, we were up year-over-year in Champion and in Basics in that May, June period. So we have good view to it from the standpoint of bookings. We can see our secondary displays with our retailers, much of the Basics business is a mask business. So we feel like we're well fixed to sell the business. In the event -- in the unexpected event that there could be a lockdown of certain channels, we think we're well positioned to pick that up online.

4212820,676268949,2091234,"Hanesbrands Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2020",2020-07-30,"Earnings Calls","Hanesbrands Inc.","Executives","Thank you, T.C. With my retirement next week after 37 years with Hanesbrands, this will be my last quarterly earnings call as CEO. This quarter, I have never been more proud of this organization and our employees' ability to rise to the occasion and meet",1122,"Thank you, T.C. With my retirement next week after 37 years with Hanesbrands, this will be my last quarterly earnings call as CEO. This quarter, I have never been more proud of this organization and our employees' ability to rise to the occasion and meet challenges to deliver exceptional performance, even in the midst of a devastating pandemic. 
Despite the economic disruption of COVID-19 around the globe, Hanesbrands delivered strong second quarter results, driven by better-than-expected performance in both our apparel and our new PPE businesses. 
For the quarter, revenue increased 6%, operating profit increased 41%, earnings per share increased 58%, and we generated $65 million of operating cash flow. Our strong second quarter performance in one of the most challenging retail and consumer environments in decades underscores the strength of our brand portfolio, the agility of our organization, the scale of our company-owned supply chain and the cash-generating power of our business model. 
In my view, there are 4 key highlights in the quarter that speak to the strength of our underlying model. And our ability to grow this business going forward. First, our apparel business outperformed; second, the organization quickly pivoted to create a new PPE business; third, we generated positive cash flow; and fourth, we ended the quarter with $1.8 billion of liquidity. 
Touching on our apparel business performance, which excludes PPE, our strong second quarter results were meaningfully ahead of our base case scenario in each of our 3 main segments: U.S. Innerwear, U.S. Activewear and international. 
Point-of-sale trends improved sequentially through the second quarter in all of our key geographies, with the positive momentum carrying into July, as consumers settled into new routines, stimulus initiatives were rolled out, and retail doors reopened around the world. In fact, point-of-sale in our U.S. Basics and Champion businesses in May and June exceeded pre-COVID levels. 
In U.S. Innerwear, point-of-sale trends accelerated through the quarter. Moving from down 29% in April to up 8% in May and up 11% in June. We experienced strong momentum in our Basics business with mid-teens point-of-sale growth, yielding more than 300 basis points of market share gains in the quarter. Within our Intimates business, point-of-sale returned to essentially flat in June and improved to up 3% in July, regaining its pre-COVID momentum as the mid-tier and department store channels reopened. 
We experienced a similar trend in our Champion business within the U.S. Activewear segment. In the quarter, Champion point-of-sale accelerated from down 14% in April to up nearly 40% in May and up more than 70% in June as consumers continued to actively seek out the brand, particularly within the online channel. With store reopenings underway in our International business, we saw monthly progression within our Innerwear businesses in Europe and Australia as well as within our Champion businesses in Europe and Asia. 
Strength in our Online business continued globally in the second quarter, with sales up more than 70% over prior year. We experienced strong growth across our key regions in the quarter, with triple-digit online growth at some of our largest customers and nearly 200% growth on our newly enhanced champion.com website. Within our Apparel business, which excludes PPE, online represented over 30% of total sales in the quarter. 
We are encouraged by the strong POS trends, which we believe points to the improving shipment and revenue trend in our Apparel business as we move through the second half and into next year. 
Turning to the second highlight of the quarter. Our newly created PPE business generated over $750 million of revenue. This was well ahead of our initial expectation as we benefited from additional government contracts for both mask and reusable gowns, and we were able to fulfill demand for a number of businesses. 
We recently launched our consumer PPE facemask business at retail. We expect to generate more than $150 million of additional PPE revenue in the second half of the year. Looking forward, we continue to believe this consumer product line represents a meaningful ongoing business opportunity. 
The third highlight of the quarter was cash flow, as we generated $65 million of cash flow from operations. Year-to-date, operating cash flow was $40 million better than last year. With the majority of retail doors closed for half the quarter, this performance speaks to the cash-generating power of our model and the discipline of the organization to aggressively manage operating cost and working capital. We continue to expect to generate positive operating cash flow for the second half of the year. 
And finally, in terms of liquidity, we said on our last call that our focus in this environment was on managing cash while positioning the company to be able to take advantage of opportunities. This focus allowed us to capture stronger-than-expected demand for our products in the quarter as well as maintain our dividend. We ended the quarter with $1.8 billion of liquidity, which we believe provides us ample capital to maximize our operating flexibility and positions us to grow the business going forward. 
Looking ahead, there remains uncertainty about the extent and pace of reopening economies in the midst of COVID-19, and we are planning accordingly. Absent any rollbacks of store reopenings, we expect year-over-year revenue trends in our Apparel business to improve sequentially in the second half. Our core brands are healthy. We are gaining market share. Point-of-sale trends remain strong. Our back-to-school and holiday plans are set and initial spring '21 bookings of Global Champion are up meaningfully over prior year in each region. We believe the positive underlying trends in our business, both prior to and during the pandemic, positions us for growth in a post pandemic environment. 
So in closing, we delivered a strong quarter in a very challenging global environment. Momentum is building in our Apparel business, and we believe we have ample liquidity. We believe our diversified global business model continues to position us to drive growth and take advantage of opportunities over the next several years. 
Before I turn the call over, I'd like to take a moment to wish those of you from the investment community, the best in the years ahead. I've enjoyed getting to know you and exchanging points of view over the years. To the Hanesbrands team, it's been an honor to be part of the HBI family for so many years. Together, we built a company and successfully expanded it to be a global leader in our categories. These are things that could only be achieved by the determined efforts of 60,000 team members around the world pulling together. I look forward to watching Hanesbrands continue to prosper under the leadership of Steve Bratspies in the years ahead. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Scott."
4212820,676268949,2091234,"Hanesbrands Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2020",2020-07-30,"Earnings Calls","Hanesbrands Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Gerald. Our strong second quarter results, including double-digit growth and adjusted and GAAP EPS, underscore the earnings and cash flow leverage, our vertically integrated business model can generate. Sales for the quarter were $1.74 billion,",1329,"Thanks, Gerald. Our strong second quarter results, including double-digit growth and adjusted and GAAP EPS, underscore the earnings and cash flow leverage, our vertically integrated business model can generate. 
Sales for the quarter were $1.74 billion, which includes $752 million of PPE revenue. As compared to last year, sales increased 6% on a reported basis and 7% on a constant currency basis. Excluding PPE, Apparel revenue declined approximately 40% over prior year. This is well ahead of our expectation and accounted for more than half of the upside in the quarter relative to our base case scenario.
Adjusted gross margin of 37.9% decreased approximately 180 basis points over the last year. Approximately 50 basis points of the decline was the result of deleverage from minimum royalty payments in our sports license business. 
The remainder of the decline was driven by COVID related door closings, which had a greater sales impact on our core international and our Champion and U.S. Activewear businesses. As a reminder, these businesses carry higher gross margins, but they also carry higher SG&A expense. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased approximately 430 basis points over prior year to 17.5%. Higher sales drove meaningful SG&A leverage, which was further benefited by our temporary cost savings initiatives. 
Interest and other expense declined $8 million over prior year to approximately $47 million due primarily to lower average rates in the quarter. Restructuring and other related charges were approximately $63 million in the quarter. Our planned supply chain restructuring actions and program exit costs, which remain unchanged, accounted for $11 million of these costs. The remaining approximately $52 million are nonrecurring COVID related costs in the quarter, which are noncash. These include a $20 million intangible asset write down, $11 million of bad debt expense and approximately $21 million of inventory adjustments primarily related to canceled orders from retailers for seasonal product we already made. 
The tax rate of 17.8% was higher than our expectation as better-than-expected performance in U.S. Innerwear and PPE resulted in a higher mix of U.S. profit in the quarter. And adjusted and GAAP earnings per share increased 58% and 12% over prior year to $0.60 and $0.46, respectively. 
Now let me take you through our segment performance. From a high level, all of our segments experienced a similar progression through the quarter. We saw significant year-over-year pressure in April, as regions sheltered in place. This was followed by sequential improvement in May and June as consumers shifted to open channels, including online and closed stores began to reopen. 
For the quarter, U.S. Innerwear sales increased approximately 67% over the prior year, while the operating margin expanded nearly 550 basis points to 27.8%. Both revenue and operating profit exceeded our base case scenario, driven by better-than-expected sales in both our core Innerwear and new PPE businesses, our significant fixed cost leverage from higher sales and by lower SG&A expense due to our temporary cost reduction initiatives. 
Adjusting for sales from our PPE business, core U.S. Innerwear performed significantly better than our base case scenario. Core revenue declined approximately 27% over prior year, with Basics down 18% and Intimates down 52%. These better than base case results were driven by the strong performance of our Basics and Intimates businesses, within the channels that remain open as well as the reopening of mid-tier and department store channels late in the quarter. On the back of improved point-of-sale during the quarter, we have seen booking trends in both Basics and Intimates strengthen through July. 
Turning to U.S. Activewear. Revenue declined 52% over prior year, which was better than our base case scenario. The year-over-year decline was due to COVID related door closures as well as school closings and fewer group events that significantly impacted our Sports Apparel and Printwear businesses. 
As expected, Activewear's operating margin declined over prior year. Deleveraged from lower sales, deleveraged from minimum royalty payments in our Sports License business. And our decision to hold Champion marketing investment flat over prior year more than offset our temporary cost savings initiatives. 
While Champion experienced headwinds due to COVID related channel closures, we were encouraged by the accelerating point-of-sale trends through the quarter and a continued POS strength in July. We believe this underscores the consumers' ongoing desire for the brand and points to improving revenue trends going forward. 
Switching to our International segment. Revenue is well ahead of our base case scenario. As compared to last year, revenue declined approximately 20% on a reported basis and 17% on a constant currency basis. Adjusting for PPE sales, core International revenue declined 44% as compared to the prior year. The better than base case performance in our core International business was driven by online as well as the performance of our company-owned stores as they reopened. 
The International segment's operating margin of 17.3% increased 310 basis points over prior year, driven by lower SG&A costs as we benefited from various temporary cost savings initiatives. 
Touching briefly on our Global Champion business. Excluding C9, revenue declined 46% over prior year with declines in both our domestic and international businesses. Like other parts of our business, Global Champion was hindered by closures of our company-owned stores and channel partner doors early in the quarter. As doors reopened, Global Champion trends improved through the quarter with momentum continuing through July, reinforcing our expectation for sequential improvement in Champion sales through the balance of the year. 
Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. We delivered a strong cash flow performance in the quarter, generating $65 million of cash flow from operations. Year-to-date, operating cash flow was approximately $40 million above last year. The strong performance was driven by previously planned inventory reduction efforts, temporary cost savings initiatives, continued working capital discipline and timely actions taken within our manufacturing network. 
With respect to our balance sheet, inventory declined approximately $265 million or 12% compared to last year. Leverage was 3.4x on a net debt to adjusted EBITDA basis, down from 3.5x last year. And we ended the quarter with approximately $1.8 billion of liquidity, which we believe provides us with significant cash -- capital cushion in this uncertain environment. 
Due to the uncertainty and unpredictability of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the current lack of visibility in our business environment, we are not providing third quarter or full year 2020 guidance at this time. However, I will like to share a few thoughts to help frame some of the key levers within our business model. 
Looking at our Apparel business, which excludes PPE, revenue declined approximately 40% over prior year in the second quarter. Absent any rollbacks of store reopenings, we currently foresee an environment for the year-over-year decline in our Apparel business to improve sequentially in both this third and fourth quarter. With respect to our PPE business, we currently expect more than a $150 million of PPE revenue in the second half, the vast majority of which is expected in the third quarter. 
While we continue to tightly manage SG&A expenses, the amount of temporary cost savings from the second quarter are currently not expected to repeat in the second half. Combined with a lower overall unit and sales volume, we believe it is reasonable to assume year-over-year pressure on margins in both this third and fourth quarters. 
Now with respect to our tax rate, we currently expect a rate of approximately 17.5% for the second half. And in terms of cash flow, we continue to expect to generate positive cash flow in the second half of the year. 
So in closing, we delivered strong second quarter results. Our balance sheet is healthy, and we believe we have ample liquidity. While there remains a significant amount of uncertainty, we are encouraged by the positive underlying momentum in our Apparel business, which we believe points to a return to pre-COVID levels in our business once the pandemic has passed. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to T.C."

I wanted to ask my one question around PPE, this new business that you have, $752 million. Could you dive in a little bit more? How much of that is government? Was any of that consumer in the quarter? Is there any recurring element to the government side of it? And then how do we think about the consumer piece? Is it mostly a mask business and wholesale versus DTC? And then if you could also talk about on the manufacturing side, how you're able to switch over your manufacturing? Are there kind of nuances and complexities investors should be aware of?

So we're very pleased with it. From the PPE standpoint, that business within the quarter was predominantly government and there was business-to-business element of it as well. We did add some more contracts on the government side in mask and gowns late in the quarter, which caused the over-delivery on that side as well as businesses began to open up, in particular, they were seeking mask for their employees and so forth. 
As I noted in my comments, as we're moving now into the third quarter, we are focusing on shipping our consumer businesses that are showing up at retail and that was over $150 million number we put out for the balance of the year. Those are in-store now, heavily under the Hanes name, but also under the Champion name, selling through extremely well, very strong reaction to those businesses as well. Our research tells us the consumer is really looking for a trusted brand and innovation, and it's right up our alley and good response. And so we're pleased with that. And I think that alone could be a $200 million to $300 million kind of business on an annualized basis in the future. 
Relative to future government business, there, certainly, could be additional opportunities out there, and we'll certainly seek those as the opportunity emerges. But those would be incremental and opportunistic at this point relative to our guidance on the consumer side of things. 
From the standpoint of manufacturing, certainly, to ramp at the pace we did in Q2, we used internal production and used outside production as well to bring up a very quick ramp to the total production. As it's come down to a more level production for the consumer side of things, we've fallen back into our own manufacturing facilities. And that's not a big switch for us. It's very similar in production to our panty or underwear products, and we make them alongside in the same facilities, and we can certainly support that going forward. This is not a capital-intensive move on our part. So we find it very complementary to what we already do. So with the change in consumer behavior and the emerging mandates by states, we feel this could be a business that goes on for a long period of time."

We completed the placement -- the replacement of their underwear department, and we captured space there and we've seen nice performance as that's come through the placement. 
I would say, overall, we gained 300 basis points of share in Basics, and it was across a number of areas. It was across socks, it was across women's panties, and it was across underwear. And certainly, underwear benefiting from that retail space expansion. So there's a lot of activity there. We can now see our back-to-school bookings, and they're solid as well. And then back-to-school is a very important period for our Innerwear businesses. 
In addition, we can all see all the way out to holiday, and we see a nice increase in holiday bookings at this point in time. So there's just a lot of energy in Innerwear that gives us a lot of good feeling about it, and we feel it's on pace to potentially get back to stability as we work to the latter half of the year.

Certainly, from the standpoint of Champion, early in the second quarter with much of the specialty and department stores channels closed, Champion saw very nice growth online. And as we mentioned, we had a 40% increase, for example, in the U.S. in our POS relative to prior year, driven heavily by online. That's online in third-party brick-and-mortar, where we were seeing sometime triple-digit rates in the U.S. as well as our own champion.com, which you may recall, we just sort of upgraded. It was in the 200% increase level. If I take you internationally, we saw as the markets reopened, the brand also ramped very quickly back to sort of pre-COVID, kind of, momentum and it ramped very nicely. 
And all of that momentum is carried for us into early July as we look forward. I did mention in my comments that we can now see farther out, even as far as into next year and our bookings have been very favorable there. And there's no doubt that the retailers witnessed the strength around the world of Champion even online, as markets were closed and it has created a lot of interest in our brand. They clearly see that the consumer is pursuing the brand, even when channels are closed. They're pursuing it online. So there's a lot of momentum in that business. And so those bookings were very favorable as we look to the spring of next year, and it was around the world. It was no one market, it was a global market. 
I would add to that, that we still anticipate our Champion second partner ramping their stores and Champion in the second half of this year. They've already brought our online business on. In China, we've seen very nice growth there online as well. So there's just a lot of energy in Champion. We remain very bullish on our ability to reach our $3 billion goal over time."

And on top of the POS, we've gotten some opportunity to fill up some holes out there. So we -- that obviously -- the answer is we would lean on inventory, and we're ramping back up to match demand on the Innerwear side of things. 
And on the Champion side, as the channels have opened up, we've gotten a clearer view of bookings out of some of the channels that were closed. We're ramping that production as well, and what we expect is a nice sequential improvement in Champion in Q3.

It's -- if I take the store question first, POS is -- or the traffic is generally ramped back at a sequentially improving pace, as we we've opened the doors, most of the doors. And you'll recall, we have Champion doors around the world. So there's no one answer to this. Some are faster than others. But if I give you a couple, for example, in Europe where in Italy stores reopened, late May and the June. We saw the traffic began to ramp nicely as soon as they were open. It's not yet and generally back to last year's levels, but it's ramping nicely. 
In Australia, we have a few Champion stores there as well as many bond stores. As the markets open, we saw a very quick ramp back in traffic there, approaching last year's levels. And the U.S. has been sort of a mix of both of those. It's a little slower. But in our outlet stores -- our U.S. outlet stores, the traffic has been a little slower, but we've seen higher conversion. So the shoppers that come in all those channels are very determined, and they're buying more in general as they come to the stores. So generally, I would summarize a little slower traffic and maybe a little higher conversion in total. 
From the standpoint of capital investment in our online, we don't expect dramatic capital investment to support our growth here. Remember, our growth's coming from a combination of working very carefully with the large pure-play and brick-and-mortar players that are out there, and that's always been a wholesale business for us directly to their warehouses, and they handle it. And our surging or growing online here, we have plenty of distribution space. We've done -- we spent the last year or so investing in our systems and upgrading our systems, and we believe those are scalable with a reasonable investment."

From the mask standpoint, the vast majority of the mask were Hanes mask. There was a small element of Champion primarily sold on our online sites.

So it's through our brick-and-mortar and our pure-play partners. And I would expect that, that mix will continue to be so going forward. The businesses are growing very well there -- year is very well there as well. Going forward. Our own sites are performing well, but there's tremendous business being built in those pure plays in brick-and-mortars. So from that standpoint, I don't expect that mix to change dramatically in the near term, going forward. The economics of the pure-play and the brick-and-mortar is very similar to our wholesale economics. It's a wholesale sale, as we've so often said, and it's very similar to our wholesale business. 
We've also worked on the economics of our own sites as well, and they're quite attractive from the standpoint of how we're performing. So we feel good about the mix we have in that, should it mix a little more toward our sites or the other way, I think we're equally happy with that mix at this time."

Again, we are continuing to monitor our balances there with our customers and working closely with them to manage any exposures. We did have a bad debt charge of $11 million in the quarter, but that related to several of our smaller customers that were impacted by COVID. And as you would expect with the COVID market disruption. As for the financial strain on some of the retailers due to store closures and just reduced consumer spending. But again, we're working closely with our customers and managing the balances there. 
And feel really good about the progress that we've made in the quarter with our customers as far as the collection efforts in those balances. We feel really good about that. The reports that the PPE business and the receivable balance, again, the $752 million of revenue that flowed through the quarter, a lot of that was later in the quarter. And so we do have a larger receivable balance at the end of the quarter. You'll notice that in the cash flow statement, the use for receivables was up more than it normally is. But again, we will expect that collection to happen pretty quickly in the third quarter. So again, we feel really good about our receivables balance at the end of the quarter."

From the standpoint of the back-to-school, we've got good view to that. We're right in the middle of it right now. And I think when you think about back-to-school, it's most important to our Basics business and Innerwear and from Champion, it's certainly a replenishable item as well. 
What we saw is even in the worst of the pandemic lockdown, when that online picked up the business for both Basics, and as you heard in my comments, we were up year-over-year in Champion and in Basics in that May, June period. So we have good view to it from the standpoint of bookings. We can see our secondary displays with our retailers, much of the Basics business is a mask business. So we feel like we're well fixed to sell the business. In the event -- in the unexpected event that there could be a lockdown of certain channels, we think we're well positioned to pick that up online. So we expect it to be a good back-to-school from the standpoint of performance relative to the market we're operating in."

4212820,676268949,2091236,"Hanesbrands Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2020",2020-07-30,"Earnings Calls","Hanesbrands Inc.","Executives","Thank you, T.C. With my retirement next week after 37 years with Hanesbrands, this will be my last quarterly earnings call as CEO. This quarter, I have never been more proud of this organization and our employees' ability to rise to the occasion and meet",1122,"Thank you, T.C. With my retirement next week after 37 years with Hanesbrands, this will be my last quarterly earnings call as CEO. This quarter, I have never been more proud of this organization and our employees' ability to rise to the occasion and meet challenges to deliver exceptional performance, even in the midst of a devastating pandemic. 
Despite the economic disruption of COVID-19 around the globe, Hanesbrands delivered strong second quarter results, driven by better-than-expected performance in both our apparel and our new PPE businesses. 
For the quarter, revenue increased 6%, operating profit increased 41%, earnings per share increased 58%, and we generated $65 million of operating cash flow. Our strong second quarter performance in one of the most challenging retail and consumer environments in decades underscores the strength of our brand portfolio, the agility of our organization, the scale of our company-owned supply chain and the cash-generating power of our business model. 
In my view, there are 4 key highlights in the quarter that speak to the strength of our underlying model. And our ability to grow this business going forward. First, our apparel business outperformed; second, the organization quickly pivoted to create a new PPE business; third, we generated positive cash flow; and fourth, we ended the quarter with $1.8 billion of liquidity. 
Touching on our apparel business performance, which excludes PPE, our strong second quarter results were meaningfully ahead of our base case scenario in each of our 3 main segments: U.S. Innerwear, U.S. Activewear and international. 
Point-of-sale trends improved sequentially through the second quarter in all of our key geographies, with the positive momentum carrying into July, as consumers settled into new routines, stimulus initiatives were rolled out, and retail doors reopened around the world. In fact, point-of-sale in our U.S. Basics and Champion businesses in May and June exceeded pre-COVID levels. 
In U.S. Innerwear, point-of-sale trends accelerated through the quarter. Moving from down 29% in April to up 8% in May and up 11% in June. We experienced strong momentum in our Basics business with mid-teens point-of-sale growth, yielding more than 300 basis points of market share gains in the quarter. Within our Intimates business, point-of-sale returned to essentially flat in June and improved to up 3% in July, regaining its pre-COVID momentum as the mid-tier and department store channels reopened. 
We experienced a similar trend in our Champion business within the U.S. Activewear segment. In the quarter, Champion point-of-sale accelerated from down 14% in April to up nearly 40% in May and up more than 70% in June as consumers continued to actively seek out the brand, particularly within the online channel. With store reopenings underway in our International business, we saw monthly progression within our Innerwear businesses in Europe and Australia as well as within our Champion businesses in Europe and Asia. 
Strength in our Online business continued globally in the second quarter, with sales up more than 70% over prior year. We experienced strong growth across our key regions in the quarter, with triple-digit online growth at some of our largest customers and nearly 200% growth on our newly enhanced champion.com website. Within our Apparel business, which excludes PPE, online represented over 30% of total sales in the quarter. 
We are encouraged by the strong POS trends, which we believe points to the improving shipment and revenue trend in our Apparel business as we move through the second half and into next year. 
Turning to the second highlight of the quarter. Our newly created PPE business generated over $750 million of revenue. This was well ahead of our initial expectation as we benefited from additional government contracts for both mask and reusable gowns, and we were able to fulfill demand for a number of businesses. 
We recently launched our consumer PPE facemask business at retail. We expect to generate more than $150 million of additional PPE revenue in the second half of the year. Looking forward, we continue to believe this consumer product line represents a meaningful ongoing business opportunity. 
The third highlight of the quarter was cash flow, as we generated $65 million of cash flow from operations. Year-to-date, operating cash flow was $40 million better than last year. With the majority of retail doors closed for half the quarter, this performance speaks to the cash-generating power of our model and the discipline of the organization to aggressively manage operating cost and working capital. We continue to expect to generate positive operating cash flow for the second half of the year. 
And finally, in terms of liquidity, we said on our last call that our focus in this environment was on managing cash while positioning the company to be able to take advantage of opportunities. This focus allowed us to capture stronger-than-expected demand for our products in the quarter as well as maintain our dividend. We ended the quarter with $1.8 billion of liquidity, which we believe provides us ample capital to maximize our operating flexibility and positions us to grow the business going forward. 
Looking ahead, there remains uncertainty about the extent and pace of reopening economies in the midst of COVID-19, and we are planning accordingly. Absent any rollbacks of store reopenings, we expect year-over-year revenue trends in our Apparel business to improve sequentially in the second half. Our core brands are healthy. We are gaining market share. Point-of-sale trends remain strong. Our back-to-school and holiday plans are set and initial spring '21 bookings of Global Champion are up meaningfully over prior year in each region. We believe the positive underlying trends in our business, both prior to and during the pandemic, positions us for growth in a post pandemic environment. 
So in closing, we delivered a strong quarter in a very challenging global environment. Momentum is building in our Apparel business, and we believe we have ample liquidity. We believe our diversified global business model continues to position us to drive growth and take advantage of opportunities over the next several years. 
Before I turn the call over, I'd like to take a moment to wish those of you from the investment community, the best in the years ahead. I've enjoyed getting to know you and exchanging points of view over the years. To the Hanesbrands team, it's been an honor to be part of the HBI family for so many years. Together, we built a company and successfully expanded it to be a global leader in our categories. These are things that could only be achieved by the determined efforts of 60,000 team members around the world pulling together. I look forward to watching Hanesbrands continue to prosper under the leadership of Steve Bratspies in the years ahead. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Scott."
4212820,676268949,2091236,"Hanesbrands Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2020",2020-07-30,"Earnings Calls","Hanesbrands Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Gerald. Our strong second quarter results, including double-digit growth and adjusted and GAAP EPS, underscore the earnings and cash flow leverage, our vertically integrated business model can generate. Sales for the quarter were $1.74 billion,",1329,"Thanks, Gerald. Our strong second quarter results, including double-digit growth and adjusted and GAAP EPS, underscore the earnings and cash flow leverage, our vertically integrated business model can generate. 
Sales for the quarter were $1.74 billion, which includes $752 million of PPE revenue. As compared to last year, sales increased 6% on a reported basis and 7% on a constant currency basis. Excluding PPE, Apparel revenue declined approximately 40% over prior year. This is well ahead of our expectation and accounted for more than half of the upside in the quarter relative to our base case scenario.
Adjusted gross margin of 37.9% decreased approximately 180 basis points over the last year. Approximately 50 basis points of the decline was the result of deleverage from minimum royalty payments in our sports license business. 
The remainder of the decline was driven by COVID related door closings, which had a greater sales impact on our core international and our Champion and U.S. Activewear businesses. As a reminder, these businesses carry higher gross margins, but they also carry higher SG&A expense. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased approximately 430 basis points over prior year to 17.5%. Higher sales drove meaningful SG&A leverage, which was further benefited by our temporary cost savings initiatives. 
Interest and other expense declined $8 million over prior year to approximately $47 million due primarily to lower average rates in the quarter. Restructuring and other related charges were approximately $63 million in the quarter. Our planned supply chain restructuring actions and program exit costs, which remain unchanged, accounted for $11 million of these costs. The remaining approximately $52 million are nonrecurring COVID related costs in the quarter, which are noncash. These include a $20 million intangible asset write down, $11 million of bad debt expense and approximately $21 million of inventory adjustments primarily related to canceled orders from retailers for seasonal product we already made. 
The tax rate of 17.8% was higher than our expectation as better-than-expected performance in U.S. Innerwear and PPE resulted in a higher mix of U.S. profit in the quarter. And adjusted and GAAP earnings per share increased 58% and 12% over prior year to $0.60 and $0.46, respectively. 
Now let me take you through our segment performance. From a high level, all of our segments experienced a similar progression through the quarter. We saw significant year-over-year pressure in April, as regions sheltered in place. This was followed by sequential improvement in May and June as consumers shifted to open channels, including online and closed stores began to reopen. 
For the quarter, U.S. Innerwear sales increased approximately 67% over the prior year, while the operating margin expanded nearly 550 basis points to 27.8%. Both revenue and operating profit exceeded our base case scenario, driven by better-than-expected sales in both our core Innerwear and new PPE businesses, our significant fixed cost leverage from higher sales and by lower SG&A expense due to our temporary cost reduction initiatives. 
Adjusting for sales from our PPE business, core U.S. Innerwear performed significantly better than our base case scenario. Core revenue declined approximately 27% over prior year, with Basics down 18% and Intimates down 52%. These better than base case results were driven by the strong performance of our Basics and Intimates businesses, within the channels that remain open as well as the reopening of mid-tier and department store channels late in the quarter. On the back of improved point-of-sale during the quarter, we have seen booking trends in both Basics and Intimates strengthen through July. 
Turning to U.S. Activewear. Revenue declined 52% over prior year, which was better than our base case scenario. The year-over-year decline was due to COVID related door closures as well as school closings and fewer group events that significantly impacted our Sports Apparel and Printwear businesses. 
As expected, Activewear's operating margin declined over prior year. Deleveraged from lower sales, deleveraged from minimum royalty payments in our Sports License business. And our decision to hold Champion marketing investment flat over prior year more than offset our temporary cost savings initiatives. 
While Champion experienced headwinds due to COVID related channel closures, we were encouraged by the accelerating point-of-sale trends through the quarter and a continued POS strength in July. We believe this underscores the consumers' ongoing desire for the brand and points to improving revenue trends going forward. 
Switching to our International segment. Revenue is well ahead of our base case scenario. As compared to last year, revenue declined approximately 20% on a reported basis and 17% on a constant currency basis. Adjusting for PPE sales, core International revenue declined 44% as compared to the prior year. The better than base case performance in our core International business was driven by online as well as the performance of our company-owned stores as they reopened. 
The International segment's operating margin of 17.3% increased 310 basis points over prior year, driven by lower SG&A costs as we benefited from various temporary cost savings initiatives. 
Touching briefly on our Global Champion business. Excluding C9, revenue declined 46% over prior year with declines in both our domestic and international businesses. Like other parts of our business, Global Champion was hindered by closures of our company-owned stores and channel partner doors early in the quarter. As doors reopened, Global Champion trends improved through the quarter with momentum continuing through July, reinforcing our expectation for sequential improvement in Champion sales through the balance of the year. 
Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. We delivered a strong cash flow performance in the quarter, generating $65 million of cash flow from operations. Year-to-date, operating cash flow was approximately $40 million above last year. The strong performance was driven by previously planned inventory reduction efforts, temporary cost savings initiatives, continued working capital discipline and timely actions taken within our manufacturing network. 
With respect to our balance sheet, inventory declined approximately $265 million or 12% compared to last year. Leverage was 3.4x on a net debt to adjusted EBITDA basis, down from 3.5x last year. And we ended the quarter with approximately $1.8 billion of liquidity, which we believe provides us with significant cash -- capital cushion in this uncertain environment. 
Due to the uncertainty and unpredictability of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the current lack of visibility in our business environment, we are not providing third quarter or full year 2020 guidance at this time. However, I will like to share a few thoughts to help frame some of the key levers within our business model. 
Looking at our Apparel business, which excludes PPE, revenue declined approximately 40% over prior year in the second quarter. Absent any rollbacks of store reopenings, we currently foresee an environment for the year-over-year decline in our Apparel business to improve sequentially in both this third and fourth quarter. With respect to our PPE business, we currently expect more than a $150 million of PPE revenue in the second half, the vast majority of which is expected in the third quarter. 
While we continue to tightly manage SG&A expenses, the amount of temporary cost savings from the second quarter are currently not expected to repeat in the second half. Combined with a lower overall unit and sales volume, we believe it is reasonable to assume year-over-year pressure on margins in both this third and fourth quarters. 
Now with respect to our tax rate, we currently expect a rate of approximately 17.5% for the second half. And in terms of cash flow, we continue to expect to generate positive cash flow in the second half of the year. 
So in closing, we delivered strong second quarter results. Our balance sheet is healthy, and we believe we have ample liquidity. While there remains a significant amount of uncertainty, we are encouraged by the positive underlying momentum in our Apparel business, which we believe points to a return to pre-COVID levels in our business once the pandemic has passed. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to T.C."

I wanted to ask my one question around PPE, this new business that you have, $752 million. Could you dive in a little bit more? How much of that is government? Was any of that consumer in the quarter? Is there any recurring element to the government side of it? And then how do we think about the consumer piece? Is it mostly a mask business and wholesale versus DTC? And then if you could also talk about on the manufacturing side, how you're able to switch over your manufacturing? Are there kind of nuances and complexities investors should be aware of? 
And then is it easy to switch it back as the traditional Innerwear business ramps back up again and you need to use that capacity? How easy is it to build additional capacity, kind of all of that kind of discussion around that PPE business, I think, would be really helpful."

And I would just say, first, we're just delighted with how the big quarter came out, and we exceeded our expectations. And certainly, the PPE portion you're asking about, but also meaningfully in our Apparel business, and it's just an extraordinary effort by the organization in total. 
So we're very pleased with it. From the PPE standpoint, that business within the quarter was predominantly government and there was business-to-business element of it as well. We did add some more contracts on the government side in mask and gowns late in the quarter, which caused the over-delivery on that side as well as businesses began to open up, in particular, they were seeking mask for their employees and so forth. 
As I noted in my comments, as we're moving now into the third quarter, we are focusing on shipping our consumer businesses that are showing up at retail and that was over $150 million number we put out for the balance of the year. Those are in-store now, heavily under the Hanes name, but also under the Champion name, selling through extremely well, very strong reaction to those businesses as well. Our research tells us the consumer is really looking for a trusted brand and innovation, and it's right up our alley and good response. And so we're pleased with that. And I think that alone could be a $200 million to $300 million kind of business on an annualized basis in the future. 
Relative to future government business, there, certainly, could be additional opportunities out there, and we'll certainly seek those as the opportunity emerges. But those would be incremental and opportunistic at this point relative to our guidance on the consumer side of things. 
From the standpoint of manufacturing, certainly, to ramp at the pace we did in Q2, we used internal production and used outside production as well to bring up a very quick ramp to the total production. As it's come down to a more level production for the consumer side of things, we've fallen back into our own manufacturing facilities. And that's not a big switch for us. It's very similar in production to our panty or underwear products, and we make them alongside in the same facilities, and we can certainly support that going forward.

And certainly, we did see nice POS trends, and we've seen those continue into July. I would say that an important achievement during that period of time is in the large retailer. We completed the placement -- the replacement of their underwear department, and we captured space there and we've seen nice performance as that's come through the placement. 
I would say, overall, we gained 300 basis points of share in Basics, and it was across a number of areas. It was across socks, it was across women's panties, and it was across underwear. And certainly, underwear benefiting from that retail space expansion. So there's a lot of activity there. We can now see our back-to-school bookings, and they're solid as well. And then back-to-school is a very important period for our Innerwear businesses. 
In addition, we can all see all the way out to holiday, and we see a nice increase in holiday bookings at this point in time. So there's just a lot of energy in Innerwear that gives us a lot of good feeling about it, and we feel it's on pace to potentially get back to stability as we work to the latter half of the year.

Certainly, from the standpoint of Champion, early in the second quarter with much of the specialty and department stores channels closed, Champion saw very nice growth online. And as we mentioned, we had a 40% increase, for example, in the U.S. in our POS relative to prior year, driven heavily by online. That's online in third-party brick-and-mortar, where we were seeing sometime triple-digit rates in the U.S. as well as our own champion.com, which you may recall, we just sort of upgraded. It was in the 200% increase level. If I take you internationally, we saw as the markets reopened, the brand also ramped very quickly back to sort of pre-COVID, kind of, momentum and it ramped very nicely. 
And all of that momentum is carried for us into early July as we look forward. I did mention in my comments that we can now see farther out, even as far as into next year and our bookings have been very favorable there. And there's no doubt that the retailers witnessed the strength around the world of Champion even online, as markets were closed and it has created a lot of interest in our brand. They clearly see that the consumer is pursuing the brand, even when channels are closed. They're pursuing it online. So there's a lot of momentum in that business. And so those bookings were very favorable as we look to the spring of next year, and it was around the world. It was no one market, it was a global market. 
I would add to that, that we still anticipate our Champion second partner ramping their stores and Champion in the second half of this year. They've already brought our online business on. In China, we've seen very nice growth there online as well. So there's just a lot of energy in Champion. We remain very bullish on our ability to reach our $3 billion goal over time."

And on top of the POS, we've gotten some opportunity to fill up some holes out there. So we -- that obviously -- the answer is we would lean on inventory, and we're ramping back up to match demand on the Innerwear side of things. 
And on the Champion side, as the channels have opened up, we've gotten a clearer view of bookings out of some of the channels that were closed. We're ramping that production as well, and what we expect is a nice sequential improvement in Champion in Q3.

It's -- if I take the store question first, POS is -- or the traffic is generally ramped back at a sequentially improving pace, as we we've opened the doors, most of the doors. And you'll recall, we have Champion doors around the world. So there's no one answer to this. Some are faster than others. But if I give you a couple, for example, in Europe where in Italy stores reopened, late May and the June. We saw the traffic began to ramp nicely as soon as they were open. It's not yet and generally back to last year's levels, but it's ramping nicely. 
In Australia, we have a few Champion stores there as well as many bond stores. As the markets open, we saw a very quick ramp back in traffic there, approaching last year's levels. And the U.S. has been sort of a mix of both of those. It's a little slower. But in our outlet stores -- our U.S. outlet stores, the traffic has been a little slower, but we've seen higher conversion. So the shoppers that come in all those channels are very determined, and they're buying more in general as they come to the stores. So generally, I would summarize a little slower traffic and maybe a little higher conversion in total. 
From the standpoint of capital investment in our online, we don't expect dramatic capital investment to support our growth here. Remember, our growth's coming from a combination of working very carefully with the large pure-play and brick-and-mortar players that are out there, and that's always been a wholesale business for us directly to their warehouses, and they handle it. And our surging or growing online here, we have plenty of distribution space. We've done -- we spent the last year or so investing in our systems and upgrading our systems, and we believe those are scalable with a reasonable investment."

And certainly, the POS as the customers there. When they could find it online, they went and found it, and now that it's open at retail, they're going to both places. So we're very encouraged for this -- the expectation and what we see in bookings for sequential improvement in that business, a lot of strength there. 
From the mask standpoint, the vast majority of the mask were Hanes mask. There was a small element of Champion primarily sold on our online sites. So I think speaking to the strength of the brand, we put them out there and they sold out immediately. So we've gone back and we're making more, but it was a smaller portion of our focus.

Again, we are continuing to monitor our balances there with our customers and working closely with them to manage any exposures. We did have a bad debt charge of $11 million in the quarter, but that related to several of our smaller customers that were impacted by COVID. And as you would expect with the COVID market disruption. As for the financial strain on some of the retailers due to store closures and just reduced consumer spending. But again, we're working closely with our customers and managing the balances there. 
And feel really good about the progress that we've made in the quarter with our customers as far as the collection efforts in those balances. We feel really good about that. The reports that the PPE business and the receivable balance, again, the $752 million of revenue that flowed through the quarter, a lot of that was later in the quarter. And so we do have a larger receivable balance at the end of the quarter. You'll notice that in the cash flow statement, the use for receivables was up more than it normally is. But again, we will expect that collection to happen pretty quickly in the third quarter. So again, we feel really good about our receivables balance at the end of the quarter."

From the standpoint of the back-to-school, we've got good view to that. We're right in the middle of it right now. And I think when you think about back-to-school, it's most important to our Basics business and Innerwear and from Champion, it's certainly a replenishable item as well. 
What we saw is even in the worst of the pandemic lockdown, when that online picked up the business for both Basics, and as you heard in my comments, we were up year-over-year in Champion and in Basics in that May, June period. So we have good view to it from the standpoint of bookings. We can see our secondary displays with our retailers, much of the Basics business is a mask business. So we feel like we're well fixed to sell the business. In the event -- in the unexpected event that there could be a lockdown of certain channels, we think we're well positioned to pick that up online. So we expect it to be a good back-to-school from the standpoint of performance relative to the market we're operating in."

I'd like to begin by thanking our Board for the opportunity to lead this great company. I also want to thank the entire team around the world for their warm welcome and their assistance as I get up to speed on our business. I'm honored and excited to be leading such a passionate team as we embark on a growth-oriented journey. .
The global pandemic has clearly created significant challenges and uncertainty. It's impacted everything from our business visibility to our manufacturing, to consumer traffic in our stores and on our website. And it continues with this week's European announcements regarding new lockdowns and curfews. 
In this unpredictable environment, I'm encouraged by the progress we're making on a number of fronts. I've been impressed with the team, the way they've been able to adapt and respond to the challenges of 2020. We're seeing revenue momentum in our business, and I feel good about our strategic assessment and the progress we've already made towards defining the ambition and strategic goals for the organization. 
For today's call, I'll begin by sharing some insights about myself and why I was attracted to this opportunity. I'll then speak to the strategic assessment that we began on my first day. I'll offer some thoughts on the process, what we are looking at as well as share some initial observations. And I'll end with a few comments on our current business performance before handing off to Scott for a more detailed review of the results and our fourth quarter guidance. 
Hanesbrands is a great company. We have iconic brands. We have global breadth and supply chain scale. We have a solid balance sheet. There's a long-standing commitment to sustainability, and we have a dedicated passionate team with a genuine appetite and readiness for change. With this strong foundation, I see significant opportunities and potential to drive growth and shareholder value. 
With respect to my background, at heart, I'm a brand and product person. I believe in providing great products borne directly from consumer insights. I believe in the power of brands to differentiate, tell stories and build lasting loyalty. I'm growth oriented. I like to change and transform things. And I like to think big. To that end, I want Hanesbrands to be one of the most admired global apparel companies. One that is growth-oriented and consistently delivers strong shareholder value. I'm also a big believer in communication: being unvarnished, honest and transparent, both internally and with all of you. 
With that backdrop, I'd like to give you a sense of how I spent my first 3 months as CEO. The global pandemic has certainly altered my approach. My preference would be to spend the first several weeks traveling, meeting with customers, visiting our stores, touring our manufacturing facilities in Asia, Central America and the Caribbean and sitting with our teams around the globe. While it's frustrating not to be able to get out and meet face-to-face, I've had plenty of interactions with our global team and our customers via video meetings and virtual plant tours. I've done a lot of listening. I've been asking a ton of questions, and I've immersed myself in learning about our various businesses. 
As I mentioned on my first day, we began a detailed objective assessment of the business. This is what I call the unvarnished truth. It will define our opportunities as well as the challenges we must address to be successful and reach our full potential. The strategic assessment is the foundation on which we will set our ambition for Hanesbrands. From there, we will build our short- and long-term operating plans to achieve our goals. 
With respect to the scope of the strategic assessment, we are evaluating our entire global portfolio. We're looking at historical performance, category trends, channel dynamics and competitive landscape across geographies and business segments. We're analyzing our cost structure across spend categories. We're analyzing the current level and mix of our inventory, and we're looking at how we're organized. 
We're also studying our supply chain, our technology infrastructure and our concept to consumer processes. We're evaluating our online and direct-to-consumer capabilities. We're analyzing our consumer mix, our brand equity measures and our product quality. We're even looking at how we are perceived by retailers. 
So let me share some initial observations from our work today. This is a great company with a strong foundation that we can leverage. However, in an environment where the pace of change is accelerating, for us to be successful and reach our full potential, we must become a more agile, consumer-centric, growth-oriented company. 
So what does this mean? It means that we're going to align Hanesbrands to become a company that embraces change, act decisively, moves quickly and shares a common ambition. We'll have a consumer-centric mindset. The consumer is going to be at the center of everything that we do. We'll become faster and more flexible by simplifying our organizational structure as well as streamlining processes and decision making, particularly around concept to consumer. We'll commit to growth. 
For example, we'll support the momentum in the Champion brand globally as well as the growth in Bonds and Bras N Things in Australia, particularly online. And not surprisingly, we need to return U.S. innerwear to consistent year-over-year growth by applying a more consumer-centric approach to our brands, evolving our supply chain capabilities and capturing new opportunities. 
Lastly, it means we're going to build certain capabilities that improve efficiency and speed, enable growth and position the company for long-term success. We are looking for opportunities to modernize our technology. We're looking at segmenting our supply chain to accelerate our time to market and meet the unique needs of our diverse brands and businesses. We must expand our digital focus and capabilities to be able to capture our share of online growth. And we'll invest in talent, filling current gaps while also developing the next-generation of leaders. 
Our investments will be deliberate and targeted we've already started a comprehensive review of our current cost structure to identify near-term savings opportunities that can be used to fuel some of our investments. I feel very good about the progress we've made. The global team is highly engaged, and there's a lot of energy, excitement and a genuine desire for change. We're working with purpose, and we're moving fast. This will be a multiyear journey that I believe will be rewarding for both our people and our shareholders. 
You'll begin to see parts of our strategy unfold this quarter, and we look forward to updating you on our progress over the coming months. 
Turning to our results. Overall, Hanes brand had a solid third quarter with revenue, operating profit, earnings per share and operating cash flow coming in above our expectations. Scott will provide a more detailed review of our results, so I'll focus my comments on 4 key takeaways from the quarter. 
First, we saw good momentum across the business, as apparel revenue trend improved sequentially in each of our business segments. We're encouraged by the trends in U.S. Innerwear. Sales, excluding PPE, increased 11.5% over prior year, driven by continued point-of-sale strength and broad-based inventory restocking by retailers. Despite shipments exceeding point-of-sale in the quarter, inventory at retail remains below last year's levels. Therefore, we expect some level of retailer restocking to continue in the fourth quarter. We're pleased with the global improvement in Champion as sales increased nearly 130% from the second quarter. Compared to last year, sales declined 9% due primarily to our sports apparel business, where COVID-related headwinds have essentially shut down sporting events and college bookstores. Excluding this, sales would have been down 2%. We were also impacted by COVID-driven supply challenges in the quarter. Absent these 2 items, Champion sales increased over prior year. We expect the supply challenges to improve in the fourth quarter. And with global spring/summer 2021 bookings up over 2019 levels, we expect Champion's momentum to carry into next year. Looking forward, I'm excited and confident in the global potential of Champion. There's a lot of opportunity for growth over the next several years. 
The second takeaway is that we're facing second half profitability headwinds, which were mentioned on last quarter's call. The timing of negative manufacturing variances and higher SG&A expense are expected to pressure both gross and operating margins in the fourth quarter. We're also facing additional uncertainty from the latest COVID trends. 
Third, we delivered another strong cash flow quarter, generating nearly $250 million of operating cash flow. While we now expect to end the year with higher-than-anticipated PPE inventory, we continue to expect to generate positive operating cash flow in the second half and for the full year. 
And the fourth takeaway for the quarter, we further strengthened our liquidity, ending the quarter with $2 billion of liquidity, which we believe provides us with plenty of operating flexibility in this uncertain environment. 
So in closing, we're making progress in an increasingly unpredictable environment. We're seeing good revenue momentum in our business. We're moving quickly with our strategic and cost assessment. We're defining our ambition, identifying our opportunities and building our plans to become more agile, consumer-centric, growth-oriented company. I'm excited to begin this multiyear journey, one that I believe will be rewarding to both our people and our shareholders. 
Before turning the call over, I want to thank our incredible team of more than 63,000 around the globe for their dedication and commitment to serving our customers during this challenging time. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Scott."
4212820,692016792,2130297,"Hanesbrands Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Nov 05, 2020",2020-11-05,"Earnings Calls","Hanesbrands Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Steve. Overall, Hanesbrands had a strong quarter with the results across all of our key metrics coming in above our expectations. Revenue momentum continued across the business, driven by continued strength in point-of-sale trends and broad-based",1394,"Thanks, Steve. Overall, Hanesbrands had a strong quarter with the results across all of our key metrics coming in above our expectations. Revenue momentum continued across the business, driven by continued strength in point-of-sale trends and broad-based inventory restocking. As expected, margins declined over prior year, but less than we were anticipating, and we generated $249 million of operating cash flow, further strengthening our liquidity position. 
Turning to the details of the results. Third quarter sales increased 3% over prior year to $1.81 billion with foreign exchange rates accounting for 80 basis points of the quarter's growth. Apparel revenue performed better than our expectation for the quarter. Excluding $179 million of PPE sales, apparel revenue declined 7% compared to prior year. This represents a significant improvement from last quarter's 40% decline as each segment experienced a sequential improvement in year-over-year revenue trends. 
Adjusted gross margin of 36.7% decreased approximately 275 basis points over last year due to increased inventory reserves as well as negative manufacturing variances, which were incurred earlier in the year rolling off the balance sheet and onto the P&L. Adjusted operating margin declined approximately 170 basis points over prior year to 12.6% and as the gross margin pressure and higher operating costs from COVID were partially offset by ongoing SG&A controls as well as benefits from our temporary cost savings initiatives. 
Restructuring and other weighted charges were $53 million in the quarter. Approximately $49 million are nonrecurring costs from starting portions of our manufacturing network that closed for approximately 10 weeks beginning in March due to the COVID pandemic. We experienced a stronger-than-expected recovery in point of sale. In an effort to meet demand and best serve our customers, we chose to expedite shipments via air freight as well as temporarily leverage third-party manufacturing capacity. This resulted in short-term incremental cost in the form of freight and sourcing premiums relative to our normal manufacturing cost. We believe this was the right long-term business decision. And in fact, we are already seeing the benefits in the form of newly captured retail shelf space. The remaining $4 million of these costs relates to our previously disclosed supply chain restructuring actions and program exit costs. These actions and their associated costs are on track and remain unchanged from previous disclosures. 
Our tax rate for the quarter was 17.3%, which was in line with our expectations. And adjusted and GAAP earnings per share decreased 11% and 43% over prior year to $0.42 and $0.29, respectively. 
Now let me take you through our segment performance. For the quarter, U.S. Innerwear sales increased 41% over prior year, driven by a 15% increase in basics, a 7% increase in intimates and the inclusion of $166 million of PPE revenue. Excluding PPE, U.S. Innerwear sales increased 11.5% over prior year due to the continued positive point-of-sale trends and inventory restocking by retailers. In our basics business, we experienced growth in each product category, which drove approximately 170 basis points of market share gains in the quarter, with an intimate sales increased at a double-digit rate. This more than offset the decline in shapewear sales, which is a category that continues to be negatively impacted by the coronavirus pandemic. Looking forward, we have seen positive point-of-sale and order trends continue through October. With these trends as well as retail inventory that remains below last year, we expect some level of restocking to continue in the fourth quarter. For the quarter, Innerwear's operating margin expanded approximately 80 basis points over prior year to 21.7%, driven by fixed cost leverage from higher unit volumes as well as favorable product mix. 
Turning to U.S. Activewear. Revenue declined 27% compared to last year, which is an improvement in the second quarter's 52% decline. The last majority of the year-over-year decline was from our sports apparel business, which continues to be significantly impacted by COVID-related headwinds. Activewear's operating margin was 9.1% for the third quarter. As expected, Activewear's margin declined compared to prior year due to the timing of negative manufacturing variances, inventory reserves for some of our non-Champion brands as well as SG&A deleverage from lower sales volumes. However, I will note that the segment margin improved significantly from last quarter's operating loss. Touching briefly on Champion, sales of the Champion brand within our Activewear segment, increased approximately 85% from the second quarter. Compared to last year, sales declined 27%, with the vast majority of the decline due to the sports apparel business. Despite the challenges in sports apparel, we continue to expect sequential improvement in Champion's revenue trends in the fourth quarter, driven by continued point-of-sale growth in key channels and online as well as improved product availability. 
Switching to our International segment. Revenue declined 5% compared to last year on a reported basis and 7% on a constant currency basis. Adjusting for PPE sales, core international revenue declined 7% and as compared to prior year, which is a significant improvement from a 44% decline in the second quarter. For the quarter, international Champion sales increased 5% over prior year. Excluding the impact from foreign exchange rates, we experienced growth in our Americas and Champion Europe businesses. This was more than offset by declines in our European Innerwear, Asia and Australia businesses where COVID-related challenges have slowed the retail recovery. National segment's operating margin declined approximately 100 basis points over prior year to 15.2%, driven by deleverage from lower sales volumes, which was partially offset by continued tight SG&A cost management. 
Turning to cash flow. We generated $249 million of operating cash flows in the quarter. Looking at our balance sheet, inventory increased 4% over prior year which was in line with sales growth and includes approximately $400 million of PPE inventory. Excluding PPE, inventory declined 15% compared to prior year. Leverage at the end of the quarter was 3.3x on a net debt to adjusted EBITDA basis, which was comparable to last year. While liquidity remains our short-term focus in a post COVID environment, our focus would be to return our leverage ratio to below 3x. We further strengthened our liquidity position in the quarter, even while reducing debt by approximately $130 million and paying our regular quarterly dividend. We ended the quarter with $2 billion of liquidity above the $1.8 billion at the end of the second quarter. We continue to believe we have significant capital cushion in this uncertain environment. 
And now turning to guidance. Outlook reflects the continued uncertainty due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our outlook is based on the current business environment, which, among other items, reflects the lockdowns and curfews put in place over the past week in Europe. Outlook does not reflect any potential impact to the consumer or operating environments should governments or businesses institute additional lockdowns and store closings. I want to remind everyone that all year-over-year comparisons reference our rebased 2019 results. I also point you to our press release and FAQ document for additional guidance details. 
For the fourth quarter, we expect total sales of $1.60 billion to $1.66 billion, which at the midpoint implies a 2% decline over prior year. Prior to this week's European lockdowns, our revenue outlook assumed a low single-digit growth. Included in our sales outlook is approximately $50 million of PPE sales, approximately $10 million of foreign exchange benefit and contributions from a 53rd week. We expect adjusted operating profit of $160 million to $180 million, which at the midpoint implies an operating margin of 10.4%. 
Expected year-over-year margin pressure is due to the timing of negative manufacturing variances and higher SG&A expense. We expect interest and other expense of approximately $50 million and a tax rate of approximately 17.5%. Our guidance for adjusted and GAAP earnings per share range from $0.25 to $0.30 and $0.24 to $0.29, respectively. And our guidance for full year 2020 operating cash flow is $300 million to $400 million, which includes the impact from the higher-than-anticipated PPE inventory. Based on our year-to-date cash flow, this implies fourth quarter operating cash flow of approximately $70 million to $170 million. 
So in closing, I'm encouraged by how we're managing through the increasingly unpredictable environment. We're seeing good revenue momentum in our business. I'm excited about our strategic assessment we're doing to define our strategy, and I look forward to the journey ahead. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to T.C."

I'm really excited to have the opportunity to work with 2 really amazing brands that quite frankly are in different places on their journey. Let me start with Hanes a little bit. Obviously, incredible household penetration, well known brand, been around a very long time and has a really, really big installed base. It leads an awful lot of its categories from a share position and it's in categories that, quite frankly, in many cases, aren't relatively lower growth. So it becomes a big share gain. And we have to think really strategically about where we can gain share, how we can do it. And you'll hear me talk about this idea of consumer centricity and the ability to make that a core value of the company and look through the lens of the consumer at everything we do and make sure they have a positive experience all the way from when they first engage to our brand, all the way through purchase and beyond and usage of the product. That will build trust and loyalty over time. 
And I think for Hanes, we look at where it is today, it has really good equity scores. People like it. It's really known for its quality and things like comfort. But when you really start to dig into the business, you'll see that the brand is aging a little bit, and we need to reach a younger consumer that's large. They're growing. They're very influential demo. And we need to make sure that we're developing products and talking to them directly. That will also step a little bit further just beyond Hanes into our intimates business, really differentiating our brands and really making sure that we're very purposeful in our channel strategies over time of where we want to build the business and how do we do that. So there's some real specific choices to be made in the Hanes world, but I think it's -- you're working off an incredible base. We just need to -- we need to fine-tune it for the new markets that it's competing in today. 
Now Champion, a little bit different position. I'll be honest, one of the main reasons I came here was the opportunity to work with -- on Champion and with the potential that it has. What Hanes is a highly developed from a market share perspective. When you look at activewear across the board and you segment it out by category, Champion is more a challenger brand, a small share position and a lot of opportunity to grow share in a lot of different categories, particularly with women over time. And it has a much broader kind of a global presence. And we're seeing really good growth from around the globe. Excited about some of the things we're doing in China and South Korea. But here, you're really talking about a -- while it's not a new brand, it's a young brand platform and one that presents a lot of opportunities to target different consumers, do a lot of innovation. There's some exciting things that are coming around new product platforms that we're trying. The new one that I saw just released around called Storm Tech, which is taking all of our reverse weave technology and making it water repellent. There's some new dye technologies coming. So there's a lot of opportunity to expand this brand into new usage occasions and gain share across all the different segments that it participates in. So a lot of opportunity, a lot of work to do. We're at the beginning of this journey to take us to where we need to get to. But I think both of the brands have just huge future potential. They've been successful, but I think we're just scratching the surface on where that can go."

And how does technology and IT investment play into that transformation? And then to Scott, you had mentioned the change in sort of low single-digit growth or growth in sales to low single-digit decline.

Thanks for repeating that. In terms of consumer perception of brand, very positive. And I obviously did my research before I came here to understand and came from, quite frankly, a position that had a lot of insight into a lot of different brands and what was trending and what wasn't trending and how the retail environment view things and how consumers view it. So I think all the brands are viewed very positive where they're positioned today. But as I said earlier, in particularly in Hanes, I think there's some work to do to reach some new consumers. But you're starting from a positive position. We're not -- there's not an equity decline or a penetration issues and things like that. It's more about where do you take them going forward. 
And kind of moving into your second question, digital will be a big piece of it. In general, it's true with most companies today, we need to become more digital, not just in our consumer facing business by the way, but in our internal, how we operate systems, how we go to market. One of the things that we're going to have to spend some time thinking about, and I don't have an answer for you today, but it's some work that we're going to do, is be very purposeful on our digital strategy with our different brands and understand how we want to go-to-market with Hanes versus Champion versus Bali. The digital strategy and the go-to-market strategy, the channel strategy for digital may be different by those brands, and we're going to be very purposeful and thoughtful in terms of how we do that. 
Underlying that, more from a technology perspective, I think that we have an opportunity -- the word I've been using is modernize our technology a bit. That will help us improve our speed and our efficiency, how we go to market, tying these new channels together, tying into our supply chain. We have a big opportunity there to improve how we operate. 
And then finally, on guidance, we feel good about the revenue momentum in our business overall. And you heard the results from third quarter and how we're building momentum. I would tell you that in the Innerwear business, we expect to continue to have year-over-year growth in that business. Obviously, the restocking is going to be a benefit, but it's not going to be as big of a benefit as maybe we saw in Q3, but we still continue to see the positive trends there. Activewear, we continue to see strong demand for Champion, and we expect to see sequential improvement in our revenue trends there. Clearly, sports apparel is going to continue to be a drag on the business right now, which is obviously highly COVID-related. 
And to answer your last point directly, yes, the most recent announcements in Europe, we took those into account, and it changed our numbers quite frankly as what we expected in the fourth quarter. So we're trying to be as transparent as we can be and include as much of the data that is kind of coming at us live as we can in terms of what the guidance is."

And -- but we did anticipate",677,"Thanks for your question. And so I'll start off with gross margin and hit on your questions there and also speak to a little bit impact that we have on SG&A. So starting with gross margin. We had -- it was lower year-on-year. And -- but we did anticipate this. We actually came in a little bit better than we initially expected. So our gross margin was down 275 basis points from last year. And then within gross margin, we had 2 main headwinds that were causing the downward pressure. The first was negative manufacturing variances, which accounts for a little more than half of the decline. And just a little bit of background on that, as a reminder, like other companies who have supply chain operations, you have manufacturing variances. As those are incurred, these are capitalized on to the balance sheet, and then they roll off on the P&L and the cost of sales as the inventory is sold. Now these specific variances were incurred earlier this year from lower unit production that we had initially planned, which essentially raises the fixed cost per unit. .
The other headwind in gross margin, and it actually covers the remainder of the decline, was additional inventory reserves that we recognized this quarter. These reserves primarily relate to the Hanes Europe innerwear business and our sports apparel business. 
As you move down the P&L, our overall operating margin was down 170 basis points. So you can see we're able to offset some of the gross margin headwind with lower SG&A. And that resulting from this tight cost controls and benefits from COVID-related temporary cost savings initiatives that we put in place earlier this year. 
Now there are a couple of items in SG&A that are higher. We have some incremental COVID-related costs like cleaning and health supplies that we're incurring to protect our employees and customers, which actually started in the second quarter. And also in addition to this, and we were speaking to it earlier, we had some costs that started this quarter and will continue related to the developing of our strategic assessment. So we'll have that and those impacts moving forward. 
Now speaking to moving forward into the fourth quarter on the margin side, the margins are going to be down like we expected. We made reference to that in our last call, we have second half headwinds in our margin. And about half of the decline is going to be in gross profit and the other half is in SG&A. And let me give you some color around both of those. 
Now within gross margin, about half the decline is related to the negative manufacturing variances that we spoke to that we incurred earlier in this year. That will be flowing through and into the fourth quarter. Now one thing I do want to point out is as you -- as we can see the variances that are currently on the balance sheet that will flow through into the P&L early next year that we can actually see these specific headwinds that are impacting Q3 and Q4 will not -- will be behind us as we go into 2021. 
Now the other half of the decline in gross margin was actually split between just lower sales volume and product mix. 
And then going to SG&A. We have several items that are kind of roughly about the same impact on margin. The first is the fixed cost deleverage from lower sales volume. And this is a reminder, about 2/3 of our SG&A is fixed. The second item relates to some -- actually some timing of some compensation-related expenses that which in the fourth quarter of last year were lower than our -- than normal levels. So this is more really a year-over-year comparability item versus 2019, not necessarily ongoing higher cost. 
And then last couple of things, which I'd speak to that impacted Q3 will also impact Q4 as those costs associated with developing the strategic assessment and those recurring caveated costs that we're having."

The business going forward, we talked about about expecting about $50 million of sales in Q4. It's moving very quickly in terms of the market is changing. We see this going forward as there'll be an opportunity for us to continue to sell PPE, but the long-term opportunity really remains unclear at this point. It's a very fragmented market out there. So the way we're positioned and think about it is you should consider PPE kind of a near-term opportunity for 2020, and we're not factoring it in. It is a huge business for us going forward at this point. But that could change, and we'll have to see how things progress in the market."

So we'll be looking holistically at how do we thoughtfully increase, probably not consistently across the portfolio, and I think it's just not all brands, but pick our bets and lean in and make sure that we continue to develop those brands with the right demographics. .
Jumping to private label, whether I see private label as a threat. Absolutely, it's a threat. The challenge for us is what we do about it. And when I -- we think about my background, I've worked on both sides of the private label business. I've built private label, and I worked in branded companies before. So a pretty good feel for what it takes to compete on both sides. But when you think about private label on the retailer side, they want and expect brands like Hanes that we have to drive traffic to their store. That's our responsibility as a brand. So we need to make sure that the brands are -- they're in demand, they're relevant, we've got the right innovation, and that consumers are seeking them out. And when consumers are seeking your brand, they rise up in the importance for retail over time. So I think when you look at the brands this company has, when you look at the capabilities that we have from an innovation and from a supply chain perspective, we should be able to compete very well, build our brands, deliver the right quality and the innovation at the pace that's needed to win against private label. And it doesn't mean private label is going away because it's not. It serves a purpose for the retailer. But well positioned brands that are running appropriately and are valued by the retailer should be able to compete extremely well."

So we're working on trying to figure out what is right. And by the way, it's not just about spending. It's having the right plan behind the brands to spend behind. So you're not just going to see us all of a sudden, just strong marketing money into the market. We're going to be working very closely on building the right brands, positioning the right plans, the right -- behind the right products. And then I do think you'll see that number increase over time to -- I'm not sure what the right number is right now, but I definitely see it being higher. But I don't want it to come across as we're happy with where we are. We have the right programs. We have the right message. We have all the right product, and it's just a spending exercise. That will be the end of the process that we get to. So we're going to go through all the brand development work, any repositioning work we need to do, and then we would increase spending after we're ready to do that. ."

To address your question on Champion, so we did see a decline of 27%, which is, again, a large sequential improvement versus the quarter to the second quarter. And as we move into the fourth quarter, we continue to see that sequential improvement on the U.S. side. We have a strong demand there. It's really going to be about as we move into the fourth quarter about improving our product availability that Steve mentioned in his earlier remarks. So again, a lot of positive trends there as we move into the fourth quarter. And even beyond that, as we talked about earlier, into 2021, our spring/summer bookings are above comparable 2019 levels. 
Now on the international side, again, similar story there. We're going to see some positive growth, again Europe business -- for the business there in champion. In Asia, again, we've seen some challenges there from COVID this year. But as we move forward and we're expecting these things stabilize in China, we already have expanded our second retail partner there. We expected to add 150 doors this year, which is above our prior estimate of 100 doors. So we're seeing distribution gains internationally as well."

And there's been a lot of good work done in terms of understanding who the consumer is and where we can play. Some new brand platforms, some of them that I mentioned earlier from a product perspective, is a big opportunity for us. And getting into new categories. Our -- as I said earlier, our share you look at it by category, is not that high. And so we're a challenger brand, and we're operating that way. And we see lots of opportunities in China and South Korea to continue to build the brand with our partnerships there with Bell and LF. We're seeing growth opportunities there. So we have a lot more work to be done on building it out. Targeting women is going to be an opportunity for us. But we're going to build out a really strong merchandising point of view around the globe. That's going to enable us to create leverage for fabric platforms and new product innovation.

And I don't -- sorry, into Q4, and I don't see that changing. So less restocking, but still some and still positive POS strength. And as I said, we've already got some October guidance -- our understanding of our business that we can see from there. 
In terms of the category over time, U.S. Innerwear overall, the business overall, the categories overall, are not high growth categories. They're different than you're seeing athleisure trends and things like that are driving big growth. These are more stable categories over time. But I think they're very healthy categories over time, and we're seeing that in demand for products. So I think with fewer doors, you have to operate differently. I like where we're positioned in the market and where we're really strong tends to be where the trend and the momentum is in the market. So I think our position is solid, and I think you'll continue to see a good solid category in business going forward, but it's going to be a share gain inside the category in total. Because per capita is relatively flat. So I like where we're positioned, and I think the category will remain healthy over time."

We're -- I'd like to say we're building a road map, but we need to make sure we're all starting from the same place, and that's been our assessment so far. So I wouldn't get to that conclusion yet that we're going to be smaller with higher margin, we're going to follow that model. We haven't decided on that yet. .
In terms of when you're going to start to see this, you'll start to see some of our strategy and our actions playing out in the fourth quarter. And we'll continue to update you as we go forward.

It may or may not be 100% at that point, but we'll certainly give you more clarity on the go-forward at that point. 
In terms of looking at the brands and things that I think they could have done, I would say these are general, nothing to do with necessarily my previous role, but as I said earlier, I think we need to continue to invest. Brands need to continue to invest behind themselves today. And there's lots of challenger brands out there. There's lots of people pushing. You need to compete for share of voice with the consumer. So I think continuing to invest in the brands is something that I would do. 
I would say, portfolio simplification. These are complicated categories, and you try to go to shop them at the shelf. There's a lot of complexity. So I think the ability to continue to simplify, reach a broad set of customers, but simplify and lean in behind core businesses. And speed, being incredibly consumer responsive and reactive and moving at the pace of the consumer. It's a challenge for lots of different brands right now, and I think it's an opportunity for us going forward. So those are a couple of things that are on my mind coming in. Some are obviously grounded in past experience. But just looking more broadly across the market, I think those are some opportunities for us."

And we're going to be focused on a lot of different things that may -- we may need to put some muscle behind. I talked earlier about modernizing technology. I think we have to look at our supply chain going forward and really understanding how do we make it -- how do we align it to make sure it supports all of our key businesses as we go forward. It was built on 1 model and incredibly successful at doing that. And it's proven its ability to flex to some extent. But I think we're challenging its flexibility right now as we build out our D2C business in different parts around the world. So we're looking at doing that. .
But I don't -- what I don't want you to do is think about the investment is going to be ramped, and we're not going to be really thoughtful and targeted and thoughtful how we do it. Underneath that, we're starting a cost transformation program at the same time. Some of these are short-term costs to kind of mobilize some short-term efforts to fuel some of these growth initiatives that we're putting into, and some are more longer-term cost initiatives that are restructuring inside and thinking about different ways of working that will present cost savings opportunities. So we're obviously going to be as aggressive on the cost side as we are on the investment side and fund as much of it as we can out of how we operate today.

But I would tell you there's good response to our brands online, particularly Champion, and as customers are going and looking and seeking product, particularly new platforms that come in. And if you look, products play differently. Our more basic traditional products tend to do extremely well on third-party partner retailers where they go to find that. And some of our smaller intimate brands tend to skew the other way. 
So the good news for us is, I think we can shape that as we go forward and have the ability to really make purposeful choices over time.

So we're not -- we cover that part, but I wouldn't say we're perfectly aligned to that right now. And we have the opportunity to go and pivot to target that younger consumer and make our brands younger, particularly the Hanes brand. The art in doing that is not lose that current base and attract new consumers and bring them in. And that's the marketing art challenge that we have to go through.

I'd like to begin by thanking our Board for the opportunity to lead this great company. I also want to thank the entire team around the world for their warm welcome and their assistance as I get up to speed on our business. I'm honored and excited to be leading such a passionate team as we embark on a growth-oriented journey.
The global pandemic has clearly created significant challenges and uncertainty. It's impacted everything from our business visibility to our manufacturing, to consumer traffic in our stores and on our website. And it continues with this week's European announcements regarding new lockdowns and curfews. In this unpredictable environment, I'm encouraged by the progress we're making on a number of fronts. I've been impressed with the team, the way they've been able to adapt and respond to the challenges of 2020. We're seeing revenue momentum in our business, and I feel good about our strategic assessment and the progress we've already made toward defining the ambition and strategic goals for the organization.
For today's call, I'll begin by sharing some insights about myself and why I was attracted to this opportunity. I'll then speak to the strategic assessment that we began on my first day. I'll offer some thoughts on the process, what we are looking at as well as share some initial observations. And I'll end with a few comments on our current business performance before handing off to Scott for a more detailed review of the results and our fourth quarter guidance.
Hanesbrands is a great company. We have iconic brands. We have global breadth and supply chain scale. We have a solid balance sheet. There's a long-standing commitment to sustainability, and we have a dedicated, passionate team with a genuine appetite and readiness for change. With this strong foundation, I see significant opportunities and potential to drive growth and shareholder value.
With respect to my background, at heart, I'm a brand and product person. I believe in providing great products borne directly from consumer insights. I believe in the power of brands to differentiate, tell stories and build lasting loyalty. I'm growth oriented. I like to change and transform things. And I like to think big. To that end, I want Hanesbrands to be one of the most admired global apparel companies, one that is growth oriented and consistently delivers strong shareholder value. I'm also a big believer in communication, being unvarnished, honest and transparent, both internally and with all of you.
With that backdrop, I'd like to give you a sense of how I spent my first 3 months as CEO. The global pandemic has certainly altered my approach. My preference would be to spend the first several weeks traveling, meeting with customers, visiting our stores, touring our manufacturing facilities in Asia, Central America and the Caribbean and sitting with our teams around the globe. While it's frustrating not to be able to get out and meet face-to-face, I've had plenty of interactions with our global team and our customers via video meetings and virtual plant tours. I've done a lot of listening, I've been asking a ton of questions and I've immersed myself in learning about our various businesses.
As I mentioned on my first day, we began a detailed, objective assessment of the business. This is what I call the unvarnished truth. It will define our opportunities as well as the challenges we must address to be successful and reach our full potential. The strategic assessment is the foundation on which we will set our ambition for Hanesbrands. From there, we will build our short- and long-term operating plans to achieve our goals.
With respect to the scope of the strategic assessment, we are evaluating our entire global portfolio. We're looking at historical performance, category trends, channel dynamics and competitive landscape across geographies and business segments. We're analyzing our cost structure across spend categories. We're analyzing the current level and mix of our inventory, and we're looking at how we're organized. We're also studying our supply chain, our technology infrastructure and our concept to consumer processes. We're evaluating our online and direct-to-consumer capabilities. We're analyzing our consumer mix, our brand equity measures and our product quality. We're even looking at how we are perceived by retailers.
So let me share some initial observations from our work today. This is a great company with a strong foundation that we can leverage. However, in an environment where the pace of change is accelerating, for us to be successful and reach our full potential, we must become a more agile, consumer-centric, growth-oriented company.
So what does this mean? It means that we're going to align Hanesbrands to become a company that embraces change, acts decisively, moves quickly and shares a common ambition. We'll have a consumer-centric mindset. The consumer is going to be at the center of everything that we do. We'll become faster and more flexible by simplifying our organizational structure as well as streamlining processes and decision-making, particularly around concept to consumer. We'll commit to growth. For example, we'll support the momentum in the Champion brand globally as well as the growth in Bonds and Bras N Things in Australia, particularly online. And not surprisingly, we need to return U.S. Innerwear to consistent year-over-year growth by applying a more consumer-centric approach to our brands, evolving our supply chain capabilities and capturing new opportunities.
Lastly, it means we're going to build certain capabilities that improve efficiency and speed, enable growth and position the company for long-term success. We are looking for opportunities to modernize our technology. We're looking at segmenting our supply chain to accelerate our time to market and meet the unique needs of our diverse brands and businesses. We must expand our digital focus and capabilities to be able to capture our share of online growth. And we'll invest in talent, filling current gaps while also developing the next generation of leaders.
Our investments will be deliberate and targeted. We've already started a comprehensive review of our current cost structure to identify near-term savings opportunities that can be used to fuel some of our investments. I feel very good about the progress we've made. The global team is highly engaged, and there's a lot of energy, excitement and a genuine desire for change. We're working with purpose, and we're moving fast. This will be a multiyear journey that I believe will be rewarding for both our people and our shareholders. You'll begin to see parts of our strategy unfold this quarter, and we look forward to updating you on our progress over the coming months.
Turning to our results. Overall, Hanes brand had a solid third quarter, with revenue, operating profit, earnings per share and operating cash flow coming in above our expectations. Scott will provide a more detailed review of our results, so I'll focus my comments on 4 key takeaways from the quarter.
First, we saw good momentum across the business as apparel revenue trends improved sequentially in each of our business segments. We're encouraged by the trends in U.S. Innerwear. Sales, excluding PPE, increased 11.5% over prior year driven by continued point-of-sale strength and broad-based inventory restocking by retailers. Despite shipments exceeding point-of-sale in the quarter, inventory at retail remains below last year's levels. Therefore, we expect some level of retailer restocking to continue in the fourth quarter.
We're pleased with the global improvement in Champion as sales increased nearly 130% from the second quarter. Compared to last year, sales declined 9% due primarily to our sports apparel business where COVID-related headwinds have essentially shut down sporting events and college bookstores. Excluding this, sales would have been down 2%. We were also impacted by COVID-driven supply challenges in the quarter. Absent these 2 items, Champion sales increased over prior year. We expect the supply challenges to improve in the fourth quarter. And with global spring/summer 2021 bookings up over 2019 levels, we expect Champion's momentum to carry into next year. Looking forward, I'm excited and confident in the global potential of Champion. There's a lot of opportunity for growth over the next several years.
The second takeaway is that we're facing second half profitability headwinds, which were mentioned on last quarter's call. The timing of negative manufacturing variances and higher SG&A expense are expected to pressure both gross and operating margins in the fourth quarter. We're also facing additional uncertainty from the latest COVID trends.
Third, we delivered another strong cash flow quarter, generating nearly $250 million of operating cash flow. While we now expect to end the year with higher-than-anticipated PPE inventory, we continue to expect to generate positive operating cash flow in the second half and for the full year.
And the fourth takeaway for the quarter, we further strengthened our liquidity, ending the quarter with $2 billion of liquidity, which we believe provides us with plenty of operating flexibility in this uncertain environment.
So in closing, we're making progress in an increasingly unpredictable environment. We're seeing good revenue momentum in our business. We're moving quickly with our strategic and cost assessment. We're defining our ambition, identifying our opportunities and building our plans to become a more agile, consumer-centric, growth-oriented company. I'm excited to begin this multiyear journey, one that I believe will be rewarding to both our people and our shareholders.
Before turning the call over, I want to thank our incredible team of more than 63,000 around the globe for their dedication and commitment to serving our customers during this challenging time.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Scott."

Overall, Hanesbrands had a strong quarter, with the results across all of our key metrics coming in above our expectations. Revenue momentum continued across the business driven by continued strength in point-of-sale trends and broad-based inventory restocking. As expected, margins declined over prior year but less than we were anticipating, and we generated $249 million of operating cash flow, further strengthening our liquidity position.
Turning to the details of the results. Third quarter sales increased 3% over prior year to $1.81 billion, with foreign exchange rates accounting for 80 basis points of the quarter's growth. Apparel revenue performed better than our expectation for the quarter. Excluding $179 million of PPE sales, apparel revenue declined 7% compared to prior year. This represents a significant improvement from last quarter's 40% decline as each segment experienced a sequential improvement in year-over-year revenue trends.
Adjusted gross margin of 36.7% decreased approximately 275 basis points over last year due to increased inventory reserves as well as negative manufacturing variances, which were incurred earlier in the year, rolling off the balance sheet and onto the P&L. Adjusted operating margin declined approximately 170 basis points over prior year to 12.6% as the gross margin pressure and higher operating costs from COVID were partially offset by ongoing SG&A controls as well as benefits from our temporary cost savings initiatives.
Restructuring and other related charges were $53 million in the quarter. Approximately $49 million are nonrecurring costs from restarting portions of our manufacturing network that closed for approximately 10 weeks beginning in March due to the COVID pandemic. We experienced a stronger-than-expected recovery in point-of-sale.
In an effort to meet demand and best serve our customers, we chose to expedite shipments via airfreight as well as temporarily leverage third-party manufacturing capacity. This resulted in short-term incremental cost in the form of freight and sourcing premiums relative to our normal manufacturing cost. We believe this was the right long-term business decision. And in fact, we are already seeing the benefits in the form of newly captured retail shelf space. The remaining $4 million of these costs relates to our previously disclosed supply chain restructuring actions and program exit costs. These actions and their associated costs are on track and remain unchanged from previous disclosures.
Our tax rate for the quarter was 17.3% (sic) [ 17.6% ], which was in line with our expectations. And adjusted and GAAP earnings per share decreased 11% and 43% over prior year to $0.42 and $0.29, respectively.
Now let me take you through our segment performance. For the quarter, U.S. Innerwear sales increased 41% over prior year driven by a 15% increase in basics, a 7% increase in intimates and the inclusion of $166 million of PPE revenue. Excluding PPE, U.S. Innerwear sales increased 11.5% over prior year due to the continued positive point-of-sale trends and inventory restocking by retailers.
In our basics business, we experienced growth in each product category, which drove approximately 170 basis points of market share gains in the quarter. Within intimates, bra sales increased at a double-digit rate. This more than offset the decline in shapewear sales, which is a category that continues to be negatively impacted by the coronavirus pandemic.
Looking forward, we have seen positive point-of-sale and order trends continue through October. With these trends, as well as retail inventory that remains below last year, we expect some level of restocking to continue in the fourth quarter.
For the quarter, Innerwear's operating margin expanded approximately 80 basis points over prior year to 21.7% driven by fixed cost leverage from higher unit volumes as well as favorable product mix.
Turning to U.S. Activewear. Revenue declined 27% compared to last year, which is an improvement from the second quarter's 52% decline. The vast majority of the year-over-year decline was from our sports apparel business, which continues to be significantly impacted by COVID-related headwinds.
Activewear's operating margin was 9.1% for the third quarter. As expected, Activewear's margin declined compared to prior year due to the timing of negative manufacturing variances, inventory reserves for some of our non-Champion brands as well as SG&A deleverage from lower sales volumes. However, I will note that the segment margin improved significantly from last quarter's operating loss.
Touching briefly on Champion, sales of the Champion brand within our Activewear segment increased approximately 85% from the second quarter. Compared to last year, sales declined 27%, with the vast majority of the decline due to the COVID-challenged sports apparel business. Despite the challenges in sports apparel, we continue to expect sequential improvement in Champion's revenue trends in the fourth quarter driven by continued point-of-sale growth in key channels and online as well as improved product availability.
Switching to our International segment. Revenue declined 5% compared to last year on a reported basis and 7% on a constant currency basis. Adjusting for PPE sales, core International revenue declined 7% as compared to prior year, which is a significant improvement from a 44% decline in the second quarter. For the quarter, International Champion sales increased 5% over prior year. Excluding the impact from foreign exchange rates, we experienced growth in our Americas and Champion Europe businesses. This was more than offset by declines in our European Innerwear, Asia and Australia businesses where COVID-related challenges have slowed the retail recovery. International segment's operating margin declined approximately 100 basis points over prior year to 15.2% driven by deleverage from lower sales volumes, which was partially offset by continued tight SG&A cost management.
Turning to cash flow. We generated $249 million of operating cash flows in the quarter. Looking at our balance sheet, inventory increased 4% over prior year which was in line with sales growth and includes approximately $400 million of PPE inventory. Excluding PPE, inventory declined 15% compared to prior year. Leverage at the end of the quarter was 3.3x on a net debt to adjusted EBITDA basis, which was comparable to last year. While liquidity remains our short-term focus in a post-COVID environment, our focus would be to return our leverage ratio to below 3x.
We further strengthened our liquidity position in the quarter even while reducing debt by approximately $130 million and paying our regular quarterly dividend. We ended the quarter with $2 billion of liquidity above the $1.8 billion at the end of the second quarter. We continue to believe we have significant capital cushion in this uncertain environment.
And now turning to guidance. Outlook reflects the continued uncertainty due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our outlook is based on the current business environment, which, among other items, reflects the lockdowns and curfews put in place over the past week in Europe. Outlook does not reflect any potential impact to the consumer or operating environments should governments or businesses institute additional lockdowns and store closings. I want to remind everyone that all year-over-year comparisons reference our rebased 2019 results. I'll also point you to our press release and FAQ document for additional guidance details.
For the fourth quarter, we expect total sales of $1.60 billion to $1.66 billion, which, at the midpoint, implies a 2% decline over prior year. Prior to this week's European lockdowns, our revenue outlook assumed a low single-digit growth. Included in our sales outlook is approximately $50 million of PPE sales, approximately $10 million of foreign exchange benefit and contributions from a 53rd week. We expect adjusted operating profit of $160 million to $180 million, which, at the midpoint, implies an operating margin of 10.4%.
Expected year-over-year margin pressure is due to the timing of negative manufacturing variances and higher SG&A expense. We expect interest and other expense of approximately $50 million and a tax rate of approximately 17.5%. Our guidance for adjusted and GAAP earnings per share range from $0.25 to $0.30 and $0.24 to $0.29, respectively. And our guidance for full year 2020 operating cash flow is $300 million to $400 million, which includes the impact from the higher-than-anticipated PPE inventory. Based on our year-to-date cash flow, this implies fourth quarter operating cash flow of approximately $70 million to $170 million.
So in closing, I'm encouraged by how we're managing through the increasingly unpredictable environment. We're seeing good revenue momentum in our business. I'm excited about our strategic assessment we're doing to define our strategy, and I look forward to the journey ahead.
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to T.C."

I'm really excited to have the opportunity to work with 2 really amazing brands that, quite frankly, are in different places on their journey.
Let me start with Hanes a little bit. Obviously, incredible household penetration, a well-known brand, been around a very long time and has a really, really big installed base. It leads in an awful lot of categories from a share position. And it's in categories that, quite frankly, in many cases, aren't relatively lower growth. So it becomes a big share gain, and we have to think really strategically about where we can gain share and how we can do it. And you'll hear me talk a lot about this idea of consumer centricity and the ability to make that a core value of the company and look through the lens of the consumer at everything we do and make sure they have a positive experience all the way from when they first engage to our brand, all the way through purchase and beyond and usage of the product. That will build trust and loyalty over time.
And I think for Hanes, when we look at where it is today, it has really good equity scores. People like it. It's really known for its quality and things like comfort. But when you really start to dig into the business, you'll see that the brand is aging a little bit, and we need to reach a younger consumer that's large. They're growing. They're very influential demo. And we need to make sure that we're developing products and talking to them directly. That will also -- to step a little bit further just beyond Hanes into our intimates business, really differentiating our brands and really making sure that we're very purposeful in our channel strategies over time of where we want to build the business and how do we do that. So there's some real specific choices to be made in the Hanes world, but I think it's -- you're working off an incredible base, and we just need to fine-tune it for the new markets that it's competing in today.
Now Champion, a little bit different position. I'll be honest, one of the main reasons I came here was the opportunity to work on Champion and with the potential that it has. What Hanes is, is highly developed from a market share perspective. When you look at Activewear across the board and you segment it out by category, Champion is more a challenger brand, a small share position and a lot of opportunity to grow share, a lot of different categories, particularly with women over time. And it has a much broader kind of a global presence. And we're seeing really good growth from around the globe. Excited about some of the things we're doing in China and South Korea.
But here, you're really talking about a -- while it's not a new brand, it's a young brand platform and one that presents a lot of opportunities to target different consumers, do a lot of innovation. There's some exciting things that are coming around new product platforms that we're trying. The new one that I saw just released around -- it's called Stormtech, which is taking all of our reverse weave technology and making it water repellent. There's some new dye technologies coming. So there's a lot of opportunity to expand this brand into new usage occasions and gain share across all the different segments that it participates in.
So a lot of opportunity, a lot of work to do. We're at the beginning of this journey to take us to where we need to get to. But I think both of the brands have just huge future potential. They've been successful, but I think we're just scratching the surface on where that can go."

And how does technology and IT investment play into that transformation?
And then to Scott, you had mentioned the change in sort of low single-digit growth -- or growth in sales to a low single-digit decline. I'm wondering if all of that has come from the recent European lockdowns or what you're seeing also in the COVID surge in the U.S. So if you can give us any more color on what the change -- the impetus for the change in that sales direction."

Thanks for repeating that. In terms of consumer perception of brand, very positive. And I obviously did my research before I came here to understand and came from, quite frankly, a position that had a lot of insight into a lot of different brands, in what was trending and what wasn't trending and how the retail environment view things and how consumers view it. So I think all the brands are viewed very positive where they're positioned today. But as I said earlier, and particularly in Hanes, I think there's some work to do to reach some new consumers. But you're starting from a positive position. We're not -- there's not an equity decline or penetration issues and things like that. It's more about where do you take them going forward.
And kind of moving into your second question, digital will be a big piece of it. In general, it's true with most companies today, we need to become more digital not just in our consumer-facing business by the way but in our internal, how we operate systems, how we go to market. One of the things that we're going to have to spend some time thinking about, and I don't have an answer for you today but it's some work that we're going to do, is be very purposeful on our digital strategy with our different brands and understand how we want to go to market with Hanes versus Champion versus Bali. The digital strategy and the go-to-market strategy, the channel strategy for digital, may be different by those brands, and we're going to be very purposeful and thoughtful in terms of how we do that.
Underlying that, more from a technology perspective, I think that we have an opportunity -- the word I've been using is modernize our technology a bit. That will help us improve our speed and our efficiency, how we go to market, tying these new channels together, tying into our supply chain. We have a big opportunity there to improve how we operate.
And then finally, on guidance, we feel good about the revenue momentum in our business overall. And you heard the results from third quarter and how we're building momentum. I would tell you that in the Innerwear business, we expect to continue to have year-over-year growth in that business. Obviously, the restocking is going to be a benefit, but it's not going to be as big of a benefit as maybe we saw in Q3, but we still continue to see the positive trends there. Activewear, we continue to see strong demand for Champion, and we expect to see sequential improvement in our revenue trends there. Clearly, sports apparel is going to continue to be a drag on the business right now, which is obviously highly COVID related.
And to answer your last point directly, yes, the most recent announcements in Europe, we took those into account, and it changed our numbers, quite frankly, as to what we've expected in the fourth quarter. So we're trying to be as transparent as we can be and include as much of the data that is kind of coming at us live as we can in terms of what the guidance is."

And so I'll start off with gross margin and hit on your questions there and also speak to a little bit impact that we have on SG&A. So starting with gross margin, we had -- it was lower year-on-year, but we did anticipate this. We actually came in a little bit better than we initially expected. So our gross margin was down 275 basis points from last year. And then within gross margin, we had 2 main headwinds that were causing the downward pressure. The first was negative manufacturing variances, which accounts for a little more than half of the decline.
And just a little bit of background on that, as a reminder, like other companies who have supply chain operations, you have manufacturing variances. As those are incurred, these are capitalized onto the balance sheet, and then they roll off on the P&L and the cost of sales as the inventory is sold. Now these specific variances were incurred earlier this year from lower unit production that we had initially planned, which essentially raises the fixed cost per unit.
The other headwind in gross margin, and it actually covers the remainder of the decline, was additional inventory reserves that we recognized this quarter. Now these reserves primarily relate to the Hanes Europe Innerwear business and our sports apparel business. As you move down the P&L, our overall operating margin was down 170 basis points. So you can see we're able to offset some of the gross margin headwind with a lower SG&A. And that's resulting from this tight cost controls and benefits from COVID-related temporary cost savings initiatives that we put in place earlier this year.
Now there are a couple of items in SG&A that are higher. We have some incremental COVID-related costs like cleaning and health supplies that we're incurring to protect our employees and customers, which actually started in the second quarter. And also, in addition to this, and we were speaking to it earlier, we had some costs that started this quarter and will continue related to the developing of our strategic assessment. So we'll have that and those impacts moving forward.
Now speaking to moving forward into the fourth quarter on the margin side, the margins are going to be down like we expected. We made reference to that in our last call. We have second half headwinds in our margin. And about half of the decline is going to be in gross profit, and the other half is in SG&A. And let me give you some color around both of those. Now within gross margin, about half the decline is related to the negative manufacturing variances that I spoke to that we incurred earlier in this year that will be flowing through into the fourth quarter.
Now one thing I did want to point out is as you -- as we can see the variances that are currently on the balance sheet that will flow through into the P&L early next year that we can actually see these specific headwinds that are impacting Q3 and Q4 will not -- will be behind us as we go into 2021. Now the other half of the decline in gross margin was actually split between just lower sales volume and product mix.
And then going to SG&A, we have several items that are kind of roughly about the same impact on margin. The first is the fixed cost deleverage from lower sales volume. And just as a reminder, about 2/3 of our SG&A is fixed. The second item relates to some -- actually some timing of some compensation-related expenses that -- which, in the fourth quarter of last year, were lower than normal levels. So this is more really a year-over-year comparability item versus 2019, not necessarily ongoing higher cost. And then the last couple of things, which I'd spoke to, that impacted Q3 will also impact Q4 as those costs associated with developing the strategic assessment and those recurring COVID-related costs that we're having."

And really, what a great proof point of leveraging the strengths and the ability of the organization to move. So I thought that was pretty impressive.
The business going forward, we talked about expecting about $50 million of sales in Q4. It's moving very quickly in terms of the market is changing. We see this going forward as there'll be an opportunity for us to continue to sell PPE, but the long-term opportunity really remains unclear at this point. It's a very fragmented market out there. So the way we're positioned and thinking about it is that you should consider PPE kind of a near-term opportunity for 2020 and we're not factoring in. It is a huge business for us going forward at this point. But that could change, and we'll have to see how things progress in the market."

Now there's been growth in the e-commerce, but it was more than offset by just lower consumer traffic and channel mix."

And our ability to add new components to the business has worked well over time as we've built the supply chain and put volume through it and taking costs out, and it's been a really, really good model.
As we go forward, I think we have to think about using that potential leverage of M&A and thinking holistically of do we want to be behind capability in addition to buying volume and should we be pruning over time. I think when you look at companies who use M&A really effectively, they do both. So we're going to be looking holistically at the portfolio, finding out what makes sense for us in the future, and then we'll talk about actions going forward."

Thanks for the question. In terms of marketing spend, yes, I think we've underinvested in these brands, and I think we're going to have to find thoughtful ways to make sure that we are investing -- that the brands get the investment that they deserve over time. And it's something you have to stay on and you have to continue to do, and I'm not sure we've kind of met that threshold and that hurdle going forward. So we'll be looking holistically at how do we thoughtfully increase, probably not consistently across the portfolio, and I think it's just not all brands but pick our bets and lean in and make sure that we continue to develop those brands with the right demographics.
Jumping to private label, whether I see private label as a threat. Absolutely, it's a threat. The challenge for us is what do we do about it. And when I -- when you think about my background, I've worked on both sides of the private label business. I've built private label, and I worked in branded companies before, so a pretty good feel for what it takes to compete on both sides. But when you think about private label on the retailer side, they want and expect brands like Hanes that we have to drive traffic to their store. That's our responsibility as a brand. So we need to make sure that the brands are -- they're in demand, they're relevant, we've got the right innovation and that consumers are seeking them out. And when consumers are seeking your brand, they rise up in the importance for retail over time.
So I think when you look at the brands this company has, when you look at the capabilities that we have from an innovation and from a supply chain perspective, we should be able to compete very well, build our brands, deliver the right quality and the innovation at a pace that's needed to win against private label. And it doesn't mean private label is going away because it's not. It serves a purpose for the retailer. But well positioned brands that are running appropriately and are valued by the retailer should be able to compete extremely well."

With regards to advertising expenses, they shook out around 2% of sales last year. As you think about fueling growth for Champion, potentially Hanes and some other of the brands, how do we think about the investments in advertising? Should we think about it as a mid-single-digit percentage of sales going forward over time?
And then to Scott, more near-term questions here. I think in your FAQ, it talks about U.S. Champion ex masks was down 27% in the third quarter. And I think you called out that it should improve in the fourth quarter. Should we assume that it's around down 10% to down 15%? And then should we also think about International Champion actually up in the fourth quarter due to -- largely due to the sell-in into China?"

Some new brand platforms, some of them that I mentioned earlier from a product perspective is a big opportunity for us. And getting into new categories.
Our -- as I said earlier, our share, when you look at it by category, is not that high. And so we're a challenger brand, and we're operating that way.

And as I said, we've already got some October guidance -- our understanding of our business that we can see from there.
In terms of the category over time, U.S. Innerwear overall, the business overall, the categories overall, are not high-growth categories. They're different than -- you're seeing athleisure trends and things like that, that are driving big growth. These are more stable categories over time. But I think they're very healthy categories over time, and we're seeing that in the demand for products. So I think with fewer doors, you have to operate differently. I like where we're positioned in the market, and where we're really strong tends to be where the trend and the momentum is in the market. So I think our position is solid, and I think you'll continue to see a good solid category business going forward.

So I wouldn't get to that conclusion yet that we're going to be smaller with higher margin, and we're going to follow that model. We haven't decided on that yet.

In terms of looking at the brands and things that I think they could have done, I would say these are general and nothing to do with necessarily my previous role, but as I said earlier, I think we need to continue to invest. Brands need to continue to invest behind themselves today. And there's lots of challenger brands out there. There's lots of people pushing. You need to compete for share of voice with the consumer. So I think continuing to invest in the brands is something that I would do.
I would say portfolio simplification, these are just complicated categories, and you try to go to shop them at the shelf. There's a lot of complexity, so I think the ability to continue to simplify, reach a broad set of customers but simplify and lean in behind core businesses. And speed, being incredibly consumer responsive and reactive and moving at the pace of the consumer, it's a challenge for lots of different brands right now, and I think it's an opportunity for us going forward. So those are a couple of things that are on my mind coming in. Some are obviously grounded in past experience.

I want to just add and layer in back to kind of your original question, you're talking about sports apparel, because I think some timing stuff might help you here, right? So when you're talking about our order book for spring/summer, and we talked about it being up over 2019, remember, that's going to be your wholesale order book, right? That's not going to take into account any of your DTC that you're doing in that business. And up over 2019, that's -- I mean that's a pretty good place to be considering the environment and kind of a lot of other peers in terms of where that is.
The last thing I would say -- sorry, I had my -- our PPE with our mask. The last part of this that I would say is that sports apparel, right, you just think about the big part of that, a lot of that is coming in through the college bookstore, right? That's for fall. That's more of when those bookings are going to come through. That would not be a big part for them to be in the spring/summer. So that might help you with some of that why sports apparel is down. And so sorry, I didn't mean to kind of come back around but just wanted to kind of put a point to that."

And you should think of these as setting the company up for long-term success. And we're thinking about how do we get to a multiyear horizon here, and we're working on that plan. But when I think of investment, I think of them as unlocks, right? Our investment should be driving growth opportunities. And we're going to be focused on a lot of different things that may -- we may need to put some muscle behind.
I talked earlier about modernizing technology. I think we have to look at our supply chain going forward and really understanding how do we make it -- how do we align it to make sure it supports all of our key businesses as we go forward. It was built on one model, and it's incredibly successful at doing that. And it's proven its ability to flex to some extent. But I think we're challenging its flexibility right now as we build out our DTC business in different parts around the world. So we're looking at doing that. But I don't -- what I don't want you to do is think about whether the investment is going to be ramped, and we're not going to be really thoughtful and targeted and thoughtful how we do it.
Underneath that, we're starting a cost transformation program at the same time. Some of these are short-term costs to kind of mobilize some short-term efforts to fuel some of these growth initiatives that we're putting into, and some are more longer-term cost initiatives that are restructuring inside and thinking about different ways of working that will present cost savings opportunities. So we're obviously going to be as aggressive on the cost side as we are on the investment side and fund as much of it as we can out of how we operate today. And we'll give you a greater look into that as we go forward of what the details are. But we certainly understand the need for performance and quarter-over-quarter, and we're going to balance the 2 as we go forward."

And we're still trying to work a balance of which brands in which channels. And once we decide that, we'll lean in very heavily. But I would tell you there's good response to our brands online, particularly Champion, and as customers are going and looking and seeking product, particularly new platforms that come in.
And if you look -- products play differently. Our more basic, traditional products tend to do extremely well on third-party partner retailers where they go to find that. And some of our smaller intimate brands tend to skew the other way. So the good news for us is, I think, we can shape that as we go forward and have the ability to really make purposeful choices over time. But the customers out there, they're looking for our brands online. We need to continue to build a great online presence, both in our third-party partners and in our own online business as well."
