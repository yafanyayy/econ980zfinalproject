273983758,654358409,1928482,"Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Mar 03, 2020",2020-03-03,"Earnings Calls","Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company","Executives","Thanks, Andy. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. HPE's first quarter results demonstrate continued progress against our strategic priorities to shift our company to higher-margin and more recurring revenues against a dynamic market",2118,"Thanks, Andy. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. HPE's first quarter results demonstrate continued progress against our strategic priorities to shift our company to higher-margin and more recurring revenues against a dynamic market backdrop. I am disappointed that our overall revenue of $6.9 billion reflects a 7% decline for the quarter, primarily due to declines in our Compute business. However, I am pleased with the results in several key areas of our business aligned to our strategy. Our pivot to as a service is gaining momentum. Our annualized revenue run rate grew 19% year-over-year. We started reporting this new metric last quarter to provide more transparency into the recurring and higher-margin benefits of shifting to our as a service model. 
We grew HPE GreenLake services orders 48% year-over-year. HPE GreenLake gained 65 new logos in Q1 and have surpassed 800 total customers. We return to growth in our intelligent edge business, with revenue up 4% year-over-year. And we continue to see profitable growth in areas of investment, including high-performance compute, hyper-converged infrastructure, big data storage and operational services orders, with continued improvements in our services attach intensity. 
Our Q1 revenues were impacted by a number of factors. First, like many of our peers, we continue to see uneven and unpredictable demand due to macro uncertainty. This has resulted in longer sales cycles and delayed customer decisions. Second, commodity supply constraints disrupted our ability to meet our customers' demand this quarter, particularly in our Compute and high-performance compute businesses. Additionally, the outbreak of the coronavirus at the end of January impacted component manufacturing, resulting in higher quarter end backlog. In both of these cases, we have established specific mitigation and recovery plans with each of our suppliers. 
Finally, we encountered a challenge in consolidating our manufacturing site in North America. We have a plan in place to address the Q1 issue and are confident that our efforts will result in increased efficiency and agility as we move forward. It is important to note that, even with the revenue shortfall, we improved our non-GAAP gross margin by 210 basis points year-over-year to 33.2%. We drove non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.44, up 5% year-over-year and in line with our outlook, while also investing for future innovation. And we delivered improved free cash flow compared to last year's level and in line with Q1 normal seasonality. 
While market uncertainty continues and new global developments like the coronavirus have emerged, we have taken the right actions to mitigate against these evolving dynamics. Some of these actions includes further cost account in our back-end operations as a part of our HPE Next program, which has been a key enabler of our gross and operating margin improvement. We have extended the program through fiscal year 2021, and expect incremental savings while maintaining the original net cash impact. As Tarek will cover in more detail, because of the actions we have taken to address the uncertainty and the expected recovery of supply chain constraints over time, we are comfortable maintaining our FY '20 non-GAAP EPS outlook. But there are too many unknowns at this point to provide second quarter guidance. Also, we do feel it is prudent to revise our fiscal year '23 free cash flow outlook from $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion to $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion, given that we expect some impact from cash conversion cycles, driven by the ongoing recovery from supply constraints and impact of the coronavirus. These are the right pragmatic actions to take, and I am confident in our ability to deliver and in our strategy. Our customers continue to reaffirm their need for hybrid capabilities to advance their digital transformations and harness the power of their data wherever it lives: in the cloud; on- and off-premises; and increasingly, at the Edge. As the age to cloud platform as a service company, HP is uniquely positioned to capitalize on these trends and help our customers transform. 
Before Tarek provides more specifics about the quarter, let me highlight a few of our business and segment results. First, our Intelligent Edge business outperformed competitors across the industry. We grew in all geographies posting double-digit growth in North America despite the challenging macro environment, and we delivered double-digit growth in our Aruba branded products. Over the last 2 quarters, we have been actively enhancing our sales coverage model in North America, and I am proud of the team's hard work and our momentum. We declared the opportunity at the Intelligent Edge early, and we continue to invest in bringing a cloud experience to the Edge, where data is increasingly created. At the core of this strategy is HP Aruba Central, the only cloud native and simple-to-use platform that unifies network management, AI powering sites and IoT device security for wire, wireless and WAN networks, and soon 5G and Edge computing. More than 58,000 unique customers are using Aruba Central. 
In Q1, Aruba, which pioneered the software-defined branch solution for deployment and management of large retail networks, further enhanced our solution by integrating Aruba Branch gateways with Aruba Central. By providing a single point of control for SD-WAN wire and wireless networking, Aruba can help customers achieve secure, simplified branch connectivity at scale. Our customers continue to recognize our innovation at the Edge. For instance, in the first quarter, the office of Information Technology at Princeton University turned to Aruba AOSCX to support its wide initiative and seamlessly integrate with Aruba wireless with a goal of creating a complete [indiscernible] first campus of the future. Subzero, a living looks and an appliance maker, updated its wired with wireless infrastructure through Aruba AOSCX and Eastern Wireless to support IoT in high-end appliances. Both Aruba AOSCX and WiFi 6 solutions continue to gain traction in the market. The customer examples I share are a testament of our differentiated innovation. I am excited about how our market leadership is helping customers redefine experiences at the Edge. We will continue to enhance our portfolio with the integration of 5G and Mobile Edge computing to capitalize on this significant opportunity. 
Turning to hybrid IT. As we announce in our securities analyst meeting last fall, we are providing revenue and operating profit disclosures in 4 business segments: Compute, high-performance compute and mission-critical systems, storage and advisory and professional services, aligned to customer demands and market trends. Tarek will walk you through the financial results in greater detail, but let me share a few high level observations. As I noted earlier, our Compute revenue was impacted by a combination of factors and came in lower-than-anticipated for the quarter. However, we did see an acceleration in unit volumes, which were up mid-single digits year-over-year, excluding Tier 1 in China. Our high-performance compute and mission-critical systems segment includes the first full quarter of Cray. We're excited about the combination of HP and Cray and the growing TAM. We have been awarded more than $2 billion in HPC business expected to be delivered in the next 3 years. Programs include the U.S. Department of Energy's El Capita System at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, and Frontier Supercomputer at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, among others. Our new segmentation provide greater insights into the size, strength and attractive financial profile of our HP storage business, which is a $5 billion business with an operating margin of 18%. We gained momentum in key areas during the quarter and expect to gain share in external disk. Big data storage grew 45% year-over-year and demonstrates early success with our MapR acquisition. Hyper-converged infrastructure also continued to grow, up 6%. HP InfoSight, our cloud-based AI operations platform, gained momentum across both Storage and Compute. I am proud of our focused efforts and innovation that have created one of the most comprehensive intelligent data platform in the industry, which will continue to provide customers with superior simplicity and performance. Our advisory and professional services business provides strategy, technology planning and consultant services that help customers navigate their digital transformation from Edge to cloud. With increased focus and simplification of this business, we drove demand across the HP portfolio and significantly expanded operating margins this quarter, up 12.5 points year-over-year. Our customer wins demonstrate the strength of our strategy and breadth of our portfolio. For example, HPE was recently selected by Zenuity, a joint venture between Volvo Cars and Veoneer, to help make next-generation autonomous driving cars a reality. HPE will provide the crucial AI and high-performance computing required to gather, store, organize and analyze data from its global network of test vehicles and software development centers. The end-to-end solution will be delivered as a service through HP GreenLake. Grove and [indiscernible], our global electronics company, wanted to reduce storage complexity and reclaim management time, already relying on 3-part for business-critical applications, the company chose Nimble storage to help manage a 20% year-over-year growth in data. This new combination has improved performance threefold. 
Volkswagen Group selected HPE to deliver state-of-the-art compute and mission-critical servers to run its apps and solutions, like SAP HANA, virtual desktop infrastructure, and others, focusing on big data analytics, AI and autonomous driving. Our offerings such as HPE, Superdome Flex, HPE [indiscernible] GEN10 servers and HPE Pointnext support services will power the data and apps for the Volkswagen Group's 12 global brands. 
In Q1, we continued to accelerate innovation. We achieved a major milestone in our pivot to as a service, with the launch of HPE GreenLake Central platform. HPE Green Lake Central is an advanced cloud platform that provides customers with a consistent cloud experience for all their applications and data wherever they live through an operational console that brands, manages and optimizes their entire hybrid states. We launched our HPE Container platform, which is the first enterprise-grade cover needs-based container solution. It leverages HPE's acquisition of Bluedata and MapR, together with 100% open source Kubernetes software. This platform provides customers with a common and faster path to run legacy and cloud-native applications, with persistent [indiscernible] connectivity. And we acquired Sitel, an innovative software company focused on service authentication. The Sitel team are the founding contributors to 2 open source projects that they are positioned to become the de facto standard for identifying and securing enterprise workloads, both on and off premises. Our site acquisition is consistent with our targeted approach to M&A that brings critical talent and complementary technologies to HPE. We look for accretive value-enhancing acquisitions that improve our competitive positioning and accelerate our strategy. 
Finally, our HP Financial Services business continues to provide us with a critical competitive advantage. In Q1, overall financing volume increased 2%. GreenLake represented more than 40% of our HPE leasing volume. HPFS uses multiple levers to help customers accelerate their digital transformations, while contributing to the circular economy. Through asset upcycling and accelerated migration, HPFS free up well over $500 million in our customers' budgets over the last 2 years. This business help us customers capture value from older assets, achieve their sustainability goals and invest in new technologies as a service. As we advance our business objectives to meet our customer needs and deliver for our shareholders, we continue to be guided by a very strong purpose. I am tremendously proud of our environmental stewardship, our investments in our people and our culture of integrity and inclusion. HP was just recognized as one of the most ethical companies by Ethisphere Institute. We were also proud to be named to Bloomberg's Gender-equality Index. These are very important measures of how HP delivers for our team members, customers, shareholders and our global communities. 
Consumer, in Q1, we faced continued macro uncertainty, which combined with supply and manufacturing constraints impacted our revenue, particularly in compute. Despite these issues in the current market backdrop, we continue to execute with discipline and made progress against our strategic priorities. We outperformed the market in critical areas like the Intelligent Edge. We gained traction in high-performance compute with acquisition of Cray. We advanced our pivot to as a service, all while delivering EPS and gross margin expansion. While we made progress in these important areas, we know we have work to do to improve in others. We are living in an uncertain time, but what is certain is our commitment to continue to manage our business with focus and discipline. I believe in our sound strategy, in our talented team and in our differentiated technology. This combination will enable us to execute our pivot to provide our customers and partners, unique edge to cloud experiences delivered as a service. And by doing so, we expect to deliver long-term profitable growth and generate stakeholder value. 
With that, let me turn it over to Tarek to provide more details about the quarter."
273983758,654358409,1928482,"Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Mar 03, 2020",2020-03-03,"Earnings Calls","Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company","Executives","Thank you very much, Antonio. Now let me provide more detail on our financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2020. As I have done before, I'll be referencing the slides from our earnings presentation to highlight our performance in the quart",1899,"Thank you very much, Antonio. Now let me provide more detail on our financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2020. As I have done before, I'll be referencing the slides from our earnings presentation to highlight our performance in the quarter. Also please note that we are now reporting results according to our new segmentation. This will provide more granular detail on the financial performance of our businesses and our progress towards becoming the Edge-to-cloud Platform as a Service company. Please refer to our recently filed Form 8-K for more detailed information which includes historical reconciliation tables for the last 2 years. 
Antonio already discussed the high-level points for the quarter, but I want to briefly reiterate the main takeaway. We are continuing to execute on our transition to higher-margin and more recurring revenue areas in a challenging business environment. We also remain confident that we have the right strategy in place and are taking the right actions to lay a foundation for sustainable, profitable growth in the future. 
Turning to Slide 2, with the financial highlights for the quarter. Despite the top line challenges from uneven demand and component supply and manufacturing constraints that I'll provide more detail on shortly, we continue to expand non-GAAP gross margins, which improved by 210 basis points this year, driven primarily by portfolio mix shift, cost of services efficiencies and commodity cost tailwinds. This gross margin expansion, combined with other income and expense benefits that included record equity interest contributed from our ownership in HBC and share buybacks resulted in diluted non-GAAP EPS of $0.44, which is up 5% year-over-year and in line with our original outlook for the quarter. 
On the cash front, free cash flow was a use of $185 million, which was in line with the prior year and normal seasonality. Consistent with our capital management policy, we paid $156 million in dividends and repurchased $204 million in shares. From a macro perspective, as Antonio mentioned, geopolitical factors continue to cause business uncertainty, particularly in larger enterprise deals, creating an uneven and unpredictable business environment. This was further exacerbated by supply constraints, both component shortages and our North American manufacturing site consolidation, which affected the Compute business, in particular. We expect component shortages to remain a headwind and this situation to alleviate as we progress through the year. 
The North American manufacturing site consolidation has created near-term execution challenges that we are actively addressing and expect to have improved efficiencies and agilities in our supply chain moving forward. Adding to the uncertainty is the potential disruption to demand and supply caused by the coronavirus outbreak. The health issue is causing disruption to both supply and demand, and while we cannot quantify the real impact at this time, we're monitoring the situation closely and are working with our suppliers to minimize potential impact. 
We'll now move to Slide 3 that shows our performance in the quarter in accordance with our new segmentation. I won't take you through every number, but let me hit a few key points. In the Intelligent Edge segment, we grew 4%. Our changes to North America sales leadership and go-to-market segmentation are paying off with double-digit growth in North America and 13% growth in overall wireless LAN product. While we continue to make relevant R&D and sales investments this year, we're also delivering significant improvement in profitability with operating margins of 9.7%, up 630 basis points year-over-year. 
In Compute, revenue declined 15% this quarter due to the previously highlighted uneven demand environment, component supply constraints and North American manufacturing site consolidation, yet we delivered a 9.5% operating profit margin in line with last year. With respect to units, excluding Tier 1 in China, our units were up mid-single digits year-over-year and have also been growing sequentially since Q2 2019. 
In High-performance Compute and Mission-Critical Systems, we grew revenue 6% that included our first full quarter contribution from Cray. Our HPC business has been awarded over $2 billion of business that is expected to be delivered through fiscal year '23. We will also optimize the credit cost envelope, and expect triple-digit millions in annualized run rate cost synergies to be recognized by the end of the next fiscal year, significantly adding to the operating profit and margins of HPC and MCS. 
Within Storage, we made progress against a competitive backdrop, maintaining flat sequential revenues with notable strength in big data growing at 45% year-over-year and hyper-converged infrastructure growing at 6% year-over-year this quarter. Note that this is the first quarter we are reporting hyper-converged infrastructure and storage aligned to our peers. 
In Advisory & Professional Services, we are reporting for the first time in our new segmentation, revenue was flat, and we significantly improved operating margins by 12.5 points year-over-year as we focus on eliminating unprofitable business. For operational services, which is included across Compute, HPC & MCS and Storage, orders were up 1% year-over-year, and revenue was down 2%. Our services intensity, which is the ratio of attach revenue per unit, was up year-over-year again in every business segment this quarter, with double-digit growth in HPC & MCS services intensity driven by Cray. This demonstrates that the underlying profitability of the units we sell and the attach rates continue to be robust. 
Within HPE Financial Services, we expanded our net portfolio of assets, which was up 2% in constant currency this quarter, with longer contract terms supporting GreenLake, and we maintained a solid return on equity of approximately 15% again this quarter with bad debt loss ratio of 0.4%, which is best-in-class within this industry. And while not shown on the slide, communications and media solutions that is included in our corporate investment segment is a strategically important business to us, providing software and services capabilities to telco service providers. It is showing improved momentum. 
Orders in CMS were up 10% sequentially, and revenue was up 2% and due to improved momentum of the telco software and services business. 
Slide 4 shows the ARR slide that I discussed at our Securities Analyst Meeting in October 2019. Please reference the same presentation for a deep dive into what makes up the ARR. Our Q1 20 ARR actuals came in at $511 million, a 19% year-over-year growth that accelerated from last quarter. Our HPE Aruba Central platform is starting to gain traction, with revenue growing triple digits year-over-year. We also continue to see strong growth in GreenLake services orders, which are up 48% year-over-year. As we progress towards building our go-to-market as a service motion and remain focused on offering a full suite of differentiated solutions that can be consumed as a service, we are confident in achieving our ARR growth guidance of 30% to 40% compounded annual growth rate from fiscal year '19 to fiscal year '22. 
Slide 5 shows our EPS performance to date. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.44 in Q1 is in line with our previously provided outlook of $0.42 to $0.46 due to disciplined execution, expanding gross margins and favorable other income and expense. This represents year-over-year growth of 5%. Also, please note, our OI&E performance in Q1 of fiscal year '20 does not change our fiscal year '20 OI&E outlook. As we foreshadowed during last October, Securities analyst meeting, we continue to expect OI&E to be a $0.03 to $0.05 per share headwind in fiscal year '20. 
Turning to gross margins on Slide 6. We continue to deliver significant year-over-year gross margin expansion that was up 210 basis points year-over-year to 33.2% as we shifted to higher-margin offerings like the Intelligent Edge with Aruba Central, Hyper-converged Infrastructure, the addition of Cray and commodity cost tailwinds. 
Moving to Slide 7. We have continued to improve operating profit since the beginning of Q1 of fiscal year '18, while making strategic investments in R&D and sales to support long-term profitable growth. In Q1 of fiscal year '20, we are now consolidating a full quarter of additional operating expenses from the Cray acquisition that will be optimized going forward. Furthermore, given the additional uncertainty in the business environment introduced this quarter, we are taking near-term actions that will enable us to protect and expand our profitability in fiscal year '20, while continuing to make critical long-term investments. As Antonio mentioned, we will extend the HPE Next program into FY '21, and expect incremental savings while maintaining the original net cash impact. 
Turning to cash flow on Slide 8. Operating cash flow declined with revenue, $461 million year-over-year. Free cash flow for Q1 was in line with normal seasonality at negative $185 million, in line with the prior year, thanks to planned net CapEx benefits in the quarter. Please remember, our normal seasonality is forecast to be used in the first half and then we generate significant amounts of free cash flow in the second half of the fiscal year. 
Now as a reminder, on Slide 9, we maintained a solid balance sheet with our cash flow generation and we have a disciplined returns based process for evaluating investments and capital returns. We are committed to maintaining an investment-grade credit rating that is evidenced by our current operating net cash position. Consistent with our capital return commitments in Q1, we returned $360 million in the form of share repurchases and dividends. As part of our capital allocation framework, we also target value-enhancing acquisitions to improve our competitive positioning and to accelerate our strategy of pivoting to as a service that provides us with higher levels of recurring revenue and profitability. As with any investment we consider, we follow a rigorous evaluation process, cognizant of size, valuation, financial impacts, such as accretion dilution and strategic fit. 
Now turning to our outlook on Slide 10. As discussed, we are in an increasingly uneven business environment, but at this point, we are comfortable maintaining our fiscal year '20 non-GAAP EPS outlook of $1.78 to $1.94, given the cost actions we plan to take and the expected recovery of supply chain constraints over time. However, there is still considerable uncertainty in the short-term due to the unknown potential impacts from the coronavirus, so we're not in a position to provide a second quarter outlook. 
From a cash flow perspective, and given our negative cash conversion cycle, we expect some current year impact on working capital receivables with elongated sales cycles persisting and the need to build inventory levels due to the supply chain constraints. Consequently, we feel it is prudent to revise our fiscal year '20 free cash flow outlook from $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion to $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion. We remain committed to our previously announced capital management policy of returning 50% to 75% of free cash flow to shareholders and now expect to be at the higher end of that range for fiscal year '20. So overall, we continue to make progress against our strategic priorities within an uneven environment and introduced new challenges this quarter. We're taking the appropriate actions to navigate the near-term uncertainty while executing against our vision and strategy that is clearly resonating with customers. 
We will continue to shift our portfolio to higher margin, software-defined solutions and focus on delivering our edge-to-cloud platform, offering our full portfolio as a service by 2022. This will ultimately drive sustainable, profitable growth and shareholder returns for the long term. 
Now with that, let's open it up for questions. Thank you."

We've taken steps to address what's under our control. Nonetheless, coronavirus has affected the tail end of the quarter and injected a new degree of uncertainty. And when you look at the revenue performance of the company, most of the decline came in the Compute category that we refer to in our new segmentation, and that decline has a lot to do with what you referred to from a supply chain standpoint."

In terms of when you think about investment long term, we have been very clear where we want to invest. Investment, obviously, is an Intelligent Edge, we see that as a next frontier, a big opportunity for us. We continue to do so. And I have to say, I'm incredibly pleased with the Q1 performance, because we said that business will return to growth, and we show -- we demonstrated that's the case. We outperformed the market and every single competitor there. And we are very, very pleased with the differentiation we have in our portfolio with higher margins. So for us, that's one area of investment. Much of that growth has happened organically. But we always look for what it makes sense for us in terms of accretive addition in terms of intellectual property and talent, right? That we want to continue to expand that set of experience we delivered at the edge. And as I said in my opening remarks, we are on a journey to integrate 5G and mobile edge computing on a very robust cloud-based solution called HP Aruba Central, which is all subscription-based and obviously, we can deliver that through GreenLake. Obviously, the other piece of this is what I call intellectual property to make our core business stronger. And that's all sort of defined at the core, with some additional, call it, intellectual property in the silicon space. That's where the core of the Cray acquisition was all about. The Cray acquisition is all about software in a cloud-native environment to run these big data-intensive loads and silicon was all about that. And as I think about the pivot as a service, also we're looking for software that will make our as a service experience unique and differentiated in a true edge-to-cloud platform. And as I announced in my remarks, we introduced 2 key platforms: one is HPE GreenLake Central, which is the console, the control point for managing and deploying workloads at the edge in the core on off-premises, so we've added managed services lay on top of that; and then the container platform, which is a true cloud native environment where you can run both legacy and cloud-based workloads. So those are the things we are doing. But I just want to emphasize, we have a very stringent rigorous process here on return on invested capital. And I see as an M&A as 1 of the 3 levels to drive innovation: organic is 1 aspect; partnership was the other 1; and inorganic. And I say that the last 15 acquisitions, I have been part of it, it has been always in that vein. And that's our goal."

So let me start by -- the second part of your question, which is how much of an impact with the coronavirus have on our business. Well, first, as we already flagged, the health and safety of our employees, customers and partners is our priority. And you know that out of abundance of caution for them, we've made the decision to cancel or postpone most of the HPE-sponsored event through April. Unfortunately, this is also causing supply and demand disruptions and affecting our revenue profile. The outbreak at the end of January started to impact component manufacturing and resulted in constrained supply and higher quarter-end backlog worldwide, and we have been in constant contact with our suppliers and are establishing specific mitigation and recovery plans. So this is affecting our revenue profile for the full year. This is why we're not guiding in the short term. And relative to what we said at SAM, where we were experiencing were thinking we would be returning to growth in fiscal year '20, I don't think that it's likely, at this stage, that we're growing fiscal year '20 as a whole for the fiscal year. But we do anticipate recovery of those supply chain constraints over time and face easier comps during the course of the year."

We have a daily process with each of our suppliers that we managed very, very tightly. And some of those suppliers are dependent on other suppliers because, as you can imagine, the supply chain is a little bit longer with Tier 2, Tier 3 suppliers to provide, what I call, low-level components to build what I call the printed circuit boards for the PCIs or the PCBIs, and that's a challenge we see today. And we see recovery, but obviously, it's going to take time. And that's why Tarek said we cannot provide right now a definite guidance, I think will be not appropriate, and that's why we're prudent not to provide you too, but because the recovery is going to happen through the year that we felt comfortable reaffirming the 2020 guidance. Remember, when we went to the Security Analyst Meeting in October, we said that we expect to grow the company on a 3-year basis, long-term plan of 1% to 3%. I think that this is still complete and intact because as you can see, as we pivot the portfolio to higher value and higher margins, at the same time, the pivot as a service, which is going extremely well and then obviously, that Intelligent Edge business growing, that's how we think about the long-term growth in the right margin profile. Obviously, the Compute at this point of time, was the challenge short term. I don't think it was off compared to some of our peers. In fact, in some cases, we did better than our peers. But that was a disappointment. And obviously, we need to stabilize and manage it through the supply chain recovery. Great."

Definitely, in China, as you know, we have a difference [indiscernible] with RHTC partnership there, and you should expect a short-term impact in China. But right now, they are working through it. But I will say, right now, we haven't seen a significant impact. If anything, it actually creates short-term opportunities. I can tell you because of the coronavirus, we see customers coming to us and say, ""Can you ship this product to take care of the fact that my employees are not going to be a work."" We see some demand in specific areas of workload optimized solutions.

Listen, I think it is a disappointing kind of situation, in my view, we are heavily discounted. There is no question about it. Think about the last 9 quarters, Toni, and think about the gross margin expansion and EPS expansion we have had. It's pretty remarkable. I mean, in the last 2 years, we expanded the margins every single quarter, and we have expanded EPS every single quarter. So my vantage point, we have done the right things, we have made the company leaner, meaner, and at the same time, we have taken big, big challenges, and we have managed it through. So I think, for us, is to continue to focus on the areas where we see the opportunity to compete and win in higher margins, but obviously, the stock also is thinking about long-term growth, and I understand that. And obviously, a big component of that is our Compute business. But in the end, I think the stock is heavily discounted, and I'm disappointed in that. On the M&A, we have been very clear since day 1, that we look at assets that they are accessible, that generally are accretive, or we can manage the dilution very quickly. But ultimately, it has to have strategic fit in the context of our strategy, obviously, whether it's the edge-to-cloud architecture and pivoting as a service. I think the assets we have acquired makes complete sense from that advantage point, and we have delivered strong results. Size is important, but I will say it's more strategic effect, and obviously, the return on that investment capital, which we have incredible strong discipline and where we have demonstrated that over the last 2 years. And so maybe I will pass it now to Tarek, because you asked the question about taking that and buying stock and so forth."

So Toni, I would say -- and Antonio, you answered the question on the stock, I would simply point to you at the performance of the various parts of our business, the Intelligent Edge, which has outperformed the sector quite substantially this quarter, what's the value of that? If you look at our storage business, which has done better than most of the players in the market and is of the same size as a very large pure-play listed company, what's the value of that? And if you look at our HPC and MCS business and the $2 billion of backlog, contracted revenues that would come in, what's the value of that? And then you have to look at other players in the sector and compare our Compute business to them and see that also for those players, the Compute business is valued negatively from an equity standpoint. But it does generate cash, and we have to figure that out. Finally, let me finish by saying HPC, the production was the value of that. It's a listed company, and it's pretty substantial.

HPE's first quarter results demonstrate continued progress against our strategic priorities to shift our company to higher-margin and more recurring revenues against a dynamic marke",2113,"Thanks, Andy. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. 
HPE's first quarter results demonstrate continued progress against our strategic priorities to shift our company to higher-margin and more recurring revenues against a dynamic market backdrop. I am disappointed that our overall revenue of $6.9 billion reflects a 7% decline for the quarter, primarily due to declines in our Compute business. However, I am pleased with the results in several key areas of our business aligned to our strategy. Our pivot to as a service is gaining momentum. Our annualized revenue run rate grew 19% year-over-year. We started reporting this new metric last quarter to provide more transparency into the recurring and higher-margin benefits of shifting to our as a service model. 
We grew HPE GreenLake services orders 48% year-over-year. HPE GreenLake gained 65 new logos in Q1 and have surpassed 800 total customers. We return to growth in our Intelligent Edge business, with revenue up 4% year-over-year. And we continue to see profitable growth in areas of investment, including high-performance compute, hyperconverged infrastructure, big data storage and operational services orders, with continued improvements in our services attach intensity. 
Our Q1 revenues were impacted by a number of factors. First, like many of our peers, we continue to see uneven and unpredictable demand due to macro uncertainty. This has resulted in longer sales cycles and delayed customer decisions. Second, commodity supply constraints disrupted our ability to meet our customers' demand this quarter, particularly in our Compute and high performance compute businesses. Additionally, the outbreak of the coronavirus at the end of January impacted component manufacturing, resulting in higher quarter end backlog. In both of these cases, we have established specific mitigation and recovery plans with each of our suppliers. 
Finally, we encountered a challenge in consolidating our manufacturing site in North America. We have a plan in place to address the Q1 issue and are confident that our efforts will result in increased efficiency and agility as we move forward. It is important to note that even with the revenue shortfall, we improved our non-GAAP gross margin by 210 basis points year-over-year to 33.2%. We drove non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.44, up 5% year-over-year and in line with our outlook, while also investing for future innovation. And we delivered improved free cash flow compared to last year's level and in line with Q1 normal seasonality. 
While market uncertainty continues and new global developments like the coronavirus have emerged, we have taken the right actions to mitigate against these evolving dynamics. Some of these actions include further cost take-out in our back-end operations as a part of our HPE Next program, which has been a key enabler of our gross and operating margin improvement. We have extended the program through fiscal year 2021 and expect incremental savings while maintaining the original net cash impact. 
As Tarek will cover in more detail, because of the actions we have taken to address the uncertainty and the expected recovery of supply chain constraints over time, we are comfortable maintaining our fiscal year '20 non-GAAP EPS outlook. But there are too many unknowns at this point to provide second quarter guidance. Also, we do feel it is prudent to revise our fiscal year '20 free cash flow outlook from $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion to $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion, given that we expect some impact on cash conversion cycles driven by the ongoing recovery from supply constraints and impact of the coronavirus. 
These are the right pragmatic actions to take, and I am confident in our ability to deliver, on our strategy. Our customers continue to reaffirm their need for hybrid capabilities to advance their digital transformations and harness the power of their data wherever it lives: in the cloud; on- and off-premises; and increasingly, at the edge. As the edge-to-cloud Platform as a Service company, HP is uniquely positioned to capitalize on these trends and help our customers transform. 
Before Tarek provides more specifics about the quarter, let me highlight a few of our business and segment results. First, our Intelligent Edge business outperformed competitors across the industry. We grew in all geographies, posting double-digit growth in North America despite the challenging macro environment, and we delivered double-digit growth in our Aruba-branded products. Over the last 2 quarters, we have been actively enhancing our sales coverage model in North America, and I am proud of the team's hard work and our momentum. We declared the opportunity at the Intelligent Edge early, and we continue to invest in bringing a cloud experience to the edge, where data is increasingly created. At the core of this strategy is HP Aruba Central, the only cloud-native and simple-to-use platform that unifies network management, AI-powered insights and IoT device security for wired, wireless and WAN networks and soon 5G and edge computing. More than 58,000 unique customers are using Aruba Central. 
In Q1, Aruba, which pioneered the software-defined branch solution for deployment and management of large retail networks, further enhanced our solution by integrating Aruba Branch Gateways with Aruba Central. By providing a single point of control for SD-WAN, wired and wireless networking, Aruba can help customers achieve secure, simplified branch connectivity at scale. Our customers continue to recognize our innovation at the edge. For instance, in the first quarter, the Office of Information Technology at Princeton University turned to Aruba AOS-CX to support its wired initiative and seamlessly integrate with Aruba wireless with a goal of creating a complete mobile-first campus of the future. Sub-Zero, a leading luxury appliance-maker, updated its wired with wireless infrastructure through Aruba AOS-CX and [ Eastern Wireless ] to support IoT in high-end appliances. Both our Aruba AOS-CX and Wi-Fi 6 solutions continue to gain traction in the market. 
The customer examples I share are a testament of our differentiated innovation. I am excited about how our market leadership is helping customers redefine experiences at the edge. We will continue to enhance our portfolio with the integration of 5G and mobile edge computing to capitalize on this significant opportunity. 
Turning to hybrid IT. As we announce at our Securities Analyst Meeting last fall, we are providing revenue and operating profit disclosures in 4 business segments, Compute, High Performance Compute & Mission-Critical Systems, Storage and Advisory & Professional Services, aligned to customer demands and market trends. Tarek will walk you through the financial results in greater detail, but let me share a few high-level observations. As I noted earlier, our Compute revenue was impacted by a combination of factors and came in lower-than-anticipated for the quarter. However, we did see an acceleration in unit volumes, which were up mid-single digits year-over-year, excluding Tier 1 and China. Our High Performance Compute & Mission-Critical Systems segment includes the first full quarter of Cray. We are excited about the combination of HP and Cray and the growing TAM. We have been awarded more than $2 billion in HPC business expected to be delivered in the next 3 years. Programs include the U.S. Department of Energy's El Capitan system at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and Frontier Supercomputer at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, among others. 
Our new segmentation provide greater insights into the size, strength and attractive financial profile of our HP Storage business, which is a $5 billion business with an operating margin of 18%. We gained momentum in key areas during the quarter and expect to gain share in external disk. Big data storage grew 45% year-over-year and demonstrates early success with our MapR acquisition. Hyperconverged infrastructure also continued to grow, up 6%. HP InfoSight, our cloud-based AI operations platform, gained momentum across both Storage and Compute. I am proud of our focused efforts and innovation that have created one of the most comprehensive intelligent data platform in the industry, which will continue to provide customers with superior simplicity and performance. 
Our Advisory & Professional Services business provides strategy, technology planning and consultant services that help customers navigate their digital transformation from edge to cloud. With increased focus and simplification of this business, we drove demand across the HPE portfolio and significantly expanded operating margins this quarter, up 12.5 points year-over-year. 
Our customer wins demonstrate the strength of our strategy and breadth of our portfolio. For example, HPE was recently selected by Zenuity, a joint venture between Volvo Cars and Veoneer, to help make next-generation autonomous driving cars a reality. HPE will provide the crucial AI and high-performance computing required to gather, store, organize and analyze data from its global network of test vehicles and software development centers. The end-to-end solution will be delivered as a service through HP GreenLake. [ Grote Electronics ], a global electronics company, wanted to reduce storage complexity and reclaim management time, already relying on 3PAR for business-critical applications, the company chose Nimble Storage to help manage a 20% year-over-year growth in data. This new combination has improved performance threefold. 
Volkswagen Group selected HPE to deliver state-of-the-art compute and mission-critical servers to run its apps and solutions like SAP HANA, virtual desktop infrastructure, and others, focused on big data analytics, AI and autonomous driving. Our offerings such as HPE Superdome Flex, HPE ProLiant Gen10 servers and HPE Pointnext support services will power the data and apps for the Volkswagen Group's 12 global brands. 
In Q1, we continued to accelerate innovation. We achieved a major milestone in our pivot to as a service, with the launch of HPE GreenLake Central platform. HPE GreenLake Central is an advanced cloud platform that provides customers with a consistent cloud experience for all their applications and data wherever they live through an operational console that runs, manages and optimizes their entire hybrid state. We launched our HPE Container Platform, which is the first enterprise-grade Kubernetes-based container solution. It leverages HPE's acquisition of BlueData and MapR, together with 100% open source Kubernetes software. This platform provides customers with a common and faster path to run legacy and cloud-native applications with persistent storage connectivity. And we acquired Scytale, an innovative software company focused on service authentication. The Scytale team are the founding contributors to 2 open source projects that they are positioned to become the de facto standard for identifying and securing enterprise workloads, both on- and off-premises. Our Scytale acquisition is consistent with our targeted approach to M&A that brings critical talent and complementary technologies to HPE. We look for accretive, value-enhancing acquisitions that improve our competitive positioning and accelerate our strategy. 
Finally, our HPE Financial Services business continues to provide us with a critical competitive advantage. In Q1, overall financing volume increased 2%. GreenLake represented more than 40% of our HPE leasing volume. HPEFS uses multiple levers to help customers accelerate their digital transformations while contributing to the circular economy. Through asset upcycling and accelerated migration, HPEFS free up well over $500 million in our customers' budgets over the last 2 years. This business helps our customers capture value from older assets, achieve their sustainability goals and invest in new technologies as a service. 
As we advance our business objectives to meet our customer needs and deliver for our shareholders, we continue to be guided by a very strong purpose. I am tremendously proud of our environmental stewardship, our investments in our people and our culture of integrity and inclusion. HP was just recognized as one of the most ethical companies by Ethisphere Institute. We were also proud to be named to Bloomberg's Gender-Equality Index. These are very important measures of how HP delivers for our team members, customers, shareholders and our global communities. 
In summary, in Q1, we faced continued macro uncertainty which, combined with supply and manufacturing constraints, impacted our revenue, particularly in Compute. Despite these issues in the current market backdrop, we continue to execute with discipline and made progress against our strategic priorities. We outperformed the market in critical areas like the Intelligent Edge. We gained traction in high-performance compute with the acquisition of Cray. We advanced our pivot to as a service, all while delivering EPS and gross margin expansion. While we made progress in these important areas, we know we have work to do to improve in others. We are living in an uncertain time, but what is certain is our commitment to continue to manage our business with focus and discipline. I believe in our sound strategy, in our talented team and in our differentiated technology. This combination will enable us to execute our pivot to provide our customers and partners unique edge-to-cloud experiences delivered as a service. And by doing so, we expect to deliver long-term profitable growth and generate stakeholder value. 
With that, let me turn it over to Tarek to provide more details about the quarter."

Now let me provide more detail on our financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2020. As I have done before, I'll be referencing the slides from our earnings presentation to highlight our performance in the quart",1899,"Thank you very much, Antonio. Now let me provide more detail on our financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2020. As I have done before, I'll be referencing the slides from our earnings presentation to highlight our performance in the quarter. Also please note that we are now reporting results according to our new segmentation. This will provide more granular detail on the financial performance of our businesses and our progress towards becoming the edge-to-cloud Platform as a Service company. Please refer to our recently filed Form 8-K for more detailed information, which includes historical reconciliation tables for the last 2 years. 
Antonio already discussed the high-level points for the quarter, but I want to briefly reiterate the main takeaway. We are continuing to execute on our transition to higher-margin and more recurring revenue areas in a challenging business environment. We also remain confident that we have the right strategy in place and are taking the right actions to lay a foundation for sustainable, profitable growth in the future. 
Turning to Slide 2, with the financial highlights for the quarter. Despite the top line challenges from uneven demand and component supply and manufacturing constraints that I'll provide more detail on shortly, we continued to expand non-GAAP gross margins, which improved by 210 basis points this year, driven primarily by portfolio mix shift, cost of services efficiencies and commodity cost tailwinds. This gross margin expansion, combined with other income and expense benefits that included record equity interest contributed from our ownership in H3C and share buybacks resulted in diluted non-GAAP EPS of $0.44, which is up 5% year-over-year and in line with our original outlook for the quarter. 
On the cash front, free cash flow was a use of $185 million, which was in line with the prior year and normal seasonality. Consistent with our capital management policy, we paid $156 million in dividends and repurchased $204 million in shares. From a macro perspective, as Antonio mentioned, geopolitical factors continue to cause business uncertainty, particularly in larger enterprise deals, creating an uneven and unpredictable business environment. This was further exacerbated by supply constraints, both component shortages and our North American manufacturing site consolidation, which affected the Compute business, in particular. We expect component shortages to remain a headwind and this situation to alleviate as we progress through the year. 
The North American manufacturing site consolidation has created near-term execution challenges that we are actively addressing and expect to have improved efficiencies and agilities in our supply chain moving forward. Adding to the uncertainty is the potential disruption to demand and supply caused by the coronavirus outbreak. The health issue is causing disruption to both supply and demand, and while we cannot quantify the real impact at this time, we're monitoring the situation closely and are working with our suppliers to minimize potential impact. 
We'll now move to Slide 3 that shows our performance in the quarter in accordance with our new segmentation. I won't take you through every number, but let me hit a few key points. In the Intelligent Edge segment, we grew 4%. Our changes to North America sales leadership and go-to-market segmentation are paying off with double-digit growth in North America and 13% growth in overall wireless LAN product. While we continue to make relevant R&D and sales investments this year, we're also delivering significant improvement in profitability with operating margins of 9.7%, up 630 basis points year-over-year. 
In Compute, revenue declined 15% this quarter due to the previously highlighted uneven demand environment, component supply constraints and North American manufacturing site consolidation, yet we delivered a 9.5% operating profit margin in line with last year. With respect to units, excluding Tier 1 and China, our units were up mid-single digits year-over-year and have also been growing sequentially since Q2 2019. 
In High Performance Compute & Mission-Critical Systems, we grew revenue 6% that included our first full quarter contribution from Cray. Our HPC business has been awarded over $2 billion of business that is expected to be delivered through fiscal year '23. We will also optimize the credit cost envelope and expect triple-digit millions in annualized run rate cost synergies to be recognized by the end of the next fiscal year, significantly adding to the operating profit and margins of HPC & MCS. 
Within Storage, we made progress against a competitive backdrop, maintaining flat sequential revenues with notable strength in big data growing at 45% year-over-year and hyperconverged infrastructure growing at 6% year-over-year this quarter. Note that this is the first quarter we are reporting hyperconverged infrastructure in Storage, aligned to our peers. 
In Advisory & Professional Services, we are reporting for the first time in our new segmentation, revenue was flat, and we significantly improved operating margins by 12.5 points year-over-year as we focus on eliminating unprofitable business. For operational services, which is included across Compute, HPC & MCS and Storage, orders were up 1% year-over-year, and revenue was down 2%. Our services intensity, which is the ratio of attach revenue per unit, was up year-over-year again in every business segment this quarter, with double-digit growth in HPC & MCS services intensity driven by Cray. This demonstrates that the underlying profitability of the units we sell and the attach rates continue to be robust. 
Within HPE Financial Services, we expanded our net portfolio of assets, which was up 2% in constant currency this quarter, with longer contract terms supporting GreenLake, and we maintained a solid return on equity of approximately 15% again this quarter with bad debt loss ratio of 0.4%, which is best-in-class within this industry. And while not shown on this slide, communications and media solutions, that is included in our Corporate Investments segment, is a strategically important business to us, providing software and services capabilities to telco service providers. It is showing improved momentum. 
Orders in CMS were up 10% sequentially, and revenue was up 2% due to improved momentum of the telco software and services business. 
Slide 4 shows the ARR slide that I discussed at our Securities Analyst Meeting in October 2019. Please reference the same presentation for a deep dive into what makes up the ARR. Our Q1 '20 ARR actuals came in at $511 million, a 19% year-over-year growth that accelerated from last quarter. Our HPE Aruba Central platform is starting to gain traction, with revenue growing triple digits year-over-year. We also continue to see strong growth in GreenLake services orders, which are up 48% year-over-year. As we progress towards building our go-to-market as a service motion and remain focused on offering a full suite of differentiated solutions that can be consumed as a service, we are confident in achieving our ARR growth guidance of 30% to 40% compounded annual growth rate from fiscal year '19 to fiscal year '22. 
Slide 5 shows our EPS performance to date. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.44 in Q1 is in line with our previously provided outlook of $0.42 to $0.46 due to disciplined execution, expanding gross margins and favorable other income and expense. This represents year-over-year growth of 5%. Also, please note, our OI&E performance in Q1 of fiscal year '20 does not change our fiscal year '20 OI&E outlook. As we foreshadowed during last October's Securities Analyst Meeting, we continue to expect OI&E to be a $0.03 to $0.05 per share headwind in fiscal year '20. 
Turning to gross margins on Slide 6. We continue to deliver significant year-over-year gross margin expansion that was up 210 basis points year-over-year to 33.2% as we shifted to higher-margin offerings like the Intelligent Edge with Aruba Central, hyperconverged infrastructure, the addition of Cray and commodity cost tailwinds. 
Moving to Slide 7. We have continued to improve operating profit since the beginning of Q1 of fiscal year '18, while making strategic investments in R&D and sales to support long-term profitable growth. In Q1 of fiscal year '20, we are now consolidating a full quarter of additional operating expenses from the Cray acquisition that will be optimized going forward. Furthermore, given the additional uncertainty in the business environment introduced this quarter, we are taking near-term actions that will enable us to protect and expand our profitability in fiscal year '20, while continuing to make critical long-term investments. As Antonio mentioned, we will extend the HPE Next program into fiscal year '21 and expect incremental savings while maintaining the original net cash impact. 
Turning to cash flow on Slide 8. Operating cash flow declined with revenue $461 million year-over-year. Free cash flow for Q1 was in line with normal seasonality at negative $185 million, in line with the prior year, thanks to planned net CapEx benefits in the quarter. Please remember, our normal seasonality is forecast to be used in the first half and then we generate significant amounts of free cash flow in the second half of the fiscal year. 
Now as a reminder, on Slide 9, we maintained a solid balance sheet with our cash flow generation, and we have a disciplined returns-based process for evaluating investments and capital returns. We are committed to maintaining an investment-grade credit rating that is evidenced by our current operating net cash position. Consistent with our capital return commitments in Q1, we returned $360 million in the form of share repurchases and dividends. As part of our capital allocation framework, we also target value-enhancing acquisitions to improve our competitive positioning and to accelerate our strategy of pivoting to as a service that provides us with higher levels of recurring revenue and profitability. As with any investment we consider, we follow a rigorous evaluation process, cognizant of size, valuation, financial impacts, such as accretion dilution, and strategic fit. 
Now turning to our outlook on Slide 10. As discussed, we are in an increasingly uneven business environment, but at this point, we are comfortable maintaining our fiscal year '20 non-GAAP EPS outlook of $1.78 to $1.94 given the cost actions we plan to take and the expected recovery of supply chain constraints over time. However, there is still considerable uncertainty in the short term due to the unknown potential impacts from the coronavirus, so we're not in a position to provide a second quarter outlook. 
From a cash flow perspective and given our negative cash conversion cycle, we expect some current year impact on working capital receivables with elongated sales cycles persisting and the need to build inventory levels due to the supply chain constraints. Consequently, we feel it is prudent to revise our fiscal year '20 free cash flow outlook from $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion to $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion. We remain committed to our previously announced capital management policy of returning 50% to 75% of free cash flow to shareholders and now expect to be at the higher end of that range for fiscal year '20. So overall, we continue to make progress against our strategic priorities within an uneven environment and introduced new challenges this quarter. We're taking the appropriate actions to navigate the near-term uncertainty while executing against our vision and strategy that is clearly resonating with customers. 
We will continue to shift our portfolio to higher-margin, software-defined solutions and focus on delivering our edge-to-cloud platform, offering our full portfolio as a service by 2022. This will ultimately drive sustainable, profitable growth and shareholder returns for the long term. 
Now with that, let's open it up for questions. Thank you."

With respect to how much those short-term disruptions have accounted for our revenue performance, I would say quite a lot. There are 3 things that affected our revenue performance. These are the macro environment softness; the second thing is supply chain constraints; and the third one is also the manufacturing node consolidation in North America. We've taken steps to address what's under our control. Nonetheless, coronavirus has affected the tail end of the quarter and injected a new degree of uncertainty. And when you look at the revenue performance of the company, most of the decline came in the Compute category that we refer to in our new segmentation, and that decline has a lot to do with what you referred to from a supply chain standpoint."

I just would like to add to Tarek that we feel pretty good about the recovery and the node consolidation that's under our control, all the other factors Tarek explained very well. In terms of when you think about investment long term, we have been very clear where we want to invest. The investment, obviously, is in Intelligent Edge. We see that as the next frontier, big opportunity for us. We continue to do so. And I have to say I'm incredibly pleased with the Q1 performance because we said that business will return to growth, and we show -- we demonstrated that's the case. We outperformed the market and every single competitor there. And we are very, very pleased with the differentiation we have in our portfolio with higher margins. So for us, that's one area of investment. 
Much of that growth has happened organically. But we always look for what makes sense for us in terms of accretive addition in terms of intellectual property and talent, right, that we want to continue to expand that set of experience we delivered at the edge. And as I said in my opening remarks, we are on a journey to integrate 5G and mobile edge computing on a very robust cloud-based solution called HP Aruba Central, which is all subscription-based and obviously we can deliver that through GreenLake. Obviously, the other piece of this is what I call intellectual property to make our core business stronger. And that's all software-defined at the core with some additional, call it, intellectual property in the silicon space. That's what the core of the Cray acquisition was all about. The Cray acquisition is all about software in a cloud-native environment to run these big data-intensive workloads, and silicon was all about that. And as I think about the pivot to as a service, also we're looking for software that will make our as a service experience unique and differentiated in a true edge-to-cloud platform. And as I announced in my remarks, we introduced 2 key platforms: one is HPE GreenLake Central, which is the console, the control point for managing and deploying workloads at the edge, in the core on-/off-premises, so we've added managed services layer on top of that; and then the container platform, which is a true cloud-native environment where you can run both legacy and cloud-based workloads. So those are the things we are doing. But I just want to emphasize, we have a very stringent, rigorous process here on return on invested capital. And I see as an -- M&A as 1 of the 3 levers to drive innovation: organic is 1 aspect; partnership is the other 1; and inorganic. And I say that the last 15 acquisitions I have been part of has been always in that vein. And that's our goal."

So let me start by the second part of your question, which is how much of an impact the coronavirus have on our business. Well, first, as we already flagged, the health and safety of our employees, customers and partners is our priority. And you know that out of abundance of caution for them, we've made the decision to cancel or postpone most of the HPE-sponsored events through April. Unfortunately, this is also causing supply and demand disruptions and affecting our revenue profile. The outbreak at the end of January started to impact component manufacturing and resulted in constrained supply and higher quarter-end backlog worldwide, and we have been in constant contact with our suppliers and are establishing specific mitigation and recovery plans. So this is affecting our revenue profile for the full year. This is why we're not guiding in the short term. And relative to what we said at SAM, where we were experiencing -- we're thinking we would be returning to growth in fiscal year '20, I don't think that it is likely at this stage that we'll grow in fiscal year '20, as a whole for the fiscal year. But we do anticipate recovery of those supply chain constraints over time and face easier comps during the course of the year."

We have a daily process with each of our suppliers that we managed very, very tightly. And some of those suppliers are dependent on other suppliers because, as you can imagine, the supply chain is a little bit longer with Tier 2, Tier 3 suppliers that provide what I call low-level components to build what I call the printed circuit boards or the PCIs or the PCBAs, and that's a challenge we see today. And we see recovery, but obviously, it's going to take time. And that's why Tarek said we cannot provide right now a definite guidance. I think it will be not appropriate. And that's why we felt prudent not to provide Q2, but because the recovery is going to happen through the year that we felt comfortable reaffirming the 2020 guidance. 
Remember, when we went to the Security Analyst Meeting in October, we said that we expect to grow the company on a 3-year basis long-term plan of 1% to 3%. I think that is still complete and intact because, as you can see, as we pivot the portfolio to higher value and higher margins, at the same time, the pivot to as a service, which is going extremely well, and then obviously that Intelligent Edge business growing, that's how we think about the long-term growth in the right margin profile. 
Obviously, the Compute at this point of time was the challenge short term. I don't think it was off compared to some of our peers. In fact, in some cases, we did better than our peers. But that was a disappointment. And obviously, we need to stabilize and manage it through the supply chain recovery."

So we entered Q2 with a higher elevated backlog that we have seen. I don't see yet, and let me qualify this, outside China, I haven't seen yet a significant impact on demand so far. Definitely, in China, as you know, we have a different set-up with our H3C partnership there, and you should expect a short-term impact in China. But right now, they are working through it. 
But I will say, right now, we haven't seen a significant impact. If anything, actually it creates short-term opportunities. I can tell you because of the coronavirus, we see customers coming to us and saying, ""Can you ship this product to take care of the fact that my employees are not going to be at work."" We see some demand in specific areas of workload-optimized solutions. And as I said in my opening remarks, we do have as awarded business, which, obviously, we have to build and ship more than $2 billion in HPC business that we have to ship over the next several quarters in the next 2 years.

Listen, I think it is a disappointing kind of situation, in my view. We are heavily discounted. There is no question about it. Think about the last 9 quarters, Toni, and think about the gross margin expansion and EPS expansion we have had. It's pretty remarkable. I mean, in the last 2 years, we expanded the margins every single quarter, and we have expanded EPS every single quarter. So my vantage point, we have done the right things. We have made the company leaner, meaner, and at the same time, we have taken big, big challenges, and we have managed it through. So I think, for us, is to continue to focus on the areas where we see the opportunity to compete and win in higher margins, but obviously, the stock also is thinking about long-term growth, and I understand that. And obviously, a big component of that is our Compute business. But in the end, I think the stock is heavily discounted, and I'm disappointed in that. 
On the M&A, we have been very clear since day 1 that we look at assets that they are accessible, that generally are accretive, or we can manage the dilution very quickly. But ultimately, it has to have strategic fit in the context of our strategy, obviously, whether it's the edge-to-cloud architecture and pivoting to as a service. I think the assets we have acquired makes complete sense from that vantage point, and we have delivered strong results. Size is important. But I will say it's more strategic fit and obviously the return on that investment capital, which we have incredible strong discipline and where we have demonstrated that over the last 2 years. 
And so maybe I will pass it now to Tarek because you asked the question about taking on debt and buying stock and so forth."

So Toni, I would say, Antonio answered the question on the stock. I would simply point to you at the performance of the various parts of our business, the Intelligent Edge, which has outperformed the sector quite substantially this quarter, what's the value of that? If you look at our Storage business, which has done better than most of the players in the market and is of the same size as a very large pure-play listed company, what's the value of that? And if you look at our HPC & MCS business and the $2 billion of backlog contracted revenues that would come in, what's the value of that? And then you have to look at other players in the sector and compare our Compute business to them and see that also for those players, the Compute business is valued negatively from an equity standpoint. But it does generate cash, and we have to figure that out. 
Finally, let me finish by saying H3C, the put option, what's the value of that? It's a listed company, and it's pretty substantial.

A&PS, specifically for A&PS, it's a very strategic business that pulls a lot of revenue and profits in other parts of the organization, and it's essential for enabling the as a service pivot. 
Now coming back on to your question with respect to aggressive buybacks, we did in the past 2 years execute a $7 billion capital return program to shareholders.

But it's to do the hard things now as these things recovered to come on the other end even stronger than before. 
On the short-term actions, I think, first, we have to protect our employees, first and foremost. I think it's important, and that was the first step.

And whilst we do deliver the EPS guide, and we confirmed it for Antonio, the drop in revenue will inevitably have a drag on the free cash flow generation. That is because we have a negative free cash flow cycle. 
So the way cash tracks earnings is a combination of what happens in the P&L at EPS level, but also the working capital component that comes with the P&L and the revenue from the accounts receivables side and also the fact that we need to build inventory to be able to cater for the supply chain shortages that we explained.

I mean, first, let's start with some of the businesses I have reported earlier and Tarek provided detail. Obviously, the Intelligent Edge, we see continued momentum. That is continuing right now as we speak. We feel pretty good about that. Much of the supply chain is not gated in China for the Intelligent Edge, so that's a positive news. Then, obviously, on high-performance computing, that demand continues to be solid, and we have a very interesting pipeline ahead of us with a unique, differentiated portfolio. So the need for processing data through AI, machine learning, big data-intensive workloads continue to be very high. That's not stopping. 
As we think about these new storage platforms, particularly what I call Intelligent Data platform, the data growth requires that the data gets stored and gets managed and ultimately insights are extracted from it. So that's positive as well. 
Right now, as I said earlier, as we enter Q2, we enter with a sizable backlog because we couldn't ship it in Q1 everything we wanted. And at the same time, we haven't seen yet outside China a significant impact. But obviously, as we think about the second back of the year here, obviously, we expect things to return to a level of normalcy that eventually will allow us to continue to progress against that. That's how I see it right now. And because of everything we do, both from a mix perspective, with the pivot to, obviously, as a service, which is a long-term opportunity and growing, and the fact we're taking our own actions here with HPE Next and other ones, that's where, at this point in time, we felt comfortable in affirming the original guidance that we provided here on EPS.

HPE's first quarter results demonstrate continued progress against our strategic priorities to shift our company to higher-margin and more recurring revenues against a dynamic marke",2111,"Thanks, Andy. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. 
HPE's first quarter results demonstrate continued progress against our strategic priorities to shift our company to higher-margin and more recurring revenues against a dynamic market backdrop. I am disappointed that our overall revenue of $6.9 billion reflects a 7% decline for the quarter, primarily due to declines in our Compute business. However, I am pleased with the results in several key areas of our business aligned to our strategy. Our pivot to as a service is gaining momentum. Our annualized revenue run rate grew 19% year-over-year. We started reporting this new metric last quarter to provide more transparency into the recurring and higher-margin benefits of shifting to our as a service model. 
We grew HPE GreenLake services orders 48% year-over-year. HPE GreenLake gained 65 new logos in Q1 and has surpassed 800 total customers. We returned to growth in our Intelligent Edge business, with revenue up 4% year-over-year. And we continue to see profitable growth in areas of investment, including high-performance compute, hyperconverged infrastructure, big data storage and operational services orders, with continued improvements in our services attach intensity. 
Our Q1 revenues were impacted by a number of factors. First, like many of our peers, we continue to see uneven and unpredictable demand due to macro uncertainty. This has resulted in longer sales cycles and delayed customer decisions. Second, commodity supply constraints disrupted our ability to meet our customers' demand this quarter, particularly in our Compute and high-performance compute businesses. 
Additionally, the outbreak of the coronavirus at the end of January impacted component manufacturing, resulting in higher quarter end backlog. In both of these cases, we have established specific mitigation and recovery plans with each of our suppliers. 
Finally, we encountered a challenge in consolidating our manufacturing site in North America. We have a plan in place to address the Q1 issue and are confident that our efforts will result in increased efficiency and agility as we move forward. 
It is important to note that even with the revenue shortfall, we improved our non-GAAP gross margin by 210 basis points year-over-year to 33.2%. We drove non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.44, up 5% year-over-year and in line with our outlook, while also investing for future innovation. And we delivered improved free cash flow compared to last year's level and in line with Q1 normal seasonality. 
While market uncertainty continues and new global developments like the coronavirus have emerged, we have taken the right actions to mitigate against these evolving dynamics. Some of these actions include further cost take-out in our back-end operations as a part of our HPE Next program, which has been a key enabler of our gross and operating margin improvement. We have extended the program through fiscal year 2021 and expect incremental savings while maintaining the original net cash impact. 
As Tarek will cover in more detail, because of the actions we have taken to address the uncertainty and the expected recovery of supply chain constraints over time, we are comfortable maintaining our fiscal year '20 non-GAAP EPS outlook. But there are too many unknowns at this point to provide second quarter guidance. Also, we do feel it is prudent to revise our fiscal year '20 free cash flow outlook from $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion to $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion given that we expect some impact on cash conversion cycles driven by the ongoing recovery from supply constraints and impact of the coronavirus. These are the right pragmatic actions to take, and I am confident in our ability to deliver in our strategy. 
Our customers continue to reaffirm their need for hybrid capabilities to advance their digital transformations and harness the power of their data wherever it lives: in the cloud; on- and off-premises; and increasingly, at the edge. As the edge-to-cloud Platform as a Service company, HP is uniquely positioned to capitalize on these trends and help our customers transform. 
Before Tarek provides more specifics about the quarter, let me highlight a few of our business and segment results. First, our Intelligent Edge business outperformed competitors across the industry. We grew in all geographies, posting double-digit growth in North America despite the challenging macro environment, and we delivered double-digit growth in our Aruba-branded products. Over the last 2 quarters, we have been actively enhancing our sales coverage model in North America, and I am proud of the team's hard work and our momentum. We declared the opportunity at the Intelligent Edge early, and we continue to invest in bringing a cloud experience to the edge, where data is increasingly created. At the core of this strategy is HP Aruba Central, the only cloud-native and simple-to-use platform that unifies network management, AI-powered insights and IoT device security for wired, wireless and WAN networks and soon 5G and edge computing. More than 58,000 unique customers are using Aruba Central. 
In Q1, Aruba, which pioneered the software-defined branch solution for deployment and management of large retail networks, further enhanced our solution by integrating Aruba Branch Gateways with Aruba Central. By providing a single point of control for SD-WAN, wired and wireless networking, Aruba can help customers achieve secure, simplified branch connectivity at scale. 
Our customers continue to recognize our innovation at the edge. For instance, in the first quarter, the Office of Information Technology at Princeton University turned to Aruba AOS-CX to support its wired initiative and seamlessly integrate with Aruba wireless with a goal of creating a complete mobile-first campus of the future. Sub-Zero, a leading luxury appliance maker, updated its wired with wireless infrastructure through Aruba AOS-CX and [ Eastern Wireless ] to support IoT in high-end appliances. Both our Aruba AOS-CX and Wi-Fi 6 solutions continue to gain traction in the market. 
The customer examples I share are a testament of our differentiated innovation. I am excited about how our market leadership is helping customers redefine experiences at the edge. We will continue to enhance our portfolio with the integration of 5G and mobile edge computing to capitalize on this significant opportunity. 
Turning to Hybrid IT. As we announce at our Securities Analyst Meeting last fall, we are providing revenue and operating profit disclosures in 4 business segments, Compute, High Performance Compute & Mission-Critical Systems, Storage and Advisory & Professional Services, aligned to customer demands and market trends. Tarek will walk you through the financial results in greater detail, but let me share a few high-level observations. As I noted earlier, our Compute revenue was impacted by a combination of factors and came in lower than anticipated for the quarter. However, we did see an acceleration in unit volumes, which were up mid-single digits year-over-year, excluding Tier 1 and China. Our High Performance Compute & Mission-Critical Systems segment includes the first full quarter of Cray. We are excited about the combination of HP and Cray and the growing TAM. We have been awarded more than $2 billion in HPC business expected to be delivered in the next 3 years. Programs include the U.S. Department of Energy's El Capitan system at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and Frontier Supercomputer at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, among others. 
Our new segmentation provide greater insights into the size, strength and attractive financial profile of our HP Storage business, which is a $5 billion business with an operating margin of 18%. We gained momentum in key areas during the quarter and expect to gain share in external disk. Big data storage grew 45% year-over-year and demonstrates early success with our MapR acquisition. Hyperconverged infrastructure also continued to grow, up 6%. HP InfoSight, our cloud-based AI operations platform, gained momentum across both Storage and Compute. I am proud of our focused efforts and innovation that have created one of the most comprehensive intelligent data platform in the industry, which will continue to provide customers with superior simplicity and performance. 
Our Advisory & Professional Services business provides strategy, technology planning and consultant services that help customers navigate their digital transformation from edge to cloud. With increased focus and simplification of this business, we drove demand across the HPE portfolio and significantly expanded operating margins this quarter, up 12.5 points year-over-year. 
Our customer wins demonstrate the strength of our strategy and breadth of our portfolio. For example, HPE was recently selected by Zenuity, a joint venture between Volvo Cars and Veoneer, to help make next-generation autonomous driving cars a reality. HPE will provide the crucial AI and high-performance computing required to gather, store, organize and analyze data from its global network of test vehicles and software development centers. The end-to-end solution will be delivered as a service through HP GreenLake. Rohde & Schwarz, a global electronics company, wanted to reduce storage complexity and reclaim management time, already relying on 3PAR for business-critical applications, the company chose Nimble Storage to help manage a 20% year-over-year growth in data. This new combination has improved performance threefold. 
Volkswagen Group selected HPE to deliver state-of-the-art compute and mission-critical servers to run its apps and solutions like SAP HANA, virtual desktop infrastructure and others focused on big data analytics, AI and autonomous driving. Our offerings such as HPE Superdome Flex, HPE ProLiant Gen10 servers and HPE Pointnext support services will power the data and apps for the Volkswagen Group's 12 global brands. 
In Q1, we continued to accelerate innovation. We achieved a major milestone in our pivot to as a service with the launch of HPE GreenLake Central platform. HPE GreenLake Central is an advanced cloud platform that provides customers with a consistent cloud experience for all their applications and data wherever they live through an operational console that runs, manages and optimizes their entire hybrid estate. We launched our HPE Container Platform, which is the first enterprise-grade Kubernetes-based container solution. It leverages HPE's acquisition of BlueData and MapR together with 100% open-source Kubernetes software. This platform provides customers with a common and faster path to run legacy and cloud-native applications with persistent storage connectivity. 
And we acquired Scytale, an innovative software company focused on service authentication. The Scytale team are the founding contributors to 2 open-source projects that they are positioned to become the de facto standard for identifying and securing enterprise workloads, both on- and off-premises. Our Scytale acquisition is consistent with our targeted approach to M&A that brings critical talent and complementary technologies to HPE. We look for accretive, value-enhancing acquisitions that improve our competitive positioning and accelerate our strategy. 
Finally, our HPE Financial Services business continues to provide us with a critical competitive advantage. In Q1, overall financing volume increased 2%. GreenLake represented more than 40% of our HPE leasing volume. HPEFS uses multiple levers to help customers accelerate their digital transformations while contributing to the circular economy. Through asset upcycling and accelerated migration, HPEFS free up well over $500 million in our customers' budgets over the last 2 years. This business helps our customers capture value from older assets, achieve their sustainability goals and invest in new technologies as a service. 
As we advance our business objectives to meet our customer needs and deliver for our shareholders, we continue to be guided by a very strong purpose. I am tremendously proud of our environmental stewardship, our investments in our people and our culture of integrity and inclusion. HP was just recognized as one of the most ethical companies by Ethisphere Institute. We were also proud to be named to Bloomberg's Gender-Equality Index. These are very important measures of how HP delivers for our team members, customers, shareholders and our global communities. 
In summary, in Q1, we faced continued macro uncertainty which, combined with supply and manufacturing constraints, impacted our revenue, particularly in Compute. Despite these issues in the current market backdrop, we continue to execute with discipline and made progress against our strategic priorities. We outperformed the market in critical areas like Intelligent Edge. We gained traction in high-performance compute with the acquisition of Cray. We advanced our pivot to as a service, all while delivering EPS and gross margin expansion. While we made progress in these important areas, we know we have work to do to improve in others. 
We are living in an uncertain time, but what is certain is our commitment to continue to manage our business with focus and discipline. I believe in our sound strategy, in our talented team and in our differentiated technology. This combination will enable us to execute our pivot to provide our customers and partners unique edge-to-cloud experiences delivered as a service. And by doing so, we expect to deliver long-term profitable growth and generate stakeholder value. 
With that, let me turn it over to Tarek to provide more details about the quarter."

Now let me provide more detail on our financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2020.

Now let me provide more detail on our financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2020. As I have done before, I'll be referencing the slides from our earnings presentation to highlight our performance in the quarter. Also please note that we are now reporting results according to our new segmentation. This will provide more granular detail on the financial performance of our businesses and our progress towards becoming the edge-to-cloud Platform as a Service company. Please refer to our recently filed Form 8-K for more detailed information, which includes historical reconciliation tables for the last 2 years. 
Antonio already discussed the high-level points for the quarter, but I want to briefly reiterate the main takeaway. We are continuing to execute on our transition to higher-margin and more recurring revenue areas in a challenging business environment. We also remain confident that we have the right strategy in place and are taking the right actions to lay a foundation for sustainable, profitable growth in the future. 
Turning to Slide 2, with the financial highlights for the quarter. Despite the top line challenges from uneven demand and component supply and manufacturing constraints that I'll provide more detail on shortly, we continued to expand non-GAAP gross margins, which improved by 210 basis points this year, driven primarily by portfolio mix shift, cost of services efficiencies and commodity cost tailwinds. This gross margin expansion combined with other income and expense benefits that included record equity interest contributed from our ownership in H3C and share buybacks resulted in diluted non-GAAP EPS of $0.44, which is up 5% year-over-year and in line with our original outlook for the quarter. 
On the cash front, free cash flow was a use of $185 million, which was in line with the prior year and normal seasonality. Consistent with our capital management policy, we paid $156 million in dividends and repurchased $204 million in shares. From a macro perspective, as Antonio mentioned, geopolitical factors continue to cause business uncertainty, particularly in larger enterprise deals, creating an uneven and unpredictable business environment. This was further exacerbated by supply constraints, both component shortages and our North American manufacturing site consolidation, which affected the Compute business, in particular. We expect component shortages to remain a headwind and this situation to alleviate as we progress through the year. 
The North American manufacturing site consolidation has created near-term execution challenges that we are actively addressing and expect to have improved efficiencies and agilities in our supply chain moving forward. Adding to the uncertainty is the potential disruption to demand and supply caused by the coronavirus outbreak. The health issue is causing disruption to both supply and demand, and while we cannot quantify the real impact at this time, we're monitoring the situation closely and are working with our suppliers to minimize potential impact. 
We'll now move to Slide 3 that shows our performance in the quarter in accordance with our new segmentation. I won't take you through every number, but let me hit a few key points. In the Intelligent Edge segment, we grew 4%. Our changes to North America sales leadership and go-to-market segmentation are paying off with double-digit growth in North America and 13% growth in overall wireless LAN product. While we continue to make relevant R&D and sales investments this year, we're also delivering significant improvement in profitability with operating margins of 9.7%, up 630 basis points year-over-year. 
In Compute, revenue declined 15% this quarter due to the previously highlighted uneven demand environment, component supply constraints and North American manufacturing site consolidation, yet we delivered a 9.5% operating profit margin in line with last year. With respect to units, excluding Tier 1 and China, our units were up mid-single digits year-over-year and have also been growing sequentially since Q2 2019. 
In High Performance Compute & Mission-Critical Systems, we grew revenue 6% that included our first full quarter contribution from Cray. Our HPC business has been awarded over $2 billion of business that is expected to be delivered through fiscal year '23. We will also optimize the Cray cost envelope and expect triple-digit millions in annualized run rate cost synergies to be recognized by the end of the next fiscal year, significantly adding to the operating profit and margins of HPC & MCS. 
Within Storage, we made progress against a competitive backdrop, maintaining flat sequential revenues with notable strength in big data growing at 45% year-over-year and hyperconverged infrastructure growing at 6% year-over-year this quarter. Note that this is the first quarter we are reporting hyperconverged infrastructure in Storage aligned to our peers. 
In Advisory & Professional Services, we are reporting for the first time in our new segmentation, revenue was flat, and we significantly improved operating margins by 12.5 points year-over-year as we focus on eliminating unprofitable business. For operational services, which is included across Compute, HPC & MCS and Storage, orders were up 1% year-over-year, and revenue was down 2%. Our services intensity, which is the ratio of attach revenue per unit, was up year-over-year again in every business segment this quarter, with double-digit growth in HPC & MCS services intensity driven by Cray. This demonstrates that the underlying profitability of the units we sell and the attach rates continue to be robust. 
Within HPE Financial Services, we expanded our net portfolio of assets, which was up 2% in constant currency this quarter, with longer contract terms supporting GreenLake, and we maintained a solid return on equity of approximately 15% again this quarter with bad debt loss ratio of 0.4%, which is best-in-class within this industry. And while not shown on this slide, communications and media solutions that is included in our Corporate Investments segment is a strategically important business to us, providing software and services capabilities to telco service providers. It is showing improved momentum. 
Orders in CMS were up 10% sequentially, and revenue was up 2% due to improved momentum of the telco software and services business. 
Slide 4 shows the ARR slide that I discussed at our Securities Analyst Meeting in October 2019. Please reference the same presentation for a deep dive into what makes up the ARR. Our Q1 '20 ARR actuals came in at $511 million, a 19% year-over-year growth that accelerated from last quarter. Our HPE Aruba Central platform is starting to gain traction, with revenue growing triple digits year-over-year. We also continue to see strong growth in GreenLake services orders, which are up 48% year-over-year. As we progress towards building our go-to-market as a service motion and remain focused on offering a full suite of differentiated solutions that can be consumed as a service, we are confident in achieving our ARR growth guidance of 30% to 40% compounded annual growth rate from fiscal year '19 to fiscal year '22. 
Slide 5 shows our EPS performance to date. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.44 in Q1 is in line with our previously provided outlook of $0.42 to $0.46 due to disciplined execution, expanding gross margins and favorable other income and expense. This represents year-over-year growth of 5%. Also, please note, our OI&E performance in Q1 of fiscal year '20 does not change our fiscal year '20 OI&E outlook. As we foreshadowed during last October's Securities Analyst Meeting, we continue to expect OI&E to be a $0.03 to $0.05 per share headwind in fiscal year '20. 
Turning to gross margins on Slide 6. We continue to deliver significant year-over-year gross margin expansion that was up 210 basis points year-over-year to 33.2% as we shifted to higher-margin offerings like the Intelligent Edge with Aruba Central, hyperconverged infrastructure, the addition of Cray and commodity cost tailwinds. 
Moving to Slide 7. We have continued to improve operating profit since the beginning of Q1 of fiscal year '18 while making strategic investments in R&D and sales to support long-term profitable growth. In Q1 of fiscal year '20, we are now consolidating a full quarter of additional operating expenses from the Cray acquisition that will be optimized going forward. Furthermore, given the additional uncertainty in the business environment introduced this quarter, we are taking near-term actions that will enable us to protect and expand our profitability in fiscal year '20 while continuing to make critical long-term investments. As Antonio mentioned, we will extend the HPE Next program into fiscal year '21 and expect incremental savings while maintaining the original net cash impact. 
Turning to cash flow on Slide 8. Operating cash flow declined with revenue $461 million year-over-year. Free cash flow for Q1 was in line with normal seasonality at negative $185 million, in line with the prior year, thanks to planned net CapEx benefits in the quarter. Please remember, our normal seasonality is for cash to be used in the first half and then we generate significant amounts of free cash flow in the second half of the fiscal year. 
Now as a reminder, on Slide 9, we maintained a solid balance sheet with our cash flow generation, and we have a disciplined returns-based process for evaluating investments and capital returns. We are committed to maintaining an investment-grade credit rating that is evidenced by our current operating net cash position. Consistent with our capital return commitments in Q1, we returned $360 million in the form of share repurchases and dividends. As part of our capital allocation framework, we also target value-enhancing acquisitions to improve our competitive positioning and to accelerate our strategy of pivoting to as a service that provides us with higher levels of recurring revenue and profitability. As with any investment we consider, we follow a rigorous evaluation process, cognizant of size, valuation, financial impacts, such as accretion dilution, and strategic fit. 
Now turning to our outlook on Slide 10. As discussed, we are in an increasingly uneven business environment, but at this point, we are comfortable maintaining our fiscal year '20 non-GAAP EPS outlook of $1.78 to $1.94 given the cost actions we plan to take and the expected recovery of supply chain constraints over time. However, there is still considerable uncertainty in the short term due to the unknown potential impacts from the coronavirus, so we're not in a position to provide a second quarter outlook. 
From a cash flow perspective and given our negative cash conversion cycle, we expect some current year impact on working capital receivables with elongated sales cycles persisting and the need to build inventory levels due to the supply chain constraints. Consequently, we feel it is prudent to revise our fiscal year '20 free cash flow outlook from $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion to $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion. We remain committed to our previously announced capital management policy of returning 50% to 75% of free cash flow to shareholders and now expect to be at the higher end of that range for fiscal year '20. 
So overall, we continued to make progress against our strategic priorities within an uneven environment and introduced new challenges this quarter. We're taking the appropriate actions to navigate the near-term uncertainty while executing against our vision and strategy that is clearly resonating with customers. We will continue to shift our portfolio to higher-margin, software-defined solutions and focus on delivering our edge-to-cloud platform, offering our full portfolio as a service by 2022. This will ultimately drive sustainable, profitable growth and shareholder returns for the long term. 
Now with that, let's open it up for questions. Thank you."

These are the macro environment softness; the second thing is supply chain constraints; and the third one is also the manufacturing node consolidation in North America. We've taken steps to address what's under our control. Nonetheless, coronavirus has affected the tail end of the quarter and injected a new degree of uncertainty. And when you look at the revenue performance of the company, most of the decline came in the Compute category that we refer to in our new segmentation, and that decline has a lot to do with what you referred to from a supply chain standpoint."

I just would like to add to Tarek that we feel pretty good about the recovery and the node consolidation that's under our control. All the other factors, Tarek explained very well. In terms of when you think about investment long term, we have been very clear where we want to invest. 
The investment, obviously, is in Intelligent Edge. We see that as the next frontier, big opportunity for us. We continue to do so. And I have to say I'm incredibly pleased with the Q1 performance because we said that business will return to growth, and we show -- we demonstrated that's the case. We outperformed the market and every single competitor there. And we are very, very pleased with the differentiation we have in that portfolio with higher margins. So for us, that's one area of investment. 
Much of that growth has happened organically. But we always look for would it make sense for us in terms of accretive addition in terms of intellectual property and talent, right, that we want to continue to expand that set of experience we delivered at the edge? And as I said in my opening remarks, we are on a journey to integrate 5G and mobile edge computing on a very robust cloud-based solution called HP Aruba Central, which is all subscription-based, and obviously, we can deliver that through GreenLake. 
Obviously, the other piece of this is what I call intellectual property to make our core business stronger. And that's all software-defined at the core with some additional, call it, intellectual property in the silicon space. That's what the core of the Cray acquisition was all about. The Cray acquisition is all about software in a cloud-native environment to run these big data-intensive workloads, and silicon was all about that. 
And as I think about the pivot to as a service, also, we're looking for software that will make our as a service experience unique and differentiated in a true edge-to-cloud platform. And as I announced in my remarks, we introduced 2 key platforms: one is HPE GreenLake Central, which is the console, the control point for managing and deploying workloads at the edge, in the core on-/off-premises, so we've added managed services layer on top of that; and then the container platform, which is a true cloud-native environment where you can run both legacy and cloud-based workloads. 
So those are the things we are doing. But I just want to emphasize we have a very stringent, rigorous process here on return on invested capital. And I see as an -- M&A as 1 of the 3 levers to drive innovation: organic is one aspect; partnership is the other one; and inorganic. And I say that the last 15 acquisitions have been part of it, has been always in that vein. And that's our goal."

Well, first, as we already flagged, the health and safety of our employees, customers and partners is our priority. And you know that out of abundance of caution for them, we've made the decision to cancel or postpone most of the HPE-sponsored events through April. 
Unfortunately, this is also causing supply and demand disruptions and affecting our revenue profile. The outbreak at the end of January started to impact component manufacturing and resulted in constrained supply and higher quarter-end backlog worldwide, and we have been in constant contact with our suppliers and are establishing specific mitigation and recovery plans. So this is affecting our revenue profile for the full year. This is why we're not guiding in the short term. And relative to what we said at SAM, where we were experiencing -- we're thinking we would be returning to growth in fiscal year '20, I don't think that it is likely at this stage that we'll grow in fiscal year '20 as a whole for the fiscal year. But we do anticipate recovery of those supply chain constraints over time and face easier comps during the course of the year."

We have a daily process with each of our suppliers that we manage very, very tightly. And some of those suppliers are dependent on other suppliers because, as you can imagine, the supply chain is a little bit longer with Tier 2, Tier 3 suppliers that provide what I call low-level components to build what I call the printed circuit boards or the PCAs or the PCBAs, and that's a challenge we see today. And we see recovery, but obviously, it's going to take time. And that's why Tarek said we cannot provide right now a definite guidance. I think it would be not appropriate. And that's why we felt prudent not to provide Q2 but because the recovery is going to happen through the year that we felt comfortable reaffirming the 2020 guidance. 
Remember, when we went to the Security Analyst Meeting in October, we said that we expect to grow the company on a 3-year basis long-term plan of 1% to 3%. I think that piece is still complete and intact because, as you can see, as we pivot the portfolio to higher value and higher margins, at the same time, the pivot to as a service, which is going extremely well, and then obviously that Intelligent Edge business growing, that's how we think about the long-term growth in the right margin profile. 
Obviously, the Compute at this point in time was the challenge short term. I don't think it was off compared to some of our peers. In fact, in some cases, we did better than our peers. But that was a disappointment. And obviously, we need to stabilize and manage it through the supply chain recovery."

And so that's true for Compute and as well a carryover for high-performance compute, which, at the core of that product, Toni, is the legacy HPE Apollo. So we entered Q2 with a higher elevated backlog that we have seen. 
I don't see yet -- let me qualify this. Outside China, I haven't seen yet a significant impact on demand so far. Definitely, in China, as you know, we have a different setup with our H3C partnership there, and you should expect a short-term impact in China. But right now, they are working through it. But I will say, right now, we haven't seen a significant impact. If anything, actually, it creates short-term opportunities. I can tell you because of the coronavirus, we see customers coming to us and saying, ""Can you ship this product to take care of the fact that my employees are not going to be at work."" We see some demand in specific areas of workload-optimized solutions. 
And as I said in my opening remarks, we do have as awarded business, which, obviously, we have to build and ship more than $2 billion in HPC business that we have to ship over the next several quarters in the next 2 years.

Listen, I think it is a disappointing kind of situation, in my view. We are heavily discounted. There is no question about it. But think about the last 9 quarters, Toni, and think about the gross margin expansion and EPS expansion we have had. It's pretty remarkable. I mean, in the last 2 years, we expanded the margins every single quarter, and we have expanded EPS every single quarter. So my vantage point, we have done the right things. We have made the company leaner, meaner, and at the same time, we have taken big, big, big challenges, and we have managed it through. So I think, for us, is to continue to focus on the areas where we see the opportunity to compete and win in higher margins, but obviously, the stock also is thinking about long-term growth, and I understand that. And obviously, a big component of that is our Compute business. But in the end, I think the stock is heavily discounted, and I'm disappointed in that. 
On the M&A, we have been very clear since day 1 that we look at assets that they are accessible, that generally are accretive or we can manage the dilution very quickly. But ultimately, it has to have strategic fit in the context of our strategy, obviously, whether it's the edge-to-cloud architecture and pivoting to as a service. I think the assets we have acquired makes complete sense from that vantage point, and we have delivered strong results. Size is important, but I will say it's more strategic fit and obviously the return on that investment capital, which we have incredible strong discipline and where we have demonstrated that over the last 2 years. 
And so maybe I will go pass it now to Tarek because you asked the question about taking debt and buying stock and so forth."

I would simply point to you at the performance of the various parts of our business, the Intelligent Edge, which has outperformed the sector quite substantially this quarter, what's the value of that? If you look at our Storage business, which has done better than most of the players in the market and is of the same size as a very large pure-play listed company, what's the value of that? And if you look at our HPC & MCS business and the $2 billion of backlog contracted revenues that would come in, what's the value of that? And then you have to look at other players in the sector and compare our Compute business to them and see that also for those players, the Compute business is valued negatively from an equity standpoint. But it does generate cash, and we have to figure that out. 
Finally, let me finish by saying H3C, the put option, what's the value of that? It's a listed company, and it's pretty substantial. So I'll let you conclude whether the stock is beaten down or not and how much it's beaten down. And you probably, in your own question, you have the answer.

But it's to do the hard things now as these things recover to come on the other end even stronger than before. 
On the short-term actions, I think, first, we have to protect our employees, first and foremost. I think it's important, and that was the first step.

Obviously, some companies have been aligned for some time, and they have been recovering on a daily basis the output of their facilities or their capacity. Obviously, the biggest constraint they had at the time was labor because, obviously, depending on the region within China, but eventually became the entire China, for the most part, is the health measures and certifications that they have to go through. But in general, I will say it's progressed every single day, and whether it's people coming online or people improving the output of whatever we're already doing. And so that's progressing. 
And so you have to take it day by day. And obviously, what we're doing is, because we have a global supply chain here, is China is one aspect, but also how we manage inventory and how we manage the distribution of those orders in a way we can maximize the return while these things gets back to normal. 
That's how we are managing. And to be honest, we have a very stringent process with war rooms and talking to suppliers every single day. I personally have talked to at least 50 of them myself and have direct contact with each of them."

So you remember last year, this time of the year, we did say that from a free cash flow standpoint, working capital would be a contributor to cash. And that is what happened last year. This year, we have attained the point where our cash conversion cycle is negative. And whilst we do deliver the EPS guide, and we confirmed it for Antonio, the drop in revenue will inevitably have a drag on the free cash flow generation. That is because we have a negative free cash flow cycle. 
So the way cash tracks earnings is a combination of what happens in the P&L at EPS level but also the working capital component that comes with the P&L and the revenue from the accounts receivables side and also the fact that we need to build inventory to be able to cater for the supply chain shortages that we explained. That is what is behind the difference between the P&L EPS performance and the free cash flow guide that we put forward."

I mean, first, let's start with some of the businesses I have reported earlier and Tarek provided detail. Obviously, the Intelligent Edge, we see continued momentum. That is continuing right now as we speak. We feel pretty good about that. Much of the supply chain is not gated in China for the Intelligent Edge, so that's a positive news. Then, obviously, on high-performance computing, that demand continues to be solid, and we have a very interesting pipeline ahead of us with a unique, differentiated portfolio. So the need for processing data through AI, machine learning, big data-intensive workloads continue to be very high. That's not stopping. 
As we think about these new storage platforms, particularly what I call Intelligent Data platform, the data growth requires that the data gets stored and gets managed and ultimately insights are extracted from it. So that's positive as well. 
Right now, as I said earlier, as we enter Q2, we enter with a sizable backlog because we couldn't ship it in Q1 everything we wanted. And at the same time, we haven't seen yet outside China a significant impact. But obviously, as we think about the second -- back of the year here, obviously, we expect to -- things to return to a level of normalcy that eventually will allow us to continue to progress against that. That's how I see it right now. And because of everything we do, both from a mix perspective, with the pivot to, obviously, as a service, which is a long-term opportunity and growing, and the fact we're taking our own actions here with HPE Next and other ones, that's where, at this point in time, we felt comfortable in affirming the original guidance that we provided here on EPS.

HPE's first quarter results demonstrate continued progress against our strategic priorities to shift our company to higher-margin and more recurring revenues against a dynamic marke",2111,"Thanks, Andy. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. 
HPE's first quarter results demonstrate continued progress against our strategic priorities to shift our company to higher-margin and more recurring revenues against a dynamic market backdrop. I am disappointed that our overall revenue of $6.9 billion reflects a 7% decline for the quarter, primarily due to declines in our Compute business. However, I am pleased with the results in several key areas of our business aligned to our strategy. Our pivot to as a service is gaining momentum. Our annualized revenue run rate grew 19% year-over-year. We started reporting this new metric last quarter to provide more transparency into the recurring and higher-margin benefits of shifting to our as a service model. 
We grew HPE GreenLake services orders 48% year-over-year. HPE GreenLake gained 65 new logos in Q1 and has surpassed 800 total customers. We returned to growth in our Intelligent Edge business, with revenue up 4% year-over-year. And we continue to see profitable growth in areas of investment, including high-performance compute, hyperconverged infrastructure, big data storage and operational services orders, with continued improvements in our services attach intensity. 
Our Q1 revenues were impacted by a number of factors. First, like many of our peers, we continue to see uneven and unpredictable demand due to macro uncertainty. This has resulted in longer sales cycles and delayed customer decisions. Second, commodity supply constraints disrupted our ability to meet our customers' demand this quarter, particularly in our Compute and high-performance compute businesses. 
Additionally, the outbreak of the coronavirus at the end of January impacted component manufacturing, resulting in higher quarter end backlog. In both of these cases, we have established specific mitigation and recovery plans with each of our suppliers. 
Finally, we encountered a challenge in consolidating our manufacturing site in North America. We have a plan in place to address the Q1 issue and are confident that our efforts will result in increased efficiency and agility as we move forward. 
It is important to note that even with the revenue shortfall, we improved our non-GAAP gross margin by 210 basis points year-over-year to 33.2%. We drove non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.44, up 5% year-over-year and in line with our outlook, while also investing for future innovation. And we delivered improved free cash flow compared to last year's level and in line with Q1 normal seasonality. 
While market uncertainty continues and new global developments like the coronavirus have emerged, we have taken the right actions to mitigate against these evolving dynamics. Some of these actions include further cost take-out in our back-end operations as a part of our HPE Next program, which has been a key enabler of our gross and operating margin improvement. We have extended the program through fiscal year 2021 and expect incremental savings while maintaining the original net cash impact. 
As Tarek will cover in more detail, because of the actions we have taken to address the uncertainty and the expected recovery of supply chain constraints over time, we are comfortable maintaining our fiscal year '20 non-GAAP EPS outlook. But there are too many unknowns at this point to provide second quarter guidance. Also, we do feel it is prudent to revise our fiscal year '20 free cash flow outlook from $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion to $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion given that we expect some impact on cash conversion cycles driven by the ongoing recovery from supply constraints and impact of the coronavirus. These are the right pragmatic actions to take, and I am confident in our ability to deliver in our strategy. 
Our customers continue to reaffirm their need for hybrid capabilities to advance their digital transformations and harness the power of their data wherever it lives: in the cloud; on- and off-premises; and increasingly, at the edge. As the edge-to-cloud Platform as a Service company, HP is uniquely positioned to capitalize on these trends and help our customers transform. 
Before Tarek provides more specifics about the quarter, let me highlight a few of our business and segment results. First, our Intelligent Edge business outperformed competitors across the industry. We grew in all geographies, posting double-digit growth in North America despite the challenging macro environment, and we delivered double-digit growth in our Aruba-branded products. Over the last 2 quarters, we have been actively enhancing our sales coverage model in North America, and I am proud of the team's hard work and our momentum. We declared the opportunity at the Intelligent Edge early, and we continue to invest in bringing a cloud experience to the edge, where data is increasingly created. At the core of this strategy is HP Aruba Central, the only cloud-native and simple-to-use platform that unifies network management, AI-powered insights and IoT device security for wired, wireless and WAN networks and soon 5G and edge computing. More than 58,000 unique customers are using Aruba Central. 
In Q1, Aruba, which pioneered the software-defined branch solution for deployment and management of large retail networks, further enhanced our solution by integrating Aruba Branch Gateways with Aruba Central. By providing a single point of control for SD-WAN, wired and wireless networking, Aruba can help customers achieve secure, simplified branch connectivity at scale. 
Our customers continue to recognize our innovation at the edge. For instance, in the first quarter, the Office of Information Technology at Princeton University turned to Aruba AOS-CX to support its wired initiative and seamlessly integrate with Aruba wireless with a goal of creating a complete mobile-first campus of the future. Sub-Zero, a leading luxury appliance maker, updated its wired with wireless infrastructure through Aruba AOS-CX and [ Eastern Wireless ] to support IoT in high-end appliances. Both our Aruba AOS-CX and Wi-Fi 6 solutions continue to gain traction in the market. 
The customer examples I share are a testament of our differentiated innovation. I am excited about how our market leadership is helping customers redefine experiences at the edge. We will continue to enhance our portfolio with the integration of 5G and mobile edge computing to capitalize on this significant opportunity. 
Turning to Hybrid IT. As we announce at our Securities Analyst Meeting last fall, we are providing revenue and operating profit disclosures in 4 business segments, Compute, High Performance Compute & Mission-Critical Systems, Storage and Advisory & Professional Services, aligned to customer demands and market trends. Tarek will walk you through the financial results in greater detail, but let me share a few high-level observations. As I noted earlier, our Compute revenue was impacted by a combination of factors and came in lower than anticipated for the quarter. However, we did see an acceleration in unit volumes, which were up mid-single digits year-over-year, excluding Tier 1 and China. Our High Performance Compute & Mission-Critical Systems segment includes the first full quarter of Cray. We are excited about the combination of HP and Cray and the growing TAM. We have been awarded more than $2 billion in HPC business expected to be delivered in the next 3 years. Programs include the U.S. Department of Energy's El Capitan system at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and Frontier Supercomputer at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, among others. 
Our new segmentation provide greater insights into the size, strength and attractive financial profile of our HP Storage business, which is a $5 billion business with an operating margin of 18%. We gained momentum in key areas during the quarter and expect to gain share in external disk. Big data storage grew 45% year-over-year and demonstrates early success with our MapR acquisition. Hyperconverged infrastructure also continued to grow, up 6%. HP InfoSight, our cloud-based AI operations platform, gained momentum across both Storage and Compute. I am proud of our focused efforts and innovation that have created one of the most comprehensive intelligent data platform in the industry, which will continue to provide customers with superior simplicity and performance. 
Our Advisory & Professional Services business provides strategy, technology planning and consultant services that help customers navigate their digital transformation from edge to cloud. With increased focus and simplification of this business, we drove demand across the HPE portfolio and significantly expanded operating margins this quarter, up 12.5 points year-over-year. 
Our customer wins demonstrate the strength of our strategy and breadth of our portfolio. For example, HPE was recently selected by Zenuity, a joint venture between Volvo Cars and Veoneer, to help make next-generation autonomous driving cars a reality. HPE will provide the crucial AI and high-performance computing required to gather, store, organize and analyze data from its global network of test vehicles and software development centers. The end-to-end solution will be delivered as a service through HP GreenLake. Rohde & Schwarz, a global electronics company, wanted to reduce storage complexity and reclaim management time, already relying on 3PAR for business-critical applications, the company chose Nimble Storage to help manage a 20% year-over-year growth in data. This new combination has improved performance threefold. 
Volkswagen Group selected HPE to deliver state-of-the-art compute and mission-critical servers to run its apps and solutions like SAP HANA, virtual desktop infrastructure and others focused on big data analytics, AI and autonomous driving. Our offerings such as HPE Superdome Flex, HPE ProLiant Gen10 servers and HPE Pointnext support services will power the data and apps for the Volkswagen Group's 12 global brands. 
In Q1, we continued to accelerate innovation. We achieved a major milestone in our pivot to as a service with the launch of HPE GreenLake Central platform. HPE GreenLake Central is an advanced cloud platform that provides customers with a consistent cloud experience for all their applications and data wherever they live through an operational console that runs, manages and optimizes their entire hybrid estate. We launched our HPE Container Platform, which is the first enterprise-grade Kubernetes-based container solution. It leverages HPE's acquisition of BlueData and MapR together with 100% open-source Kubernetes software. This platform provides customers with a common and faster path to run legacy and cloud-native applications with persistent storage connectivity. 
And we acquired Scytale, an innovative software company focused on service authentication. The Scytale team are the founding contributors to 2 open-source projects that they are positioned to become the de facto standard for identifying and securing enterprise workloads, both on- and off-premises. Our Scytale acquisition is consistent with our targeted approach to M&A that brings critical talent and complementary technologies to HPE. We look for accretive, value-enhancing acquisitions that improve our competitive positioning and accelerate our strategy. 
Finally, our HPE Financial Services business continues to provide us with a critical competitive advantage. In Q1, overall financing volume increased 2%. GreenLake represented more than 40% of our HPE leasing volume. HPEFS uses multiple levers to help customers accelerate their digital transformations while contributing to the circular economy. Through asset upcycling and accelerated migration, HPEFS free up well over $500 million in our customers' budgets over the last 2 years. This business helps our customers capture value from older assets, achieve their sustainability goals and invest in new technologies as a service. 
As we advance our business objectives to meet our customer needs and deliver for our shareholders, we continue to be guided by a very strong purpose. I am tremendously proud of our environmental stewardship, our investments in our people and our culture of integrity and inclusion. HP was just recognized as one of the most ethical companies by Ethisphere Institute. We were also proud to be named to Bloomberg's Gender-Equality Index. These are very important measures of how HP delivers for our team members, customers, shareholders and our global communities. 
In summary, in Q1, we faced continued macro uncertainty which, combined with supply and manufacturing constraints, impacted our revenue, particularly in Compute. Despite these issues in the current market backdrop, we continue to execute with discipline and made progress against our strategic priorities. We outperformed the market in critical areas like Intelligent Edge. We gained traction in high-performance compute with the acquisition of Cray. We advanced our pivot to as a service, all while delivering EPS and gross margin expansion. While we made progress in these important areas, we know we have work to do to improve in others. 
We are living in an uncertain time, but what is certain is our commitment to continue to manage our business with focus and discipline. I believe in our sound strategy, in our talented team and in our differentiated technology. This combination will enable us to execute our pivot to provide our customers and partners unique edge-to-cloud experiences delivered as a service. And by doing so, we expect to deliver long-term profitable growth and generate stakeholder value. 
With that, let me turn it over to Tarek to provide more details about the quarter."

Now let me provide more detail on our financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2020. As I have done before, I'll be referencing the slides from our earnings presentation to highlight our performance in the quarter. Also please note that we are now reporting results according to our new segmentation. This will provide more granular detail on the financial performance of our businesses and our progress towards becoming the edge-to-cloud Platform as a Service company. Please refer to our recently filed Form 8-K for more detailed information, which includes historical reconciliation tables for the last 2 years. 
Antonio already discussed the high-level points for the quarter, but I want to briefly reiterate the main takeaway. We are continuing to execute on our transition to higher-margin and more recurring revenue areas in a challenging business environment. We also remain confident that we have the right strategy in place and are taking the right actions to lay a foundation for sustainable, profitable growth in the future. 
Turning to Slide 2, with the financial highlights for the quarter. Despite the top line challenges from uneven demand and component supply and manufacturing constraints that I'll provide more detail on shortly, we continued to expand non-GAAP gross margins, which improved by 210 basis points this year, driven primarily by portfolio mix shift, cost of services efficiencies and commodity cost tailwinds. This gross margin expansion combined with other income and expense benefits that included record equity interest contributed from our ownership in H3C and share buybacks resulted in diluted non-GAAP EPS of $0.44, which is up 5% year-over-year and in line with our original outlook for the quarter. 
On the cash front, free cash flow was a use of $185 million, which was in line with the prior year and normal seasonality. Consistent with our capital management policy, we paid $156 million in dividends and repurchased $204 million in shares. From a macro perspective, as Antonio mentioned, geopolitical factors continue to cause business uncertainty, particularly in larger enterprise deals, creating an uneven and unpredictable business environment. This was further exacerbated by supply constraints, both component shortages and our North American manufacturing site consolidation, which affected the Compute business, in particular. We expect component shortages to remain a headwind and this situation to alleviate as we progress through the year. 
The North American manufacturing site consolidation has created near-term execution challenges that we are actively addressing and expect to have improved efficiencies and agilities in our supply chain moving forward. Adding to the uncertainty is the potential disruption to demand and supply caused by the coronavirus outbreak. The health issue is causing disruption to both supply and demand, and while we cannot quantify the real impact at this time, we're monitoring the situation closely and are working with our suppliers to minimize potential impact. 
We'll now move to Slide 3 that shows our performance in the quarter in accordance with our new segmentation. I won't take you through every number, but let me hit a few key points. In the Intelligent Edge segment, we grew 4%. Our changes to North America sales leadership and go-to-market segmentation are paying off with double-digit growth in North America and 13% growth in overall wireless LAN product. While we continue to make relevant R&D and sales investments this year, we're also delivering significant improvement in profitability with operating margins of 9.7%, up 630 basis points year-over-year. 
In Compute, revenue declined 15% this quarter due to the previously highlighted uneven demand environment, component supply constraints and North American manufacturing site consolidation, yet we delivered a 9.5% operating profit margin in line with last year. With respect to units, excluding Tier 1 and China, our units were up mid-single digits year-over-year and have also been growing sequentially since Q2 2019. 
In High Performance Compute & Mission-Critical Systems, we grew revenue 6% that included our first full quarter contribution from Cray. Our HPC business has been awarded over $2 billion of business that is expected to be delivered through fiscal year '23. We will also optimize the Cray cost envelope and expect triple-digit millions in annualized run rate cost synergies to be recognized by the end of the next fiscal year, significantly adding to the operating profit and margins of HPC & MCS. 
Within Storage, we made progress against a competitive backdrop, maintaining flat sequential revenues with notable strength in big data growing at 45% year-over-year and hyperconverged infrastructure growing at 6% year-over-year this quarter. Note that this is the first quarter we are reporting hyperconverged infrastructure in Storage aligned to our peers. 
In Advisory & Professional Services, we are reporting for the first time in our new segmentation, revenue was flat, and we significantly improved operating margins by 12.5 points year-over-year as we focus on eliminating unprofitable business. For operational services, which is included across Compute, HPC & MCS and Storage, orders were up 1% year-over-year, and revenue was down 2%. Our services intensity, which is the ratio of attach revenue per unit, was up year-over-year again in every business segment this quarter, with double-digit growth in HPC & MCS services intensity driven by Cray. This demonstrates that the underlying profitability of the units we sell and the attach rates continue to be robust. 
Within HPE Financial Services, we expanded our net portfolio of assets, which was up 2% in constant currency this quarter, with longer contract terms supporting GreenLake, and we maintained a solid return on equity of approximately 15% again this quarter with bad debt loss ratio of 0.4%, which is best-in-class within this industry. And while not shown on this slide, communications and media solutions that is included in our Corporate Investments segment is a strategically important business to us, providing software and services capabilities to telco service providers. It is showing improved momentum. 
Orders in CMS were up 10% sequentially, and revenue was up 2% due to improved momentum of the telco software and services business. 
Slide 4 shows the ARR slide that I discussed at our Securities Analyst Meeting in October 2019. Please reference the same presentation for a deep dive into what makes up the ARR. Our Q1 '20 ARR actuals came in at $511 million, a 19% year-over-year growth that accelerated from last quarter. Our HPE Aruba Central platform is starting to gain traction, with revenue growing triple digits year-over-year. We also continue to see strong growth in GreenLake services orders, which are up 48% year-over-year. As we progress towards building our go-to-market as a service motion and remain focused on offering a full suite of differentiated solutions that can be consumed as a service, we are confident in achieving our ARR growth guidance of 30% to 40% compounded annual growth rate from fiscal year '19 to fiscal year '22. 
Slide 5 shows our EPS performance to date. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.44 in Q1 is in line with our previously provided outlook of $0.42 to $0.46 due to disciplined execution, expanding gross margins and favorable other income and expense. This represents year-over-year growth of 5%. Also, please note, our OI&E performance in Q1 of fiscal year '20 does not change our fiscal year '20 OI&E outlook. As we foreshadowed during last October's Securities Analyst Meeting, we continue to expect OI&E to be a $0.03 to $0.05 per share headwind in fiscal year '20. 
Turning to gross margins on Slide 6. We continue to deliver significant year-over-year gross margin expansion that was up 210 basis points year-over-year to 33.2% as we shifted to higher-margin offerings like the Intelligent Edge with Aruba Central, hyperconverged infrastructure, the addition of Cray and commodity cost tailwinds. 
Moving to Slide 7. We have continued to improve operating profit since the beginning of Q1 of fiscal year '18 while making strategic investments in R&D and sales to support long-term profitable growth. In Q1 of fiscal year '20, we are now consolidating a full quarter of additional operating expenses from the Cray acquisition that will be optimized going forward. Furthermore, given the additional uncertainty in the business environment introduced this quarter, we are taking near-term actions that will enable us to protect and expand our profitability in fiscal year '20 while continuing to make critical long-term investments. As Antonio mentioned, we will extend the HPE Next program into fiscal year '21 and expect incremental savings while maintaining the original net cash impact. 
Turning to cash flow on Slide 8. Operating cash flow declined with revenue $461 million year-over-year. Free cash flow for Q1 was in line with normal seasonality at negative $185 million, in line with the prior year, thanks to planned net CapEx benefits in the quarter. Please remember, our normal seasonality is for cash to be used in the first half and then we generate significant amounts of free cash flow in the second half of the fiscal year. 
Now as a reminder, on Slide 9, we maintained a solid balance sheet with our cash flow generation, and we have a disciplined returns-based process for evaluating investments and capital returns. We are committed to maintaining an investment-grade credit rating that is evidenced by our current operating net cash position. Consistent with our capital return commitments in Q1, we returned $360 million in the form of share repurchases and dividends. As part of our capital allocation framework, we also target value-enhancing acquisitions to improve our competitive positioning and to accelerate our strategy of pivoting to as a service that provides us with higher levels of recurring revenue and profitability. As with any investment we consider, we follow a rigorous evaluation process, cognizant of size, valuation, financial impacts, such as accretion dilution, and strategic fit. 
Now turning to our outlook on Slide 10. As discussed, we are in an increasingly uneven business environment, but at this point, we are comfortable maintaining our fiscal year '20 non-GAAP EPS outlook of $1.78 to $1.94 given the cost actions we plan to take and the expected recovery of supply chain constraints over time. However, there is still considerable uncertainty in the short term due to the unknown potential impacts from the coronavirus, so we're not in a position to provide a second quarter outlook. 
From a cash flow perspective and given our negative cash conversion cycle, we expect some current year impact on working capital receivables with elongated sales cycles persisting and the need to build inventory levels due to the supply chain constraints. Consequently, we feel it is prudent to revise our fiscal year '20 free cash flow outlook from $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion to $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion. We remain committed to our previously announced capital management policy of returning 50% to 75% of free cash flow to shareholders and now expect to be at the higher end of that range for fiscal year '20. 
So overall, we continued to make progress against our strategic priorities within an uneven environment and introduced new challenges this quarter. We're taking the appropriate actions to navigate the near-term uncertainty while executing against our vision and strategy that is clearly resonating with customers. We will continue to shift our portfolio to higher-margin, software-defined solutions and focus on delivering our edge-to-cloud platform, offering our full portfolio as a service by 2022. This will ultimately drive sustainable, profitable growth and shareholder returns for the long term. 
Now with that, let's open it up for questions. Thank you."

With respect to how much those short-term disruptions have accounted for our revenue performance, I would say quite a lot. There are 3 things that affected our revenue performance. These are the macro environment softness; the second thing is supply chain constraints; and the third one is also the manufacturing node consolidation in North America. We've taken steps to address what's under our control. Nonetheless, coronavirus has affected the tail end of the quarter and injected a new degree of uncertainty. And when you look at the revenue performance of the company, most of the decline came in the Compute category that we refer to in our new segmentation, and that decline has a lot to do with what you referred to from a supply chain standpoint."

I just would like to add to Tarek that we feel pretty good about the recovery and the node consolidation that's under our control. All the other factors, Tarek explained very well. In terms of when you think about investment long term, we have been very clear where we want to invest. 
The investment, obviously, is in Intelligent Edge. We see that as the next frontier, big opportunity for us. We continue to do so. And I have to say I'm incredibly pleased with the Q1 performance because we said that business will return to growth, and we show -- we demonstrated that's the case. We outperformed the market and every single competitor there. And we are very, very pleased with the differentiation we have in that portfolio with higher margins. So for us, that's one area of investment. 
Much of that growth has happened organically. But we always look for would it make sense for us in terms of accretive addition in terms of intellectual property and talent, right, that we want to continue to expand that set of experience we delivered at the edge? And as I said in my opening remarks, we are on a journey to integrate 5G and mobile edge computing on a very robust cloud-based solution called HP Aruba Central, which is all subscription-based, and obviously, we can deliver that through GreenLake. 
Obviously, the other piece of this is what I call intellectual property to make our core business stronger. And that's all software-defined at the core with some additional, call it, intellectual property in the silicon space. That's what the core of the Cray acquisition was all about. The Cray acquisition is all about software in a cloud-native environment to run these big data-intensive workloads, and silicon was all about that. 
And as I think about the pivot to as a service, also, we're looking for software that will make our as a service experience unique and differentiated in a true edge-to-cloud platform. And as I announced in my remarks, we introduced 2 key platforms: one is HPE GreenLake Central, which is the console, the control point for managing and deploying workloads at the edge, in the core on-/off-premises, so we've added managed services layer on top of that; and then the container platform, which is a true cloud-native environment where you can run both legacy and cloud-based workloads. 
So those are the things we are doing. But I just want to emphasize we have a very stringent, rigorous process here on return on invested capital. And I see as an -- M&A as 1 of the 3 levers to drive innovation: organic is one aspect; partnership is the other one; and inorganic. And I say that the last 15 acquisitions have been part of it, has been always in that vein. And that's our goal."

Well, first, as we already flagged, the health and safety of our employees, customers and partners is our priority. And you know that out of abundance of caution for them, we've made the decision to cancel or postpone most of the HPE-sponsored events through April. 
Unfortunately, this is also causing supply and demand disruptions and affecting our revenue profile. The outbreak at the end of January started to impact component manufacturing and resulted in constrained supply and higher quarter-end backlog worldwide, and we have been in constant contact with our suppliers and are establishing specific mitigation and recovery plans. So this is affecting our revenue profile for the full year. This is why we're not guiding in the short term. And relative to what we said at SAM, where we were experiencing -- we're thinking we would be returning to growth in fiscal year '20, I don't think that it is likely at this stage that we'll grow in fiscal year '20 as a whole for the fiscal year. But we do anticipate recovery of those supply chain constraints over time and face easier comps during the course of the year."

We have a daily process with each of our suppliers that we manage very, very tightly. And some of those suppliers are dependent on other suppliers because, as you can imagine, the supply chain is a little bit longer with Tier 2, Tier 3 suppliers that provide what I call low-level components to build what I call the printed circuit boards or the PCAs or the PCBAs, and that's a challenge we see today. And we see recovery, but obviously, it's going to take time. And that's why Tarek said we cannot provide right now a definite guidance. I think it would be not appropriate. And that's why we felt prudent not to provide Q2 but because the recovery is going to happen through the year that we felt comfortable reaffirming the 2020 guidance. 
Remember, when we went to the Security Analyst Meeting in October, we said that we expect to grow the company on a 3-year basis long-term plan of 1% to 3%. I think that piece is still complete and intact because, as you can see, as we pivot the portfolio to higher value and higher margins, at the same time, the pivot to as a service, which is going extremely well, and then obviously that Intelligent Edge business growing, that's how we think about the long-term growth in the right margin profile. 
Obviously, the Compute at this point in time was the challenge short term. I don't think it was off compared to some of our peers. In fact, in some cases, we did better than our peers. But that was a disappointment. And obviously, we need to stabilize and manage it through the supply chain recovery."

And so that's true for Compute and as well a carryover for high-performance compute, which, at the core of that product, Toni, is the legacy HPE Apollo. So we entered Q2 with a higher elevated backlog that we have seen. 
I don't see yet -- let me qualify this. Outside China, I haven't seen yet a significant impact on demand so far. Definitely, in China, as you know, we have a different setup with our H3C partnership there, and you should expect a short-term impact in China. But right now, they are working through it. But I will say, right now, we haven't seen a significant impact. If anything, actually, it creates short-term opportunities. I can tell you because of the coronavirus, we see customers coming to us and saying, ""Can you ship this product to take care of the fact that my employees are not going to be at work."" We see some demand in specific areas of workload-optimized solutions. 
And as I said in my opening remarks, we do have as awarded business, which, obviously, we have to build and ship more than $2 billion in HPC business that we have to ship over the next several quarters in the next 2 years.

But think about the last 9 quarters, Toni, and think about the gross margin expansion and EPS expansion we have had. It's pretty remarkable. I mean, in the last 2 years, we expanded the margins every single quarter, and we have expanded EPS every single quarter. So my vantage point, we have done the right things. We have made the company leaner, meaner, and at the same time, we have taken big, big, big challenges, and we have managed it through. So I think, for us, is to continue to focus on the areas where we see the opportunity to compete and win in higher margins, but obviously, the stock also is thinking about long-term growth, and I understand that. And obviously, a big component of that is our Compute business. But in the end, I think the stock is heavily discounted, and I'm disappointed in that. 
On the M&A, we have been very clear since day 1 that we look at assets that they are accessible, that generally are accretive or we can manage the dilution very quickly. But ultimately, it has to have strategic fit in the context of our strategy, obviously, whether it's the edge-to-cloud architecture and pivoting to as a service. I think the assets we have acquired makes complete sense from that vantage point, and we have delivered strong results. Size is important, but I will say it's more strategic fit and obviously the return on that investment capital, which we have incredible strong discipline and where we have demonstrated that over the last 2 years. 
And so maybe I will go pass it now to Tarek because you asked the question about taking debt and buying stock and so forth."

And if you look at our HPC & MCS business and the $2 billion of backlog contracted revenues that would come in, what's the value of that? And then you have to look at other players in the sector and compare our Compute business to them and see that also for those players, the Compute business is valued negatively from an equity standpoint. But it does generate cash, and we have to figure that out. 
Finally, let me finish by saying H3C, the put option, what's the value of that? It's a listed company, and it's pretty substantial. So I'll let you conclude whether the stock is beaten down or not and how much it's beaten down. And you probably, in your own question, you have the answer.

Now coming back on to your question with respect to aggressive buybacks, we did in the past 2 years execute a $7 billion capital return program to shareholders. We returned $2.9 billion by way of dividends and $4.1 billion by way of buybacks. And what we did flag at SAM is the fact that we are going to continue to return capital to shareholders in line with our free cash flow generation capacity. We're not going to deviate from this because it's important that we continue to think about the long-term value of those businesses, and each one of those businesses has its own investment profile and needs to be therefore catered for."

Specifically to HPE Next, we are continuing the implementation of the program in that context where we have to align our cost structure to the new business climate that exists. We're not announcing a new restructuring plan, and what is happening is that through the implementation of the new segmentation, we have identified new savings opportunities in each of the businesses, and we'll continue to streamline our operations in that context."

And I will say, for the vast majority, everything was executed flawlessly, and we have delivered the results of the gross margin expansion you see. As we implemented this new segmentation, now we can see through even better visibility on what else we can go do. And as Tarek just said it, right, the reality is you never stop focusing on improving your operations. And because HPE Next actually at the core was a cultural transformation, it gave us the ability now to take further actions, which are actually, I will argue, timely considering the uncertainty we live in. But it's to do the hard things now as these things recover to come on the other end even stronger than before. 
On the short-term actions, I think, first, we have to protect our employees, first and foremost. I think it's important, and that was the first step. And then, obviously, that comes with the benefits from the savings, but I want to be clear, this is all about protecting our employees to make sure they don't get exposed for things they don't need to."

But in general, I will say it's progressed every single day, and whether it's people coming online or people improving the output of whatever we're already doing. And so that's progressing. 
And so you have to take it day by day. And obviously, what we're doing is, because we have a global supply chain here, is China is one aspect, but also how we manage inventory and how we manage the distribution of those orders in a way we can maximize the return while these things gets back to normal. 
That's how we are managing. And to be honest, we have a very stringent process with war rooms and talking to suppliers every single day. I personally have talked to at least 50 of them myself and have direct contact with each of them."

This year, we have attained the point where our cash conversion cycle is negative. And whilst we do deliver the EPS guide, and we confirmed it for Antonio, the drop in revenue will inevitably have a drag on the free cash flow generation. That is because we have a negative free cash flow cycle. 
So the way cash tracks earnings is a combination of what happens in the P&L at EPS level but also the working capital component that comes with the P&L and the revenue from the accounts receivables side and also the fact that we need to build inventory to be able to cater for the supply chain shortages that we explained.

That is continuing right now as we speak. We feel pretty good about that. Much of the supply chain is not gated in China for the Intelligent Edge, so that's a positive news. Then, obviously, on high-performance computing, that demand continues to be solid, and we have a very interesting pipeline ahead of us with a unique, differentiated portfolio. So the need for processing data through AI, machine learning, big data-intensive workloads continue to be very high. That's not stopping. 
As we think about these new storage platforms, particularly what I call Intelligent Data platform, the data growth requires that the data gets stored and gets managed and ultimately insights are extracted from it. So that's positive as well. 
Right now, as I said earlier, as we enter Q2, we enter with a sizable backlog because we couldn't ship it in Q1 everything we wanted. And at the same time, we haven't seen yet outside China a significant impact. But obviously, as we think about the second -- back of the year here, obviously, we expect to -- things to return to a level of normalcy that eventually will allow us to continue to progress against that. That's how I see it right now. And because of everything we do, both from a mix perspective, with the pivot to, obviously, as a service, which is a long-term opportunity and growing, and the fact we're taking our own actions here with HPE Next and other ones, that's where, at this point in time, we felt comfortable in affirming the original guidance that we provided here on EPS.

Sorry, I had a problem with my phone. So thanks, Sonalee. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today and I hope everyone is safe and healthy. Our fiscal Q2 results represent a full quarter of operating during the coronavirus-",1858,"Yes, thank you. Sorry, I had a problem with my phone. So thanks, Sonalee. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today and I hope everyone is safe and healthy. Our fiscal Q2 results represent a full quarter of operating during the coronavirus-19 (sic) [ COVID-19 ] crisis. This pandemic is unlike any other crisis we faced and it has brought significant economic disruption. Businesses and communities are struggling. Supply chain productivity continues to be significantly constrained and the demand environment is uneven. 
The market for capabilities like remote connectivity and virtual desktop solutions is stronger than pre-crisis in certain segments, and we are well positioned in those areas. But overall, customers are understandably cautious, given so much uncertainty. These dynamics had a significant impact on our financial performance this quarter, given the economic lockdowns since February. Our overall Q2 revenue declined by 15% to $6 billion, which led to a 42% decline in our non-GAAP operating profit. 
This was a tough quarter by every measure, and I am, of course, disappointed in the results, but I do not view our Q2 performance as a reflection of our capabilities nor of the opportunity ahead of us. Through this unsettling time, I have been really proud of our response that is aligned to our purpose to advance the way people live and work. We consider it our responsibility to help the world navigate this pandemic. We have prioritized protecting the health and safety of our team members and supporting our customers and partners as we weather this storm together. 
At the outset, we moved quickly to mobilize crisis management teams around the world. We took decisive steps to ensure our team members' safety and well-being. We closed all of our sites and rapidly moved team members to work from home except for those who are performing mission-critical roles. We expanded team members' benefits to cover coronavirus-19 (sic) [ COVID-19 ] testing and treatment, enhanced mental health support and provided tools and resources to keep people connected and productive. 
We also responded with important initiatives to address key needs created by the pandemic. We made substantial donations through HPE's foundation and designated $2 billion in financing through HP Financial Services to our customers and partners with financial hardships. Our Aruba networking capabilities have been deployed in drive-up and virtual health care clinics and in schools that are facilitating distance learning. And our high-performance computing solutions are helping scientists and leading research institutions speed up the discovery with complex modeling, simulation, AI and machine learning capabilities. 
We joined forces with the U.S. government and other high-tech companies to form the White House High Performance Computing Consortium, giving coronavirus-19 (sic) [ COVID-19 ] researchers access to HPC resources. HPE also signed the Open COVID pledge, granting free access to all of our patented technologies for the purpose of diagnosing, preventing and treating the virus. We have also adapted to deliver much needed capabilities and experiences to aid our customers' transformations as they navigate this difficult time. Through an improved sales coverage model aligned to market segments, our Intelligent Edge business continued to outperform the market while expanding operating margins and demonstrated 12% year-over-year growth in North America. 
In addition, we gained traction in our HPE GreenLake business. We continue to see acceleration in this very profitable strategic business and are seeing larger deals come in, underscoring a growing interest in our as-a-service offerings. In fact, our annualized revenue run rate or ARR increased 17% to $520 million. While these are healthy signs of the needs our customers will continue to have coming out of the crisis, there continue to be significant supply constraints and delays in customer acceptance. This has impacted our ability to make deliveries to our customers. Across our portfolio, we exited Q2 with more than $1.5 billion in backlog in Compute, Storage, HPC and Mission-Critical Systems as well Aruba, which represents 2x the historical backlog. Our team is doing everything we can to deliver on these customer orders. 
Tarek will take you through our Q2 results in more detail. But before he does that, I want to take the time to align actions we will take to address the near-term uncertainty and ensure HPE is well positioned to emerge stronger, more agile and digitally enabled for a post coronavirus-19 world. While the world has started to envision what a recovery might look like, we need to be prepared for different scenarios. We know there is no going back to what used to be. There is only preparing for and building what comes next. We need to adapt in order to keep our strategic momentum even as the world has changed dramatically. We are taking a deliberate set of actions to protect our financial foundation, become a more agile organization and align our resources to critical core businesses in areas of growth that accelerate our [indiscernible] cloud Platform as a Service strategy. 
We continue to analyze financial forecasts and customer trends to better understand when and how global economies will recover. In the meantime, we are taking some immediate steps to reduce operating expenses that will protect our financial profile. Effective July 1, we will implement a short-term pay reduction for all team members, where it is legally permitted, through October 31, 2020. My executive team and I will take the highest percentage reduction. Beyond us, the amount of reduction will vary by level. For team members who live in countries where pay reductions cannot be mandatory due to local laws and regulations, we are implementing unpaid leaves. 
In addition, we have implemented cost containment measures across the company, restricted external hiring through the end of our fiscal year and put salary increases on hold. Additionally, our Board of Directors have voluntary decided to forgo a percentage of its cash compensation for the remainder of the fiscal year 2020 to demonstrate its commitment to Hewlett Packard Enterprise, as we focus on preserving liquidity and improve our position to deliver for our customers now and in the future. 
In addition to those short-term measures, today, we are announcing a cost optimization and prioritization plan. This plan will help us focus our investments and realign our workforce to aid growth that will accelerate our strategy. Some of the measures in the plan include continue to streamline our product portfolio, implementing new digital customer engagement models and optimizing our workplace size strategy and experiences. HP expects the plan will be implemented through fiscal year 2022. And as a result of the changes to the company's workforce, real estate model and further business process improvements, we estimate gross savings of at least $1 billion and annualized net run rate savings of at least $800 million by fiscal year '22 year-end. 
In order to achieve this level of cost savings, HPE estimates cash funding payments between $1 billion to $1.3 billion over the next 3 years. Tarek will provide further details in his remarks. While we take the steps to secure our financial foundation and strengthen our operations, we have simplified our operating model and have aligned them to the financial segmentation we introduced early this year. Each of HPE's businesses is critical to our go-forward success. Each carries an important part of the mission. And as our customers demand new and different products and services from us, we must deliver. I am personally committed to delivering to help each of our businesses leverage its existing strengths and evolve. Each of our business groups now report directly to me. 
As part of the new organizational model, we created a GreenLake Cloud Services Group to accelerate our as-a-service capabilities. We also added a new software team that will architect our software strategy and portfolio that power our as-a-service platform. This new structure will provide further accountability and improve our execution and transformation. 
As the world emerges from the global pandemic, business continuity will depend on solutions that advance IT resiliency, empower remote workforces securely, extend connectivity, reinvigorate customer engagement and enable business model evolution. These realities means that the digital transformation will be more critical than ever. This is why we must accelerate our strategy to deliver everything as-a-service edge to cloud. 
We see that the growth in the cloud, on and off premises and increasingly at the edge where we are uniquely positioned. The edge customers need persistent connectivity to bridge the digital and physical worlds. HP Aruba Central is at the core of our edge strategy. It is the only cloud-native, simple-to-use and secure platform that unifies network management for wired, wireless and WAN networks and soon, 5G and edge computing. In Q2, the number of unique customers using Aruba Central increased to 65,000. 
Customers will also continue to need capabilities that harness the power of their data, wherever it lives, at the edge, across public and private clouds, in colocations or in the traditional data center. We continue to believe the cloud is an experience, not a destination. And as-a-service business models will extend the cloud experience everywhere for all apps and data. 
Early this month, we announced the general availability of HP GreenLake Central, our advanced cloud-native platform that provides customers with a consistent cloud experience for all their applications and data. Through underlying operations consoles, the, manages and optimizes their entire hybrid cloud estate. And in Q2, we made HP container platform generally available. Our new cloud-native software-defined stack is built using technologies from HPE's acquisition of Blue Data, Storage and MapR and deliver greater flexibility and lower cost for Kubernetes deployments of cloud-native and non-cloud-native applications with persistent storage connectivity. 
Next month at our first-ever Discover Virtual Experience, we will showcase how HPE will help organizations ensure seamless business continuity through new technology capabilities, greater business intelligence and enhanced financial flexibility. Joined by thousands of customers and partners, we will discuss how we should think differently about transformation in the future, and we'll introduce new innovation to bring agility to customers' apps and data everywhere. 
There is a great promise in what we can accomplish when we increase the speed of innovation and continue to bring to market differentiated capabilities from edge to cloud. Our customers, partners and communities need what HP can provide. Our ability to execute our strategic to offering our entire portfolio as a service by 2022 while we continue to rearchitect and strengthen our core businesses is critical. As we drive increased performance in our core businesses, we will be able to further align resources to new growth segments that will accelerate our strategy and pave the way to sustainable, profitable growth. 
One of our core beliefs at HPE is the power of yes, we can, and I'm confident in our ability to execute because I believe we have the right strategy, the right leadership team and the right mindset to adapt and deliver in bold new ways. We are focused and we are making the necessary trade-offs so we can continue to invest in the future. We are undertaking it with a sense of urgency and conviction in our strategy. With that, let me turn it to Tarek to review the quarter's results. Tarek?"

I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2020. As I have done before, I'll be referencing the slides from our earnings presentation to highlight our performance in the quarter. Also please note, since last quarter, we are now reporting results according to our new segmentation. 
Antonio discussed some of the key highlights of this quarter on Slide 1. Now let me discuss our financial performance, starting Slide 2. Our Q2 results were heavily impacted by the global COVID-19 crisis. As Antonio mentioned, our Q2 represented a full quarter of operating under COVID-19. Our revenues of $6 billion were down 15% year-over-year, primarily driven by supply chain disruption, which resulted in significantly higher levels of backlog, particularly in Compute, HPC, MCS and Storage. We also saw uneven demand, with customers pushing out business activity as they navigated through the current economic crisis and lockdown. 
At the edge, the market for capabilities like remote cloud connectivity and virtual desktop solutions was stronger than precrisis in certain segments, and we're well positioned in those areas, offsetting the decline in campus switching that resulted from lower business activity. Despite the challenging backdrop, we managed to maintain relatively stable non-GAAP gross margins, which were down by 20 basis points year-over-year. 
Our non-GAAP operating profit, however, was down 42% year-over-year to 6.1% in operating margin terms and our non-GAAP EPS of $0.22 was down 48% year-over-year. Our GAAP EPS was a loss of $0.64, primarily due to an $865 million noncash goodwill impairment charge associated with legacy goodwill allocated to the HPC and MCS business segment, which impacted GAAP net EPS by $0.67. This impairment was not driven by the Cray business, which continues to perform consistent with our expectations. 
Cash flow from operations this quarter was $100 million, impacted by reduced profitability and inventory buildup. Free cash flow was negative $402 million compared to a positive $402 million for the prior year period, which was impacted by higher financing volumes. Taking all the previous into account, we're taking decisive and prudent actions to manage our costs and expenses, further improve our liquidity and focus on opportunities to emerge stronger in the post COVID-19 world. 
Turning to Slide 3. Antonio outlined for you some of the near-term cost takeout measures we're implementing, including reductions in pay across our workforce, unpaid leave in places where pay reductions are not legally permitted and hiring restrictions. He also mentioned the actions we're committing to today to further strengthen our financial profile in the medium and long term and accelerate our strategy. Today, we are announcing a cost optimization and prioritization plan to reflect the current revenue environment and to position ourselves as a more resilient company, ready to address the needs of our customers in a post COVID-19 world. We remain confident that we have the right strategy and are taking the right actions to secure our financial foundation and support our path to sustainable, profitable growth. 
More specifically, our plan is designed to rightsize our cost structure to the new normal, to allocate resources in alignment with our new segmentation and growth areas, to drive increased efficiencies through investment in digitalization and automation, and finally, to accelerate our pivot to as-a-service to drive long-term sustainable profitable growth. Overall, these new cost efficiencies will be captured from simplifying and evolving our product portfolio strategy and go-to-market, cost savings from supply chain optimization, increased penetration of remote customer support, new initiatives to leverage digital marketing and consolidating our real estate footprint. 
In terms of a time line, we expect that the plan will be implemented through fiscal year 2022 and estimate that it will deliver annualized net run rate savings of at least $800 million by fiscal year '22 end. Having said that, we expect to achieve the majority of the savings by the end of fiscal year '21. In order to achieve this level of cost savings, we estimate cumulative cash funding payments of between $1 billion to $1.3 billion over the next 3 years. 
We'll now move to Slide 4 that shows our performance in the quarter in accordance with our new segmentation. Let me hit a few key points. In the Intelligent Edge segment, we declined 2%. However, we saw over 12% year-over-year growth in North America, showing that the changes we made to our North America sales leadership and go-to-market segmentation are paying off, even in the midst of a challenging business environment. While campus switching declined single digits due to increased emphasis on working from home, we grew the wireless line product business 7% year-over-year due to high demand for our remote access solutions and Wi-Fi 6 Certified access points with 35% year-over-year growth in North America. 
Furthermore, we expanded gross margins and also grew operating margins by 570 basis points year-over-year to 11%. The bottom line is that we gained share in both campus switching and wireless markets while significantly improving profit margins. In Compute, revenue declined 19% this quarter, driven by lower conversion rates, even as order backlog grew to 2x our average historical backlog and lower unit growth, which was negative double digits this quarter. Our ability to fulfill orders was impacted by component shortages, with supply chain logistics further disrupting our ability to fulfill demand due to the coronavirus pandemic. As the supply chain constraints alleviate, we expect to execute against our high backlog. 
In High Performance Compute and Mission-Critical Systems, revenue declined 18%, primarily as a result of delayed installation and customer acceptance on account of COVID-19. Similar to Compute, this resulted in an elevated backlog, but we expect to see a stronger uptick in revenues in the second half of the year as we execute against the order book. Our HPC business has been actively involved in COVID-related research activity and is providing COVID-19 researchers worldwide with access to the world's most powerful HPC resources to advance the pace of scientific discovery in the fight to stop the virus. Furthermore, we announced the 2023 delivery of the world's fastest Exascale Supercomputer, El Capitan for the United States Department of Energy at a record-breaking speed of 2 exaflops, 10x faster than today's most powerful supercomputer. 
Most importantly, the Cray integration remains on track to deliver the FY '20 revenue targets and triple-digit run rate synergies by fiscal year '21. Within Storage, we declined 16% year-over-year due to higher backlog similar to Compute but had notable strength in big data showing a growth of 61% year-over-year. Nimble services revenues grew 20% year-over-year, with services intensity at record highs as customers add high-margin value-added services. 
For operational services, which is included across Compute, HPC, MCS and Storage, revenue declined by less than 1% year-over-year while orders were down 5% year-over-year, driven by the drop in Compute units. On the positive side, our services intensity, which is the ratio of attach revenue per hardware unit sold, continued to be strong with double-digit growth in storage and HPC MCS services driven by Cray. This demonstrates that the underlying profitability of the units we sell and the attach rates continues to be robust. 
In Advisory & Professional Services, revenue was down 8% but we significantly improved operating margins by 6.2 points year-over-year due to our reentry in select countries, combined with an increase in remote delivery of projects from 65% to 90%, which helped to control costs and drive an improvement in chargeability levels of staff. Within HPE Financial Services, financing volume grew 10% year-over-year despite the impact of COVID-19, and our net portfolio of assets was up 4% this quarter with longer contract terms supporting GreenLake. 
We maintained a solid return on equity of approximately 15% again this quarter. Our bad debt loss ratio this quarter was 0.5%, which is best-in-class in this industry. We'll obviously continue to closely monitor the impairment losses as liquidity constraints could affect some of our customers' ability to pay in upcoming quarters. We will tighten our underwriting guidelines as necessary to ensure we can manage through this crisis and any impairment losses remain within our level of confidence. 
Our Communications and Media Solutions business that is included in our Corporate Investment segment is a strategically important business to us, providing software and services capabilities to telco service providers. CMS is showing improved momentum. We saw strong double-digit software order growth, with EMEA growing 45% and Japan growing 70% this quarter. Revenue gained momentum, growing 2% sequentially. We also expanded operating margins by 170 basis points year-over-year this quarter. We also recorded our first 5G core win with a Tier 1 carrier in the United States. The strategic win validates our 5G strategy with multi-vendor integration and true cloud-native telco network solutions. 
Slide 5 shows our growing ARR profile I introduced at our Securities Analyst meeting in October 2019. I'm pleased to report that our Q2 '20 ARR came in at $520 million, representing 17% year-over-year growth and in line with our expectations. Our HPE Aruba Central SaaS platform continued to grow revenue triple digits year-over-year this quarter. As we progress towards building our go-to-market as a service motion and remain focused on offering a full suite of differentiated solutions that can be consumed as a service, we are reiterating our ARR growth guidance of 30% to 40% compounded annual growth rate from FY '19 to FY '22. 
Slide 6 highlights our EPS performance to date. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.22 in Q2, with headwinds from reduced operating leverage, suspension of our share buybacks and a lower but expected contribution from OI&E. Consistent with our guidance at SAM, we expect OI&E to be approximately negative $100 million for fiscal year '20. 
Turning to gross margin on Slide 7. We delivered non-GAAP gross margin of 32% in Q2 of fiscal year '20, which was down 20% -- which was down, excuse me, 20 basis points year-over-year. Commodity costs were a tailwind to gross margin this quarter, even as the supply-demand balance turned into a more inflationary commodities environment at the start of the quarter. 
Moving to Slide 8. Non-GAAP operating margin was 6.1% in Q2 of fiscal year '20, and non-GAAP operating income was down 42% year-over-year. This clearly demonstrates the imperative to rightsize our business to reflect the new revenue profile we are facing as a result of the COVID-19 impact. 
Turning to Slide 9. Our cash flow from operations was $100 million, impacted by reduced profitability from the Compute and Storage businesses, which were heavily impacted this quarter and higher than normal working capital. Free cash flow was a use of $402 million for the quarter, driven by year-over-year growth, which was impacted by financing volumes. Higher-than-normal backlog and resulting inventory buildup triggered a reduction in our cash conversion cycle from minus 17 days in the prior quarter to minus 5 days this quarter. We expect our cash conversion cycle to improve through the rest of the year as we execute against the backlog and supply chain constraints alleviate, both of which help us reduce our high inventory levels. 
Now moving on to Slide 10. I want to spend a moment on the strength of our balance sheet and investment-grade credit rating, which is a competitive advantage in this environment. As of our April 30 quarter end, we had approximately $5.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents, having successfully raised $2.25 billion in senior notes in April 2020 at a low cost of capital. We also have an undrawn revolving credit facility of $4.75 billion at our disposal, so in total, we have approximately $10 billion of liquidity. 
We remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade rating, which was reaffirmed by the rating agencies in April 2020. Bottom line, we have a strong cash position and ample credit available during these uncertain times to support and invest in our business. 
Let me recap for you our key takeaways for this quarter on Slide 11. But before I do that, it's worth spending a couple of minutes on capital allocation. In Q2, we returned $305 million to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. We repurchased $151 million in shares and paid a cash dividend of $154 million. In April 2020, we took the decision to suspend share buybacks in the light of the current environment where liquidity is of paramount importance. Subsequently, in April, we announced a regular dividend payment for Q3 '20 payable in July. 
Finally, let me summarize the key takeaway for you this quarter. Our fiscal Q2 results represent a full quarter of operating under the COVID-19 crisis and were heavily impacted by the crisis, both on the demand and supply side. As a result, we have enacted short-term actions and long-term cost optimization and prioritization plans to reflect the current revenue environment and to position ourselves as a more resilient company in a post COVID world. 
Our robust balance sheet with approximately $10 billion of liquidity and investment-grade credit rating gives us flexibility not only to weather the current storm but to continue to invest in key growth initiatives. We remain confident that we have the right strategy and are taking the right actions to secure our financial foundation and support our path to sustainable, profitable growth. 
Now turning to outlook. Since the crisis began, we've been stress testing our model and running scenarios based on various assumptions, just like everybody else does. Given the level of uncertainty around the duration of the crisis and the rate and the shape of the recovery, there's a wide range of possible outcomes for the year. We have taken prudent and decisive steps, with the latest being our cost optimization and prioritization plan so that we are prepared for the different outcomes. Due to the uncertainty and consistent with our April 6, 2020 8-K filing, where we withdrew our fiscal year '20 financial guidance, we will not be providing any Q3 or fiscal year '20 guidance. Now with that, let me hand over to Antonio and open it up for questions. Antonio?"

And then just related to that, you specifically said that the HPC business and conversion rates would tick up in the second half, but you stopped short of giving a similar time line for Compute and Storage. So just any color as to when you think orders will begin to convert in those 2 segments as well?"
273983758,667013396,1995236,"Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, May 21, 2020",2020-05-21,"Earnings Calls","Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company","Executives","Yes, Katy, and thanks for the question. So the order intake or what I referred as the order linearity, was fairly steady, I have to say. We normally plan a quarter in 13 weeks. The first week is the previous backlog from the previous quarter. The backlog",494,"Yes, Katy, and thanks for the question. So the order intake or what I referred as the order linearity, was fairly steady, I have to say. We normally plan a quarter in 13 weeks. The first week is the previous backlog from the previous quarter. The backlog from the previous quarter and then 12 weeks, right? And we plan the linearity early on, and I will say we had or exceeded our order linearity intake every week of the quarter. And so this really came down to our ability to convert the order book into revenue. 
And in the case of HPC, High Performance Compute, let me remind everyone that in order for us to convert that order into revenue, we have to build it, obviously. We have to ship it. But we have to install it and we have to turn it on. And once the customer accepts that installation, which in many cases, is very large installations, you're talking about a number of clusters, that's when only we can recognize revenue. And so the impact on HPC was twofold, was not been able to go to customer sites because customers were locked down like we are, and be able to install and deliver and turn it on. And obviously, the same challenge we had in Compute and Storage, with supply chain constraints in capacity because of the social distancing, and obviously, in the components level that we saw, obviously, a major disruption. 
And as a reminder, we ship pretty much 3 servers every minute. And so when the supply chain stops, it's pretty significant. So in terms of going forward, our priority 1, 2 and 3 continues to be clear the backlog. And that's how I think about it. Throughout Q2, we made progress in the recovery. I will say China is pretty much back to normal. But obviously, they are cleaning the backlog themselves because they had to first recover the labor. And then obviously, the the pen also on sub-suppliers for the components, think about cables, connectors, transistors, you name it. And so for us, the majority of backlog right now is in the bucket. 
And then in the regional factories, for the vast majority are all performing at capacity, except 1 or 2 where the rules and the regulations or the shelter-in-place are demanding that there is a stringent process on social distancing, which obviously impact the capacity in the factory lines. But the factors are all up and running. So I am optimistic about the weeks to come so I'll take this a week at the time. Obviously, we continue to focus on the order intake. I cannot comment in May because I think you asked the question on May because we are in Q3 right now. But in Q2, the ordinary was fairly steady. And we expect not just HPC, but computer storage to continue to make progress, and that's why Q3 will be different in Q2."

Thanks, Wamsi. Great question. So you mentioned HPE Next, let me start with that. I mean, I was the architect of HPE next. In the 2017 year, as you know, we launched it in the fall of 2017.

In the 2017 year, as you know, we launched it in the fall of 2017. I will say, HPE Next was a great success story because it allow us to rearchitect the company in the key areas in terms of simplification of processes, streamlining our go-to-market model. Remember, we went from a worldwide geo to country to more a geomodel where we remove layers. And honestly, it allow us to reinvest back in innovation, and that's where I announced the investment of $4 billion at the edge and now we start seeing the results of that, with great numbers despite the challenges. 
So that was a success. And remember, we committed to deliver $800 million in net savings and which we did and we did ahead of schedule. Now to your point, this is a crisis unlike anyone we have faced. And I will say, 2017, I said, listen, we don't envision another cost optimization plan but this is a cost optimization driven by the pandemic. But honestly, I see an opportunity to go faster in our pivot to our strategy, which is to offer everything as a service. It is very unfortunate that we have this pandemic, which is causing tremendous economic disruption and obviously, a huge impact to communities. 
But from the business perspective, we are more convicted than ever in our strategy and we see it, the demand for pervasive ubiquity connectivity. That's why the access points are very strong for us. All cloud -- the cloud experience deployed everywhere from the edge-to-cloud and the ability to consume it as a service, and this is where we see tremendous momentum with HP GreenLake. 
So for me is rightsize our cost structure, do new normal. And we don't know exactly what the new normal is at this point in time because we don't know what the recovery looks like. It's about allocating resources for the areas of growth we see in the future and also, increase efficiency because we learn a lot. Remember, in Q1, I talked about it. We learned quite a lot and we extended the HPE Next, which is now part of this cost optimization and prioritization plan and digitize everything. 
I believe this will cause incredible structural impacts in the way people are going to work. And my expectation is at least 50% of our employees will never come back to an office. And the office will look completely different, which means our offices will be more center of innovation and collaboration, not where you come to do your regular work every day. And that requires a resizing our real estate footprint. But even if you resize the footprint, also require new experiences and therefore investment associated with that. But when you bring it all together and they need to reskill and upskill and allocate resources in the right place, I believe we have an opportunity to accelerate that strategy and drive to that long-term sustainable profitable growth."

Definitely was a supply chain-driven, although demand continued to be uneven, as we discussed before, particularly in Compute. I would say you have to look at it this way. The shortfall on the revenue is pretty much all supply chain-driven because I made the comment early on that our linearity in the order intake was pretty steady. But in that arena, you have to look at the customer segments. Obviously, when you sell to, I call it, cloud companies, which are more software companies that deliver their value through the cloud, those will continue to be steady. 
If you think about enterprise, I will say, those were pretty steady. SMB obviously was the biggest challenge in the transactional business because fundamentally, that segment of the market was significantly disruptive. As I think about the future, right, obviously, we already were under a macro situation. But let's remind ourselves that the compute platform go through an innovation cycle themselves even though it's commoditized. 
And as I think about the Gen10, you remember the Gen10, we actually told everyone that we said that 2/3 of the structural change was permanent because of the ability to attach richer configuration. As we go to what we call Gen10.5 and Gen11, which is happening in the next 18 months, you're going to see more than that. You're going to see, again, the same cycle where the density of these products, the amount of memory and storage you can put inside this compute platform, will continue to increase. And that's good for us because obviously, it drives AOP. But right now, our focus is really around clear the backlog, both on the compute side and on the HPC side, both finish installation and obviously clear the backlog there as well."

The only thing I will say is that definitely, the vast majority was supply chain. And as I said in my earlier comment in the previous question, there was some demand, obviously, but particularly in SMB and some elements of the mid-market, where enterprise was a little more steady. And we saw [ uptake ] demand, for example, that consumes Compute, for example, in solutions like VDI, which was in high demand or even big data storage, which at the end, truly is a Compute platform with a lot of hard disk attached to it or SSDs attached to it. 
So in that context, you're asking absolutely the right question, and this is what I'm manically focused with the team, and which, as I said, my priority 1, 2 and 3 is clear the backlog. And as I said earlier, we focused the quarter in 13 weeks where we enter the backlog, which was the $1.5 billion on May 1. And what we're going to exit on July 31 as the new orders come in because fundamentally, we expect the orders to come in, and we have a linearity plan associated with that recovery. 
So I feel pretty optimistic about it. But however, it's going to come down to our ability to get the supply in the right place and ability to execute in the cycle times that we need. And obviously, as you know, we have a very global diversified supply chain, and we have made some series of moves to move products built around the globe, even if they are for other regions so we can accelerate that backlog. And so this is going to be the name of the game. But generally, as I think about the last 4 weeks and I think about the next 4 weeks and then the next 4 weeks after that, we continue to see progress. 
But there's a lot of things. Who knows, there is a restart of coronavirus. I'm more concerned right now, Toni, to be honest with you, if something happened in one of these locations where we have the factory and you go into a resheltering of the social distances, that could have an impact. In terms of the velocity behind with components from China, I will say that's for the vast majority is going absolutely in the right direction. And obviously, the logistics side, as we reopen countries and flights across the globe, that will help as well."

There wouldn't be another HPE Next. You felt you were in the right place on cost. You said last quarter, you were doing a little bit more on cost but it wasn't structural, it wasn't another HPE Next. And now you are undertaking a significant multiyear structural change. And A, that doesn't feel consistent with the statement that this was really a supply issue. And B, it makes me wonder, like, are you more worried about your competitive position? Or are you worried that the IT environment is going to be weaker for a while?"

So my remarks about what happened in Q2 was about the supply chain and lesser so on the demand. I cannot forecast right now what the demand is on the back end, and this is where in our remarks, we said we are looking at the pipeline, we are looking at the economic indicators, which obviously all of you provide and others. And so I would not make any further comment because on the demand in, I don't know, in October or November, I don't know what that would look like. But I'm just replying to your question about what happened in Q2 definitely was based on the order intake we had, it was -- the vast majority was a supply chain problem. And there were pockets of uneven demand, which obviously were accentuated in the SMB space, which was quite significant. 
But remember, we serve global customers, we serve large enterprise, mid-market and SMB and in that lower vertical, so you have to look at this from multiple perspective. But the difference in Q2 was the vast majority was definitely a supply chain. And in that demand, we saw pockets of growth despite the dynamic of the coronavirus, which Aruba definitely was [indiscernible] despite the 2% decline year-over-year, we saw bright spots in wireless line, up 7%; North America, as a geo, 12%. 
The remote access points, we couldn't ship enough of it. I mean, we didn't have all of it. BDI was another one. So I think that was Q2. As I think about Q3, it's all about clean in the backlog and in a reasonable way, I feel more confident in Q3 and obviously, in the results in Q2 because you should expect continuous improvement. As for the demand, I don't know what to tell you, Toni, right now, because, obviously, it depends also in the global recovery of the economy. And the ultimate customer is going to assess where they want to spend the money. But right now, that's where we are. 
And then in terms of HPE Next, I made that comment at the beginning of HPE Next. Now let's be clear, I mean nobody expected a coronavirus-19. But as I said in one of my comments, I think, to Kate's question, actually, 1 same question was, I believe this in a downturn, this is what you go to double down in your strategy. And this is we're investing in the right place now so when the recovery takes place, you come out on the other end stronger. And so that's fundamentally what we're doing is really, obviously, addressing the cost resizing for the situation we are in. And in the short term, we have taken some painful action. 
For me as a CEO telling our employees, we're going to cut salary is not an easy thing to do. I don't take that lightly. But on the other hand, allocating the right people, the right resources, the right investment into the future, now that we're in the downturn, is the biggest opportunity because I think the strategy is absolutely spot-on and I'm more convicted than ever."

And that's what we are modeling and this is why we have come up with the cost prioritization plan that Antonio mentioned. And as he said, we need to take every day as it comes. 
So in terms of cost takeout, there is -- as part of our plan, the goal is to achieve the vast majority of the $800 million net run rate savings by fiscal year '21, although we said this number will be visible by fiscal year '22. And the reason why we said this is because of this level of uncertainty that exists in the shape of the economic recovery that I was referring to you before. 
So what we are doing is we're supplementing run rate reductions with temporary pay cuts and actions that we can take otherwise to protect the financial profile of the company and enhance our liquidity moving forward. Back to you, Antonio."

And what we have seen in the last several months is a continuous growth in our pipeline and the ability to convert that pipeline into larger deals, larger deals. Some of these deals, in particular, the [ 2 03 ], which are triple digits to give a sense. And so for us -- and also they are multiyear, right? So for us, that's an exciting because remember, we said many times, when we sign a GreenLake deal, we work with the customer in a multiyear deal. And the pull-through for infrastructure that goes with it and services attached is higher. The services attached through [indiscernible] or operational services is 100%, by the way, attached, and the margins are higher. 
So fundamentally, we are confident in reaffirming the annualized run rate revenue of 30%, 40% that Tarek talked earlier because it's a function of getting this continuous momentum and larger deals for many large-cap companies. So I think that's what we see and now we are telling more for the mid-market as well for SMB. And what the customers are looking for is the ability to scale up and down based on their needs and also more and more have someone else run it for them. They don't want to be in the run side. They want to be more in the innovation side."

So there is an opportunity to continue to drive that optimization. And fundamentally, I think about our portfolio as a way to accelerate that as-a-service model. 
Obviously, on one hand, at the edge, we have a fantastic cloud platform called HP Aruba, that we continue to invest -- Aruba Central, that we continue to invest and it's 100% software, right, with access points of switching that comes with it, I think that way, and obviously, through the subscription model. The other thing is, obviously on the core business, is how we drive the best workload optimized solutions that they are fully automated and provisioned from the cloud using HP GreenLake Central. So that's another component of that. So that's how we think about it. 
And obviously, there is a lot of the work we do even in the core businesses. While people may think it's hardware, and I want to give an example and the recent introduction of our distributed hyperconverged infrastructure, is actually all software. It's 100% software in many ways. And as I think about the future of how the world will evolve, we're going to live in a more distributed model. Today, it's very centralized in the sense you have your mobile phone or your mobile device connected to some sort of cloud. That cloud can be your data center, can be somebody else's cloud. But fundamentally, the cloud experience will extend -- will be extended all the way to the edge. And that's why we have planned in that portfolio to continue to invest in the Aruba Central with integration of 5G and the integration of edge compute. So it's a combination of freeing up resources in the traditional businesses, reallocate those resources in those areas that will drive the long-term sustainable profitable growth based on the work we have done in HPE Next and also continue to digitize everything we have and we can.

I think I will say -- let me start the bat, SMB obviously has been a significant challenge. We all witness every day. That's what has driven the big chunk of the unemployment that we see here in the United States. So obviously, that will take time to recover. And generally that market gets served through what we call a transactional engine and it's a high-velocity engine. 
In the enterprise, if you take it by vertical, I think telco has been fairly steady. Tarek talked about a portfolio that we have called Communications and Media Solutions. You heard some of the numbers in some areas growing 40% and 70%. It's all software and services and obviously drags infrastructure because eventually have to virtualize whatever infrastructure you put there. 
Financial Services actually was fairly steady and strong. We have a very large footprint, and this is where the diversification of our geo and verticals actually is helping us a little bit. Generally, FSI and telco are very large for us, where retail, not so much. And I think retail obviously was more impacted. But I will say, telco or communication, media and entertainment, financial services was strong. Obviously, oil and gas, not so much because we know the pricing of the oil. And then as I think about transportation, obviously impacted as well. 
But I will say the number of deals and the size of the deals were generally the same. The elongated sales cycles was consistent. But we align our plans based on the linearity I talked earlier, and Q2 was fairly steady and so far. So whether I know the first half was supply chain and the second half is demand is to be seen. Again, Tarek talked early on about the shape of the recovery. And I agree with Tarek. I totally subscribe to the U recovery. The question is how far the 2 sides of the U are and how deep the U is. But right now, it feels steady in those areas. And as I said earlier, our focus is the backlog.

So the most important thing in our cost optimization and prioritization plan is to achieve those $800 million of net run rate savings and hold them as long as possible in the cost structure so that we can effectively see more margins in our business. With respect to free cash flow, last year, if it were not for a legal settlement that we paid, we would have exceeded the $2 billion free cash flow mark. So that was what that business was capable back then with a certain revenue base. 
And what you've heard from Antonio is that we are rightsizing the business to what is potentially a new revenue base. And it's too early to tell whether that new revenue base will come back to the pre-pandemic revenue levels moving forward. But what's very important right now is our focus is to ensure that we rightsize our business and deliver those run rate savings so that we can emerge stronger after this crisis subsides."

Thanks, Tarek. And again, I just want to -- last year was a unique year in the sense that we were pretty much on track. And actually, I will argue, we delivered the normalized free cash flow because we're able to take care of unique circumstances wit",499,"Yes. Thanks, Tarek. And again, I just want to -- last year was a unique year in the sense that we were pretty much on track. And actually, I will argue, we delivered the normalized free cash flow because we're able to take care of unique circumstances with a settlement in arbitration. So when you add it all up, it was in excess of $2 billion. And again, it comes down to our ability to drive the operating cash, the cash from operations, which general tends to be very strong. Obviously, this quarter, because we couldn't convert, we couldn't deliver that. 
But let me remind again that the cost optimization and is a prioritization. It's not just about resizing but it's about shifting investments to the strategy, which I answered earlier to Toni. I think is the opportunity we have now and therefore, making that happen in the lower part of this, whatever the lower is, is the right strategy so you become stronger on the other end. 
So to wrap it up, thanks again for joining us today and for your questions. Let me make a few comments to wrap the call. As I said earlier, these are unprecedented and challenging times for all of us. It's not just the business, but obviously, the economy and the communities. Technology and digital transformation, in my view, are more critical than ever to enable what I think is going to be a new world, a new distributor world where workforces will be located in different ways, and honestly, there will be new ways to run businesses. 
I think our strategy to deliver a cloud experience from the edge to the cloud is more relevant than ever. And at the core of that is to securely connect people and things as we see more than 50 million devices being connected to the network every single day. But at the same time, we need to analyze data faster and to accelerate business outcomes for our customers. 
I think the measure we announced today will allow us to protect not only our balance sheet and continue to preserve the liquidity, which, as you saw in one of the slides, we have a very robust balance sheet with capacity up to $10 billion so that's not the issue. But fundamentally, my goal is to adapt the organization to be more agile to align our resources to the critical core business areas of growth and ultimately to accelerate the strategy, which I'm very convicted which will result in a long-term sustainable profitable growth. 
And I want you to take away that this work is being done with sense of urgency. Whether we are the first to announce it than other people, doesn't matter. We believe that this is the right thing to do and that time is important. So again, thank you for joining us the call today, and I hope you stay safe with you and your family. And we'll talk soon. Take care."

Sorry, I had a problem with my phone. So thanks, Sonalee. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today and I hope everyone is safe and healthy. Our fiscal Q2 results represent a full quarter of operating during the coronavirus-",1851,"Yes, thank you. Sorry, I had a problem with my phone. So thanks, Sonalee. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today and I hope everyone is safe and healthy. Our fiscal Q2 results represent a full quarter of operating during the coronavirus-19 (sic) [ COVID-19 ] crisis. This pandemic is unlike any other crisis we faced, and it has brought significant economic disruption. Businesses and communities are struggling. Supply chain productivity continues to be significantly constrained, and the demand environment is uneven. The market for capabilities like remote connectivity and virtual desktop solutions is stronger than precrisis in certain segments, and we are well positioned in those areas. But overall, customers are understandably cautious given so much uncertainty.
These dynamics had a significant impact on our financial performance this quarter given the economic lockdowns since February. Our overall Q2 revenue declined by 15% to $6 billion, which led to a 42% decline in our non-GAAP operating profit. This was a tough quarter by every measure, and I am, of course, disappointed in the results, but I do not view our Q2 performance as a reflection of our capabilities nor of the opportunity ahead of us.
Through this unsettling time, I have been really proud of our response that is aligned to our purpose to advance the way people live and work. We consider it a responsibility to help the world navigate this pandemic. We have prioritized protecting the health and safety of our team members and supporting our customers and partners as we weather this storm together.
At the outset, we moved quickly to mobilize crisis management teams around the world. We took decisive steps to ensure our team members' safety and well-being. We closed all of our sites and rapidly moved team members to work from home except for those who are performing mission-critical roles. We expanded team members' benefits to cover coronavirus-19 testing and treatment, enhanced mental health support and provided tools and resources to keep people connected and productive.
We also responded with important initiatives to address key needs created by the pandemic. We made substantial donations through HPE's foundation and designated $2 billion in financing through HPE Financial Services to our customers and partners with financial hardships. Our Aruba networking capabilities have been deployed in drive-up and virtual health care clinics and in schools that are facilitating distance learning. And our high-performance computing solutions are helping scientists and leading research institutions speed up drug discovery with complex modeling, simulation, AI and machine learning capabilities.
We joined forces with the U.S. government and other high-tech companies to form the White House High Performance Computing Consortium, giving coronavirus-19 researchers access to HPC resources. HPE also signed the Open COVID pledge, granting free access to all of our patented technologies for the purpose of diagnosing, preventing and treating the virus.
We have also adapted to deliver much needed capabilities and experiences to aid our customers' transformations as they navigate this difficult time. Through an improved sales coverage model aligned to market segments, our Intelligent Edge business continued to outperform the market while expanding operating margins and demonstrated 12% year-over-year growth in North America. In addition, we gained traction in our HPE GreenLake business. We continue to see acceleration in this very profitable strategic business and are seeing larger deals come in, underscoring a growing interest in our as-a-service offerings. In fact, our annualized revenue run rate, or ARR, increased 17% to $520 million.
While these are healthy signs of the needs our customers will continue to have coming out of the crisis, there continue to be significant supply constraints and delays in customer acceptance. This has impacted our ability to make deliveries to our customers.
Across our portfolio, we exited Q2 with more than $1.5 billion in backlog in Compute, Storage, HPC & Mission-Critical Systems as well Aruba, which represents 2x the historical backlog. Our team is doing everything we can to deliver on these customer orders.
Tarek will take you through our Q2 results in more detail. But before he does that, I want to take the time to align actions we will take to address the near-term uncertainty and ensure HPE is well positioned to emerge stronger, more agile and digitally enabled for a post coronavirus-19 world.
While the world has started to envision what a recovery might look like, we need to be prepared for different scenarios. We know there is no going back to what used to be. There is only preparing for and building what comes next. We need to adapt in order to keep our strategic momentum even as the world has changed dramatically. We are taking a deliberate set of actions to protect our financial foundation, become a more agile organization and align our resources to critical core businesses in areas of growth that accelerate our HPE Cloud platform as a service strategy. We continue to analyze financial forecasts and customer trends to better understand when and how global economies will recover.
In the meantime, we are taking some immediate steps to reduce operating expenses that will protect our financial profile. Effective July 1, we will implement a short-term pay reduction for all team members, where it is legally permitted, through October 31, 2020. My executive team and I will take the highest percentage reduction. Beyond us, the amount of reduction will vary by level. For team members who live in countries where pay reductions cannot be mandatory due to local laws and regulations, we are implementing unpaid leaves. In addition, we have implemented cost containment measures across the company, restricted external hiring through the end of our fiscal year and put salary increases on hold. Additionally, our Board of Directors have voluntary decided to forgo a percentage of its cash compensation for the remainder of the fiscal year 2020 to demonstrate its commitment to Hewlett Packard Enterprise as we focus on preserving liquidity and improve our position to deliver for our customers now and in the future.
In addition to those short-term measures, today, we are announcing a cost optimization and prioritization plan. This plan will help us focus our investments and realign our workforce to areas of growth that will accelerate our strategy. Some of the measures in the plan include continuing to streamline our product portfolio, implementing new digital customer engagement models and optimizing our workplace size strategy and experiences. HPE expects the plan will be implemented through fiscal year 2022. And as a result of the changes to the company's workforce, real estate model and further business process improvements, we estimate gross savings of at least $1 billion and annualized net run rate savings of at least $800 million by fiscal year '22 year-end. In order to achieve this level of cost savings, HPE estimates cash funding payments between $1 billion to $1.3 billion over the next 3 years. Tarek will provide further details in his remarks.
While we take the steps to secure our financial foundation and strengthen our operations, we have simplified our operating model and have aligned them to the financial segmentation we introduced early this year. Each of HPE's businesses is critical to our go-forward success. Each carries out an important part of the mission. And as our customers demand new and different products and services from us, we must deliver. I am personally committed to delivering to help each of our businesses leverage its existing strengths and evolve. Each of our business groups now report directly to me.
As part of the new organizational model, we created a GreenLake cloud services group to accelerate our as-a-service capabilities. We also added a new software team that will architect our software strategy and portfolio that power our as-a-service platform. This new structure will provide further accountability and improve our execution and transformation.
As the world emerges from the global pandemic, business continuity will depend on solutions that advance IT resiliency, empower remote workforces securely, extend connectivity, reinvigorate customer engagement and enable business model evolution. These realities mean that the digital transformation will be more critical than ever. This is why we must accelerate our strategy to deliver everything as-a-service, edge to cloud.
We see the growth in the cloud, on- and off-premises and increasingly at the edge where we are uniquely positioned. The edge customers need persistent connectivity to bridge the digital and physical worlds. HPE Aruba Central is at the core of our edge strategy. It is the only cloud-native, simple-to-use and secure platform that unifies network management for wired, wireless and WAN networks and soon, 5G and edge computing. In Q2, the number of unique customers using Aruba Central increased to 65,000.
Customers will also continue to need capabilities that harness the power of their data wherever it lives: at the edge, across public and private clouds, in colocations or in the traditional data center. We continue to believe the cloud is an experience, not a destination. And as-a-service business models will extend the cloud experience everywhere for all apps and data.
Earlier this month, we announced the general availability of HPE GreenLake Central, our advanced cloud-native platform that provides customers with a consistent cloud experience for all their applications and data through underlying operations consoles that runs, manages and optimizes their entire hybrid cloud estate. And in Q2, we made HPE Container Platform generally available. Our new cloud-native, software-defined stack is built using technologies from HPE's acquisition of BlueData, Storage and MapR and deliver greater flexibility and lower cost for Kubernetes deployments of cloud-native and noncloud-native applications with persistent storage connectivity.
Next month at our first-ever Discover virtual experience, we will showcase how HPE will help organizations ensure seamless business continuity through new technology capabilities, greater business intelligence and enhanced financial flexibility. Joined by thousands of customers and partners, we will discuss how we should think differently about transformation in the future, and we'll introduce new innovation to bring agility to customers' apps and data everywhere.
There is a great promise in what we can accomplish when we increase the speed of innovation and continue to bring to market differentiated capabilities from edge to cloud. Our customers, partners and communities need what HPE can provide. Our ability to execute our strategic pivot to offering our entire portfolio as a service by 2022 while we continue to rearchitect and strengthen our core businesses is critical. As we drive increased performance in our core businesses, we will be able to further align resources to new growth segments that will accelerate our strategy and pave the way to sustainable, profitable growth.
One of our core beliefs at HPE is the power of ""Yes, we can,"" and I'm confident in our ability to execute because I believe we have the right strategy, the right leadership team and the right mindset to adapt and deliver in bold, new ways. We are focused and we are making the necessary trade-offs so we can continue to invest in the future. We are undertaking it with a sense of urgency and conviction in our strategy.
With that, let me turn it to Tarek to review the quarter's results. Tarek?"

Hope you can all hear me and are all safe and well. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2020. As I have done before, I'll be referencing the slides from our earnings presen",2362,"Thank you very much, Antonio. Hope you can all hear me and are all safe and well. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2020. As I have done before, I'll be referencing the slides from our earnings presentation to highlight our performance in the quarter. Also please note, since last quarter, we are now reporting results according to our new segmentation.
Antonio discussed some of the key highlights of this quarter on Slide 1. Now let me discuss our financial performance, starting Slide 2. Our Q2 results were heavily impacted by the global COVID-19 crisis. As Antonio mentioned, our Q2 represented a full quarter of operating under COVID-19. Our revenues of $6 billion were down 15% year-over-year, primarily driven by supply chain disruption, which resulted in significantly higher levels of backlog, particularly in Compute, HPC & MCS and Storage. We also saw uneven demand with customers pushing out business activity as they navigated through the current economic crisis and lockdown.
At the edge, the market for capabilities like remote cloud connectivity and virtual desktop solutions was stronger than precrisis in certain segments, and we're well positioned in those areas, offsetting the decline in campus switching that resulted from lower business activity. Despite the challenging backdrop, we managed to maintain relatively stable non-GAAP gross margins, which were down by 20 basis points year-over-year.
Our non-GAAP operating profit, however, was down 42% year-over-year to 6.1% in operating margin terms, and our non-GAAP EPS of $0.22 was down 48% year-over-year. Our GAAP EPS was a loss of $0.64, primarily due to an $865 million noncash goodwill impairment charge associated with legacy goodwill allocated to the HPC & MCS business segment, which impacted GAAP net EPS by $0.67. This impairment was not driven by the Cray business, which continues to perform consistent with our expectations.
Cash flow from operations this quarter was $100 million impacted by reduced profitability and inventory buildup. Free cash flow was negative $402 million compared to a positive $402 million for the prior year period, which was impacted by higher financing volumes. Taking all the previous into account, we're taking decisive and prudent actions to manage our costs and expenses, further improve our liquidity and focus on opportunities to emerge stronger in the post-COVID-19 world.
Turning to Slide 3. Antonio outlined for you some of the near-term cost takeout measures we're implementing, including reductions in pay across our workforce, unpaid leave in places where pay reductions are not legally permitted and hiring restrictions. He also mentioned the actions we're committing to today to further strengthen our financial profile in the medium and long term and accelerate our strategy.
Today, we are announcing a cost optimization and prioritization plan to reflect the current revenue environment and to position ourselves as a more resilient company ready to address the needs of our customers in a post-COVID-19 world. We remain confident that we have the right strategy and are taking the right actions to secure our financial foundation and support our path to sustainable, profitable growth.
More specifically, our plan is designed to rightsize our cost structure to the new normal; to allocate resources in alignment with our new segmentation and growth areas; to drive increased efficiencies through investment in digitalization and automation; and finally, to accelerate our pivot to as-a-service to drive long-term sustainable profitable growth. Overall, these new cost efficiencies will be captured from simplifying and evolving our product portfolio strategy and go-to-market, cost savings from supply chain optimization, increased penetration of remote customer support, new initiatives to leverage digital marketing and consolidating our real estate footprint.
In terms of a time line, we expect that the plan will be implemented through fiscal year 2022 and estimate that it will deliver annualized net run rate savings of at least $800 million by fiscal year '22 end. Having said that, we expect to achieve the majority of the savings by the end of fiscal year '21. In order to achieve this level of cost savings, we estimate cumulative cash funding payments of between $1 billion to $1.3 billion over the next 3 years.
We'll now move to Slide 4 that shows our performance in the quarter in accordance with our new segmentation. Let me hit a few key points. In the Intelligent Edge segment, we declined 2%. However, we saw over 12% year-over-year growth in North America, showing that the changes we made to our North America sales leadership and go-to-market segmentation are paying off, even in the midst of a challenging business environment. While campus switching declined single digits due to increased emphasis on working from home, we grew the wireless LAN product business 7% year-over-year due to high demand for our remote access solutions and Wi-Fi 6 Certified (sic) [ Wi-Fi CERTIFIED 6 ] access points with 35% year-over-year growth in North America. Furthermore, we expanded gross margins and also grew operating margins by 570 basis points year-over-year to 11%. The bottom line is that we gained share in both campus switching and wireless LAN markets while significantly improving profit margins.
In Compute, revenue declined 19% this quarter driven by lower conversion rates, even as order backlog grew to 2x our average historical backlog, and lower unit growth which was negative double digits this quarter. Our ability to fulfill orders was impacted by component shortages, with supply chain logistics further disrupting our ability to fulfill demand due to the coronavirus pandemic. As the supply chain constraints alleviate, we expect to execute against our high backlog.
In High Performance Compute & Mission-Critical Systems, revenue declined 18%, primarily as a result of delayed installation and customer acceptance on account of COVID-19. Similar to Compute, this resulted in an elevated backlog, but we expect to see a stronger uptick in revenues in the second half of the year as we execute against the order book. Our HPC business has been actively involved in COVID-related research activity and is providing COVID-19 researchers worldwide with access to the world's most powerful HPC resources to advance the pace of scientific discovery in the fight to stop the virus. Furthermore, we announced the 2023 delivery of the world's fastest exascale supercomputer, El Capitan, for the United States Department of Energy at a record-breaking speed of 2 exaflops, 10x faster than today's most powerful supercomputer. Most importantly, the Cray integration remains on track to deliver the FY '20 revenue targets and triple-digit run rate synergies by fiscal year '21.
Within Storage, we declined 16% year-over-year due to higher backlog similar to Compute but had notable strength in big data, showing a growth of 61% year-over-year. Nimble services revenues grew 20% year-over-year with services intensity at record highs as customers add high-margin, value-added services.
For Operational Services, which is included across Compute, HPC & MCS and Storage, revenue declined by less than 1% year-over-year while orders were down 5% year-over-year driven by the drop in Compute units. On the positive side, our services intensity, which is the ratio of attach revenue per hardware unit sold, continued to be strong with double-digit growth in Storage and HPC & MCS services driven by Cray. This demonstrates that the underlying profitability of the units we sell and the attach rates continues to be robust.
In Advisory & Professional Services, revenue was down 8%, but we significantly improved operating margins by 6.2 points year-over-year due to our reentry in select countries, combined with an increase in remote delivery of projects from 65% to 90%, which helped to control costs and drive an improvement in chargeability levels of staff. Within HPE Financial Services, financing volume grew 10% year-over-year despite the impact of COVID-19, and our net portfolio of assets was up 4% this quarter with longer contract terms supporting GreenLake. We maintained a solid return on equity of approximately 15% again this quarter.
Our bad debt loss ratio this quarter was 0.5%, which is best-in-class in this industry. We'll obviously continue to closely monitor the impairment losses as liquidity constraints could affect some of our customers' ability to pay in upcoming quarters. We will tighten our underwriting guidelines as necessary to ensure we can manage through this crisis, and any impairment losses remain within our level of confidence.
Our Communications & Media Solutions business that is included in our Corporate Investments segment is a strategically important business to us, providing software and services capabilities to telco service providers. CMS is showing improved momentum. We saw strong double-digit software order growth, with EMEA growing 45% and Japan growing 70% this quarter.
Revenue gained momentum, growing 2% sequentially. We also expanded operating margins by 170 basis points year-over-year this quarter. We also recorded our first 5G core win with a Tier 1 carrier in the United States. The strategic win validates our 5G strategy with multi-vendor integration and true cloud-native telco network solutions.
Slide 5 shows our growing ARR profile I introduced at our Securities Analyst Meeting in October 2019. I'm pleased to report that our Q2 '20 ARR came in at $520 million, representing 17% year-over-year growth and in line with our expectations. Our HPE Aruba Central SaaS platform continued to grow revenue triple digits year-over-year this quarter. As we progress towards building our go-to-market as a service motion and remain focused on offering a full suite of differentiated solutions that can be consumed as a service, we are reiterating our ARR growth guidance of 30% to 40% compounded annual growth rate from FY '19 to FY '22.
Slide 6 highlights our EPS performance to date. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.22 in Q2, with headwinds from reduced operating leverage, suspension of our share buybacks and a lower but expected contribution from OI&E. Consistent with our guidance at SAM, we expect OI&E to be approximately negative $100 million for fiscal year '20.
Turning to gross margin on Slide 7. We delivered non-GAAP gross margin of 32% in Q2 of fiscal year '20, which was down 20% -- which was down, excuse me, 20 basis points year-over-year. Commodity costs were a tailwind to gross margin this quarter even as the supply-demand balance turned into a more inflationary commodities environment at the start of the quarter.
Moving to Slide 8. Non-GAAP operating margin was 6.1% in Q2 of fiscal year '20, and non-GAAP operating income was down 42% year-over-year. This clearly demonstrates the imperative to rightsize our business to reflect the new revenue profile we are facing as a result of the COVID-19 impact.
Turning to Slide 9. Our cash flow from operations was $100 million impacted by reduced profitability from the Compute and Storage businesses, which were heavily impacted this quarter, and higher than normal working capital. Free cash flow was a use of $402 million for the quarter driven by year-over-year growth, which was impacted by financing volumes. Higher-than-normal backlog and resulting inventory buildup triggered a reduction in our cash conversion cycle from minus 17 days in the prior quarter to minus 5 days this quarter. We expect our cash conversion cycle to improve through the rest of the year as we execute against the backlog and supply chain constraints alleviate, both of which help us reduce our high inventory levels.
Now moving on to Slide 10. I want to spend a moment on the strength of our balance sheet and investment-grade credit rating, which is a competitive advantage in this environment. As of our April 30 quarter end, we had approximately $5.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents, having successfully raised $2.25 billion in senior notes in April 2020 at a low cost of capital. We also have an undrawn revolving credit facility of $4.75 billion at our disposal. So in total, we have approximately $10 billion of liquidity. We remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade rating, which was reaffirmed by the rating agencies in April 2020. Bottom line, we have a strong cash position and ample credit available during these uncertain times to support and invest in our business.
Let me recap for you our key takeaways for this quarter on Slide 11. But before I do that, it's worth spending a couple of minutes on capital allocation. In Q2, we returned $305 million to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. We repurchased $151 million in shares and paid a cash dividend of $154 million. In April 2020, we took the decision to suspend share buybacks in the light of the current environment where liquidity is of paramount importance. Subsequently, in April, we announced a regular dividend payment for Q3 '20 payable in July.
Finally, let me summarize the key takeaway for you this quarter. Our fiscal Q2 results represent a full quarter of operating under the COVID-19 crisis, and were heavily impacted by the crisis both on the demand and supply side. As a result, we have enacted short-term actions and long-term cost optimization and prioritization plans to reflect the current revenue environment and to position ourselves as a more resilient company in a post-COVID world.
Our robust balance sheet with approximately $10 billion of liquidity and investment-grade credit rating gives us flexibility not only to weather the current storm but to continue to invest in key growth initiatives. We remain confident that we have the right strategy and are taking the right actions to secure our financial foundation and support our path to sustainable, profitable growth.
Now turning to outlook. Since the crisis began, we've been stress testing our model and running scenarios based on various assumptions, just like everybody else does. Given the level of uncertainty around the duration of the crisis and the rate and the shape of the recovery, there's a wide range of possible outcomes for the year. We have taken prudent and decisive steps, with the latest being our cost optimization and prioritization plan, so that we are prepared for the different outcomes. Due to the uncertainty, and consistent with our April 6, 2020 8-K filing where we withdrew our fiscal year '20 financial guidance, we will not be providing any Q3 or fiscal year '20 guidance.
Now with that, let me hand over to Antonio and open it up for questions. Antonio?"

So the order intake, or what I referred as the order linearity, was fairly steady I have to say. We normally plan a quarter in 13 weeks. The first week is the previous backlog from the previous quarter -- the backlog from the previous quarter and then 12 weeks, right? And we plan the linearity early on. And I will say we hit or exceeded our order linearity intake every week of the quarter. And so this really came down to our ability to convert the order book into revenue.
And in the case of HPC, High Performance Compute, let me remind everyone that in order for us to convert that order into revenue, we have to build it, obviously. We have to ship it. But we have to install it, and we have to turn it on. And once the customer accepts that installation, which, in many cases, is fairly large installations, you're talking about a number of clusters, that's when only we can recognize revenue. And so the impact on HPC was twofold: was not been able to go to customer sites because customers were locked down like we are and not be able to install and deliver and turn it on; and obviously, the same challenge we had in Compute and Storage with supply chain constraints in capacity because of the social distancing; and obviously, in the components level that we saw, obviously, a major disruption. And as a reminder, we ship pretty much 3 servers every minute. And so when the supply chain stops, it's pretty significant.
So in terms of going forward, our priority 1, 2 and 3 continues to be clear the backlog. And that's how I think about it. Throughout Q2, we made progress in the recovery. I will say China is pretty much back to normal. But obviously, they are cleaning the backlog themselves because they had to first recover the labor. And then obviously, they depend also on sub-suppliers for the components. Think about cables, connectors, transistors, you name it. And so for us, the majority of backlog right now is in the bucket.
And then in the regional factories, for the vast majority, all are performing at capacity except 1 or 2 where the rules and the regulations or the shelter-in-place are demanding that there is a stringent process on social distancing, which obviously impact the capacity in the factory lines. But the factories are all up and running. So I am optimistic about the weeks to come. So I take this a week at a time. Obviously, we continue to focus on the order intake. I cannot comment in May because I think you asked the question on May because we are in Q3 right now. But in Q2, the order linearity was fairly steady. And we expect not just HPC but Compute and Storage to continue to make progress, and that's why Q3 will be different than Q2."

Thanks, Wamsi, a great question. So since mentioned HPE Next, let me start with that. I mean I was the architect of HPE Next. In the 2017 year, as you know, we launched it in the fall of 2017. I will say, HPE Next was a great success story because it",522,"Yes. Thanks, Wamsi, a great question. So since mentioned HPE Next, let me start with that. I mean I was the architect of HPE Next. In the 2017 year, as you know, we launched it in the fall of 2017. I will say, HPE Next was a great success story because it allows us to rearchitect the company in the key areas in terms of simplification of processes, streamlining our go-to-market model. Remember, we went from a worldwide geo to country to more a geo model where we remove layers. And honestly, it allows us to reinvest back in innovation, and that's where I announced the investment of $4 billion at the edge, and now we start seeing the results of that with great numbers despite the challenges. So that was a success. And remember, we committed to deliver $800 million in net savings and which we did and we did ahead of schedule.
Now to your point, this is a crisis unlike anyone we have faced. And I will say, 2017, I said, listen, we don't envision another cost optimization plan. But this is a cost optimization driven by the pandemic. But honestly, I see an opportunity to go faster in our pivot to our strategy, which is to offer everything as a service. It is very unfortunate that we have this pandemic, which is causing tremendous economic disruption and, obviously, a huge impact to communities. But from the business perspective, we are more convicted than ever in our strategy. And we see it, the demand for pervasive ubiquity connectivity. That's why the access points are very strong for us: all cloud -- the cloud experience deployed everywhere from the edge-to-cloud and the ability to consume it as a service, and this is where we see tremendous momentum with HPE GreenLake.
So for me it is rightsize our cost structure to the new normal. And we don't know exactly what the new normal is at this point in time because we don't know what the recovery looks like. It's about allocating resources for the areas of growth we see in the future and also increase efficiency because we learn a lot. Remember, in Q1, I talked about it. We learned quite a lot and we extended the HPE Next, which is now part of this cost optimization and prioritization plan and digitized everything.
I believe this will cause incredible structural impacts in the way people are going to work. And my expectation is at least 50% of our employees will never come back to an office. And the office will look completely different, which means our offices will be more center of innovation and collaboration, not where you come to do your regular work every day. And that requires resizing our real estate footprint. But even as you resize the footprint, that also require new experiences and, therefore, investment associated with that. But when you bring it all together, and they need to reskill and upskill and allocate resources in the right place, I believe we have an opportunity to accelerate that strategy and drive to that long-term sustainable profitable growth."

Definitely, it was supply chain-driven, although demand continued to be uneven, as we discussed before, particularly in Compute. I would say you have to look at it this way, the shortfall on the revenue is pretty much all supply chain-driven because I made the comment early on that our linearity in the order intake was pretty steady. But in that order linearity, you have to look at the customer segments. Obviously, when you sell to, I call it cloud companies which are more software companies that deliver their value through the cloud, those will continue to be steady. If you think about enterprise, I will say, those were pretty steady. SMB, obviously, was the biggest challenge in the transactional business because, fundamentally, that segment of the market was significantly disruptive.
As I think about the future, right, obviously, we already were under a macro situation. But let's remind ourselves that the Compute platform go through an innovation cycle themselves even though it's commoditized. And as I think about the Gen10, you remember the Gen10, we actually told everyone that we said that 2/3 of the structural change was permanent because of the ability to attach richer configuration. As we go to what we call Gen10.5 and Gen11, which is happening in the next 18 months, you're going to see more on that. You're going to see, again, the same cycle where the density of these products, the amount of memory and storage you can put inside this compute platform, will continue to increase. And that's good for us because obviously, it drives AUP. But right now, our focus is really around clear the backlog, both on the Compute side and on the HPC side, both finish installation and obviously clear the backlog there as well."

The only thing I will say is that, definitely, the vast majority was supply chain. And as I said in my earlier comment in the previous question, there was some demand, obviously, but particularly in SMB and some elements of the mid-market where enterprise was a little more steady. And we saw uptake in demand, for example, that consumes Compute, for example, in solutions like VDI, which was in high demand; or even big data storage which, in the end, Toni, is a Compute platform with a lot of hard disk attached to it or SSDs attached to it.
So in that context, you're asking absolutely the right question, and this is what I'm maniacally focused with the team and which, as I said, my priority 1, 2 and 3 is clear the backlog. And as I said earlier, we focused the quarter in 13 weeks where we enter the backlog, which was the $1.5 billion on May 1, and where we're going to exit on July 31 as the new orders come in because, fundamentally, we expect the orders to come in, and we have a linearity plan associated with that recovery. So I feel pretty optimistic about it.
But however, it's going to come down to our ability to get the supply in the right place and ability to execute in the cycle times that we need. And obviously, as you know, we have a very global diversified supply chain, and we have made some series of moves to move products built around the globe, even if they are for other regions so we can accelerate that backlog. And so this is going to be the name of the game. But generally, as I think about the last 4 weeks, and I think about the next 4 weeks and then the next 4 weeks after that, we continue to see progress.
But there's a lot of things, who knows, there is a restart of coronavirus. I'm more concerned right now, Toni, to be honest with you, if something happened in one of these locations where we have the factory and you go into a resheltering or the social distancing, that could have an impact. In terms of the velocity behind with components from China, I will say that's where the vast majority is going absolutely in the right direction. And obviously, the logistics side, as we reopen countries and flights across the globe, that will help as well."

There wouldn't be another HPE Next. You felt you were in the right place on cost. You said last quarter, you were doing a little bit more on cost, but it wasn't structural, it wasn't another HPE Next. And now you are undertaking a significant multiyear structural change. And a, that doesn't feel consistent with the statement that this was really a supply issue. And b, it makes me wonder, like, are you more worried about your competitive position? Or are you worried that the IT environment is going to be weaker for a while?"

So my remarks about what happened in Q2 was about the supply chain and lesser so on the demand. I cannot forecast right now what the demand is on the back end, and this is where, in our remarks, we said we are looking at the pipeline, we are looking at the economic indicators, which obviously all of you provide and others. And so I would not make any further comment because on the demand, I don't know, in October or November, I don't know what that would look like. But I'm just replying to your question about what happened in Q2 definitely was, based on the order intake we had, it was -- the vast majority was a supply chain problem.
And there were pockets of uneven demand, which obviously were accentuated in the SMB space, which was quite significant. But remember, we serve global customers, we serve large enterprise, mid-market and SMB and in that lower vertical, so you have to look at this from multiple perspectives. But the difference in Q2 was the vast majority was definitely supply chain. And in that demand, we saw pockets of growth despite the dynamic of the coronavirus, which Aruba definitely was -- despite the 2% decline year-over-year, we saw bright spots in wireless LAN, up 7%; North America, as a geo, 12%. The remote access points, we couldn't ship enough of it. I mean we didn't have all of it. VDI was another one.
So I think -- that was Q2. As I think about Q3, it's all about cleaning the backlog. And in a reasonable way, I feel more confident in Q3 than, obviously, in the results in Q2 because you should expect continuous improvement. As for the demand, I don't know what to tell you, Toni, right now, because, obviously, it depends also in the global recovery of the economy. And then ultimately, the customers are going to assess where they want to spend the money. But right now, that's where we are.
And then in terms of HPE Next, I made that comment at the beginning of HPE Next. Now let's be clear, I mean nobody expected a coronavirus-19. But as I said in one of my comments, I think, to Katy's question -- actually, Wamsi's question, was I believe, in a downturn, this is where you got to double down in your strategy and this is where you're investing in the right place now, so when the recovery takes place, you come out on the other end stronger. And so that's fundamentally what we're doing, is really, obviously, addressing the cost resizing for the situation we are in. And in the short term, we have taken some painful actions. For me, as a CEO, telling our employees we're going to cut salaries, is not an easy thing to do. I don't take that lightly. But on the other hand, allocating the right people, the right resources, the right investment into the future, now that we're in the downturn, is the biggest opportunity because I think the strategy is absolutely spot-on, and I'm more convicted than ever."

And this is why we have come up with the cost prioritization plan that Antonio mentioned. And as he said, we need to take every day as it comes.
So in terms of cost takeout, there is -- as part of our plan, the goal is to achieve the vast majority of the $800 million net run rate savings by fiscal year '21, although we said this number will be visible by fiscal year '22. And the reason why we said this is because of this level of uncertainty that exists in the shape of the economic recovery that I was referring to you before.

And with HPE -- with the introduction of HPE GreenLake Central, which is a true cloud-native platform where you can deploy the right mix from edge to cloud and consumer as a service and deliver the workload optimized solutions in a standardized way, it is a true differentiation for us. And what we have seen in the last several months is a continuous growth in our pipeline and the ability to convert that pipeline into larger deals. Some of these deals, in particular, the 2 or 3, which are triple digits, to give a sense. And so for us -- and also they are multiyear, right? So for us, that's exciting because, remember, we said many times, when we sign a GreenLake deal, we work with the customer in a multiyear deal. And the pull-through for infrastructure that goes with it and services attached is higher. The services attached through Pointnext -- Pointnext operational services is 100%, by the way, attached. And the margins are higher.
So fundamentally, we are confident in reaffirming the annualized run rate revenue of 30%, 40% that Tarek talked earlier because it's a function of getting this continuous momentum and larger deals for many large-cap companies. So I think that's what we see. And now we are tailoring it more for the mid-market as well for SMB. And what the customers are looking for is the ability to scale up and down based on their needs and also more and more have someone else run it for them.

We've stocked up a lot of inventory, and the backlog is also a reflection of the fact that we stocked up a lot of inventory.

Rethinking also our workforce management practices because, quite frankly, I don't know what your situation is like, but we've been working very effectively from home for the past 3 months almost. And so this is pointing to us the need to think about this new normal and what does it mean from a workforce management standpoint and our real estate footprint.

So obviously, from the portfolio optimization, I think about the work we have done under HPE Next and continue that work to streamline a number of platform as options. We have done a phenomenal job there. But to Tarek's point, it's all about where we build these products and, fundamentally, where we also design these products. So there is an opportunity to continue to drive that optimization. And fundamentally, I think about our portfolio as a way to accelerate that as-a-service model. Obviously, on one hand, at the edge, we have a fantastic cloud platform called HPE Aruba that we continue to -- Aruba Central that we continue to invest, and it's 100% software, right, with access points of switching that comes with it, think of it that way and, obviously, through the subscription model. The other thing is, obviously, on the core business, is how we drive the best workload optimized solutions that they are fully automated and provisioned from the cloud using HPE GreenLake Central. So that's another component of that.
So that's how we think about it. And obviously, there is a lot of the work we do even in the core businesses. While people may think it's hardware -- and I want to give an example. In the recent introduction of our distributed hyperconverged infrastructure, it's actually all software. It's 100% software in many ways. And as I think about the future of how the world will evolve, we're going to live in a more distributed model. Today, it's very centralized in the sense you have your mobile phone or your mobile device connected to some sort of cloud. That cloud can be your data center, can be somebody else's cloud. But fundamentally, the cloud experience will extend -- will be extended all the way to the edge. And that's why we have planned in that portfolio to continue to invest in the Aruba Central with integration of 5G and the integration of edge compute. So it's a combination of freeing up resources in the traditional businesses, reallocate those resources in those areas that will drive the long-term sustainable profitable growth based on the work we have done in HPE Next and also continue to digitize everything we have and we can."

SMB obviously has been a significant challenge. We all witness every day. That's what has driven the big chunk of the unemployment that we see here in the United States. So obviously, that will take time to recover. And generally, that market gets served through what we call a transactional engine, and it's a high-velocity engine. In the enterprise, if you take it by vertical, I think telco has been fairly steady. Tarek talked about a portfolio that we have called Communications & Media Solutions. You heard some of the numbers, in some areas growing 40% and 70%. It's all software and services and, obviously, drags infrastructure because, eventually, you have to virtualize whatever infrastructure you put there.
Financial Services actually was fairly steady and strong. We have a very large footprint, and this is where the diversification of our geo and verticals actually is helping us a little bit. Generally, FSI and telco are very large for us where retail, not so much. And I think retail, obviously, was more impacted. But I will say, telco or communication, media and entertainment, financial services was strong. Obviously, oil and gas, not so much, because we know the pricing of the oil. And then as I think about transportation, obviously, impacted as well. But I will say the number of deals and the size of the deals were generally the same. The elongated sales cycles were consistent. But we align our plans based on the linearity that I talked earlier, and Q2 was fairly steady so far.
So whether I know the first half was supply chain and the second half is demand is to be seen. Again, Tarek talked early on about the shape of the recovery. And I agree with Tarek, I totally subscribe to the U recovery. The question is how far the 2 sides of the U are and how deep the U is. But right now, it feels steady in those areas. And as I said earlier, our focus is the backlog."

So the most important thing in our cost optimization and prioritization plan is to achieve those $800 million of net run rate savings and hold them as long as possible in the cost structure so that we can effectively see more margins in our business. With respect to free cash flow, last year, if it were not for a legal settlement that we paid, we would have exceeded the $2 billion free cash flow mark. So that was what that business was capable back then with a certain revenue base. And what you've heard from Antonio is that we are rightsizing the business to what is potentially a new revenue base. And it's too early to tell whether that new revenue base will come back to the pre-pandemic revenue levels moving forward. But what's very important right now is our focus, is to ensure that we rightsize our business and deliver those run rate savings so that we can emerge stronger after this crisis subsides."

And again, I just want to -- last year was a unique year in the sense that we were pretty much on track. And actually, I will argue, we delivered the normalized free cash flow because we're able to take care of unique circumstances with a settlement in arbitration. So when you add it all up, it was in excess of $2 billion. And again, it comes down to our ability to drive the operating cash, the cash from operations, which generally tends to be very strong. Obviously, this quarter, because we couldn't convert, we couldn't deliver that.
But let me remind again that the cost optimization and so prioritization is not just about resizing but it's about shifting investments to the strategy, which I answered earlier to Toni. I think it's the opportunity we have now and, therefore, making that happen in the lower part of this, whatever the lower is, is the right strategy so you become stronger on the other end.
So to wrap it up, thanks again for joining us today and for your questions. Let me make a few comments to wrap the call. As I said earlier, these are unprecedented and challenging times for all of us. It's not just the business but, obviously, the economy and the communities. Technology and digital transformation, in my view, are more critical than ever to enable what I think is going to be a new world, a new distributed world where workforces will be located in different ways. And honestly, there will be new ways to run businesses.
I think our strategy to deliver a cloud experience from the edge to the cloud is more relevant than ever. And at the core of that is to securely connect people and things as we see more than 50 million devices being connected to the network every single day. But at the same time, we need to analyze data faster and to accelerate business outcomes for our customers.
I think the measure we announced today will allow us to protect not only our balance sheet and continue to preserve the liquidity, which, as you saw in one of the slides, we have a very robust balance sheet with capacity up to $10 billion, so that's not the issue. But fundamentally, my goal is to adapt the organization to be more agile, to align our resources to the critical core business areas of growth and, ultimately, to accelerate the strategy which I'm very convicted, which will result in a long-term sustainable profitable growth. And I want you to take away that this work is being done with sense of urgency. Whether we are the first to announce it than other people doesn't matter. We believe that this is the right thing to do and that time is important.
So again, thank you for joining us on the call today, and I hope you stay safe with you and your family. And we'll talk soon. Take care."

Sorry, I had a problem with my phone. So thanks, Sonalee. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today and I hope everyone is safe and healthy. Our fiscal Q2 results represent a full quarter of operating during the coronavirus-",1851,"Yes, thank you. Sorry, I had a problem with my phone. So thanks, Sonalee. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today and I hope everyone is safe and healthy. Our fiscal Q2 results represent a full quarter of operating during the coronavirus-19 (sic) [ COVID-19 ] crisis. This pandemic is unlike any other crisis we faced, and it has brought significant economic disruption. Businesses and communities are struggling. Supply chain productivity continues to be significantly constrained, and the demand environment is uneven. The market for capabilities like remote connectivity and virtual desktop solutions is stronger than precrisis in certain segments, and we are well positioned in those areas. But overall, customers are understandably cautious given so much uncertainty.
These dynamics had a significant impact on our financial performance this quarter given the economic lockdowns since February. Our overall Q2 revenue declined by 15% to $6 billion, which led to a 42% decline in our non-GAAP operating profit. This was a tough quarter by every measure, and I am, of course, disappointed in the results, but I do not view our Q2 performance as a reflection of our capabilities nor of the opportunity ahead of us.
Through this unsettling time, I have been really proud of our response that is aligned to our purpose to advance the way people live and work. We consider it a responsibility to help the world navigate this pandemic. We have prioritized protecting the health and safety of our team members and supporting our customers and partners as we weather this storm together.
At the outset, we moved quickly to mobilize crisis management teams around the world. We took decisive steps to ensure our team members' safety and well-being. We closed all of our sites and rapidly moved team members to work from home except for those who are performing mission-critical roles. We expanded team members' benefits to cover coronavirus-19 testing and treatment, enhanced mental health support and provided tools and resources to keep people connected and productive.
We also responded with important initiatives to address key needs created by the pandemic. We made substantial donations through HPE's foundation and designated $2 billion in financing through HPE Financial Services to our customers and partners with financial hardships. Our Aruba networking capabilities have been deployed in drive-up and virtual health care clinics and in schools that are facilitating distance learning. And our high-performance computing solutions are helping scientists and leading research institutions speed up drug discovery with complex modeling, simulation, AI and machine learning capabilities.
We joined forces with the U.S. government and other high-tech companies to form the White House High Performance Computing Consortium, giving coronavirus-19 researchers access to HPC resources. HPE also signed the Open COVID pledge, granting free access to all of our patented technologies for the purpose of diagnosing, preventing and treating the virus.
We have also adapted to deliver much needed capabilities and experiences to aid our customers' transformations as they navigate this difficult time. Through an improved sales coverage model aligned to market segments, our Intelligent Edge business continued to outperform the market while expanding operating margins and demonstrated 12% year-over-year growth in North America. In addition, we gained traction in our HPE GreenLake business. We continue to see acceleration in this very profitable strategic business and are seeing larger deals come in, underscoring a growing interest in our as-a-service offerings. In fact, our annualized revenue run rate, or ARR, increased 17% to $520 million.
While these are healthy signs of the needs our customers will continue to have coming out of the crisis, there continue to be significant supply constraints and delays in customer acceptance. This has impacted our ability to make deliveries to our customers.
Across our portfolio, we exited Q2 with more than $1.5 billion in backlog in Compute, Storage, HPC & Mission-Critical Systems as well Aruba, which represents 2x the historical backlog. Our team is doing everything we can to deliver on these customer orders.
Tarek will take you through our Q2 results in more detail. But before he does that, I want to take the time to align actions we will take to address the near-term uncertainty and ensure HPE is well positioned to emerge stronger, more agile and digitally enabled for a post coronavirus-19 world.
While the world has started to envision what a recovery might look like, we need to be prepared for different scenarios. We know there is no going back to what used to be. There is only preparing for and building what comes next. We need to adapt in order to keep our strategic momentum even as the world has changed dramatically. We are taking a deliberate set of actions to protect our financial foundation, become a more agile organization and align our resources to critical core businesses in areas of growth that accelerate our HPE Cloud platform as a service strategy. We continue to analyze financial forecasts and customer trends to better understand when and how global economies will recover.
In the meantime, we are taking some immediate steps to reduce operating expenses that will protect our financial profile. Effective July 1, we will implement a short-term pay reduction for all team members, where it is legally permitted, through October 31, 2020. My executive team and I will take the highest percentage reduction. Beyond us, the amount of reduction will vary by level. For team members who live in countries where pay reductions cannot be mandatory due to local laws and regulations, we are implementing unpaid leaves. In addition, we have implemented cost containment measures across the company, restricted external hiring through the end of our fiscal year and put salary increases on hold. Additionally, our Board of Directors have voluntary decided to forgo a percentage of its cash compensation for the remainder of the fiscal year 2020 to demonstrate its commitment to Hewlett Packard Enterprise as we focus on preserving liquidity and improve our position to deliver for our customers now and in the future.
In addition to those short-term measures, today, we are announcing a cost optimization and prioritization plan. This plan will help us focus our investments and realign our workforce to areas of growth that will accelerate our strategy. Some of the measures in the plan include continuing to streamline our product portfolio, implementing new digital customer engagement models and optimizing our workplace size strategy and experiences. HPE expects the plan will be implemented through fiscal year 2022. And as a result of the changes to the company's workforce, real estate model and further business process improvements, we estimate gross savings of at least $1 billion and annualized net run rate savings of at least $800 million by fiscal year '22 year-end. In order to achieve this level of cost savings, HPE estimates cash funding payments between $1 billion to $1.3 billion over the next 3 years. Tarek will provide further details in his remarks.
While we take the steps to secure our financial foundation and strengthen our operations, we have simplified our operating model and have aligned them to the financial segmentation we introduced early this year. Each of HPE's businesses is critical to our go-forward success. Each carries out an important part of the mission. And as our customers demand new and different products and services from us, we must deliver. I am personally committed to delivering to help each of our businesses leverage its existing strengths and evolve. Each of our business groups now report directly to me.
As part of the new organizational model, we created a GreenLake cloud services group to accelerate our as-a-service capabilities. We also added a new software team that will architect our software strategy and portfolio that power our as-a-service platform. This new structure will provide further accountability and improve our execution and transformation.
As the world emerges from the global pandemic, business continuity will depend on solutions that advance IT resiliency, empower remote workforces securely, extend connectivity, reinvigorate customer engagement and enable business model evolution. These realities mean that the digital transformation will be more critical than ever. This is why we must accelerate our strategy to deliver everything as-a-service, edge to cloud.
We see the growth in the cloud, on- and off-premises and increasingly at the edge where we are uniquely positioned. The edge customers need persistent connectivity to bridge the digital and physical worlds. HPE Aruba Central is at the core of our edge strategy. It is the only cloud-native, simple-to-use and secure platform that unifies network management for wired, wireless and WAN networks and soon, 5G and edge computing. In Q2, the number of unique customers using Aruba Central increased to 65,000.
Customers will also continue to need capabilities that harness the power of their data wherever it lives: at the edge, across public and private clouds, in colocations or in the traditional data center. We continue to believe the cloud is an experience, not a destination. And as-a-service business models will extend the cloud experience everywhere for all apps and data.
Earlier this month, we announced the general availability of HPE GreenLake Central, our advanced cloud-native platform that provides customers with a consistent cloud experience for all their applications and data through underlying operations consoles that runs, manages and optimizes their entire hybrid cloud estate. And in Q2, we made HPE Container Platform generally available. Our new cloud-native, software-defined stack is built using technologies from HPE's acquisition of BlueData, Storage and MapR and deliver greater flexibility and lower cost for Kubernetes deployments of cloud-native and noncloud-native applications with persistent storage connectivity.
Next month at our first-ever Discover virtual experience, we will showcase how HPE will help organizations ensure seamless business continuity through new technology capabilities, greater business intelligence and enhanced financial flexibility. Joined by thousands of customers and partners, we will discuss how we should think differently about transformation in the future, and we'll introduce new innovation to bring agility to customers' apps and data everywhere.
There is a great promise in what we can accomplish when we increase the speed of innovation and continue to bring to market differentiated capabilities from edge to cloud. Our customers, partners and communities need what HPE can provide. Our ability to execute our strategic pivot to offering our entire portfolio as a service by 2022 while we continue to rearchitect and strengthen our core businesses is critical. As we drive increased performance in our core businesses, we will be able to further align resources to new growth segments that will accelerate our strategy and pave the way to sustainable, profitable growth.
One of our core beliefs at HPE is the power of ""Yes, we can,"" and I'm confident in our ability to execute because I believe we have the right strategy, the right leadership team and the right mindset to adapt and deliver in bold, new ways. We are focused and we are making the necessary trade-offs so we can continue to invest in the future. We are undertaking it with a sense of urgency and conviction in our strategy.
With that, let me turn it to Tarek to review the quarter's results. Tarek?"

As I have done before, I'll be referencing the slides from our earnings presen",2362,"Thank you very much, Antonio. Hope you can all hear me and are all safe and well. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2020. As I have done before, I'll be referencing the slides from our earnings presentation to highlight our performance in the quarter. Also please note, since last quarter, we are now reporting results according to our new segmentation.
Antonio discussed some of the key highlights of this quarter on Slide 1. Now let me discuss our financial performance, starting Slide 2. Our Q2 results were heavily impacted by the global COVID-19 crisis. As Antonio mentioned, our Q2 represented a full quarter of operating under COVID-19. Our revenues of $6 billion were down 15% year-over-year, primarily driven by supply chain disruption, which resulted in significantly higher levels of backlog, particularly in Compute, HPC & MCS and Storage. We also saw uneven demand with customers pushing out business activity as they navigated through the current economic crisis and lockdown.
At the edge, the market for capabilities like remote cloud connectivity and virtual desktop solutions was stronger than precrisis in certain segments, and we're well positioned in those areas, offsetting the decline in campus switching that resulted from lower business activity. Despite the challenging backdrop, we managed to maintain relatively stable non-GAAP gross margins, which were down by 20 basis points year-over-year.
Our non-GAAP operating profit, however, was down 42% year-over-year to 6.1% in operating margin terms, and our non-GAAP EPS of $0.22 was down 48% year-over-year. Our GAAP EPS was a loss of $0.64, primarily due to an $865 million noncash goodwill impairment charge associated with legacy goodwill allocated to the HPC & MCS business segment, which impacted GAAP net EPS by $0.67. This impairment was not driven by the Cray business, which continues to perform consistent with our expectations.
Cash flow from operations this quarter was $100 million impacted by reduced profitability and inventory buildup. Free cash flow was negative $402 million compared to a positive $402 million for the prior year period, which was impacted by higher financing volumes. Taking all the previous into account, we're taking decisive and prudent actions to manage our costs and expenses, further improve our liquidity and focus on opportunities to emerge stronger in the post-COVID-19 world.
Turning to Slide 3. Antonio outlined for you some of the near-term cost takeout measures we're implementing, including reductions in pay across our workforce, unpaid leave in places where pay reductions are not legally permitted and hiring restrictions. He also mentioned the actions we're committing to today to further strengthen our financial profile in the medium and long term and accelerate our strategy.
Today, we are announcing a cost optimization and prioritization plan to reflect the current revenue environment and to position ourselves as a more resilient company ready to address the needs of our customers in a post-COVID-19 world. We remain confident that we have the right strategy and are taking the right actions to secure our financial foundation and support our path to sustainable, profitable growth.
More specifically, our plan is designed to rightsize our cost structure to the new normal; to allocate resources in alignment with our new segmentation and growth areas; to drive increased efficiencies through investment in digitalization and automation; and finally, to accelerate our pivot to as-a-service to drive long-term sustainable profitable growth. Overall, these new cost efficiencies will be captured from simplifying and evolving our product portfolio strategy and go-to-market, cost savings from supply chain optimization, increased penetration of remote customer support, new initiatives to leverage digital marketing and consolidating our real estate footprint.
In terms of a time line, we expect that the plan will be implemented through fiscal year 2022 and estimate that it will deliver annualized net run rate savings of at least $800 million by fiscal year '22 end. Having said that, we expect to achieve the majority of the savings by the end of fiscal year '21. In order to achieve this level of cost savings, we estimate cumulative cash funding payments of between $1 billion to $1.3 billion over the next 3 years.
We'll now move to Slide 4 that shows our performance in the quarter in accordance with our new segmentation. Let me hit a few key points. In the Intelligent Edge segment, we declined 2%. However, we saw over 12% year-over-year growth in North America, showing that the changes we made to our North America sales leadership and go-to-market segmentation are paying off, even in the midst of a challenging business environment. While campus switching declined single digits due to increased emphasis on working from home, we grew the wireless LAN product business 7% year-over-year due to high demand for our remote access solutions and Wi-Fi 6 Certified (sic) [ Wi-Fi CERTIFIED 6 ] access points with 35% year-over-year growth in North America. Furthermore, we expanded gross margins and also grew operating margins by 570 basis points year-over-year to 11%. The bottom line is that we gained share in both campus switching and wireless LAN markets while significantly improving profit margins.
In Compute, revenue declined 19% this quarter driven by lower conversion rates, even as order backlog grew to 2x our average historical backlog, and lower unit growth which was negative double digits this quarter. Our ability to fulfill orders was impacted by component shortages, with supply chain logistics further disrupting our ability to fulfill demand due to the coronavirus pandemic. As the supply chain constraints alleviate, we expect to execute against our high backlog.
In High Performance Compute & Mission-Critical Systems, revenue declined 18%, primarily as a result of delayed installation and customer acceptance on account of COVID-19. Similar to Compute, this resulted in an elevated backlog, but we expect to see a stronger uptick in revenues in the second half of the year as we execute against the order book. Our HPC business has been actively involved in COVID-related research activity and is providing COVID-19 researchers worldwide with access to the world's most powerful HPC resources to advance the pace of scientific discovery in the fight to stop the virus. Furthermore, we announced the 2023 delivery of the world's fastest exascale supercomputer, El Capitan, for the United States Department of Energy at a record-breaking speed of 2 exaflops, 10x faster than today's most powerful supercomputer. Most importantly, the Cray integration remains on track to deliver the FY '20 revenue targets and triple-digit run rate synergies by fiscal year '21.
Within Storage, we declined 16% year-over-year due to higher backlog similar to Compute but had notable strength in big data, showing a growth of 61% year-over-year. Nimble services revenues grew 20% year-over-year with services intensity at record highs as customers add high-margin, value-added services.
For Operational Services, which is included across Compute, HPC & MCS and Storage, revenue declined by less than 1% year-over-year while orders were down 5% year-over-year driven by the drop in Compute units. On the positive side, our services intensity, which is the ratio of attach revenue per hardware unit sold, continued to be strong with double-digit growth in Storage and HPC & MCS services driven by Cray. This demonstrates that the underlying profitability of the units we sell and the attach rates continues to be robust.
In Advisory & Professional Services, revenue was down 8%, but we significantly improved operating margins by 6.2 points year-over-year due to our reentry in select countries, combined with an increase in remote delivery of projects from 65% to 90%, which helped to control costs and drive an improvement in chargeability levels of staff. Within HPE Financial Services, financing volume grew 10% year-over-year despite the impact of COVID-19, and our net portfolio of assets was up 4% this quarter with longer contract terms supporting GreenLake. We maintained a solid return on equity of approximately 15% again this quarter.
Our bad debt loss ratio this quarter was 0.5%, which is best-in-class in this industry. We'll obviously continue to closely monitor the impairment losses as liquidity constraints could affect some of our customers' ability to pay in upcoming quarters. We will tighten our underwriting guidelines as necessary to ensure we can manage through this crisis, and any impairment losses remain within our level of confidence.
Our Communications & Media Solutions business that is included in our Corporate Investments segment is a strategically important business to us, providing software and services capabilities to telco service providers. CMS is showing improved momentum. We saw strong double-digit software order growth, with EMEA growing 45% and Japan growing 70% this quarter.
Revenue gained momentum, growing 2% sequentially. We also expanded operating margins by 170 basis points year-over-year this quarter. We also recorded our first 5G core win with a Tier 1 carrier in the United States. The strategic win validates our 5G strategy with multi-vendor integration and true cloud-native telco network solutions.
Slide 5 shows our growing ARR profile I introduced at our Securities Analyst Meeting in October 2019. I'm pleased to report that our Q2 '20 ARR came in at $520 million, representing 17% year-over-year growth and in line with our expectations. Our HPE Aruba Central SaaS platform continued to grow revenue triple digits year-over-year this quarter. As we progress towards building our go-to-market as a service motion and remain focused on offering a full suite of differentiated solutions that can be consumed as a service, we are reiterating our ARR growth guidance of 30% to 40% compounded annual growth rate from FY '19 to FY '22.
Slide 6 highlights our EPS performance to date. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.22 in Q2, with headwinds from reduced operating leverage, suspension of our share buybacks and a lower but expected contribution from OI&E. Consistent with our guidance at SAM, we expect OI&E to be approximately negative $100 million for fiscal year '20.
Turning to gross margin on Slide 7. We delivered non-GAAP gross margin of 32% in Q2 of fiscal year '20, which was down 20% -- which was down, excuse me, 20 basis points year-over-year. Commodity costs were a tailwind to gross margin this quarter even as the supply-demand balance turned into a more inflationary commodities environment at the start of the quarter.
Moving to Slide 8. Non-GAAP operating margin was 6.1% in Q2 of fiscal year '20, and non-GAAP operating income was down 42% year-over-year. This clearly demonstrates the imperative to rightsize our business to reflect the new revenue profile we are facing as a result of the COVID-19 impact.
Turning to Slide 9. Our cash flow from operations was $100 million impacted by reduced profitability from the Compute and Storage businesses, which were heavily impacted this quarter, and higher than normal working capital. Free cash flow was a use of $402 million for the quarter driven by year-over-year growth, which was impacted by financing volumes. Higher-than-normal backlog and resulting inventory buildup triggered a reduction in our cash conversion cycle from minus 17 days in the prior quarter to minus 5 days this quarter. We expect our cash conversion cycle to improve through the rest of the year as we execute against the backlog and supply chain constraints alleviate, both of which help us reduce our high inventory levels.
Now moving on to Slide 10. I want to spend a moment on the strength of our balance sheet and investment-grade credit rating, which is a competitive advantage in this environment. As of our April 30 quarter end, we had approximately $5.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents, having successfully raised $2.25 billion in senior notes in April 2020 at a low cost of capital. We also have an undrawn revolving credit facility of $4.75 billion at our disposal. So in total, we have approximately $10 billion of liquidity. We remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade rating, which was reaffirmed by the rating agencies in April 2020. Bottom line, we have a strong cash position and ample credit available during these uncertain times to support and invest in our business.
Let me recap for you our key takeaways for this quarter on Slide 11. But before I do that, it's worth spending a couple of minutes on capital allocation. In Q2, we returned $305 million to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. We repurchased $151 million in shares and paid a cash dividend of $154 million. In April 2020, we took the decision to suspend share buybacks in the light of the current environment where liquidity is of paramount importance. Subsequently, in April, we announced a regular dividend payment for Q3 '20 payable in July.
Finally, let me summarize the key takeaway for you this quarter. Our fiscal Q2 results represent a full quarter of operating under the COVID-19 crisis, and were heavily impacted by the crisis both on the demand and supply side. As a result, we have enacted short-term actions and long-term cost optimization and prioritization plans to reflect the current revenue environment and to position ourselves as a more resilient company in a post-COVID world.
Our robust balance sheet with approximately $10 billion of liquidity and investment-grade credit rating gives us flexibility not only to weather the current storm but to continue to invest in key growth initiatives. We remain confident that we have the right strategy and are taking the right actions to secure our financial foundation and support our path to sustainable, profitable growth.
Now turning to outlook. Since the crisis began, we've been stress testing our model and running scenarios based on various assumptions, just like everybody else does. Given the level of uncertainty around the duration of the crisis and the rate and the shape of the recovery, there's a wide range of possible outcomes for the year. We have taken prudent and decisive steps, with the latest being our cost optimization and prioritization plan, so that we are prepared for the different outcomes. Due to the uncertainty, and consistent with our April 6, 2020 8-K filing where we withdrew our fiscal year '20 financial guidance, we will not be providing any Q3 or fiscal year '20 guidance.
Now with that, let me hand over to Antonio and open it up for questions. Antonio?"

So just any color as to when you think orders will begin to convert in those 2 segments as well."
273983758,667013396,2019116,"Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, May 21, 2020",2020-05-21,"Earnings Calls","Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company","Executives","Yes, Katy, and thanks for the question. So the order intake, or what I referred as the order linearity, was fairly steady I have to say. We normally plan a quarter in 13 weeks.

So the order intake, or what I referred as the order linearity, was fairly steady I have to say. We normally plan a quarter in 13 weeks. The first week is the previous backlog from the previous quarter -- the backlog from the previous quarter and then 12 weeks, right? And we plan the linearity early on. And I will say we hit or exceeded our order linearity intake every week of the quarter. And so this really came down to our ability to convert the order book into revenue.
And in the case of HPC, High Performance Compute, let me remind everyone that in order for us to convert that order into revenue, we have to build it, obviously. We have to ship it. But we have to install it, and we have to turn it on. And once the customer accepts that installation, which, in many cases, is fairly large installations, you're talking about a number of clusters, that's when only we can recognize revenue. And so the impact on HPC was twofold: was not been able to go to customer sites because customers were locked down like we are and not be able to install and deliver and turn it on; and obviously, the same challenge we had in Compute and Storage with supply chain constraints in capacity because of the social distancing; and obviously, in the components level that we saw, obviously, a major disruption. And as a reminder, we ship pretty much 3 servers every minute. And so when the supply chain stops, it's pretty significant.
So in terms of going forward, our priority 1, 2 and 3 continues to be clear the backlog. And that's how I think about it. Throughout Q2, we made progress in the recovery. I will say China is pretty much back to normal. But obviously, they are cleaning the backlog themselves because they had to first recover the labor. And then obviously, they depend also on sub-suppliers for the components. Think about cables, connectors, transistors, you name it. And so for us, the majority of backlog right now is in the bucket.
And then in the regional factories, for the vast majority, all are performing at capacity except 1 or 2 where the rules and the regulations or the shelter-in-place are demanding that there is a stringent process on social distancing, which obviously impact the capacity in the factory lines. But the factories are all up and running. So I am optimistic about the weeks to come. So I take this a week at a time. Obviously, we continue to focus on the order intake. I cannot comment in May because I think you asked the question on May because we are in Q3 right now. But in Q2, the order linearity was fairly steady. And we expect not just HPC but Compute and Storage to continue to make progress, and that's why Q3 will be different than Q2."

Thanks, Wamsi, a great question. So since mentioned HPE Next, let me start with that. I mean I was the architect of HPE Next. In the 2017 year, as you know, we launched it in the fall of 2017. I will say, HPE Next was a great success story because it",522,"Yes. Thanks, Wamsi, a great question. So since mentioned HPE Next, let me start with that. I mean I was the architect of HPE Next. In the 2017 year, as you know, we launched it in the fall of 2017. I will say, HPE Next was a great success story because it allows us to rearchitect the company in the key areas in terms of simplification of processes, streamlining our go-to-market model. Remember, we went from a worldwide geo to country to more a geo model where we remove layers. And honestly, it allows us to reinvest back in innovation, and that's where I announced the investment of $4 billion at the edge, and now we start seeing the results of that with great numbers despite the challenges. So that was a success. And remember, we committed to deliver $800 million in net savings and which we did and we did ahead of schedule.
Now to your point, this is a crisis unlike anyone we have faced. And I will say, 2017, I said, listen, we don't envision another cost optimization plan. But this is a cost optimization driven by the pandemic. But honestly, I see an opportunity to go faster in our pivot to our strategy, which is to offer everything as a service. It is very unfortunate that we have this pandemic, which is causing tremendous economic disruption and obviously, a huge impact to communities. But from the business perspective, we are more convicted than ever in our strategy. And we see it, the demand for pervasive ubiquity connectivity. That's why the access points are very strong for us: all cloud -- the cloud experience deployed everywhere from the edge-to-cloud and the ability to consume it as a service, and this is where we see tremendous momentum with HPE GreenLake.
So for me it is rightsize our cost structure to the new normal. And we don't know exactly what the new normal is at this point in time because we don't know what the recovery looks like. It's about allocating resources for the areas of growth we see in the future and also increase efficiency because we learn a lot. Remember, in Q1, I talked about it. We learned quite a lot and we extended the HPE Next, which is now part of this cost optimization and prioritization plan and digitized everything.
I believe this will cause incredible structural impacts in the way people are going to work. And my expectation is at least 50% of our employees will never come back to an office. And the office will look completely different, which means our offices will be more center of innovation and collaboration, not where you come to do your regular work every day. And that requires resizing our real estate footprint. But even as you resize the footprint, that also require new experiences and therefore, investment associated with that. But when you bring it all together, and they need to reskill and upskill and allocate resources in the right place, I believe we have an opportunity to accelerate that strategy and drive to that long-term sustainable profitable growth."

Definitely, it was supply chain-driven, although demand continued to be uneven, as we discussed before, particularly in Compute. I would say you have to look at it this way, the shortfall on the revenue is pretty much all supply chain-driven because I made the comment early on that our linearity in the order intake was pretty steady. But in that order linearity, you have to look at the customer segments. Obviously, when you sell to, I call it cloud companies which are more software companies that deliver their value through the cloud, those will continue to be steady. If you think about enterprise, I will say, those were pretty steady. SMB, obviously, was the biggest challenge in the transactional business because, fundamentally, that segment of the market was significantly disruptive.
As I think about the future, right, obviously, we already were under a macro situation. But let's remind ourselves that the Compute platform go through an innovation cycle themselves even though it's commoditized. And as I think about the Gen10, you remember the Gen10, we actually told everyone that we said that 2/3 of the structural change was permanent because of the ability to attach richer configuration. As we go to what we call Gen10.5 and Gen11, which is happening in the next 18 months, you're going to see more on that. You're going to see, again, the same cycle where the density of these products, the amount of memory and storage you can put inside this compute platform, will continue to increase. And that's good for us because obviously, it drives AUP. But right now, our focus is really around clear the backlog, both on the Compute side and on the HPC side, both finish installation and obviously clear the backlog there as well."

The only thing I will say is that, definitely, the vast majority was supply chain. And as I said in my earlier comment in the previous question, there was some demand, obviously, but particularly in SMB and some elements of the mid-market where enterprise was a little more steady. And we saw uptake in demand, for example, that consumes Compute, for example, in solutions like VDI, which was in high demand; or even big data storage which, in the end, Toni, is a Compute platform with a lot of hard disk attached to it or SSDs attached to it.
So in that context, you're asking absolutely the right question, and this is what I'm maniacally focused with the team and which, as I said, my priority 1, 2 and 3 is clear the backlog. And as I said earlier, we focused the quarter in 13 weeks where we enter the backlog, which was the $1.5 billion on May 1, and where we're going to exit on July 31 as the new orders come in because, fundamentally, we expect the orders to come in, and we have a linearity plan associated with that recovery. So I feel pretty optimistic about it.
But however, it's going to come down to our ability to get the supply in the right place and ability to execute in the cycle times that we need. And obviously, as you know, we have a very global diversified supply chain, and we have made some series of moves to move products built around the globe, even if they are for other regions so we can accelerate that backlog. And so this is going to be the name of the game. But generally, as I think about the last 4 weeks, and I think about the next 4 weeks and then the next 4 weeks after that, we continue to see progress.
But there's a lot of things, who knows, there is a restart of coronavirus. I'm more concerned right now, Toni, to be honest with you, if something happened in one of these locations where we have the factory and you go into a resheltering or the social distancing, that could have an impact. In terms of the velocity behind with components from China, I will say that's where the vast majority is going absolutely in the right direction. And obviously, the logistics side, as we reopen countries and flights across the globe, that will help as well."

Maybe you could -- I mean is it unrealistic to think you could close -- you could get backlog to normal levels? And then my second question is, if you're really saying that this was largely a supply, not demand disruption, I'm still a little -- I'm having difficulty reconciling the new sort of HPE Next to because, on your Q4 call, you were pretty unequivocal. There wouldn't be another HPE Next. You felt you were in the right place on cost. You said last quarter, you were doing a little bit more on cost, but it wasn't structural, it wasn't another HPE Next. And now you are undertaking a significant multiyear structural change. And a, that doesn't feel consistent with the statement that this was really a supply issue. And b, it makes me wonder, like, are you more worried about your competitive position? Or are you worried that the IT environment is going to be weaker for a while?"

So my remarks about what happened in Q2 was about the supply chain and lesser so on the demand. I cannot forecast right now what the demand is on the back end, and this is where, in our remarks, we said we are looking at the pipeline, we are looking at the economic indicators, which obviously all of you provide and others. And so I would not make any further comment because on the demand, I don't know, in October or November, I don't know what that would look like. But I'm just replying to your question about what happened in Q2 definitely was, based on the order intake we had, it was -- the vast majority was a supply chain problem.
And there were pockets of uneven demand, which obviously were accentuated in the SMB space, which was quite significant. But remember, we serve global customers, we serve large enterprise, mid-market and SMB and in that lower vertical, so you have to look at this from multiple perspectives. But the difference in Q2 was the vast majority was definitely supply chain. And in that demand, we saw pockets of growth despite the dynamic of the coronavirus, which Aruba definitely was -- despite the 2% decline year-over-year, we saw bright spots in wireless LAN, up 7%; North America, as a geo, 12%. The remote access points, we couldn't ship enough of it. I mean we didn't have all of it. VDI was another one.
So I think -- that was Q2. As I think about Q3, it's all about cleaning the backlog. And in a reasonable way, I feel more confident in Q3 than, obviously, in the results in Q2 because you should expect continuous improvement. As for the demand, I don't know what to tell you, Toni, right now, because, obviously, it depends also in the global recovery of the economy. And then ultimately, the customers are going to assess where they want to spend the money. But right now, that's where we are.
And then in terms of HPE Next, I made that comment at the beginning of HPE Next. Now let's be clear, I mean nobody expected a coronavirus-19. But as I said in one of my comments, I think, to Katy's question -- actually, Wamsi's question, was I believe, in a downturn, this is where you got to double down in your strategy and this is where you're investing in the right place now, so when the recovery takes place, you come out on the other end stronger. And so that's fundamentally what we're doing, is really, obviously, addressing the cost resizing for the situation we are in. And in the short term, we have taken some painful actions. For me, as a CEO, telling our employees we're going to cut salaries, is not an easy thing to do. I don't take that lightly. But on the other hand, allocating the right people, the right resources, the right investment into the future, now that we're in the downturn, is the biggest opportunity because I think the strategy is absolutely spot-on, and I'm more convicted than ever."

It's quite difficult to call the bottom or a trough quarter given the level of uncertainty that is currently visible. So one thing that we know is that the uncertainty is high. And it's everyone's guess what the shape of the recovery will be, so please bear that in mind. And most people and economies we talk to, and I spent a lot of time talking to many experts, as I'm sure you did, are not thinking in terms of a V-shaped recovery, more in terms of a U-shaped recovery, and that's what we are modeling. And this is why we have come up with the cost prioritization plan that Antonio mentioned. And as he said, we need to take every day as it comes.
So in terms of cost takeout, there is -- as part of our plan, the goal is to achieve the vast majority of the $800 million net run rate savings by fiscal year '21, although we said this number will be visible by fiscal year '22. And the reason why we said this is because of this level of uncertainty that exists in the shape of the economic recovery that I was referring to you before. So what we are doing is we're supplementing run rate reductions with temporary pay cuts and actions that we can take otherwise to protect the financial profile of the company and enhance our liquidity moving forward."

I think we have a unique differentiated value proposition with the HPE GreenLake. And with HPE -- with the introduction of HPE GreenLake Central, which is a true cloud-native platform where you can deploy the right mix from edge to cloud and consumer as a service and deliver the workload optimized solutions in a standardized way, it is a true differentiation for us. And what we have seen in the last several months is a continuous growth in our pipeline and the ability to convert that pipeline into larger deals. Some of these deals, in particular, the 2 or 3, which are triple digits, to give a sense. And so for us -- and also they are multiyear, right? So for us, that's exciting because, remember, we said many times, when we sign a GreenLake deal, we work with the customer in a multiyear deal. And the pull-through for infrastructure that goes with it and services attached is higher. The services attached through Pointnext -- Pointnext operational services is 100%, by the way, attached. And the margins are higher.
So fundamentally, we are confident in reaffirming the annualized run rate revenue of 30%, 40% that Tarek talked earlier because it's a function of getting this continuous momentum and larger deals for many large-cap companies. So I think that's what we see. And now we are tailoring it more for the mid-market as well for SMB. And what the customers are looking for is the ability to scale up and down based on their needs and also more and more have someone else run it for them. They don't want to be in the run side, they want to be more in the innovation side."

So obviously, from the portfolio optimization, I think about the work we have done under HPE Next and continue that work to streamline a number of platform as options. We have done a phenomenal job there. But to Tarek's point, it's all about where we build these products and fundamentally, where we also design these products. So there is an opportunity to continue to drive that optimization. And fundamentally, I think about our portfolio as a way to accelerate that as-a-service model. Obviously, on one hand, at the edge, we have a fantastic cloud platform called HPE Aruba that we continue to -- Aruba Central that we continue to invest, and it's 100% software, right, with access points of switching that comes with it, think of it that way and obviously, through the subscription model. The other thing is, obviously, on the core business, is how we drive the best workload optimized solutions that they are fully automated and provisioned from the cloud using HPE GreenLake Central. So that's another component of that.
So that's how we think about it. And obviously, there is a lot of the work we do even in the core businesses. While people may think it's hardware -- and I want to give an example. In the recent introduction of our distributed hyperconverged infrastructure, it's actually all software. It's 100% software in many ways. And as I think about the future of how the world will evolve, we're going to live in a more distributed model. Today, it's very centralized in the sense you have your mobile phone or your mobile device connected to some sort of cloud. That cloud can be your data center, can be somebody else's cloud. But fundamentally, the cloud experience will extend -- will be extended all the way to the edge. And that's why we have planned in that portfolio to continue to invest in the Aruba Central with integration of 5G and the integration of edge compute. So it's a combination of freeing up resources in the traditional businesses, reallocate those resources in those areas that will drive the long-term sustainable profitable growth based on the work we have done in HPE Next and also continue to digitize everything we have and we can."

SMB obviously has been a significant challenge. We all witness every day. That's what has driven the big chunk of the unemployment that we see here in the United States. So obviously, that will take time to recover. And generally, that market gets served through what we call a transactional engine, and it's a high-velocity engine. In the enterprise, if you take it by vertical, I think telco has been fairly steady. Tarek talked about a portfolio that we have called Communications & Media Solutions. You heard some of the numbers, in some areas growing 40% and 70%. It's all software and services and obviously, drags infrastructure because, eventually, you have to virtualize whatever infrastructure you put there.
Financial Services actually was fairly steady and strong. We have a very large footprint, and this is where the diversification of our geo and verticals actually is helping us a little bit. Generally, FSI and telco are very large for us where retail, not so much. And I think retail, obviously, was more impacted. But I will say, telco or communication, media and entertainment, financial services was strong. Obviously, oil and gas, not so much, because we know the pricing of the oil. And then as I think about transportation, obviously, impacted as well. But I will say the number of deals and the size of the deals were generally the same. The elongated sales cycles were consistent. But we align our plans based on the linearity that I talked earlier, and Q2 was fairly steady so far.
So whether I know the first half was supply chain and the second half is demand is to be seen. Again, Tarek talked early on about the shape of the recovery. And I agree with Tarek, I totally subscribe to the U recovery. The question is how far the 2 sides of the U are and how deep the U is. But right now, it feels steady in those areas. And as I said earlier, our focus is the backlog."

With respect to free cash flow, last year, if it were not for a legal settlement that we paid, we would have exceeded the $2 billion free cash flow mark. So that was what that business was capable back then with a certain revenue base. And what you've heard from Antonio is that we are rightsizing the business to what is potentially a new revenue base. And it's too early to tell whether that new revenue base will come back to the pre-pandemic revenue levels moving forward. But what's very important right now is our focus, is to ensure that we rightsize our business and deliver those run rate savings so that we can emerge stronger after this crisis subsides."

And again, I just want to -- last year was a unique year in the sense that we were pretty much on track. And actually, I will argue, we delivered the normalized free cash flow because we're able to take care of unique circumstances with a settlement in arbitration. So when you add it all up, it was in excess of $2 billion. And again, it comes down to our ability to drive the operating cash, the cash from operations, which generally tends to be very strong. Obviously, this quarter, because we couldn't convert, we couldn't deliver that.
But let me remind again that the cost optimization and so prioritization is not just about resizing but it's about shifting investments to the strategy, which I answered earlier to Toni. I think it's the opportunity we have now and therefore, making that happen in the lower part of this, whatever the lower is, is the right strategy so you become stronger on the other end.
So to wrap it up, thanks again for joining us today and for your questions. Let me make a few comments to wrap the call. As I said earlier, these are unprecedented and challenging times for all of us. It's not just the business but, obviously, the economy and the communities. Technology and digital transformation, in my view, are more critical than ever to enable what I think is going to be a new world, a new distributed world where workforces will be located in different ways. And honestly, there will be new ways to run businesses.
I think our strategy to deliver a cloud experience from the edge to the cloud is more relevant than ever. And at the core of that is to securely connect people and things as we see more than 50 million devices being connected to the network every single day. But at the same time, we need to analyze data faster and to accelerate business outcomes for our customers.
I think the measure we announced today will allow us to protect not only our balance sheet and continue to preserve the liquidity, which, as you saw in one of the slides, we have a very robust balance sheet with capacity up to $10 billion, so that's not the issue. But fundamentally, my goal is to adapt the organization to be more agile, to align our resources to the critical core business areas of growth and ultimately, to accelerate the strategy which I'm very convicted, which will result in a long-term sustainable profitable growth. And I want you to take away that this work is being done with sense of urgency. Whether we are the first to announce it than other people doesn't matter. We believe that this is the right thing to do and that time is important.
So again, thank you for joining us on the call today, and I hope you stay safe with you and your family. And we'll talk soon. Take care."

Thank you for joining us today and I hope everyone is safe and healthy. Our fiscal Q2 results represent a full quarter of operating during the coronavirus-19 (sic) [ COVID-19 ] crisis. This pandemic is unlike any other crisis we faced, and it has brought significant economic disruption. Businesses and communities are struggling. Supply chain productivity continues to be significantly constrained, and the demand environment is uneven. The market for capabilities like remote connectivity and virtual desktop solutions is stronger than precrisis in certain segments, and we are well positioned in those areas. But overall, customers are understandably cautious given so much uncertainty.
These dynamics had a significant impact on our financial performance this quarter given the economic lockdowns since February. Our overall Q2 revenue declined by 15% to $6 billion, which led to a 42% decline in our non-GAAP operating profit. This was a tough quarter by every measure, and I am, of course, disappointed in the results, but I do not view our Q2 performance as a reflection of our capabilities nor of the opportunity ahead of us.
Through this unsettling time, I have been really proud of our response that is aligned to our purpose to advance the way people live and work. We consider it a responsibility to help the world navigate this pandemic. We have prioritized protecting the health and safety of our team members and supporting our customers and partners as we weather this storm together.
At the outset, we moved quickly to mobilize crisis management teams around the world. We took decisive steps to ensure our team members' safety and well-being. We closed all of our sites and rapidly moved team members to work from home except for those who are performing mission-critical roles. We expanded team members' benefits to cover coronavirus-19 testing and treatment, enhanced mental health support and provided tools and resources to keep people connected and productive.
We also responded with important initiatives to address key needs created by the pandemic. We made substantial donations through HPE's foundation and designated $2 billion in financing through HPE Financial Services to our customers and partners with financial hardships. Our Aruba networking capabilities have been deployed in drive-up and virtual health care clinics and in schools that are facilitating distance learning. And our high-performance computing solutions are helping scientists and leading research institutions speed up drug discovery with complex modeling, simulation, AI and machine learning capabilities.
We joined forces with the U.S. government and other high-tech companies to form the White House High Performance Computing Consortium, giving coronavirus-19 researchers access to HPC resources. HPE also signed the Open COVID pledge, granting free access to all of our patented technologies for the purpose of diagnosing, preventing and treating the virus.
We have also adapted to deliver much needed capabilities and experiences to aid our customers' transformations as they navigate this difficult time. Through an improved sales coverage model aligned to market segments, our Intelligent Edge business continued to outperform the market while expanding operating margins and demonstrated 12% year-over-year growth in North America. In addition, we gained traction in our HPE GreenLake business. We continue to see acceleration in this very profitable strategic business and are seeing larger deals come in, underscoring a growing interest in our as-a-service offerings. In fact, our annualized revenue run rate, or ARR, increased 17% to $520 million.
While these are healthy signs of the needs our customers will continue to have coming out of the crisis, there continue to be significant supply constraints and delays in customer acceptance. This has impacted our ability to make deliveries to our customers.
Across our portfolio, we exited Q2 with more than $1.5 billion in backlog in Compute, Storage, HPC & Mission-Critical Systems as well Aruba, which represents 2x the historical backlog. Our team is doing everything we can to deliver on these customer orders.
Tarek will take you through our Q2 results in more detail. But before he does that, I want to take the time to align actions we will take to address the near-term uncertainty and ensure HPE is well positioned to emerge stronger, more agile and digitally enabled for a post coronavirus-19 world.
While the world has started to envision what a recovery might look like, we need to be prepared for different scenarios. We know there is no going back to what used to be. There is only preparing for and building what comes next. We need to adapt in order to keep our strategic momentum even as the world has changed dramatically. We are taking a deliberate set of actions to protect our financial foundation, become a more agile organization and align our resources to critical core businesses in areas of growth that accelerate our HPE Cloud platform as a service strategy. We continue to analyze financial forecasts and customer trends to better understand when and how global economies will recover.
In the meantime, we are taking some immediate steps to reduce operating expenses that will protect our financial profile. Effective July 1, we will implement a short-term pay reduction for all team members, where it is legally permitted, through October 31, 2020. My executive team and I will take the highest percentage reduction. Beyond us, the amount of reduction will vary by level. For team members who live in countries where pay reductions cannot be mandatory due to local laws and regulations, we are implementing unpaid leaves. In addition, we have implemented cost containment measures across the company, restricted external hiring through the end of our fiscal year and put salary increases on hold. Additionally, our Board of Directors have voluntary decided to forgo a percentage of its cash compensation for the remainder of the fiscal year 2020 to demonstrate its commitment to Hewlett Packard Enterprise as we focus on preserving liquidity and improve our position to deliver for our customers now and in the future.
In addition to those short-term measures, today, we are announcing a cost optimization and prioritization plan. This plan will help us focus our investments and realign our workforce to areas of growth that will accelerate our strategy. Some of the measures in the plan include continuing to streamline our product portfolio, implementing new digital customer engagement models and optimizing our workplace size strategy and experiences. HPE expects the plan will be implemented through fiscal year 2022. And as a result of the changes to the company's workforce, real estate model and further business process improvements, we estimate gross savings of at least $1 billion and annualized net run rate savings of at least $800 million by fiscal year '22 year-end. In order to achieve this level of cost savings, HPE estimates cash funding payments between $1 billion to $1.3 billion over the next 3 years. Tarek will provide further details in his remarks.
While we take the steps to secure our financial foundation and strengthen our operations, we have simplified our operating model and have aligned them to the financial segmentation we introduced early this year. Each of HPE's businesses is critical to our go-forward success. Each carries out an important part of the mission. And as our customers demand new and different products and services from us, we must deliver. I am personally committed to delivering to help each of our businesses leverage its existing strengths and evolve. Each of our business groups now report directly to me.
As part of the new organizational model, we created a GreenLake cloud services group to accelerate our as-a-service capabilities. We also added a new software team that will architect our software strategy and portfolio that power our as-a-service platform. This new structure will provide further accountability and improve our execution and transformation.
As the world emerges from the global pandemic, business continuity will depend on solutions that advance IT resiliency, empower remote workforces securely, extend connectivity, reinvigorate customer engagement and enable business model evolution. These realities mean that the digital transformation will be more critical than ever. This is why we must accelerate our strategy to deliver everything as-a-service, edge to cloud.
We see the growth in the cloud, on- and off-premises and increasingly at the edge where we are uniquely positioned. The edge customers need persistent connectivity to bridge the digital and physical worlds. HPE Aruba Central is at the core of our edge strategy. It is the only cloud-native, simple-to-use and secure platform that unifies network management for wired, wireless and WAN networks and soon, 5G and edge computing. In Q2, the number of unique customers using Aruba Central increased to 65,000.
Customers will also continue to need capabilities that harness the power of their data wherever it lives: at the edge, across public and private clouds, in colocations or in the traditional data center. We continue to believe the cloud is an experience, not a destination. And as-a-service business models will extend the cloud experience everywhere for all apps and data.
Earlier this month, we announced the general availability of HPE GreenLake Central, our advanced cloud-native platform that provides customers with a consistent cloud experience for all their applications and data through underlying operations consoles that runs, manages and optimizes their entire hybrid cloud estate. And in Q2, we made HPE Container Platform generally available. Our new cloud-native, software-defined stack is built using technologies from HPE's acquisition of BlueData, Storage and MapR and deliver greater flexibility and lower cost for Kubernetes deployments of cloud-native and noncloud-native applications with persistent storage connectivity.
Next month at our first-ever Discover virtual experience, we will showcase how HPE will help organizations ensure seamless business continuity through new technology capabilities, greater business intelligence and enhanced financial flexibility. Joined by thousands of customers and partners, we will discuss how we should think differently about transformation in the future, and we'll introduce new innovation to bring agility to customers' apps and data everywhere.
There is a great promise in what we can accomplish when we increase the speed of innovation and continue to bring to market differentiated capabilities from edge to cloud. Our customers, partners and communities need what HPE can provide. Our ability to execute our strategic pivot to offering our entire portfolio as a service by 2022 while we continue to rearchitect and strengthen our core businesses is critical. As we drive increased performance in our core businesses, we will be able to further align resources to new growth segments that will accelerate our strategy and pave the way to sustainable, profitable growth.
One of our core beliefs at HPE is the power of ""Yes, we can,"" and I'm confident in our ability to execute because I believe we have the right strategy, the right leadership team and the right mindset to adapt and deliver in bold, new ways. We are focused and we are making the necessary trade-offs so we can continue to invest in the future. We are undertaking it with a sense of urgency and conviction in our strategy.
With that, let me turn it to Tarek to review the quarter's results. Tarek?"

Hope you can all hear me and are all safe and well. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2020. As I have done before, I'll be referencing the slides from our earnings presen",2362,"Thank you very much, Antonio. Hope you can all hear me and are all safe and well. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2020. As I have done before, I'll be referencing the slides from our earnings presentation to highlight our performance in the quarter. Also please note, since last quarter, we are now reporting results according to our new segmentation.
Antonio discussed some of the key highlights of this quarter on Slide 1. Now let me discuss our financial performance, starting Slide 2. Our Q2 results were heavily impacted by the global COVID-19 crisis. As Antonio mentioned, our Q2 represented a full quarter of operating under COVID-19. Our revenues of $6 billion were down 15% year-over-year, primarily driven by supply chain disruption, which resulted in significantly higher levels of backlog, particularly in Compute, HPC & MCS and Storage. We also saw uneven demand with customers pushing out business activity as they navigated through the current economic crisis and lockdown.
At the edge, the market for capabilities like remote cloud connectivity and virtual desktop solutions was stronger than precrisis in certain segments, and we're well positioned in those areas, offsetting the decline in campus switching that resulted from lower business activity. Despite the challenging backdrop, we managed to maintain relatively stable non-GAAP gross margins, which were down by 20 basis points year-over-year.
Our non-GAAP operating profit, however, was down 42% year-over-year to 6.1% in operating margin terms, and our non-GAAP EPS of $0.22 was down 48% year-over-year. Our GAAP EPS was a loss of $0.64, primarily due to an $865 million noncash goodwill impairment charge associated with legacy goodwill allocated to the HPC & MCS business segment, which impacted GAAP net EPS by $0.67. This impairment was not driven by the Cray business, which continues to perform consistent with our expectations.
Cash flow from operations this quarter was $100 million impacted by reduced profitability and inventory buildup. Free cash flow was negative $402 million compared to a positive $402 million for the prior year period, which was impacted by higher financing volumes. Taking all the previous into account, we're taking decisive and prudent actions to manage our costs and expenses, further improve our liquidity and focus on opportunities to emerge stronger in the post-COVID-19 world.
Turning to Slide 3. Antonio outlined for you some of the near-term cost takeout measures we're implementing, including reductions in pay across our workforce, unpaid leave in places where pay reductions are not legally permitted and hiring restrictions. He also mentioned the actions we're committing to today to further strengthen our financial profile in the medium and long term and accelerate our strategy.
Today, we are announcing a cost optimization and prioritization plan to reflect the current revenue environment and to position ourselves as a more resilient company ready to address the needs of our customers in a post-COVID-19 world. We remain confident that we have the right strategy and are taking the right actions to secure our financial foundation and support our path to sustainable, profitable growth.
More specifically, our plan is designed to rightsize our cost structure to the new normal; to allocate resources in alignment with our new segmentation and growth areas; to drive increased efficiencies through investment in digitalization and automation; and finally, to accelerate our pivot to as-a-service to drive long-term sustainable profitable growth. Overall, these new cost efficiencies will be captured from simplifying and evolving our product portfolio strategy and go-to-market, cost savings from supply chain optimization, increased penetration of remote customer support, new initiatives to leverage digital marketing and consolidating our real estate footprint.
In terms of a time line, we expect that the plan will be implemented through fiscal year 2022 and estimate that it will deliver annualized net run rate savings of at least $800 million by fiscal year '22 end. Having said that, we expect to achieve the majority of the savings by the end of fiscal year '21. In order to achieve this level of cost savings, we estimate cumulative cash funding payments of between $1 billion to $1.3 billion over the next 3 years.
We'll now move to Slide 4 that shows our performance in the quarter in accordance with our new segmentation. Let me hit a few key points. In the Intelligent Edge segment, we declined 2%. However, we saw over 12% year-over-year growth in North America, showing that the changes we made to our North America sales leadership and go-to-market segmentation are paying off, even in the midst of a challenging business environment. While campus switching declined single digits due to increased emphasis on working from home, we grew the wireless LAN product business 7% year-over-year due to high demand for our remote access solutions and Wi-Fi 6 Certified (sic) [ Wi-Fi CERTIFIED 6 ] access points with 35% year-over-year growth in North America. Furthermore, we expanded gross margins and also grew operating margins by 570 basis points year-over-year to 11%. The bottom line is that we gained share in both campus switching and wireless LAN markets while significantly improving profit margins.
In Compute, revenue declined 19% this quarter driven by lower conversion rates, even as order backlog grew to 2x our average historical backlog, and lower unit growth which was negative double digits this quarter. Our ability to fulfill orders was impacted by component shortages, with supply chain logistics further disrupting our ability to fulfill demand due to the coronavirus pandemic. As the supply chain constraints alleviate, we expect to execute against our high backlog.
In High Performance Compute & Mission-Critical Systems, revenue declined 18%, primarily as a result of delayed installation and customer acceptance on account of COVID-19. Similar to Compute, this resulted in an elevated backlog, but we expect to see a stronger uptick in revenues in the second half of the year as we execute against the order book. Our HPC business has been actively involved in COVID-related research activity and is providing COVID-19 researchers worldwide with access to the world's most powerful HPC resources to advance the pace of scientific discovery in the fight to stop the virus. Furthermore, we announced the 2023 delivery of the world's fastest exascale supercomputer, El Capitan, for the United States Department of Energy at a record-breaking speed of 2 exaflops, 10x faster than today's most powerful supercomputer. Most importantly, the Cray integration remains on track to deliver the FY '20 revenue targets and triple-digit run rate synergies by fiscal year '21.
Within Storage, we declined 16% year-over-year due to higher backlog similar to Compute but had notable strength in big data, showing a growth of 61% year-over-year. Nimble services revenues grew 20% year-over-year with services intensity at record highs as customers add high-margin, value-added services.
For Operational Services, which is included across Compute, HPC & MCS and Storage, revenue declined by less than 1% year-over-year while orders were down 5% year-over-year driven by the drop in Compute units. On the positive side, our services intensity, which is the ratio of attach revenue per hardware unit sold, continued to be strong with double-digit growth in Storage and HPC & MCS services driven by Cray. This demonstrates that the underlying profitability of the units we sell and the attach rates continues to be robust.
In Advisory & Professional Services, revenue was down 8%, but we significantly improved operating margins by 6.2 points year-over-year due to our reentry in select countries, combined with an increase in remote delivery of projects from 65% to 90%, which helped to control costs and drive an improvement in chargeability levels of staff. Within HPE Financial Services, financing volume grew 10% year-over-year despite the impact of COVID-19, and our net portfolio of assets was up 4% this quarter with longer contract terms supporting GreenLake. We maintained a solid return on equity of approximately 15% again this quarter.
Our bad debt loss ratio this quarter was 0.5%, which is best-in-class in this industry. We'll obviously continue to closely monitor the impairment losses as liquidity constraints could affect some of our customers' ability to pay in upcoming quarters. We will tighten our underwriting guidelines as necessary to ensure we can manage through this crisis, and any impairment losses remain within our level of confidence.
Our Communications & Media Solutions business that is included in our Corporate Investments segment is a strategically important business to us, providing software and services capabilities to telco service providers. CMS is showing improved momentum. We saw strong double-digit software order growth, with EMEA growing 45% and Japan growing 70% this quarter.
Revenue gained momentum, growing 2% sequentially. We also expanded operating margins by 170 basis points year-over-year this quarter. We also recorded our first 5G core win with a Tier 1 carrier in the United States. The strategic win validates our 5G strategy with multi-vendor integration and true cloud-native telco network solutions.
Slide 5 shows our growing ARR profile I introduced at our Securities Analyst Meeting in October 2019. I'm pleased to report that our Q2 '20 ARR came in at $520 million, representing 17% year-over-year growth and in line with our expectations. Our HPE Aruba Central SaaS platform continued to grow revenue triple digits year-over-year this quarter. As we progress towards building our go-to-market as a service motion and remain focused on offering a full suite of differentiated solutions that can be consumed as a service, we are reiterating our ARR growth guidance of 30% to 40% compounded annual growth rate from FY '19 to FY '22.
Slide 6 highlights our EPS performance to date. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.22 in Q2, with headwinds from reduced operating leverage, suspension of our share buybacks and a lower but expected contribution from OI&E. Consistent with our guidance at SAM, we expect OI&E to be approximately negative $100 million for fiscal year '20.
Turning to gross margin on Slide 7. We delivered non-GAAP gross margin of 32% in Q2 of fiscal year '20, which was down 20% -- which was down, excuse me, 20 basis points year-over-year. Commodity costs were a tailwind to gross margin this quarter even as the supply-demand balance turned into a more inflationary commodities environment at the start of the quarter.
Moving to Slide 8. Non-GAAP operating margin was 6.1% in Q2 of fiscal year '20, and non-GAAP operating income was down 42% year-over-year. This clearly demonstrates the imperative to rightsize our business to reflect the new revenue profile we are facing as a result of the COVID-19 impact.
Turning to Slide 9. Our cash flow from operations was $100 million impacted by reduced profitability from the Compute and Storage businesses, which were heavily impacted this quarter, and higher than normal working capital. Free cash flow was a use of $402 million for the quarter driven by year-over-year growth, which was impacted by financing volumes. Higher-than-normal backlog and resulting inventory buildup triggered a reduction in our cash conversion cycle from minus 17 days in the prior quarter to minus 5 days this quarter. We expect our cash conversion cycle to improve through the rest of the year as we execute against the backlog and supply chain constraints alleviate, both of which help us reduce our high inventory levels.
Now moving on to Slide 10. I want to spend a moment on the strength of our balance sheet and investment-grade credit rating, which is a competitive advantage in this environment. As of our April 30 quarter end, we had approximately $5.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents, having successfully raised $2.25 billion in senior notes in April 2020 at a low cost of capital. We also have an undrawn revolving credit facility of $4.75 billion at our disposal. So in total, we have approximately $10 billion of liquidity. We remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade rating, which was reaffirmed by the rating agencies in April 2020. Bottom line, we have a strong cash position and ample credit available during these uncertain times to support and invest in our business.
Let me recap for you our key takeaways for this quarter on Slide 11. But before I do that, it's worth spending a couple of minutes on capital allocation. In Q2, we returned $305 million to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. We repurchased $151 million in shares and paid a cash dividend of $154 million. In April 2020, we took the decision to suspend share buybacks in the light of the current environment where liquidity is of paramount importance. Subsequently, in April, we announced a regular dividend payment for Q3 '20 payable in July.
Finally, let me summarize the key takeaway for you this quarter. Our fiscal Q2 results represent a full quarter of operating under the COVID-19 crisis, and were heavily impacted by the crisis both on the demand and supply side. As a result, we have enacted short-term actions and long-term cost optimization and prioritization plans to reflect the current revenue environment and to position ourselves as a more resilient company in a post-COVID world.
Our robust balance sheet with approximately $10 billion of liquidity and investment-grade credit rating gives us flexibility not only to weather the current storm but to continue to invest in key growth initiatives. We remain confident that we have the right strategy and are taking the right actions to secure our financial foundation and support our path to sustainable, profitable growth.
Now turning to outlook. Since the crisis began, we've been stress testing our model and running scenarios based on various assumptions, just like everybody else does. Given the level of uncertainty around the duration of the crisis and the rate and the shape of the recovery, there's a wide range of possible outcomes for the year. We have taken prudent and decisive steps, with the latest being our cost optimization and prioritization plan, so that we are prepared for the different outcomes. Due to the uncertainty, and consistent with our April 6, 2020 8-K filing where we withdrew our fiscal year '20 financial guidance, we will not be providing any Q3 or fiscal year '20 guidance.
Now with that, let me hand over to Antonio and open it up for questions. Antonio?"

So the order intake, or what I referred as the order linearity, was fairly steady I have to say. We normally plan a quarter in 13 weeks. The first week is the previous backlog from the previous quarter -- the backlog from the previous quarter and then 12 weeks, right? And we plan the linearity early on. And I will say we hit or exceeded our order linearity intake every week of the quarter. And so this really came down to our ability to convert the order book into revenue.
And in the case of HPC, High Performance Compute, let me remind everyone that in order for us to convert that order into revenue, we have to build it, obviously. We have to ship it. But we have to install it, and we have to turn it on. And once the customer accepts that installation, which, in many cases, is fairly large installations, you're talking about a number of clusters, that's when only we can recognize revenue. And so the impact on HPC was twofold: was not been able to go to customer sites because customers were locked down like we are and not be able to install and deliver and turn it on; and obviously, the same challenge we had in Compute and Storage with supply chain constraints in capacity because of the social distancing; and obviously, in the components level that we saw, obviously, a major disruption. And as a reminder, we ship pretty much 3 servers every minute. And so when the supply chain stops, it's pretty significant.
So in terms of going forward, our priority 1, 2 and 3 continues to be clear the backlog. And that's how I think about it. Throughout Q2, we made progress in the recovery. I will say China is pretty much back to normal. But obviously, they are cleaning the backlog themselves because they had to first recover the labor. And then obviously, they depend also on sub-suppliers for the components. Think about cables, connectors, transistors, you name it. And so for us, the majority of backlog right now is in the bucket.
And then in the regional factories, for the vast majority, all are performing at capacity except 1 or 2 where the rules and the regulations or the shelter-in-place are demanding that there is a stringent process on social distancing, which obviously impact the capacity in the factory lines. But the factories are all up and running. So I am optimistic about the weeks to come. So I take this a week at a time. Obviously, we continue to focus on the order intake. I cannot comment in May because I think you asked the question on May because we are in Q3 right now. But in Q2, the order linearity was fairly steady. And we expect not just HPC but Compute and Storage to continue to make progress, and that's why Q3 will be different than Q2."

Thanks, Wamsi, a great question. So since mentioned HPE Next, let me start with that. I mean I was the architect of HPE Next. In the 2017 year, as you know, we launched it in the fall of 2017. I will say, HPE Next was a great success story because it",522,"Yes. Thanks, Wamsi, a great question. So since mentioned HPE Next, let me start with that. I mean I was the architect of HPE Next. In the 2017 year, as you know, we launched it in the fall of 2017. I will say, HPE Next was a great success story because it allows us to rearchitect the company in the key areas in terms of simplification of processes, streamlining our go-to-market model. Remember, we went from a worldwide geo to country to more a geo model where we remove layers. And honestly, it allows us to reinvest back in innovation, and that's where I announced the investment of $4 billion at the edge, and now we start seeing the results of that with great numbers despite the challenges. So that was a success. And remember, we committed to deliver $800 million in net savings and which we did and we did ahead of schedule.
Now to your point, this is a crisis unlike anyone we have faced. And I will say, 2017, I said, listen, we don't envision another cost optimization plan. But this is a cost optimization driven by the pandemic. But honestly, I see an opportunity to go faster in our pivot to our strategy, which is to offer everything as a service. It is very unfortunate that we have this pandemic, which is causing tremendous economic disruption and obviously, a huge impact to communities. But from the business perspective, we are more convicted than ever in our strategy. And we see it, the demand for pervasive ubiquity connectivity. That's why the access points are very strong for us: all cloud -- the cloud experience deployed everywhere from the edge-to-cloud and the ability to consume it as a service, and this is where we see tremendous momentum with HPE GreenLake.
So for me it is rightsize our cost structure to the new normal. And we don't know exactly what the new normal is at this point in time because we don't know what the recovery looks like. It's about allocating resources for the areas of growth we see in the future and also increase efficiency because we learn a lot. Remember, in Q1, I talked about it. We learned quite a lot and we extended the HPE Next, which is now part of this cost optimization and prioritization plan and digitized everything.
I believe this will cause incredible structural impacts in the way people are going to work. And my expectation is at least 50% of our employees will never come back to an office. And the office will look completely different, which means our offices will be more center of innovation and collaboration, not where you come to do your regular work every day. And that requires resizing our real estate footprint. But even as you resize the footprint, that also require new experiences and therefore, investment associated with that. But when you bring it all together, and they need to reskill and upskill and allocate resources in the right place, I believe we have an opportunity to accelerate that strategy and drive to that long-term sustainable profitable growth."

Definitely, it was supply chain-driven, although demand continued to be uneven, as we discussed before, particularly in Compute. I would say you have to look at it this way, the shortfall on the revenue is pretty much all supply chain-driven because I made the comment early on that our linearity in the order intake was pretty steady. But in that order linearity, you have to look at the customer segments. Obviously, when you sell to, I call it cloud companies which are more software companies that deliver their value through the cloud, those will continue to be steady. If you think about enterprise, I will say, those were pretty steady. SMB, obviously, was the biggest challenge in the transactional business because, fundamentally, that segment of the market was significantly disruptive.
As I think about the future, right, obviously, we already were under a macro situation. But let's remind ourselves that the Compute platform go through an innovation cycle themselves even though it's commoditized. And as I think about the Gen10, you remember the Gen10, we actually told everyone that we said that 2/3 of the structural change was permanent because of the ability to attach richer configuration. As we go to what we call Gen10.5 and Gen11, which is happening in the next 18 months, you're going to see more on that. You're going to see, again, the same cycle where the density of these products, the amount of memory and storage you can put inside this compute platform, will continue to increase. And that's good for us because obviously, it drives AUP. But right now, our focus is really around clear the backlog, both on the Compute side and on the HPC side, both finish installation and obviously clear the backlog there as well."

The only thing I will say is that, definitely, the vast majority was supply chain. And as I said in my earlier comment in the previous question, there was some demand, obviously, but particularly in SMB and some elements of the mid-market where enterprise was a little more steady. And we saw uptake in demand, for example, that consumes Compute, for example, in solutions like VDI, which was in high demand; or even big data storage which, in the end, Toni, is a Compute platform with a lot of hard disk attached to it or SSDs attached to it.
So in that context, you're asking absolutely the right question, and this is what I'm maniacally focused with the team and which, as I said, my priority 1, 2 and 3 is clear the backlog. And as I said earlier, we focused the quarter in 13 weeks where we enter the backlog, which was the $1.5 billion on May 1, and where we're going to exit on July 31 as the new orders come in because, fundamentally, we expect the orders to come in, and we have a linearity plan associated with that recovery. So I feel pretty optimistic about it.
But however, it's going to come down to our ability to get the supply in the right place and ability to execute in the cycle times that we need. And obviously, as you know, we have a very global diversified supply chain, and we have made some series of moves to move products built around the globe, even if they are for other regions so we can accelerate that backlog. And so this is going to be the name of the game. But generally, as I think about the last 4 weeks, and I think about the next 4 weeks and then the next 4 weeks after that, we continue to see progress.
But there's a lot of things, who knows, there is a restart of coronavirus. I'm more concerned right now, Toni, to be honest with you, if something happened in one of these locations where we have the factory and you go into a resheltering or the social distancing, that could have an impact. In terms of the velocity behind with components from China, I will say that's where the vast majority is going absolutely in the right direction. And obviously, the logistics side, as we reopen countries and flights across the globe, that will help as well."

You said last quarter, you were doing a little bit more on cost, but it wasn't structural, it wasn't another HPE Next. And now you are undertaking a significant multiyear structural change. And a, that doesn't feel consistent with the statement that this was really a supply issue. And b, it makes me wonder, like, are you more worried about your competitive position?

So my remarks about what happened in Q2 was about the supply chain and lesser so on the demand. I cannot forecast right now what the demand is on the back end, and this is where, in our remarks, we said we are looking at the pipeline, we are looking at the economic indicators, which obviously all of you provide and others. And so I would not make any further comment because on the demand, I don't know, in October or November, I don't know what that would look like. But I'm just replying to your question about what happened in Q2 definitely was, based on the order intake we had, it was -- the vast majority was a supply chain problem.
And there were pockets of uneven demand, which obviously were accentuated in the SMB space, which was quite significant. But remember, we serve global customers, we serve large enterprise, mid-market and SMB and in that lower vertical, so you have to look at this from multiple perspectives. But the difference in Q2 was the vast majority was definitely supply chain. And in that demand, we saw pockets of growth despite the dynamic of the coronavirus, which Aruba definitely was -- despite the 2% decline year-over-year, we saw bright spots in wireless LAN, up 7%; North America, as a geo, 12%. The remote access points, we couldn't ship enough of it. I mean we didn't have all of it. VDI was another one.
So I think -- that was Q2. As I think about Q3, it's all about cleaning the backlog. And in a reasonable way, I feel more confident in Q3 than, obviously, in the results in Q2 because you should expect continuous improvement. As for the demand, I don't know what to tell you, Toni, right now, because, obviously, it depends also in the global recovery of the economy. And then ultimately, the customers are going to assess where they want to spend the money. But right now, that's where we are.
And then in terms of HPE Next, I made that comment at the beginning of HPE Next. Now let's be clear, I mean nobody expected a coronavirus-19. But as I said in one of my comments, I think, to Katy's question -- actually, Wamsi's question, was I believe, in a downturn, this is where you got to double down in your strategy and this is where you're investing in the right place now, so when the recovery takes place, you come out on the other end stronger. And so that's fundamentally what we're doing, is really, obviously, addressing the cost resizing for the situation we are in. And in the short term, we have taken some painful actions. For me, as a CEO, telling our employees we're going to cut salaries, is not an easy thing to do. I don't take that lightly. But on the other hand, allocating the right people, the right resources, the right investment into the future, now that we're in the downturn, is the biggest opportunity because I think the strategy is absolutely spot-on, and I'm more convicted than ever."

And this is why we have come up with the cost prioritization plan that Antonio mentioned. And as he said, we need to take every day as it comes.
So in terms of cost takeout, there is -- as part of our plan, the goal is to achieve the vast majority of the $800 million net run rate savings by fiscal year '21, although we said this number will be visible by fiscal year '22. And the reason why we said this is because of this level of uncertainty that exists in the shape of the economic recovery that I was referring to you before.

And with HPE -- with the introduction of HPE GreenLake Central, which is a true cloud-native platform where you can deploy the right mix from edge to cloud and consumer as a service and deliver the workload optimized solutions in a standardized way, it is a true differentiation for us. And what we have seen in the last several months is a continuous growth in our pipeline and the ability to convert that pipeline into larger deals. Some of these deals, in particular, the 2 or 3, which are triple digits, to give a sense. And so for us -- and also they are multiyear, right? So for us, that's exciting because, remember, we said many times, when we sign a GreenLake deal, we work with the customer in a multiyear deal. And the pull-through for infrastructure that goes with it and services attached is higher. The services attached through Pointnext -- Pointnext operational services is 100%, by the way, attached. And the margins are higher.
So fundamentally, we are confident in reaffirming the annualized run rate revenue of 30%, 40% that Tarek talked earlier because it's a function of getting this continuous momentum and larger deals for many large-cap companies. So I think that's what we see. And now we are tailoring it more for the mid-market as well for SMB. And what the customers are looking for is the ability to scale up and down based on their needs and also more and more have someone else run it for them.

But effectively, if you look at what the plan is about, it's fundamentally around realigning resources to the segments that we started to report back in the first quarter and areas of growth that we see, driving better productivity levels across those segments, changing fundamentally the way we engage with customers from a marketing and sales standpoint, rethinking our supply chain to create it in such a way that is more resilient than before, yet agile and efficient. Rethinking also our workforce management practices because, quite frankly, I don't know what your situation is like, but we've been working very effectively from home for the past 3 months almost. And so this is pointing to us the need to think about this new normal and what does it mean from a workforce management standpoint and our real estate footprint. So you can rethink your real estate footprint now that the world is much more distributed and connected than ever before. So I hope I have provided sufficient color to answer your question."

So obviously, from the portfolio optimization, I think about the work we have done under HPE Next and continue that work to streamline a number of platform as options. We have done a phenomenal job there. But to Tarek's point, it's all about where we build these products and fundamentally, where we also design these products. So there is an opportunity to continue to drive that optimization. And fundamentally, I think about our portfolio as a way to accelerate that as-a-service model. Obviously, on one hand, at the edge, we have a fantastic cloud platform called HPE Aruba that we continue to -- Aruba Central that we continue to invest, and it's 100% software, right, with access points of switching that comes with it, think of it that way and obviously, through the subscription model. The other thing is, obviously, on the core business, is how we drive the best workload optimized solutions that they are fully automated and provisioned from the cloud using HPE GreenLake Central. So that's another component of that.
So that's how we think about it. And obviously, there is a lot of the work we do even in the core businesses. While people may think it's hardware -- and I want to give an example. In the recent introduction of our distributed hyperconverged infrastructure, it's actually all software. It's 100% software in many ways. And as I think about the future of how the world will evolve, we're going to live in a more distributed model. Today, it's very centralized in the sense you have your mobile phone or your mobile device connected to some sort of cloud. That cloud can be your data center, can be somebody else's cloud. But fundamentally, the cloud experience will extend -- will be extended all the way to the edge. And that's why we have planned in that portfolio to continue to invest in the Aruba Central with integration of 5G and the integration of edge compute. So it's a combination of freeing up resources in the traditional businesses, reallocate those resources in those areas that will drive the long-term sustainable profitable growth based on the work we have done in HPE Next and also continue to digitize everything we have and we can."

SMB obviously has been a significant challenge. We all witness every day. That's what has driven the big chunk of the unemployment that we see here in the United States. So obviously, that will take time to recover. And generally, that market gets served through what we call a transactional engine, and it's a high-velocity engine. In the enterprise, if you take it by vertical, I think telco has been fairly steady. Tarek talked about a portfolio that we have called Communications & Media Solutions. You heard some of the numbers, in some areas growing 40% and 70%. It's all software and services and obviously, drags infrastructure because, eventually, you have to virtualize whatever infrastructure you put there.
Financial Services actually was fairly steady and strong. We have a very large footprint, and this is where the diversification of our geo and verticals actually is helping us a little bit. Generally, FSI and telco are very large for us where retail, not so much. And I think retail, obviously, was more impacted. But I will say, telco or communication, media and entertainment, financial services was strong. Obviously, oil and gas, not so much, because we know the pricing of the oil. And then as I think about transportation, obviously, impacted as well. But I will say the number of deals and the size of the deals were generally the same. The elongated sales cycles were consistent. But we align our plans based on the linearity that I talked earlier, and Q2 was fairly steady so far.
So whether I know the first half was supply chain and the second half is demand is to be seen. Again, Tarek talked early on about the shape of the recovery. And I agree with Tarek, I totally subscribe to the U recovery. The question is how far the 2 sides of the U are and how deep the U is. But right now, it feels steady in those areas. And as I said earlier, our focus is the backlog."

So the most important thing in our cost optimization and prioritization plan is to achieve those $800 million of net run rate savings and hold them as long as possible in the cost structure so that we can effectively see more margins in our business. With respect to free cash flow, last year, if it were not for a legal settlement that we paid, we would have exceeded the $2 billion free cash flow mark. So that was what that business was capable back then with a certain revenue base. And what you've heard from Antonio is that we are rightsizing the business to what is potentially a new revenue base. And it's too early to tell whether that new revenue base will come back to the pre-pandemic revenue levels moving forward. But what's very important right now is our focus, is to ensure that we rightsize our business and deliver those run rate savings so that we can emerge stronger after this crisis subsides."

And again, I just want to -- last year was a unique year in the sense that we were pretty much on track. And actually, I will argue, we delivered the normalized free cash flow because we're able to take care of unique circumstances with a settlement in arbitration. So when you add it all up, it was in excess of $2 billion. And again, it comes down to our ability to drive the operating cash, the cash from operations, which generally tends to be very strong. Obviously, this quarter, because we couldn't convert, we couldn't deliver that.
But let me remind again that the cost optimization and so prioritization is not just about resizing but it's about shifting investments to the strategy, which I answered earlier to Toni. I think it's the opportunity we have now and therefore, making that happen in the lower part of this, whatever the lower is, is the right strategy so you become stronger on the other end.
So to wrap it up, thanks again for joining us today and for your questions. Let me make a few comments to wrap the call. As I said earlier, these are unprecedented and challenging times for all of us. It's not just the business but obviously, the economy and the communities. Technology and digital transformation, in my view, are more critical than ever to enable what I think is going to be a new world, a new distributed world where workforces will be located in different ways. And honestly, there will be new ways to run businesses.
I think our strategy to deliver a cloud experience from the edge to the cloud is more relevant than ever. And at the core of that is to securely connect people and things as we see more than 50 million devices being connected to the network every single day. But at the same time, we need to analyze data faster and to accelerate business outcomes for our customers.
I think the measure we announced today will allow us to protect not only our balance sheet and continue to preserve the liquidity, which, as you saw in one of the slides, we have a very robust balance sheet with capacity up to $10 billion, so that's not the issue. But fundamentally, my goal is to adapt the organization to be more agile, to align our resources to the critical core business areas of growth and ultimately, to accelerate the strategy which I'm very convicted, which will result in a long-term sustainable profitable growth. And I want you to take away that this work is being done with sense of urgency. Whether we are the first to announce it than other people doesn't matter. We believe that this is the right thing to do and that time is important.
So again, thank you for joining us on the call today, and I hope you stay safe with you and your family. And we'll talk soon. Take care."

Thank you for joining us today, and I hope everyone is staying safe and healthy. Overall, I am pleased with our Q3 performance. We executed well to enable strong sequential growth across our businesses. We gained momentum in key areas of differentiation, driven by customer demand aligned to our strategy, and we began to take decisive and prudent actions to strengthen our core financial foundation, while we continue to align resources to critical areas of growth. 
COVID-19 has forced fundamental changes in businesses and communities. These changes have further validated our strategy. Navigating through the pandemic and planning for a post-COVID world has increased customer needs for other service offerings, secure connectivity, remote work capabilities and analytics to unlock insights from data. Our solutions are aligned to these needs, and we see a tremendous opportunity to help our customers transform and digitize their businesses as they continue to adapt and operate in our new world. 
Let me review a few highlights from the quarter. Total net revenue of $6.8 billion was up 14% quarter-over-quarter, and non-GAAP operating profit was up 33% quarter-over-quarter. Compute, HPC & MCS, storage and Intelligent Edge business segments also grew sequentially. Moving forward, we expect continued gradual performance improvement. 
We made significant improvements in our supply chain execution, reducing our backlog by more than $500 million from our Q2 historical high exit levels, which contributed to our results. In our HPC business, COVID-related impacts continued to affect our customers' ability to accept delivery of our products. We expect to return to normalized level of backlog by the end of Q4 through continued improvements in both supply chain execution and customer acceptances. Our pivot to as-a-service continued its strong momentum in the quarter. Our annualized revenue run rate of $528 million grew 11% year-over-year. GreenLake services orders grew a record 82% year-over-year. We believe this is faster than the orders growth of public cloud vendors, and it is a validation of our hyper strategy and competitive differentiation. 
We are focused on delivering one seamless cloud experience for all applications and data, no matter where they exist: at the edge, in a data center, in a colocation or in a public cloud estate. While others are now publicly declaring plans to offer Everything-as-a-Service, we have been focused on this for several years and have made significant organic and inorganic investments to deliver a differentiated experience for our customers. 
Our Q3 free cash flow of $924 million was up $276 million year-over-year, driven by a record cash flow from operations as a result of our improved execution this quarter. Importantly, we also declared our Q4 dividend today. Dividends remain an important part of our capital allocation framework that consists of capital return to shareholders and strategic investments that together drive long-term shareholder value. 
Our customers are managing through the pandemic with even greater needs for the capabilities HP can uniquely provide. In June, we put our strategy in the spotlight at our Discover virtual experience event, where we introduced new breakthrough innovation on a global virtual stage. The new solutions we introduced support our position that cloud is an experience, not a destination, and they're already gaining traction with our customers. We launched our next-generation of HP GreenLake Cloud Services. These new cloud services span machine learning operations, container management, virtualization, Infrastructure-as-a-Service, data protection and Connectivity-as-a-Service. Now our customers can access all of our HP GreenLake Cloud services via a soft service point-and-click catalog on our HP GreenLake Central Cloud Portal. Notably, in Q3, we signed several of our largest HPE GreenLake cloud services deals in history, including Lyondell Bezel, one of the largest plastics, chemicals and refining companies in the world who signed a $27 million HP GreenLake deal to drive their digital transformation and environmental efficiency. Underpinning our customers' cloud experience is the need for software. That is why we introduced our new HPE SML software portfolio. Our new portfolio includes a container platform that deploys Kubernetes at scale for a wide range of use cases on [indiscernible] and virtual machines. A data fabric that delivers enterprise-wide global access to data from edge-to-cloud with best-in-class reliability, security and performance, and machine learning operations solution that increases speed and agility for machine learning ops by operationalizing end-to-end processes from pilot to production, as well as It operations and automation to improve productivity and mitigate risk of service disruption. In addition, it enables our customer to control cost and compliance across their hybrid cloud estate through our managed cloud controls capabilities built into the portfolio. HPE SML can be consumed as a license or as a part of our HPE GreenLake cloud services offering. And just a few weeks ago, as a strong endorsement of our strategy and capabilities, we announced plans to partner with SAP to deliver the customer addition of SAP HANA Enterprise Cloud with HPE GreenLake Cloud Services. This new joint solution will help customers leverage our cloud capabilities, while keeping their SAP workloads and data on-premises. At the same time, we continue to strengthen our core capabilities in storage and compute, which are essential resources to store and process customers' data. Every 60 seconds, we ship 46 terabytes of storage in 4 servers. Despite the challenging market that impacted our storage performance overall, in Q3, we saw sequential improvement of 4%, and importantly, we gained traction and grew in key areas of investment. Big data storage, which is built on unique intellectual property from our MapR acquisition to enable real-time analytics for mission-critical big data world loads, grew revenues 31% year-over-year. Nimble distributed HCI, our new hyper-converged solution for business-critical applications and mixed world loads at scale grew revenue at 112% year-over-year. 
And a great example of our organic innovation is HP Primera, our most intelligent storage platform, grew revenues 114% year-over-year. HP Primera gained 104 new logos this quarter, with nearly 1/4 of those being new to HP storage. We saw strong sequential momentum with HPC in mission-critical systems that grew 10%, including a 10-year deal of $125 million with the University of Edinburgh in Scotland, who chose HPE to power the Edinburgh International Data Facility with our industry-leading HPC and AI solutions. 
And finally, we had a very solid quarter in compute, with 29% quarter-over-quarter growth, driven by the reduction in backlog and customer demand in VDI, or virtual desktop infrastructure, solutions. For example, Erasmus University Medical Center in the Netherlands wanted to upgrade its VDI environment for life cycle management needs and to prepare for future waves of COVID-19. We introduced a complete composable hyper-converged infrastructure solution based on HPE Synergy, along with HPE Primera to meet their needs. Our Intelligent Edge business performed in line with the market in Q3. We continue to see the edge as a significant opportunity over the long term. The explosion of data devices and application will drive demand for secure multi-protocol connectivity, analytics and cloud computing capabilities at the edge, especially in the post-COVID world. We are now entering the edge of insights, driven by the amount of data we are generating and the utilization of new analytic tools, such as machine learning and artificial intelligence technologies. Customers are looking to power a new breed of applications and workloads that work in concert with the cloud, but analyze and process data at the edge. To enable these new customer needs, we introduced the Aruba Edge services platform, or Aruba ESP, the industry first AI-powered cloud platform designed for to unify, automate and secure the edge. The Aruba ESP combines AI ops, Aruba Zero Trust security and a unified infrastructure with financial and consumption flexibility, and we are seeing early customer adoption. Noble Hospitality, a luxury lifestyle brand is standardizing on our Aruba Edge services platform as their edge cloud foundation for the hotel chain. The ability to generate actionable analytics where the data is created and deliver new on-property experiences for guests was critical to their decision. We also announced our plans to acquire SD1 leader, Silver Peak. Silver Peak's advanced SD1 offerings strengthened our Aruba ESP and complements Aruba's existing work-from-home and branch office solutions to deliver one of the industry's most comprehensive portfolios designed to securely connect any edge to any cloud. The combination, which is expected to close in Q4 of this fiscal year, will allow enterprise customers to simplify their branch office and 1 deployments to empower remote workforces, enable cloud-native deployments and transform business operations without compromising quality or reliability. This is a great example of accelerating our strategy while maintaining a disciplined approach to capital allocation. 
Building on our 5G core stack launched in March, we introduced a new telco edge orchestrator solution for telecom or operators. This new solution provides revenue opportunities for telecoms in the enterprise market with 1-click deployment of applications at the edge of the new 5G networks. We are receiving positive feedback on our 5G offerings. For example, we announced an innovative technical demonstration of an automated virtual 5G network conducted with a French telecom operator, Orange, and telco infrastructure solutions provider CASA systems. The demo highlights the expanding use cases and service agility needed to support 5G business applications, including location-based telemetry, IoT, edge computing and more that will require low latency. 
Our ability to innovate for our customers is made possible by strong financial management that strengthen our core financial foundation and allows us to align resources to the most critical areas. As we exited Q2, you will recall that we took a number of decisive and prudent actions to manage our business through the evolving impacts of COVID-19. This included several short-term initiatives to reduce operating expenses and drive efficiencies as well as the introduction of a long-term cost optimization and prioritization plan designed to accelerate sustainable profitable growth. We remain on track to deliver the annualized net run rate savings of at least $800 million by the end of fiscal year '22, driven by optimizing our workplace site strategy, simplifying our product portfolio and introducing new digital customer engagement models. These efforts, backed by our diversified portfolio, robust balance sheet and investment-grade credit rating, will allow us to continue to invest in key growth areas. 
In closing, I am proud of our Q3 performance, and I am proud of our HPE team. Our team members have been steadfast partners for our customers through an unprecedented period. They have moved quickly to address rapidly evolving market conditions. They have innovated with our customers in mind. They have made personal sacrifices to invest in our company's future. They have passionately committed to help HPE play a role in shaping a more equitable and inclusive society. And they have done all of this, while managing the challenges of living through a global pandemic. Furthermore simply, my HP colleagues have represented our values, labor culture and deliver on our purpose to advance the way people even work. As a result of the efforts, HP is stronger and better able to serve our customers, partners and communities in a world that's forever changed. While we continue to navigate through the global pandemic and macro uncertainty, we are cautiously optimistic that we will see gradual quarter-over-quarter performance improvement going forward. This is why we are providing guidance for our fiscal year '20 non-GAAP EPS, which Tarek will discuss. We look forward to seeing you virtually at our security Analyst meeting on October 15, where we will provide more details about our long-term plans. 
And with that, let me turn it over to Tarek to review the quarter's results."

I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2020. As usual, I'll be referencing the slides from our earnings presentation to highlight our performance in the quarter. Also, let me remind you that since the start of the fiscal year, we are reporting results according to our new segmentation. 
Antonio discussed the key highlights for this quarter on Slide 4. Now let me discuss our financial performance, starting with Slide 5. Q3 was characterized by strong execution, driving sequential growth. We delivered Q3 revenues of $6.8 billion, up 14% sequentially and down 4% from the prior year period. I am especially pleased to report that we have made significant progress in clearing our backlog by more than $500 million during the quarter. We expect a return to normalized backlog levels as we exit Q4 2020. As a result, we have grown non-GAAP gross profit by 8% sequentially to $2.1 billion in Q3. Non-GAAP gross margins were 30.4% this quarter, down 160 basis points sequentially, driven by a higher mix of compute as we executed against our backlog from prior quarters. Normalizing for the effect of backlog, both our compute and storage business segments grew gross margin on a sequential basis. Our non-GAAP operating profit was up 33% sequentially, resulting in a 7.1% operating margin, and our non-GAAP EPS of $0.32 and was up 45% sequentially. Our GAAP EPS was $0.01 as we accelerated our transformation program and incurred restructuring costs. 
Q3 cash flow from operations was approximately $1.5 billion, driven by strong operational execution. Free cash flow was $924 million, up $276 million from the prior year period, driven primarily by favorable working capital movements that I will detail later. Finally, we paid $154 million of dividends in the quarter and are declaring a Q4 dividend today of $0.12 per share payable October 7, 2020.
Let's move to Slide 6, which shows our performance in the quarter by segment. Here are the highlights. In the Intelligent Edge segment, we grew revenues 3% quarter-over-quarter, in line with the market. While wireless LAN declined single digits sequentially, we grew the campus switching business 12% quarter-over-quarter. In North America, our largest geo, revenue grew 4% quarter-over-quarter, demonstrating our continued momentum. Operating margin in Q3 was 8.6%, down 240 basis points quarter-over-quarter, impacted primarily by higher logistics and duties costs in this current environment. 
In Compute, revenue grew 29% quarter-over-quarter, as we executed against the backlog and improved our supply chain execution. Not only did units grow strong double digits sequentially, AUP grew 3% quarter-over-quarter as well. The increased operating leverage in this segment resulted in an operating profit margin of 8.5%, up 380 basis points quarter-over-quarter. 
In high-performance compute and mission critical systems, revenue grew 10% quarter-over-quarter, driven by strong performance in edge compute, HPC Apollo and MCS, up sequentially 82%, 16% and 2%, respectively. We expect to see sequential momentum next quarter driven by increased customer acceptance for HPC & MCS and Cray as we execute against the order book across the portfolio. Most importantly, Cray remains on track to deliver both on its FY '20 revenue targets and triple-digit run rate synergies by the end of fiscal year '21. 
Within Storage, we grew revenue 4% quarter-over-quarter, driven by strong operational execution across the segment portfolio of products and reduction of backlog to normalized levels. With respect to Pointnext operational services, which is included across our compute, HPC & MCS and storage segments, total revenue was down 2%, while orders grew 1% on a sequential basis. Additionally, our services intensity, which is the ratio of attach revenue per [indiscernible] units sold continued to be strong with solid double-digit growth on a sequential basis across all segments. Compute, storage and HPC & MCS. This demonstrates that the underlying profitability of the units we sell and the attach rates continue to be robust. 
In advisory and professional services, revenue was down 4% sequentially, as COVID impacted consulting activity and the chargeability levels of our staff. This business is strategically important for us as it helps customers navigate through their digital transformation and also pull-through significant infrastructure and operational services orders. 
Within HPE Financial Services, financing volume was up 1% quarter-over-quarter despite the impact of COVID-19, and our net portfolio of assets was up 4% this quarter, driven primarily by FX movements. We maintained a solid return on equity of approximately 13% this quarter. Our bad debt loss ratio this quarter was 74 basis points, which was slightly higher than previous quarters, is still best-in-class within this industry. I am particularly pleased by the collection performance in HPEFS, which attests to the quality of the book and the HPEFS franchise overall. I will come back to that later on. 
Our Communications and Media Solutions business that is included in our Corporate Investment segment, is strategically important to us, providing software and services capabilities to telco service providers. Revenue was down 4% sequentially due to first half slowdown in services bookings. However, due to our improved cost of delivery, we're able to expand operating margins by 30 basis points quarter-over-quarter. We continue to make good progress in our 5G core strategy that provides multi-vendor integration and true cloud-native telco networks functions. 
Slide 7 shows our growing ARR profile, which I introduced at our Securities Analyst Meeting in October 2019. I am very pleased to report that our Q3 '20 ARR came in at $528 million, representing 11% year-over-year growth. GreenLake Service orders were up 82% year-over-year in constant currency, driven by outstanding performance in North America, which delivered 5x year-over-year growth. Our HPE Aruba central SaaS platform continued to grow revenue strong double digits year-over-year as well. Based on strong customer demand, I am confident to reiterate our ARR growth guidance of 30% to 40% CAGR from fiscal year '19 to fiscal year '22. 
Slide 8 highlights our EPS performance to date. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.32 in Q3, up 45% sequentially from Q2 driven by improved operating leverage, cost control and lower OI&E expenses. We now expect fiscal year '20 OI&E to be significantly less than our $100 million expense guidance provided at SAM 2019, driven by higher earnings from equity interest in HPC, and better cost of debt resulting from our balance sheet funding diversification strategy that I will elaborate further on. 
Turning to gross margin on Slide 9. And as I mentioned previously, non-GAAP gross profit was up 8% sequentially due to improved operating leverage. At 30.4% of revenues, our gross margin was down 160 basis points quarter-over-quarter driven by higher mix of compute as we executed against our elevated backlog from the prior quarter. Most importantly, and normalizing for the effect of backlog, both Compute and Storage Business segments grew gross margins on a sequential basis. 
Moving to Slide 10. Non-GAAP operating margin was 7.1% in Q3 of fiscal year '20 and  non-GAAP operating income of $484 million was up 33% quarter-over-quarter. A combination of improved operating leverage and disciplined cost controls enabled us to improve profitability on a sequential basis. Last quarter, let me say this, we were prescient by proactively announcing the head of other industry players, a cost optimization and prioritization plan that would deliver annualized net run rate savings of at least $800 million by the end of fiscal year '22. We are making excellent progress there and are very much on track to emerge stronger in the post-COVID world. The actions we outlined as part of that plan to transform our core by optimizing our cost structure and aligning our resources through deep segmentation to key growth areas are now clearly starting to bear fruit. 
Turning to Slide 11. We generated cash flow from operations of approximately $1.5 billion. This is the highest level for the past 11 quarters, as we improved our operational execution. Free cash flow was $924 million for the quarter, driven by timing of working capital movements that resulted in favorability in Q3. Overall, we saw an improvement in our cash conversion cycle for minus 5 days in the prior quarter to minus 10 days this quarter. For Q4, we expect free cash flow to be sequentially lower, mainly due to 2 reasons: number one, working capital will be a use of cash; and number two, higher restructuring payments related to our core transformation plan we announced in Q2. As you recall, during the lockdown, we discussed our company exposure by industry vertical and company size, and explain in detail that our business is highly resilient. As a proof point, I would like to highlight the performance of our credit collection teams in both our operating company and in HPEFS. Thanks to their contribution during the quarter, the level of our ARR that is current is at a record high of 99.5%, which attest of the strength of the HPE business and the quality of our franchise. 
Now moving on to Slide 12, I want to spend a moment to talk about the strength of our diversified balance sheet and liquidity position and provide some insight on the puts and takes on forthcoming adjustments to our cash and debt positions. As of our 31st of July quarter end, we had approximately $8.5 billion of cash and cash equivalents, having successfully raised $1.75 billion in senior notes in July 2020 at a low-cost of debt. Post the quarter end, we redeemed $3 billion of bonds maturing in October 2020. Together with an undrawn revolving credit facility of $4.75 billion at our disposal, we currently have approximately $10.3 billion of liquidity after the redemption of the notes maturing in October 2020. Additionally, we expect to pay $925 million cash when we complete the proposed acquisition of Silver Peak, which is expected to close in Q4 of fiscal year '20. Adjusted for these known changes, our opco gross debt would be lower by $3 billion to approximately $4.4 billion, and our opco cash will also be lower by $3.9 billion to approximately $4 billion, resulting in an opco net debt of approximately $400 million. Separately, we have securitized some Financial Services-related debt through the ABS market in the U.S., and as of July 301st quarter end, we have approximately $2.1 billion in outstanding ABS issuances. The refinancing of higher cost unsecured debt with ABS financing allows us to boost access to financing markets at cheaper cost of capital, which helps diversify our balance sheet and lower interest expense payments in the future. Finally, I would like to reiterate that we remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade credit rating, which was reaffirmed by the rating agencies in July 2020. Bottom line, we have a strong cash position and ample liquidity available to run our operations, continue to invest in our business and execute on our strategy. 
Now turning to outlook on Slide 13. Given the progress made in our operations, we are now in a position to provide guidance on fiscal year '20 EPS. We expect to finish fiscal year '20 with non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $1.30 to $1.34, and we expect our fiscal year '20 GAAP diluted net loss per share to be between $0.35 and $0.31. 
Let me recap our key takeaways for this quarter on Slide 14. We delivered strong sequential improvement in top and bottom line and significantly improved operational and supply chain execution. We also accelerated our as-a-service pivot with very strong momentum in ARR and record GreenLake Services order growth. We're taking actions to strengthen our financial foundation and align resources to critical areas to transform our core and drive sustainable profitable growth. At this stage, given all of this, we expect gradual sequential performance improvement moving forward. In Q3, we paid $154 million in dividends to shareholders. We recognize that dividends are an important part of our capital allocation framework and returns to shareholders, and today, we are very pleased to declare a Q4 dividend of $0.12 per share payable on October 7, 2020. 
On a personal note, I'd like to echo Antonio's comments. We are both very proud of the way our company and team members quickly and decisively responded to the unprecedented challenges that the global COVID-19 pandemic has caused. As Antonio mentioned, we look forward to having you join us at our Virtual Securities Analyst meeting on October 15, where we will provide an update on our strategy, financial outlook and capital management policy. 
Now with that, let's open it up for questions. Thank you."

So I have a pretty good insight of what we see in the market. What we see right now, first of all, and I made this comment in my remarks, we see steady demand. And obviously, there are areas which are stronger than others. But the general sense is as follows: first of all, they're looking to strengthen their operations, and therefore, IT plays a huge role with that, and IT resiliency is more important than ever. So anything that comes with security and enables them to digitize their processes is on the growth side. Second is, obviously, they have a lot of data, and they need to get insight from that data. And we see an acceleration of solutions related to AI and machine learning, and that's why our big data storage saw another great, solid performance. But obviously, ML ops, and that's why we introduced an offer with HP GreenLake Cloud Services around machine learning operations is a high demand. Obviously, as we look at the workforce, and I think there are permanent and lasting changes to how we're going to work in the future, remote connectivity is essential. And that's why I'm so excited about the acquisition of Silver Peak, because together with Aruba services platform, give us now the ability to provide connectivity for all the edges. And the edge now is your home office, right? I consider that the micro branch to any cloud. And obviously, there are multiple clouds, because it's a hybrid strategy. And then anything that preserves CapEx is also in high demand. And that's why we see significant momentum with our HP GreenLake cloud services, because that's a true conceived as-a-service offering. And so obviously, that's in transition, right? We see -- what we see is a transition period. But I would say the enterprise has been steady. Obviously, SMBE is a challenge, from the customer segmentation perspective, is a challenge. When I look at the verticals, I think the financial sector where you play is still very solid. And the manufacturing side as well. Education, obviously, now is going to be very important. And in the public sector, the public sector is very strong. And obviously, we have a unique portfolio there with our HPC and AI solutions, but also around storage as well. So that's the general theme, Shannon, that we see at this point in time. In terms of budgets, obviously, they are assessing what happens in the context of their own revenues and profit. But overall, I will say the enterprise, which is where we participate the most, is fairly steady. And that's what Tarek meant, we have a very diversified and resilient portfolio, both by customer segment and by solution."

There's still some, but that's why we feel very confident that we can totally get back to the historical levels by the end of Q4. We grew sequentially double digits in units, NAUP, 3%. If you recall, commodity cost has been inflationary in the first part of the year, and we took quite significant actions on pricing. And that's why our AUPs went up because of pricing, but also because of the structural changes we continue to see in that type of products. I mentioned we shipped 46 terabytes of storage. And that's not just storage in a traditional storage platform, it goes with the Compute, right? And for servers. I think, as you think about going forward, obviously, we'll continue to be very disciplined on pricing. In terms of commodity costs, but in particular, DRAM, we start seeing some declines, honestly. The curve is pointing downwards. But as I said before, and we lived this in 2018, right, when prices go up -- when cost goes up, prices go up faster than when the cost goes down, it takes longer. But ultimately, the next-generation of our compute platform will drive even more richer configurations because there will be more per gigabyte per unit that will be attached to it. And so that's why we feel good about where we are today. But that's what we see in compute right now is still very competitive, there's no question about it. But the demand is shifting between enterprise, public sector and obviously, the service provider segment."

I mean, as I said before, everything in our life computes, which means Compute is embedded everywhere, not just in a server, and a lot of our storage platform is basically a compute platform with software, right? Big data storage is a great example of that. It is an Apollo platform that runs our AI software on it. It's hard to predict exactly what's going to happen there, but we saw steady demand again. We obviously have reallocated resources, particularly in our go-to-market where we see the growth opportunity as well. And we will continue to drive what the focus is, particularly in ADAS like VDI, which is, in essence, is a compute product with a bunch of software. Traditional Compute per se, in general purpose workloads, those obviously have been kind of weakened over time, been declining. But overall, I think a combination of AUPs, pricing, obviously, action and richer configuration, we should maintain a level of stability at this point in time considering that 2020 was fairly depressed overall. In terms of the edge, we believe we grew in line with the market. If I look at our competitors, what they announced, I think, is in line with the market. But we saw strength, as Tarek said, in switching, which was up sequentially 12%. Obviously, we continue to see quite a bit of strength in our subscription-based model with our Aruba platform. And also, we saw quite a bit of strength as well on the solutions around we provide, particularly [indiscernible] work solutions and remote connectivity. For us, this is a business that the long-term future. The thesis is totally intact. The Silver Peak acquisition will obviously accelerate the growth of Aruba going forward as well."

Now back to the first part of your question with respect to free cash flow, free cash flow was exceptionally strong in Q3 as we work through the backlog, right? So this has been very, very solid. And particularly, we were able to work through the backlog and improve the cash conversion cycle. Also, we benefited from temporary favorable timing of working capital, and that component will reverse in Q4. And so in Q4, like I mentioned in my script, expect free cash flow to be lower than Q3 as a result of 2 components: one is the restructuring cost; and number two, the working capital changes, and specifically, if you want a little bit more guidance as to where in working capital the change will come, it's predominantly in payables that you will see a change that will be adverse to the generation of free cash flow."

So thank you, Katy, and I'm sure you will all be normalizing for backlog on every aspect of our business. So I want to take the opportunity to clarify this and leaving no shadows for doubt. So as you recall, in Q2, we said we exited with executable",425,"Sure. So thank you, Katy, and I'm sure you will all be normalizing for backlog on every aspect of our business. So I want to take the opportunity to clarify this and leaving no shadows for doubt. So as you recall, in Q2, we said we exited with executable backlog in excess of $1.5 billion, which was 2x the level that we would normally see in our operation. So essentially, $750 million above the level that we normally have in our business. We reduced that $750 million by $500 million in Q3. The rest, we believe we can reduce by Q4. So even if you normalize for the $500 million, and I'll let you do all the calculations, you will see that the underlying revenue performance Q3 on Q2 is better. And also, if you really ask where did that backlog gets reduced, in which segment, in particular, it was mainly compute in a tiny bit in Storage, that's where the $500 million come from. And even if you look at compute back onto Wamsi's questions before, and you normalize for the reduction in backlog, you will observe that Compute was growing sequentially even after the normalization. We also want to underscore the fact that the backlog reduction hides a little bit what happens at the gross margin level, right? It's very difficult for you to see this at your end. But we did -- both of us reiterate the fact that, with the pricing actions we have taken and once you normalize for backlog, both Compute and Storage flow their underlying gross margins going up. And this is partly the reason why we've done so well in growing our gross profit 8% sequentially in the year. So that hopefully answers the backlog question -- or part of your question. On GreenLake, it's true, you're saying that Q-on-Q, the ARR decelerated. But the practical reality is where you look at the lead indicators that make the ARR is the order growth. The order growth that we've had in Q3, it's the record -- it's at record levels. We didn't experience an 82% order growth in GreenLake and we feel very good about this order growth because we're seeing bigger deals with larger companies. And the companies that Antonio quoted are not small companies that typically start with a little spend that is valuable on their IT infrastructure. These are bigger companies that are considering as-a-service consumption as a new way to handle their IT expenditures. So Antonio, maybe you would like to add to that?"

Actually, I will say a couple of things to that comment on the backlog, Katy, I mean this is product shipped, right? Not all that product was totally recognizable in the quarter, particularly in HPC.

Not all that product was totally recognizable in the quarter, particularly in HPC. Because if you remember, right, in the HPC segment, we got to ship it, we have to install it, we have to turn it on, and we have to run the test. And only and only when the customer signs up for the acceptance, then we can recognize revenue. And that's why we still have quite an interesting opportunity in Q4 with HPC in particular. But in Compute, once you ship it, you recognize it. So overall, very pleased with that. But even when you factor the backlog out, we actually grew sequentially on net new orders. And the net new orders, to Tarek's point, came at higher margins because of our pricing actions. The problem is the backlog was kind of dilutive to the margins because we price protect our customers, obviously, and we stand on that commitment. And also the channel, right? On the GreenLake, I mean, this is an amazing performance. As I said in my comment, I think, is -- we believe, I believe, it's faster growth than any cloud out there. And it has -- it really comes down to the ability to provide a hybrid experience. What customers are telling us, they don't want to be in the wrong side of the house anymore, but they understand they have to have apps and data everywhere. 70% of the apps and data, still on-prem, by the way. And more apps and data are moving to the edge. But ultimately, even if they have apps in public cloud, they like the GreenLake because it provides them the cost control, the managed aspect of it, and we can run it for them in a truly hybrid approach. And when they keep the apps and data on-prem, we give them the exact same consumption model, or whether they move it to the edge. And their value proposition is resonating more and more because the world is hybrid, cloud is an experience, and obviously, our software capabilities, they are playing a huge role together with our innovation on the business model side, and obviously, the financing. So that's what we see. And the ARR will take care of itself because, obviously, there is puts and takes because remember, air is a consumption-driven metric of it. And as we go forward, we are very, very confident to hit that 30% to 40%."

And so if I adjust for that, last quarter should have been $500 million higher. In this quarter, you actually shipped that and recognized $500 million, and so this quarter, adjusting for backlog, should be $500 million lower. So if I look at that year-over-year revenue ex the $500 million boost in backlog, it's down 13%. But more importantly, sequentially, if I make those 2 adjustments, revenue is actually down about 3% sequentially, which should be a reflection of orders, if I make the backlog adjustment, and that's below normal seasonal. And so a, is that incorrect, that analysis? And b, I'd like to understand why that wouldn't point to the fact that the order rate actually might be getting a little worse rather than getting a little better? And I have a follow-up, please."

But operationally, things are slightly different, meaning if you normalize Q3 performance for the $500 million, yes, you get to $6.3 billion. But it's not entirely operationally correct to add the $500 million to Q2, because as part of the backlog, you do have orders that ship in-quarter but are not invoiced. You do have all sorts of different effects that come into play that distort that picture. So there is a limit to the normalization math that we can give. The simple point is, it's all about timing. Look, it's all about timing. This revenue should have materialized in fiscal year '20. It is materializing in fiscal year '20. And we're back to normalized levels of backlog by the end of fiscal year '20. We've taken $500 million of backlog down. There's another -- you've done the math, $250 million to go. There's also another aspect that Antonio underscored before in HPC & MCS, it's very, very important for all of you to understand and it's the following. Specifically for that segment, it's slightly different than other segments because these systems are super sophisticated and even if we ship and land the system on customer premises, before we can actually invoice the customer, there's a technical acceptance process that takes place that delays our ability to invoice the customer. And so that is also fundamentally changing the trajectory of HPC & MCS, and we see very, very strong order demand in the public sector, which underpins the HPC & MCS segment, and you'll see the fruits of that in the foreseeable quarters. The conclusion of it is, whatever happens on backlog is an fiscal year '20 phenomenon driven by COVID, and they were essentially in Q1, the fact that we had, you remember, component shortages, and the whole industry experienced those. This translated into Q2 into manufacturing closures, where manufacturing was not at the full level. And then now, this issue has morphed into being specifically for HPC & MCS, a customer acceptance issue. So all in all, what matters is that the revenue of fiscal year '20 is actually the same if you factor into the equation the fact that we will reduce the backlog we generated and we saw elevated at the end of Q2, we'll turn that into revenue by the end of Q4 in full."

I think, Toni, the other part is that we reduced the backlog by $500 million, but not all of that translated in Q3, because, again, the HPC side of this, it takes -- sometimes takes weeks, some takes in months. We have installations, which are very large. It takes many, many weeks. And obviously, the global pandemic, the COVID, is not allowing us to have a lot of people on-site for cabling and all that as well. And even if we ship it, in many cases, depending on the timing on the kind of more of the normal type of products, we may have a ship to not invoice, which basically, yes, from the supply chain, it was taken care, but not from the revenue recognition perspective. That type of situation gets resolved, generally speaking, with a handful of weeks. On the HPC, it depends customer by customer. But the point on HPC is very strong. And obviously, we have a go-forward amount of business, which is very sizable for us. And that's very good."

And I think as I think about that, obviously, there is a lot of opportunities, particularly as we continue to pivot the company with more software and services-oriented type of offers. And you can see even in Q3, some of the strength with big data storage, in our Primera, which is a software in [indiscernible], is a software offering based on InfoSight, up over 100%. And so these are the things that will continue to drive growth.

We did also articulate the fact that if you normalize for backlog, which did have an impact on gross margins, both in Compute and Storage, our gross margins would be up. But also, what you can see at OP margin is the fact that we are starting to take cost out and we are incurring restructuring costs as a result of this. I want to take the opportunity to remind everyone about our cost optimization and prioritization plan that we announced in Q2. We took proactive steps to strengthen our financial profile. We're -- I would tell you, I take a lot pride about this one, because we were present, we did it on time, being hit very hard in a full quarter of Q2 that was disrupted by COVID. And we are on track with that program to generate net annualized run rate savings of at least $800 million by the end of fiscal year '22 relative to the fiscal year '19 exit level, and with most of those savings achieved at the end of fiscal year '21.

Thank you for joining us today, and I hope everyone is staying safe and healthy. Overall, I am pleased with our Q3 performance. We executed well to enable strong sequential growth across our businesses. We gained momentum in key areas of differentiation driven by customer demand aligned to our strategy. And we began to take decisive and prudent actions to strengthen our core financial foundation while we continued to align resources to critical areas of growth.
COVID-19 has forced fundamental changes in businesses and communities. These changes have further validated our strategy. Navigating through the pandemic and planning for a post-COVID world has increased customer needs for as-a-service offerings, secure connectivity, remote work capabilities and analytics to unlock insights from data. Our solutions are aligned to these needs, and we see a tremendous opportunity to help our customers transform and digitize their businesses as they continue to adapt and operate in a new world.
Let me review a few highlights from the quarter. Total net revenue of $6.8 billion was up 14% quarter-over-quarter, and non-GAAP operating profit was up 33% quarter-over-quarter. Compute, HPC & MCS, Storage and Intelligent Edge business segments also grew sequentially. Moving forward, we expect continued gradual performance improvement.
We made significant improvements in our supply chain execution, reducing our backlog by more than $500 million from our Q2 historical high exit levels, which contributed to our results. In our HPC business, COVID-related impacts continued to affect our customers' ability to accept delivery of our products. We expect to return to normalized level of backlog by the end of Q4 through continued improvements in both supply chain execution and customer acceptances.
Our pivot to as-a-service continued its strong momentum in the quarter. Our annualized revenue run rate of $528 million grew 11% year-over-year. GreenLake services orders grew a record 82% year-over-year. We believe this is faster than the orders growth of public cloud vendors, and it is a validation of our hybrid strategy and competitive differentiation.
We are focused on delivering one seamless cloud experience for all applications and data, no matter where they exist: at the edge, in a data center, in a colocation or in a public cloud estate. While others are now publicly declaring plans to offer Everything-as-a-Service, we have been focused on this for several years and have made significant organic and inorganic investments to deliver a differentiated experience for our customers.
Our Q3 free cash flow of $924 million was up $276 million year-over-year, driven by a record cash flow from operations as a result of our improved execution this quarter. Importantly, we also declared our Q4 dividend today. Dividends remain an important part of our capital allocation framework that consists of capital return to shareholders and strategic investments that together drive long-term shareholder value.
Our customers are managing through the pandemic with even greater needs for the capabilities HPE can uniquely provide. In June, we put our strategy in the spotlight at our Discover Virtual Experience event, where we introduced new breakthrough innovation on a global virtual stage. The new solutions we introduced support our position that cloud is an experience, not a destination, and they're already gaining traction with our customers.
We launched our next-generation of HPE GreenLake cloud services. These new cloud services span machine learning operations, container management, virtualization, Infrastructure-as-a-Service, data protection and Connectivity-as-a-Service. Now our customers can access all of our HPE GreenLake cloud services via a self-service point-and-click catalog on our HPE GreenLake Central cloud portal.
Notably, in Q3, we signed several of our largest HPE GreenLake cloud services deals in history, including LyondellBasell, one of the largest plastics, chemicals and refining companies in the world, who signed a $27 million HPE GreenLake deal to drive their digital transformation and environmental efficiency. Underpinning our customer cloud experience is the need for software. That is why we introduced our new HPE Ezmeral software portfolio. Our new portfolio includes a container platform that deploys Kubernetes at scale for a wide range of use cases on bare metal and virtual machines; a data fabric that delivers enterprise-wide global access to data from edge to cloud with best-in-class reliability, security and performance; and machine learning operations solution that increases speed and agility for machine learning ops by operationalizing end-to-end processes from pilot to production; as well as IT operations and automation to improve productivity and mitigate risk of service disruption. In addition, it enables our customer to control cost and compliance across their hybrid cloud estate through our managed cloud control capabilities built into the portfolio. HPE Ezmeral can be consumed as a license or as a part of our HPE GreenLake cloud services offering.
And just a few weeks ago, as a strong endorsement of our strategy and capabilities, we announced plans to partner with SAP to deliver the customer edition of SAP HANA Enterprise Cloud with HPE GreenLake cloud services. This new joint solution will help customers leverage our cloud capabilities while keeping their SAP workloads and data on-premises.
At the same time, we continued to strengthen our core capabilities in Storage and Compute, which are essential resources to store and process customers' data. Every 60 seconds, we ship 46 terabytes of storage and 4 servers. Despite the challenging market that impacted our Storage performance overall, in Q3, we saw sequential improvement of 4% and, importantly, we gained traction and grew in key areas of investment. Big data storage, which is built on unique intellectual property from our MapR acquisition to enable real-time analytics for mission-critical big data workloads, grew revenues 31% year-over-year. Nimble distributed HCI, our new hyper-converged solution for business-critical applications and mixed workloads at scale grew revenue at 112% year-over-year.
And a great example of our organic innovation is HPE Primera, our most intelligent storage platform, grew revenues 114% year-over-year. HPE Primera gained 104 new logos this quarter, with nearly 1/4 of those being new to HPE Storage. We saw strong sequential momentum with HPC and Mission-Critical Systems that grew 10%, including a 10-year deal of $125 million with the University of Edinburgh in Scotland, who chose HPE to power the Edinburgh International Data Facility with our industry-leading HPC and AI solutions.
And finally, we had a very solid quarter in Compute, with 29% quarter-over-quarter growth, driven by the reduction in backlog and customer demand in VDI, or virtual desktop infrastructure, solutions. For example, Erasmus University Medical Center in the Netherlands wanted to upgrade its VDI environment for life cycle management needs and to prepare for future waves of COVID-19. We introduced a complete composable hyper-converged infrastructure solution based on HPE Synergy, along with HPE Primera, to meet our needs.
Our Intelligent Edge business performed in line with the market in Q3. We continued to see the edge as a significant opportunity over the long term. The explosion of data, devices and application will drive demand for secure multi-protocol connectivity, analytics and cloud computing capabilities at the edge, especially in the post-COVID world.
We are now entering the age of insights, driven by the amount of data we are generating and the utilization of new analytic tools, such as machine learning and artificial intelligence technologies. Customers are looking to power a new breed of applications and workloads that work in concert with cloud, but analyze and process data at the edge. To enable these new customer needs, we introduced the Aruba Edge Services Platform, or Aruba ESP, the industry-first AI-powered cloud platform designed for -- to unify, automate and secure the edge. The Aruba ESP combines AIOps, Aruba -- Zero Trust security and a unified infrastructure with financial and consumption flexibility, and we are seeing early customer adoption. Noble Hospitality, a luxury lifestyle brand, is standardizing on Aruba Edge services Platform as their edge cloud foundation for the hotel chain. The ability to generate actionable analytics where the data is created and deliver new on-property experiences for guests was critical to their decision.
We also announced our plans to acquire SD-WAN leader, Silver Peak. Silver Peak's advanced SD-WAN offerings strengthened our Aruba ESP and complements Aruba's existing work-from-home and branch office solutions to deliver one of the industry's most comprehensive portfolios designed to securely connect any edge to any cloud. The combination, which is expected to close in Q4 of this fiscal year, will allow enterprise customers to simplify their branch office and WAN deployments to empower remote workforces, enable cloud-native deployments and transform business operations without compromising quality or reliability. This is a great example of accelerating our strategy while maintaining a disciplined approach to capital allocation.
Building on our 5G Core Stack launch in March, we introduced a new telco Edge Orchestrator solution for telecom operators. This new solution provides revenue opportunities for telecoms in the enterprise market with 1-click deployment of applications at the edge of the new 5G networks. We are receiving positive feedback on our 5G offerings. For example, we announced an innovative technical demonstration of an automated virtual 5G network conducted with a French telecom operator, Orange, and telco infrastructure solutions provider Casa Systems. The demo highlights the expanding use cases and service agility needed to support 5G business applications, including location-based telemetry, IoT, edge computing and more that will require low latency.
Our ability to innovate for our customers is made possible by strong financial management that strengthen our core financial foundation and allows us to align resources to the most critical areas. As we exited Q2, you will recall that we took a number of decisive and prudent actions to manage our business through the evolving impacts of COVID-19. This included several short-term initiatives to reduce operating expenses and drive efficiencies as well as the introduction of a long-term cost optimization and prioritization plan designed to accelerate sustainable profitable growth. We remain on track to deliver the annualized net run rate savings of at least $800 million by the end of fiscal year '22, driven by optimizing our workplace site strategy, simplifying our product portfolio and introducing new digital customer engagement models. These efforts, backed by our diversified portfolio, robust balance sheet and investment-grade credit rating, will allow us to continue to invest in key growth areas.
In closing, I am proud of our Q3 performance, and I am proud of our HPE team. Our team members have been steadfast partners for our customers through an unprecedented period. They have moved quickly to address rapidly evolving market conditions. They have innovated with our customers in mind. They have made personal sacrifices to invest in our company's future. They have passionately committed to help HPE play a role in shaping a more equitable and inclusive society. And they have done all of this while managing the challenges of living through a global pandemic. Put it more simply, my HPE colleagues have represented our values, lived our culture and delivered on our purpose to advance the way people even work. As a result of the efforts, HPE is stronger and better able to serve our customers, partners and communities in a world that's forever changed.
While we continue to navigate through the global pandemic and macro uncertainty, we are cautiously optimistic that we will see gradual quarter-over-quarter performance improvement going forward. This is why we are providing guidance for our fiscal year '20 non-GAAP EPS, which Tarek will discuss. We look forward to seeing you virtually at our Securities Analyst Meeting on October 15, where we will provide more details about our long-term plans.
And with that, let me turn it over to Tarek to review the quarter's results."

I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2020. As usual, I'll be referencing the slides from our earnings presentation to highlight our performance in the quarter. Also, let me remind you that since the start of the fiscal year, we are reporting results according to our new segmentation.
Antonio discussed the key highlights for this quarter on Slide 4. Now let me discuss our financial performance, starting with Slide 5. Q3 was characterized by strong execution, driving sequential growth. We delivered Q3 revenues of $6.8 billion, up 14% sequentially and down 4% from the prior year period. I am especially pleased to report that we have made significant progress in clearing our backlog by more than $500 million during the quarter. We expect a return to normalized backlog levels as we exit Q4 2020. As a result, we have grown non-GAAP gross profit by 8% sequentially to $2.1 billion in Q3. Non-GAAP gross margins were 30.4% this quarter, down 160 basis points sequentially, driven by a higher mix of Compute as we executed against our backlog from prior quarters. Normalizing for the effect of backlog, both our Compute and Storage business segments grew gross margin on a sequential basis. Our non-GAAP operating profit was up 33% sequentially, resulting in a 7.1% operating margin, and our non-GAAP EPS of $0.32 and was up 45% sequentially. Our GAAP EPS was $0.01 as we accelerated our transformation program and incurred restructuring costs.
Q3 cash flow from operations was approximately $1.5 billion, driven by strong operational execution. Free cash flow was $924 million, up $276 million from the prior year period, driven primarily by favorable working capital movements that I will detail later. Finally, we paid $154 million of dividends in the quarter and are declaring a Q4 dividend today of $0.12 per share payable October 7, 2020.
Let's move to Slide 6, which shows our performance in the quarter by segment. Here are the highlights. In the Intelligent Edge segment, we grew revenues 3% quarter-over-quarter, in line with the market. While wireless LAN declined single digit sequentially, we grew the campus switching business 12% quarter-over-quarter. In North America, our largest geo, revenue grew 4% quarter-over-quarter, demonstrating our continued momentum. Operating margin in Q3 was 8.6%, down 240 basis points quarter-over-quarter, impacted primarily by higher logistics and duties costs in this current environment.
In Compute, revenue grew 29% quarter-over-quarter as we executed against the backlog and improved our supply chain execution. Not only did units grow strong double digits sequentially, AUP grew 3% quarter-over-quarter as well. The increased operating leverage in this segment resulted in an operating profit margin of 8.5%, up 380 basis points quarter-over-quarter.
In High Performance Compute & Mission-Critical Systems, revenue grew 10% quarter-over-quarter, driven by strong performance in edge compute, HPC Apollo and MCS, up sequentially 82%, 16% and 2%, respectively. We expect to see sequential momentum next quarter driven by increased customer acceptance for HPC & MCS and Cray as we execute against the order book across the portfolio. Most importantly, Cray remains on track to deliver both on its FY '20 revenue targets and triple-digit run rate synergies by the end of fiscal year '21.
Within Storage, we grew revenue 4% quarter-over-quarter, driven by strong operational execution across the segment portfolio of products and reduction of backlog to normalized levels. With respect to Pointnext operational services, which is included across our Compute, HPC, MCS and Storage segments, total revenue was down 2%, while orders grew 1% on a sequential basis. Additionally, our services intensity, which is the ratio of attach revenue per hardware units sold continued to be strong with solid double-digit growth on a sequential basis across all segments: Compute, Storage and HPC & MCS. This demonstrates that the underlying profitability of the units we sell and the attach rates continue to be robust.
In Advisory & Professional Services, revenue was down 4% sequentially as COVID impacted consulting activity and the chargeability levels of our staff. This business is strategically important for us as it helps customers navigate through their digital transformation and also pulls through significant infrastructure and operational services orders.
Within HPE Financial Services, financing volume was up 1% quarter-over-quarter despite the impact of COVID-19, and our net portfolio of assets was up 4% this quarter, driven primarily by FX movements. We maintained a solid return on equity of approximately 13% this quarter. Our bad debt loss ratio this quarter was 74 basis points, which was slightly higher than previous quarters, is still best-in-class within this industry. I am particularly pleased by the collection performance in HPEFS, which attests to the quality of the book and the HPEFS franchise overall. I will come back to that later on.
Our Communications and Media Solutions business that is included in our Corporate Investments segment, is strategically important to us, providing software and services capabilities to telco service providers. Revenue was down 4% sequentially due to first half slowdown in services bookings. However, due to our improved cost of delivery, we're able to expand operating margins by 30 basis points quarter-over-quarter. We continue to make good progress in our 5G core strategy that provides multi-vendor integration and true cloud-native telco networks functions.
Slide 7 shows our growing ARR profile, which I introduced at our Securities Analyst Meeting in October 2019. I am very pleased to report that our Q3 '20 ARR came in at $528 million, representing 11% year-over-year growth. GreenLake service orders were up 82% year-over-year in constant currency, driven by outstanding performance in North America, which delivered 5x year-over-year growth. Our HPE Aruba Central SaaS platform continued to grow revenue strong double digits year-over-year as well. Based on strong customer demand, I am confident to reiterate our ARR growth guidance of 30% to 40% CAGR from fiscal year '19 to fiscal year '22.
Slide 8 highlights our EPS performance to date. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.32 in Q3, up 45% sequentially from Q2 driven by improved operating leverage, cost control and lower OI&E expenses. We now expect fiscal year '20 OI&E to be significantly less than our $100 million expense guidance provided at SAM 2019, driven by higher earnings from equity interest in HPC and better cost of debt resulting from our balance sheet funding diversification strategy that I will elaborate further on.
Turning to gross margin on Slide 9. And as I mentioned previously, non-GAAP gross profit was up 8% sequentially due to improved operating leverage. At 30.4% of revenues, our gross margin was down 160 basis points quarter-over-quarter driven by higher mix of compute as we executed against our elevated backlog from the prior quarter. Most importantly, and normalizing for the effect of backlog, both Compute and Storage business segments grew gross margins on a sequential basis.
Moving to Slide 10. Non-GAAP operating margin was 7.1% in Q3 of fiscal year '20 and non-GAAP operating income of $484 million was up 33% quarter-over-quarter. A combination of improved operating leverage and disciplined cost controls enabled us to improve profitability on a sequential basis. Last quarter, let me say this, we were prescient by proactively announcing ahead of other industry players a cost optimization and prioritization plan that would deliver annualized net run rate savings of at least $800 million by the end of fiscal year '22. We are making excellent progress there and are very much on track to emerge stronger in the post-COVID world. The actions we outlined as part of that plan to transform our core by optimizing our cost structure and aligning our resources through deep segmentation to key growth areas are now clearly starting to bear fruit.
Turning to Slide 11. We generated cash flow from operations of approximately $1.5 billion. This is the highest level for the past 11 quarters, as we improved our operational execution. Free cash flow was $924 million for the quarter, driven by timing of working capital movements that resulted in favorability in Q3. Overall, we saw an improvement in our cash conversion cycle for minus 5 days in the prior quarter to minus 10 days this quarter. For Q4, we expect free cash flow to be sequentially lower mainly due to 2 reasons: number one, working capital will be use of cash; and number two, higher restructuring payments related to our core transformation plan we announced in Q2.
As you recall, during the lockdown, we discussed our company exposure by industry vertical and company size and explained in detail that our business is highly resilient. As a proof point, I would like to highlight the performance of our credit collection teams in both our operating company and in HPEFS. Thanks to their contribution during the quarter, the level of our ARR that is current is at a record high of 99.5%, which attests of the strength of the HPE business and the quality of our franchise.
Now moving on to Slide 12, I want to spend a moment to talk about the strength of our diversified balance sheet and liquidity position and provide some insight on the puts and takes on forthcoming adjustments to our cash and debt positions. As of our 31st of July quarter end, we had approximately $8.5 billion of cash and cash equivalents, having successfully raised $1.75 billion in senior notes in July 2020 at a low cost of debt.
Post the quarter end, we redeemed $3 billion of bonds maturing in October 2020. Together with an undrawn revolving credit facility of $4.75 billion at our disposal, we currently have approximately $10.3 billion of liquidity after the redemption of the notes maturing in October 2020. Additionally, we expect to pay $925 million cash when we complete the proposed acquisition of Silver Peak, which is expected to close in Q4 of fiscal year '20. Adjusted for these known changes, our OpCo gross debt would be lower by $3 billion to approximately $4.4 billion, and our OpCo cash will also be lower by $3.9 billion to approximately $4 billion, resulting in an OpCo net debt of approximately $400 million.
Separately, we have securitized some Financial Services-related debt through the ABS market in the U.S., and as of July 301st quarter end, we have approximately $2.1 billion in outstanding ABS issuances. The refinancing of higher-cost unsecured debt with ABS financing allows us to boost access to financing markets at cheaper cost of capital, which helps diversify our balance sheet and lower interest expense payments in the future. Finally, I would like to reiterate that we remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade credit rating, which was reaffirmed by the rating agencies in July 2020. Bottom line, we have a strong cash position and ample liquidity available to run our operations, continue to invest in our business and execute on our strategy.
Now turning to outlook on Slide 13. Given the progress made in our operations, we are now in a position to provide guidance on fiscal year '20 EPS. We expect to finish fiscal year '20 with non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $1.30 to $1.34, and we expect our fiscal year '20 GAAP diluted net loss per share to be between $0.35 and $0.31.
Let me recap our key takeaways for this quarter on Slide 14. We delivered strong sequential improvement in top and bottom line and significantly improved operational and supply chain execution. We also accelerated our as-a-service pivot with very strong momentum in ARR and record GreenLake services order growth. We're taking actions to strengthen our financial foundation and align resources to critical areas to transform our core and drive sustainable profitable growth. At this stage, given all of this, we expect gradual sequential performance improvement moving forward. In Q3, we paid $154 million in dividends to shareholders. We recognize that dividends are an important part of our capital allocation framework and returns to shareholders, and today, we are very pleased to declare a Q4 dividend of $0.12 per share payable on October 7, 2020.
On a personal note, I'd like to echo Antonio's comments. We are both very proud of the way our company and team members quickly and decisively responded to the unprecedented challenges that the global COVID-19 pandemic has caused. As Antonio mentioned, we look forward to having you join us at our virtual Securities Analyst Meeting on October 15, where we will provide an update on our strategy, financial outlook and capital management policy.
Now with that, let's open it up for questions. Thank you."

So I spent probably 50% of my time talking to customers and partners, so I have a pretty good insight of what we see in the market. What we see right now, first of all, and I made this comment in my remarks, we see steady demand and, obviously, there are areas which are stronger than others. But the general sense is as follows. First of all, they're looking to strengthen their operations and, therefore, IT plays a huge role with that, and IT resiliency is more important than ever. So anything that comes with security and enables them to digitize their processes is on the growth side.
Second is, obviously, they have a lot of data, and they need to get insight from that data. And we see an acceleration of solutions related to AI and machine learning, and that's why our big data storage saw another great, solid performance. But obviously, ML ops, and that's why we introduced an offer with HPE GreenLake cloud services around machine learning operations, is in high demand.
Obviously, as we look at the workforce, I think there are permanent and lasting changes to how we're going to work in the future. Remote connectivity is essential. And that's why I'm so excited about the acquisition of Silver Peak because together with Aruba services platform give us now the ability to provide connectivity for all the edges and the edge now is your home office, right? I consider that the micro branch to any cloud. And obviously, there are multiple clouds because it's a hybrid strategy.
And then anything that preserves CapEx is also in high demand and that's why we see significant momentum with our HP GreenLake cloud services because that's a true conceived as-a-service offering. And so obviously, that's in transition. What we see is a transition period, but I would say the enterprise has been steady. Obviously, SMB is a challenge -- from a customer segmentation perspective, is a challenge.
When I look at the verticals, I think the financial sector where you play is still very solid and the manufacturing side as well. Education, obviously, now is going to be very important. And the public sector, the public sector is very strong. And obviously, we have a unique portfolio there with our HPC and AI solutions, but also around storage as well. So that's the general theme, Shannon, that we see at this point in time.
In terms of budgets, obviously, they are assessing what happens in the context of their own revenues and profit. But overall, I will say the enterprise, which is where we participate the most, is fairly steady, and that's what Tarek meant we have a very diversified and resilient portfolio, both by customer segment and by solution."

There's still some, but that's why we feel very confident that we can totally get back to the historical levels by the end of Q4. We grew sequentially double digits in units and AUP, 3%. If you recall, commodity cost has been inflationary in the first part of the year, and we took quite significant actions on pricing and that's why our AUPs went up because of pricing, but also because of the structural changes we continue to see in that type of products. I mentioned we shipped 46 terabytes of storage, and that's not just storage in a traditional storage platform, it goes with compute, right; and 4 servers.
I think, as you think about going forward, obviously, we'll continue to be very disciplined on pricing. In terms of commodity costs, in particular, DRAM, we've started seeing some decline, honestly. The curve is pointing downwards. But as I said before, and we lived this in 2018, right, when prices go up -- when cost goes up, prices go up faster and when the cost goes down, it takes longer. But ultimately, the next generation of our compute platform will drive even more richer configurations because there will be more gigabyte per unit that will be attached to it. And so that's why we feel good about where we are today. But that's what we see in Compute right now, it is still very competitive, there's no question about it. But the demand is shifting between enterprise, public sector and, obviously, the service provider segment."

I mean as I said before, everything in our life computes, which means Compute is embedded everywhere, not just in a server, and a lot of our storage platform is basically a compute platform with software, right? Big data storage is a great example of that. It is an Apollo platform that runs our AI software on it. It's hard to predict exactly what's going to happen there, but we saw steady demand again. We, obviously, have reallocated resources, particularly in our go-to-market where we see the growth opportunity as well. And we will continue to drive what the focus is, particularly in areas like VDI, which in essence, is a Compute product with a bunch of software. Traditional Compute per se, in general purpose workloads, those obviously have been kind of weakened over time, have been declining. But overall, I think a combination of AUPs, pricing, obviously, action and richer configuration, we should maintain a level of stability at this point in time considering that 2020 was fairly depressed overall.
In terms of the edge, we believe we grew in line with the market. If I look at our competitors, what they announced, I think, is in line with the market. But we saw strength, as Tarek said, in switching, which was up sequentially, 12%. Obviously, we continue to see quite a bit of strength in our subscription-based model with our Aruba platform. And also, we saw quite a bit of strength as well on the solutions around we provide, particularly remote work solutions or remote connectivity. For us, this is a business that has the long-term future. The thesis is totally intact. The Silver Peak acquisition will, obviously, accelerate the growth of Aruba going forward as well."

Now back to the first part of your question with respect to free cash flow. Free cash flow was exceptionally strong in Q3 as we work through the backlog, right? So this has been very, very solid and, particularly, we were able to work through the backlog and improve the cash conversion cycle. Also, we benefited from temporary favorable timing of working capital, and that component will reverse in Q4. And so in Q4, like I mentioned in my script, expect free cash flow to be lower than Q3 as a result of 2 components: one is the restructuring cost; and number two, the working capital changes. And specifically, if you want a little bit more guidance as to where in working capital the change will come, it's predominantly in payables that you will see a change that will be adverse to the generation of free cash flow."

So thank you, Katy, and I'm sure you will all be normalizing for backlog on every aspect of our business, so I want to take the opportunity to clarify this and leaving no shadows for doubt. So as you recall, in Q2, we said we exited with executable backlog in excess of $1.5 billion, which was 2x the level that we would normally see in our operations, so essentially, $750 million above the level that we normally have in our business. We reduced that $750 million by $500 million in Q3, the rest we believe we can reduce by Q4. So even if you normalize for the $500 million, and I'll let you do all the calculations, you will see that the underlying revenue performance Q3 on Q2 is better. And also, if you really ask where did that backlog get reduced, in which segment, in particular, it was mainly Compute and a tiny bit in Storage. That's where the $500 million come from. And even if you look at Compute back onto Wamsi's questions before, and you normalize for the reduction in backlog, you will observe that Compute was growing sequentially even after the normalization.
We also want to underscore the fact that the backlog reduction hides a little bit what happens at the gross margin level, right? It's very difficult for you to see this at your end. But we did -- both of us reiterate the fact that, with the pricing actions we have taken and once you normalized for backlog, both Compute and Storage saw their underlying gross margins going up. And this is partly the reason why we've done so well in growing our gross profit 8% sequentially in the year. So that, hopefully, answers the backlog question -- or part of your question.
On GreenLake, it's true that you're saying that Q-on-Q, the ARR decelerated, but the practical reality is where you look at the lead indicators that make the ARR is the order growth. The order growth that we've had in Q3, it's the record -- at record levels. We didn't experience an 82% order growth in GreenLake, and we feel very good about this order growth because we're seeing bigger deals with larger companies. And the companies that Antonio quoted are not small companies that typically start with a little spend that is valuable on their IT infrastructure. These are bigger companies that are considering as-a-service consumption as a new way to handle their IT expenditures. So Antonio, maybe you would like to add to that?"

Actually, I will say a couple of things to that comment on the backlog, Katy. I mean this is product shipped, right? Not all of the products was totally recognizable in the quarter, particularly in HPC because if you remember right, in the HPC segment, we got to ship it, we have to install it, we have to turn it on, and we have to run the test. And only and only when the customer signs up for the acceptance, then we can recognize revenue. And that's why we still have quite an interesting opportunity in Q4 with HPC in particular. But in Compute, once you ship it, you recognize it. So overall, very pleased with that. But even when you factor the backlog out, we actually grew sequentially on net new orders. And the net new orders, to Tarek's point, came at higher margins because of our pricing actions. The problem is the backlog was kind of dilutive to the margins because we price-protect our customers, obviously, and we stand on that commitment and also the channel, right?
On the GreenLake, I mean, this is an amazing performance. As I said in my comment, I think, it is, we believe -- I believe, is faster growth than any cloud out there. And it has -- it really comes down to the ability to provide a hybrid experience. What customers are telling us, they don't want to be on the wrong side of the house anymore, but they understand they have to have apps and data everywhere. 70% of the apps and data still on-prem, by the way, and more apps and data are moving to the edge. But ultimately, even if they have apps and data in public cloud, they like the GreenLake because it provides them the cost control, the managed aspect of it, and we can run it for them in a truly hybrid approach. And when they keep the apps and data on-prem, we give them the exact same consumption model or whether they move it to the edge. And their value proposition is resonating more and more because the world is hybrid, cloud is an experience and, obviously, our software capabilities, they are playing a huge role together with our innovation on the business model side and, obviously, the financing.
So that's what we see. And the ARR will take care of itself because, obviously, there is puts and takes because, remember, ARR is a consumption-driven metric of it and, as we go forward, very, very confident to hit that 30% to 40%."

So your math is right, but operationally, things are slightly different, meaning if you normalize Q3 performance for the $500 million, yes, you get to $6.3 billion, but it's not entirely operationally correct to add the $500 million to Q2 because as part of the backlog, you do have orders that ship in quarter but are not invoiced. You do have all sorts of different effects that come into play that distort that picture. So there is a limit to the normalization math that we can give. The simple point is, it's all about timing. Look, it's all about timing. This revenue should have materialized in fiscal year '20. It is materializing in fiscal year '20. And we're back to normalized levels of backlog by the end of fiscal year '20. We've taken $500 million of backlog down. There's another, you've done the math, $250 million to go. There's also another aspect that Antonio underscored before in HPC & MCS, it's very, very important for all of you to understand and it's the following. Specifically for that segment, it's slightly different than other segments because these systems are super sophisticated and even if we ship and land the system on customer premises, before we can actually invoice the customer, there's a technical acceptance process that takes place that delays our ability to invoice the customer. And so that is also fundamentally changing the trajectory of HPC & MCS, and we see very, very strong order demand in the public sector, which underpins the HPC & MCS segment, and you'll see the fruits of that in the foreseeable quarters.
The conclusion of it is, whatever happens on backlog is an FY '20 phenomenon driven by COVID, and there were -- essentially in Q1, the fact that we had, you remember, component shortages, the whole industry experienced those, this translated in Q2 into manufacturing closures, where manufacturing was not at the full level. And then now this issue has morphed into being, specifically for HPC & MCS, a customer acceptance issue. So all in all, what matters is that the revenue of fiscal year '20 is actually the same if you factor into the equation the fact that we will reduce the backlog we generated and we saw elevated at the end of Q2, we'll turn that into revenue by the end of Q4 in full."

We have installations which are very large. It takes many, many weeks. And obviously, the global pandemic, the COVID, is not allowing us to have a lot of people on site for cabling and all that as well. And even if we ship it, in many cases, depending on the timing, on the kind of more of the normal type of products, we may have a ship to, not invoice, which basically, yes, from the supply chain, it was taken care, but not from the revenue recognition perspective. That type of situation gets resolved, generally speaking, within a handful of weeks. On the HPC, it depends on customer by customer. But the point on HPC is very strong and, obviously, we have a go-forward [indiscernible] a month of business, which is very sizable for us, and that's very good."

And then just on the Compute margins. They were down 440 basis points year-over-year despite flat volumes. Is that really the impact of the rising component prices?

We did also articulate the fact that if you normalize for backlog, which did have an impact on gross margins, both in Compute and Storage, our gross margins would be up. But also, what you can see at OP margin is the fact that we are starting to take cost out, and we are incurring restructuring costs as a result of this.
I want to take the opportunity to remind everyone about our cost optimization and prioritization plan that we announced in Q2. We took proactive steps to strengthen our financial profile. We're -- I would tell you, I take a lot of pride about this one because we were prescient, and we did it on time, being hit very hard in a full quarter of Q2 that was disrupted by COVID. And we are on track with that program to generate net annualized run rate savings of at least $800 million by the end of fiscal year '22 relative to the fiscal year '19 exit level, and with most of those savings achieved at the end of fiscal year '21.

Thank you for joining us today, and I hope everyone is staying safe and healthy. Overall, I am pleased with our Q3 performance. We executed well to enable strong sequential growth across our businesses. We gained momentum in key areas of differentiation driven by customer demand aligned to our strategy. And we began to take decisive and prudent actions to strengthen our core financial foundation while we continued to align resources to critical areas of growth.
COVID-19 has forced fundamental changes in businesses and communities. These changes have further validated our strategy. Navigating through the pandemic and planning for a post-COVID world has increased customer needs for as-a-service offerings, secure connectivity, remote work capabilities and analytics to unlock insights from data. Our solutions are aligned to these needs, and we see a tremendous opportunity to help our customers transform and digitize their businesses as they continue to adapt and operate in a new world.
Let me review a few highlights from the quarter. Total net revenue of $6.8 billion was up 14% quarter-over-quarter, and non-GAAP operating profit was up 33% quarter-over-quarter. Compute, HPC & MCS, Storage and Intelligent Edge business segments also grew sequentially. Moving forward, we expect continued gradual performance improvement.
We made significant improvements in our supply chain execution, reducing our backlog by more than $500 million from our Q2 historical high exit levels, which contributed to our results. In our HPC business, COVID-related impacts continued to affect our customers' ability to accept delivery of our products. We expect to return to normalized level of backlog by the end of Q4 through continued improvements in both supply chain execution and customer acceptances.
Our pivot to as-a-service continued its strong momentum in the quarter. Our annualized revenue run rate of $528 million grew 11% year-over-year. GreenLake services orders grew a record 82% year-over-year. We believe this is faster than the orders growth of public cloud vendors, and it is a validation of our hybrid strategy and competitive differentiation.
We are focused on delivering one seamless cloud experience for all applications and data, no matter where they exist: at the edge, in a data center, in a colocation or in a public cloud estate. While others are now publicly declaring plans to offer Everything-as-a-Service, we have been focused on this for several years and have made significant organic and inorganic investments to deliver a differentiated experience for our customers.
Our Q3 free cash flow of $924 million was up $276 million year-over-year, driven by a record cash flow from operations as a result of our improved execution this quarter. Importantly, we also declared our Q4 dividend today. Dividends remain an important part of our capital allocation framework that consists of capital return to shareholders and strategic investments that together drive long-term shareholder value.
Our customers are managing through the pandemic with even greater needs for the capabilities HPE can uniquely provide. In June, we put our strategy in the spotlight at our Discover Virtual Experience event, where we introduced new breakthrough innovation on a global virtual stage. The new solutions we introduced support our position that cloud is an experience, not a destination, and they're already gaining traction with our customers.
We launched our next-generation of HPE GreenLake cloud services. These new cloud services span machine learning operations, container management, virtualization, Infrastructure-as-a-Service, data protection and Connectivity-as-a-Service. Now our customers can access all of our HPE GreenLake cloud services via a self-service point-and-click catalog on our HPE GreenLake Central cloud portal.
Notably, in Q3, we signed several of our largest HPE GreenLake cloud services deals in history, including LyondellBasell, one of the largest plastics, chemicals and refining companies in the world, who signed a $27 million HPE GreenLake deal to drive their digital transformation and environmental efficiency. Underpinning our customer cloud experience is the need for software. That is why we introduced our new HPE Ezmeral software portfolio. Our new portfolio includes a container platform that deploys Kubernetes at scale for a wide range of use cases on bare metal and virtual machines; a data fabric that delivers enterprise-wide global access to data from edge to cloud with best-in-class reliability, security and performance; and machine learning operations solution that increases speed and agility for machine learning ops by operationalizing end-to-end processes from pilot to production; as well as IT operations and automation to improve productivity and mitigate risk of service disruption. In addition, it enables our customer to control cost and compliance across their hybrid cloud estate through our managed cloud control capabilities built into the portfolio. HPE Ezmeral can be consumed as a license or as a part of our HPE GreenLake cloud services offering.
And just a few weeks ago, as a strong endorsement of our strategy and capabilities, we announced plans to partner with SAP to deliver the customer edition of SAP HANA Enterprise Cloud with HPE GreenLake cloud services. This new joint solution will help customers leverage our cloud capabilities while keeping their SAP workloads and data on-premises.
At the same time, we continued to strengthen our core capabilities in Storage and Compute, which are essential resources to store and process customers' data. Every 60 seconds, we ship 46 terabytes of storage and 4 servers. Despite the challenging market that impacted our Storage performance overall, in Q3, we saw sequential improvement of 4% and, importantly, we gained traction and grew in key areas of investment. Big data storage, which is built on unique intellectual property from our MapR acquisition to enable real-time analytics for mission-critical big data workloads, grew revenues 31% year-over-year. Nimble distributed HCI, our new hyper-converged solution for business-critical applications and mixed workloads at scale grew revenue at 112% year-over-year.
And a great example of our organic innovation is HPE Primera, our most intelligent storage platform, grew revenues 114% year-over-year. HPE Primera gained 104 new logos this quarter, with nearly 1/4 of those being new to HPE Storage. We saw strong sequential momentum with HPC and Mission-Critical Systems that grew 10%, including a 10-year deal of $125 million with the University of Edinburgh in Scotland, who chose HPE to power the Edinburgh International Data Facility with our industry-leading HPC and AI solutions.
And finally, we had a very solid quarter in Compute, with 29% quarter-over-quarter growth, driven by the reduction in backlog and customer demand in VDI, or virtual desktop infrastructure, solutions. For example, Erasmus University Medical Center in the Netherlands wanted to upgrade its VDI environment for life cycle management needs and to prepare for future waves of COVID-19. We introduced a complete composable hyper-converged infrastructure solution based on HPE Synergy, along with HPE Primera, to meet our needs.
Our Intelligent Edge business performed in line with the market in Q3. We continued to see the edge as a significant opportunity over the long term. The explosion of data, devices and application will drive demand for secure multi-protocol connectivity, analytics and cloud computing capabilities at the edge, especially in the post-COVID world.
We are now entering the age of insights, driven by the amount of data we are generating and the utilization of new analytic tools, such as machine learning and artificial intelligence technologies. Customers are looking to power a new breed of applications and workloads that work in concert with cloud, but analyze and process data at the edge. To enable these new customer needs, we introduced the Aruba Edge Services Platform, or Aruba ESP, the industry-first AI-powered cloud platform designed for -- to unify, automate and secure the edge. The Aruba ESP combines AIOps, Aruba -- Zero Trust security and a unified infrastructure with financial and consumption flexibility, and we are seeing early customer adoption. Noble Hospitality, a luxury lifestyle brand, is standardizing on Aruba Edge services Platform as their edge cloud foundation for the hotel chain. The ability to generate actionable analytics where the data is created and deliver new on-property experiences for guests was critical to their decision.
We also announced our plans to acquire SD-WAN leader, Silver Peak. Silver Peak's advanced SD-WAN offerings strengthened our Aruba ESP and complements Aruba's existing work-from-home and branch office solutions to deliver one of the industry's most comprehensive portfolios designed to securely connect any edge to any cloud. The combination, which is expected to close in Q4 of this fiscal year, will allow enterprise customers to simplify their branch office and WAN deployments to empower remote workforces, enable cloud-native deployments and transform business operations without compromising quality or reliability. This is a great example of accelerating our strategy while maintaining a disciplined approach to capital allocation.
Building on our 5G Core Stack launch in March, we introduced a new telco Edge Orchestrator solution for telecom operators. This new solution provides revenue opportunities for telecoms in the enterprise market with 1-click deployment of applications at the edge of the new 5G networks. We are receiving positive feedback on our 5G offerings. For example, we announced an innovative technical demonstration of an automated virtual 5G network conducted with a French telecom operator, Orange, and telco infrastructure solutions provider Casa Systems. The demo highlights the expanding use cases and service agility needed to support 5G business applications, including location-based telemetry, IoT, edge computing and more that will require low latency.
Our ability to innovate for our customers is made possible by strong financial management that strengthen our core financial foundation and allows us to align resources to the most critical areas. As we exited Q2, you will recall that we took a number of decisive and prudent actions to manage our business through the evolving impacts of COVID-19. This included several short-term initiatives to reduce operating expenses and drive efficiencies as well as the introduction of a long-term cost optimization and prioritization plan designed to accelerate sustainable profitable growth. We remain on track to deliver the annualized net run rate savings of at least $800 million by the end of fiscal year '22, driven by optimizing our workplace site strategy, simplifying our product portfolio and introducing new digital customer engagement models. These efforts, backed by our diversified portfolio, robust balance sheet and investment-grade credit rating, will allow us to continue to invest in key growth areas.
In closing, I am proud of our Q3 performance, and I am proud of our HPE team. Our team members have been steadfast partners for our customers through an unprecedented period. They have moved quickly to address rapidly evolving market conditions. They have innovated with our customers in mind. They have made personal sacrifices to invest in our company's future. They have passionately committed to help HPE play a role in shaping a more equitable and inclusive society. And they have done all of this while managing the challenges of living through a global pandemic. Put it more simply, my HPE colleagues have represented our values, lived our culture and delivered on our purpose to advance the way people even work. As a result of the efforts, HPE is stronger and better able to serve our customers, partners and communities in a world that's forever changed.
While we continue to navigate through the global pandemic and macro uncertainty, we are cautiously optimistic that we will see gradual quarter-over-quarter performance improvement going forward. This is why we are providing guidance for our fiscal year '20 non-GAAP EPS, which Tarek will discuss. We look forward to seeing you virtually at our Securities Analyst Meeting on October 15, where we will provide more details about our long-term plans.
And with that, let me turn it over to Tarek to review the quarter's results."
273983758,683213884,2091853,"Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Aug 25, 2020",2020-08-25,"Earnings Calls","Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company","Executives","Thank you very much, Antonio.

I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2020. As usual, I'll be referencing the slides from our earnings presentation to highlight our performance in the quarter. Also, let me remind you that since the start of the fiscal year, we are reporting results according to our new segmentation.
Antonio discussed the key highlights for this quarter on Slide 4. Now let me discuss our financial performance, starting with Slide 5. Q3 was characterized by strong execution, driving sequential growth. We delivered Q3 revenues of $6.8 billion, up 14% sequentially and down 4% from the prior year period. I am especially pleased to report that we have made significant progress in clearing our backlog by more than $500 million during the quarter. We expect a return to normalized backlog levels as we exit Q4 2020. As a result, we have grown non-GAAP gross profit by 8% sequentially to $2.1 billion in Q3. Non-GAAP gross margins were 30.4% this quarter, down 160 basis points sequentially, driven by a higher mix of Compute as we executed against our backlog from prior quarters. Normalizing for the effect of backlog, both our Compute and Storage business segments grew gross margin on a sequential basis. Our non-GAAP operating profit was up 33% sequentially, resulting in a 7.1% operating margin, and our non-GAAP EPS of $0.32 was up 45% sequentially. Our GAAP EPS was $0.01 as we accelerated our transformation program and incurred restructuring costs.
Q3 cash flow from operations was approximately $1.5 billion, driven by strong operational execution. Free cash flow was $924 million, up $276 million from the prior year period, driven primarily by favorable working capital movements that I will detail later. Finally, we paid $154 million of dividends in the quarter and are declaring a Q4 dividend today of $0.12 per share payable October 7, 2020.
Let's move to Slide 6, which shows our performance in the quarter by segment. Here are the highlights. In the Intelligent Edge segment, we grew revenues 3% quarter-over-quarter, in line with the market. While wireless LAN declined single digit sequentially, we grew the campus switching business 12% quarter-over-quarter. In North America, our largest geo, revenue grew 4% quarter-over-quarter, demonstrating our continued momentum. Operating margin in Q3 was 8.6%, down 240 basis points quarter-over-quarter, impacted primarily by higher logistics and duties costs in this current environment.
In Compute, revenue grew 29% quarter-over-quarter as we executed against the backlog and improved our supply chain execution. Not only did units grow strong double digits sequentially, AUP grew 3% quarter-over-quarter as well. The increased operating leverage in this segment resulted in an operating profit margin of 8.5%, up 380 basis points quarter-over-quarter.
In High Performance Compute & Mission-Critical Systems, revenue grew 10% quarter-over-quarter, driven by strong performance in edge compute, HPC Apollo and MCS, up sequentially 82%, 16% and 2%, respectively. We expect to see sequential momentum next quarter driven by increased customer acceptance for HPC & MCS and Cray as we execute against the order book across the portfolio. Most importantly, Cray remains on track to deliver both on its FY '20 revenue targets and triple-digit run rate synergies by the end of fiscal year '21.
Within Storage, we grew revenue 4% quarter-over-quarter, driven by strong operational execution across the segment portfolio of products and reduction of backlog to normalized levels. With respect to Pointnext operational services, which is included across our Compute, HPC, MCS and Storage segments, total revenue was down 2%, while orders grew 1% on a sequential basis. Additionally, our services intensity, which is the ratio of attach revenue per hardware units sold continued to be strong with solid double-digit growth on a sequential basis across all segments: Compute, Storage and HPC & MCS. This demonstrates that the underlying profitability of the units we sell and the attach rates continue to be robust.
In Advisory & Professional Services, revenue was down 4% sequentially as COVID impacted consulting activity and the chargeability levels of our staff. This business is strategically important for us as it helps customers navigate through their digital transformation and also pulls through significant infrastructure and operational services orders.
Within HPE Financial Services, financing volume was up 1% quarter-over-quarter despite the impact of COVID-19, and our net portfolio of assets was up 4% this quarter, driven primarily by FX movements. We maintained a solid return on equity of approximately 13% this quarter. Our bad debt loss ratio this quarter was 74 basis points, which was slightly higher than previous quarters, is still best-in-class within this industry. I am particularly pleased by the collection performance in HPEFS, which attests to the quality of the book and the HPEFS franchise overall. I will come back to that later on.
Our Communications and Media Solutions business that is included in our Corporate Investments segment, is strategically important to us, providing software and services capabilities to telco service providers. Revenue was down 4% sequentially due to first half slowdown in services bookings. However, due to our improved cost of delivery, we're able to expand operating margins by 30 basis points quarter-over-quarter. We continue to make good progress in our 5G core strategy that provides multi-vendor integration and true cloud-native telco networks functions.
Slide 7 shows our growing ARR profile, which I introduced at our Securities Analyst Meeting in October 2019. I am very pleased to report that our Q3 '20 ARR came in at $528 million, representing 11% year-over-year growth. GreenLake service orders were up 82% year-over-year in constant currency, driven by outstanding performance in North America, which delivered 5x year-over-year growth. Our HPE Aruba Central SaaS platform continued to grow revenue strong double digits year-over-year as well. Based on strong customer demand, I am confident to reiterate our ARR growth guidance of 30% to 40% CAGR from fiscal year '19 to fiscal year '22.
Slide 8 highlights our EPS performance to date. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.32 in Q3, up 45% sequentially from Q2 driven by improved operating leverage, cost control and lower OI&E expenses. We now expect fiscal year '20 OI&E to be significantly less than our $100 million expense guidance provided at SAM 2019, driven by higher earnings from equity interest in HPC and better cost of debt resulting from our balance sheet funding diversification strategy that I will elaborate further on.
Turning to gross margin on Slide 9. And as I mentioned previously, non-GAAP gross profit was up 8% sequentially due to improved operating leverage. At 30.4% of revenues, our gross margin was down 160 basis points quarter-over-quarter driven by higher mix of compute as we executed against our elevated backlog from the prior quarter. Most importantly, and normalizing for the effect of backlog, both Compute and Storage business segments grew gross margins on a sequential basis.
Moving to Slide 10. Non-GAAP operating margin was 7.1% in Q3 of fiscal year '20 and non-GAAP operating income of $484 million was up 33% quarter-over-quarter. A combination of improved operating leverage and disciplined cost controls enabled us to improve profitability on a sequential basis. Last quarter, let me say this, we were prescient by proactively announcing ahead of other industry players a cost optimization and prioritization plan that would deliver annualized net run rate savings of at least $800 million by the end of fiscal year '22. We are making excellent progress there and are very much on track to emerge stronger in the post-COVID world. The actions we outlined as part of that plan to transform our core by optimizing our cost structure and aligning our resources through deep segmentation to key growth areas are now clearly starting to bear fruit.
Turning to Slide 11. We generated cash flow from operations of approximately $1.5 billion. This is the highest level for the past 11 quarters, as we improved our operational execution. Free cash flow was $924 million for the quarter, driven by timing of working capital movements that resulted in favorability in Q3. Overall, we saw an improvement in our cash conversion cycle for minus 5 days in the prior quarter to minus 10 days this quarter. For Q4, we expect free cash flow to be sequentially lower mainly due to 2 reasons: number one, working capital will be use of cash; and number two, higher restructuring payments related to our core transformation plan we announced in Q2.
As you recall, during the lockdown, we discussed our company exposure by industry vertical and company size and explained in detail that our business is highly resilient. As a proof point, I would like to highlight the performance of our credit collection teams in both our operating company and in HPEFS. Thanks to their contribution during the quarter, the level of our ARR that is current is at a record high of 99.5%, which attests of the strength of the HPE business and the quality of our franchise.
Now moving on to Slide 12, I want to spend a moment to talk about the strength of our diversified balance sheet and liquidity position and provide some insight on the puts and takes on forthcoming adjustments to our cash and debt positions. As of our 31st of July quarter end, we had approximately $8.5 billion of cash and cash equivalents, having successfully raised $1.75 billion in senior notes in July 2020 at a low cost of debt.
Post the quarter end, we redeemed $3 billion of bonds maturing in October 2020. Together with an undrawn revolving credit facility of $4.75 billion at our disposal, we currently have approximately $10.3 billion of liquidity after the redemption of the notes maturing in October 2020. Additionally, we expect to pay $925 million cash when we complete the proposed acquisition of Silver Peak, which is expected to close in Q4 of fiscal year '20. Adjusted for these known changes, our OpCo gross debt would be lower by $3 billion to approximately $4.4 billion, and our OpCo cash will also be lower by $3.9 billion to approximately $4 billion, resulting in an OpCo net debt of approximately $400 million.
Separately, we have securitized some Financial Services-related debt through the ABS market in the U.S., and as of July 301st quarter end, we have approximately $2.1 billion in outstanding ABS issuances. The refinancing of higher-cost unsecured debt with ABS financing allows us to boost access to financing markets at cheaper cost of capital, which helps diversify our balance sheet and lower interest expense payments in the future. Finally, I would like to reiterate that we remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade credit rating, which was reaffirmed by the rating agencies in July 2020. Bottom line, we have a strong cash position and ample liquidity available to run our operations, continue to invest in our business and execute on our strategy.
Now turning to outlook on Slide 13. Given the progress made in our operations, we are now in a position to provide guidance on fiscal year '20 EPS. We expect to finish fiscal year '20 with non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $1.30 to $1.34, and we expect our fiscal year '20 GAAP diluted net loss per share to be between $0.35 and $0.31.
Let me recap our key takeaways for this quarter on Slide 14. We delivered strong sequential improvement in top and bottom line and significantly improved operational and supply chain execution. We also accelerated our as-a-service pivot with very strong momentum in ARR and record GreenLake services order growth. We're taking actions to strengthen our financial foundation and align resources to critical areas to transform our core and drive sustainable profitable growth. At this stage, given all of this, we expect gradual sequential performance improvement moving forward. In Q3, we paid $154 million in dividends to shareholders. We recognize that dividends are an important part of our capital allocation framework and returns to shareholders, and today, we are very pleased to declare a Q4 dividend of $0.12 per share payable on October 7, 2020.
On a personal note, I'd like to echo Antonio's comments. We are both very proud of the way our company and team members quickly and decisively responded to the unprecedented challenges that the global COVID-19 pandemic has caused. As Antonio mentioned, we look forward to having you join us at our Virtual Securities Analyst Meeting on October 15, where we will provide an update on our strategy, financial outlook and capital management policy.
Now with that, let's open it up for questions. Thank you."

So I spent probably 50% of my time talking to customers and partners, so I have a pretty good insight of what we see in the market. What we see right now, first of all, and I made this comment in my remarks, we see steady demand and, obviously, there are areas which are stronger than others. But the general sense is as follows. First of all, they're looking to strengthen their operations and, therefore, IT plays a huge role with that, and IT resiliency is more important than ever. So anything that comes with security and enables them to digitize their processes is on the growth side.
Second is, obviously, they have a lot of data, and they need to get insight from that data. And we see an acceleration of solutions related to AI and machine learning, and that's why our big data storage saw another great, solid performance. But obviously, ML ops, and that's why we introduced an offer with HPE GreenLake cloud services around machine learning operations, is in high demand.
Obviously, as we look at the workforce, I think there are permanent and lasting changes to how we're going to work in the future. Remote connectivity is essential. And that's why I'm so excited about the acquisition of Silver Peak because together with Aruba services platform give us now the ability to provide connectivity for all the edges and the edge now is your home office, right? I consider that the micro branch to any cloud. And obviously, there are multiple clouds because it's a hybrid strategy.
And then anything that preserves CapEx is also in high demand and that's why we see significant momentum with our HP GreenLake cloud services because that's a true conceived as-a-service offering. And so obviously, that's in transition. What we see is a transition period, but I would say the enterprise has been steady. Obviously, SMB is a challenge -- from a customer segmentation perspective, is a challenge.
When I look at the verticals, I think the financial sector where you play is still very solid and the manufacturing side as well. Education, obviously, now is going to be very important. And the public sector, the public sector is very strong. And obviously, we have a unique portfolio there with our HPC and AI solutions, but also around storage as well. So that's the general theme, Shannon, that we see at this point in time.
In terms of budgets, obviously, they are assessing what happens in the context of their own revenues and profit. But overall, I will say the enterprise, which is where we participate the most, is fairly steady, and that's what Tarek meant we have a very diversified and resilient portfolio, both by customer segment and by solution."

There's still some, but that's why we feel very confident that we can totally get back to the historical levels by the end of Q4. We grew sequentially double digits in units and AUP, 3%. If you recall, commodity cost has been inflationary in the first part of the year, and we took quite significant actions on pricing and that's why our AUPs went up because of pricing, but also because of the structural changes we continue to see in that type of products. I mentioned we shipped 46 terabytes of storage, and that's not just storage in a traditional storage platform, it goes with compute, right; and for servers.
I think, as you think about going forward, obviously, we'll continue to be very disciplined on pricing. In terms of commodity costs, in particular, DRAM, we've started seeing some decline, honestly. The curve is pointing downwards. But as I said before, and we lived this in 2018, right, when prices go up -- when cost goes up, prices go up faster and when the cost goes down, it takes longer. But ultimately, the next generation of our compute platform will drive even more richer configurations because there will be more gigabyte per unit that will be attached to it. And so that's why we feel good about where we are today. But that's what we see in Compute right now, it is still very competitive, there's no question about it. But the demand is shifting between enterprise, public sector and, obviously, the service provider segment."

I mean as I said before, everything in our life computes, which means Compute is embedded everywhere, not just in a server, and a lot of our storage platform is basically a compute platform with software, right? Big data storage is a great example of that. It is an Apollo platform that runs our AI software on it. It's hard to predict exactly what's going to happen there, but we saw steady demand again. We, obviously, have reallocated resources, particularly in our go-to-market where we see the growth opportunity as well. And we will continue to drive what the focus is, particularly in areas like VDI, which is, in essence, is a Compute product with a bunch of software. Traditional Compute per se, in general purpose workloads, those obviously have been kind of weakened over time, have been declining. But overall, I think a combination of AUPs, pricing, obviously, action and richer configuration, we should maintain a level of stability at this point in time considering that 2020 was fairly depressed overall.
In terms of the edge, we believe we grew in line with the market. If I look at our competitors, what they announced, I think, is in line with the market. But we saw strength, as Tarek said, in switching, which was up sequentially, 12%. Obviously, we continue to see quite a bit of strength in our subscription-based model with our Aruba platform. And also, we saw quite a bit of strength as well on the solutions around we provide, particularly remote work solutions or remote connectivity. For us, this is a business that has the long-term future. The thesis is totally intact. The Silver Peak acquisition will, obviously, accelerate the growth of Aruba going forward as well."

It's pretty much in line with the guidance we gave you in Q2 for fiscal year '20. $300 million to $400 million is the cost we would incur for the restructuring.
Now back to the first part of your question with respect to free cash flow. Free cash flow was exceptionally strong in Q3 as we work through the backlog, right? So this has been very, very solid and, particularly, we were able to work through the backlog and improve the cash conversion cycle. Also, we benefited from temporary favorable timing of working capital, and that component will reverse in Q4. And so in Q4, like I mentioned in my script, expect free cash flow to be lower than Q3 as a result of 2 components: one is the restructuring cost; and number two, the working capital changes. And specifically, if you want a little bit more guidance as to where in working capital the change will come, it's predominantly in payables that you will see a change that will be adverse to the generation of free cash flow."

So thank you, Katy, and I'm sure you will all be normalizing for backlog on every aspect of our business, so I want to take the opportunity to clarify this and leaving no shadows for doubt. So as you recall, in Q2, we said we exited with executable backlog in excess of $1.5 billion, which was 2x the level that we would normally see in our operations, so essentially, $750 million above the level that we normally have in our business. We reduced that $750 million by $500 million in Q3, the rest we believe we can reduce by Q4. So even if you normalize for the $500 million, and I'll let you do all the calculations, you will see that the underlying revenue performance Q3 on Q2 is better. And also, if you really ask where did that backlog get reduced, in which segment, in particular, it was mainly Compute and a tiny bit in Storage. That's where the $500 million come from. And even if you look at Compute back onto Wamsi's questions before, and you normalize for the reduction in backlog, you will observe that Compute was growing sequentially even after the normalization.
We also want to underscore the fact that the backlog reduction hides a little bit what happens at the gross margin level, right? It's very difficult for you to see this at your end. But we did -- both of us reiterate the fact that, with the pricing actions we have taken and once you normalized for backlog, both Compute and Storage saw their underlying gross margins going up. And this is partly the reason why we've done so well in growing our gross profit 8% sequentially in the year. So that, hopefully, answers the backlog question -- or part of your question.
On GreenLake, it's true that you're saying that Q-on-Q, the ARR decelerated, but the practical reality is where you look at the lead indicators that make the ARR is the order growth. The order growth that we've had in Q3, it's the record -- at record levels. We didn't experience an 82% order growth in GreenLake, and we feel very good about this order growth because we're seeing bigger deals with larger companies. And the companies that Antonio quoted are not small companies that typically start with a little spend that is valuable on their IT infrastructure. These are bigger companies that are considering as-a-service consumption as a new way to handle their IT expenditures. So Antonio, maybe you would like to add to that?"

Actually, I will say a couple of things to that comment on the backlog, Katy. I mean this is product shipped, right? Not all of the products was totally recognizable in the quarter, particularly in HPC because if you remember right, in the HPC segment, we got to ship it, we have to install it, we have to turn it on, and we have to run the test. And only and only when the customer signs up for the acceptance, then we can recognize revenue. And that's why we still have quite an interesting opportunity in Q4 with HPC in particular. But in Compute, once you ship it, you recognize it. So overall, very pleased with that. But even when you factor the backlog out, we actually grew sequentially on net new orders. And the net new orders, to Tarek's point, came at higher margins because of our pricing actions. The problem is the backlog was kind of dilutive to the margins because we price-protect our customers, obviously, and we stand on that commitment and also the channel, right?
On the GreenLake, I mean, this is an amazing performance. As I said in my comment, I think, it is, we believe -- I believe, is faster growth than any cloud out there. And it has -- it really comes down to the ability to provide a hybrid experience. What customers are telling us, they don't want to be on the wrong side of the house anymore, but they understand they have to have apps and data everywhere. 70% of the apps and data still on-prem, by the way, and more apps and data are moving to the edge. But ultimately, even if they have apps and data in public cloud, they like the GreenLake because it provides them the cost control, the managed aspect of it, and we can run it for them in a truly hybrid approach. And when they keep the apps and data on-prem, we give them the exact same consumption model or whether they move it to the edge. And their value proposition is resonating more and more because the world is hybrid, cloud is an experience and, obviously, our software capabilities, they are playing a huge role together with our innovation on the business model side and, obviously, the financing.
So that's what we see. And the ARR will take care of itself because, obviously, there is puts and takes because, remember, ARR is a consumption-driven metric of it and, as we go forward, very, very confident to hit that 30% to 40%."

So your math is right, but operationally, things are slightly different, meaning if you normalize Q3 performance for the $500 million, yes, you get to $6.3 billion, but it's not entirely operationally correct to add the $500 million to Q2 because as part of the backlog, you do have orders that ship in quarter but are not invoiced. You do have all sorts of different effects that come into play that distort that picture. So there is a limit to the normalization math that we can give. The simple point is, it's all about timing. Look, it's all about timing. This revenue should have materialized in fiscal year '20. It is materializing in fiscal year '20. And we're back to normalized levels of backlog by the end of fiscal year '20. We've taken $500 million of backlog down. There's another, you've done the math, $250 million to go. There's also another aspect that Antonio underscored before in HPC & MCS, it's very, very important for all of you to understand and it's the following. Specifically for that segment, it's slightly different than other segments because these systems are super sophisticated and even if we ship and land the system on customer premises, before we can actually invoice the customer, there's a technical acceptance process that takes place that delays our ability to invoice the customer. And so that is also fundamentally changing the trajectory of HPC & MCS, and we see very, very strong order demand in the public sector, which underpins the HPC & MCS segment, and you'll see the fruits of that in the foreseeable quarters.
The conclusion of it is, whatever happens on backlog is an FY '20 phenomenon driven by COVID, and there were -- essentially in Q1, the fact that we had, you remember, component shortages, the whole industry experienced those, this translated in Q2 into manufacturing closures, where manufacturing was not at the full level. And then now this issue has morphed into being, specifically for HPC & MCS, a customer acceptance issue. So all in all, what matters is that the revenue of fiscal year '20 is actually the same if you factor into the equation the fact that we will reduce the backlog we generated and we saw elevated at the end of Q2, we'll turn that into revenue by the end of Q4 in full."

We have installations which are very large. It takes many, many weeks. And obviously, the global pandemic, the COVID, is not allowing us to have a lot of people on site for cabling and all that as well. And even if we ship it, in many cases, depending on the timing, on the kind of more of the normal type of products, we may have a ship to, not invoice, which basically, yes, from the supply chain, it was taken care, but not from the revenue recognition perspective. That type of situation gets resolved, generally speaking, within a handful of weeks. On the HPC, it depends on customer by customer. But the point on HPC is very strong and, obviously, we have a go-forward outlook for a month of business, which is very sizable for us, and that's very good."

As I said, it depends by customer segment, depends by offer. Ultimately, what I see at this point in time is it has been steady, but the reality is that there are areas that are stronger and there are areas that are weaker. But I think it points to the diversification of our portfolio. We have a unique portfolio, and that's why we have a unique strategy to become the platform edge to cloud. And I think -- as I think about that, obviously, there is a lot of opportunities, particularly as we continue to pivot the company with more software and services-oriented type of offers. And you can see even in Q3, some of the strength with big data storage; our Primera, which is a software -- in essence, it is a software offering based on InfoSight, up over 100%. So these are the things that will continue to drive growth. And if we can sustain -- the question was asked about the Compute momentum, then you get that continued improvement, which we believe will be the case. But HPC plays a huge role for us. Let me be clear about HPC. I am very bullish about that business."

So yes, your observation is right, the gross margin went down 160 basis points as highlighted in our announcement, and we more than made that at the OP margin level, with the OP margin at 7.1%. So what's driving that at the gross margin level is purely the mix. We had more Compute revenue at lower margin. It's a mix issue. We did also articulate the fact that if you normalize for backlog, which did have an impact on gross margins, both in Compute and Storage, our gross margins would be up. But also, what you can see at OP margin is the fact that we are starting to take cost out, and we are incurring restructuring costs as a result of this.
I want to take the opportunity to remind everyone about our cost optimization and prioritization plan that we announced in Q2. We took proactive steps to strengthen our financial profile. We're -- I would tell you, I take a lot of pride about this one because we were prescient, and we did it on time, being hit very hard in a full quarter of Q2 that was disrupted by COVID. And we are on track with that program to generate net annualized run rate savings of at least $800 million by the end of fiscal year '22 relative to the fiscal year '19 exit level, and with most of those savings achieved at the end of fiscal year '21. So hopefully, that should give you some comfort with respect to also the visibility point. That's why we're saying, we expect gradual performance improvements going forward knowing that we have taken actions with this core transformation program that is about prioritizing and reducing costs where we can find opportunities to do so."

This was a quarter marked by strong execution and, honestly, very strong sequential growth. While much of the uncertainty is still there in the market and the global pandemic is still with us, we actually are cautiously optimistic, and we will see quarter-over-quarter improvements going forward across our businesses and, at the same time, we are investing into the future, which is essential for us, but I'm very pleased with our execution in the pivot to as-a-Service. You can see the momentum there.

Thank you for joining us today, and I hope everyone is staying safe and healthy. Overall, I am pleased with our Q3 performance. We executed well to enable strong sequential growth across our businesses. We gained momentum in key areas of differentiation driven by customer demand aligned to our strategy. And we began to take decisive and prudent actions to strengthen our core financial foundation while we continued to align resources to critical areas of growth.
COVID-19 has forced fundamental changes in businesses and communities. These changes have further validated our strategy. Navigating through the pandemic and planning for a post-COVID world has increased customer needs for as-a-service offerings, secure connectivity, remote work capabilities and analytics to unlock insights from data. Our solutions are aligned to these needs, and we see a tremendous opportunity to help our customers transform and digitize their businesses as they continue to adapt and operate in a new world.
Let me review a few highlights from the quarter. Total net revenue of $6.8 billion was up 14% quarter-over-quarter, and non-GAAP operating profit was up 33% quarter-over-quarter. Compute, HPC & MCS, Storage and Intelligent Edge business segments also grew sequentially. Moving forward, we expect continued gradual performance improvement.
We made significant improvements in our supply chain execution, reducing our backlog by more than $500 million from our Q2 historical high exit levels, which contributed to our results. In our HPC business, COVID-related impacts continued to affect our customers' ability to accept delivery of our products. We expect to return to normalized level of backlog by the end of Q4 through continued improvements in both supply chain execution and customer acceptances.
Our pivot to as-a-service continued its strong momentum in the quarter. Our annualized revenue run rate of $528 million grew 11% year-over-year. GreenLake services orders grew a record 82% year-over-year. We believe this is faster than the orders growth of public cloud vendors, and it is a validation of our hybrid strategy and competitive differentiation.
We are focused on delivering one seamless cloud experience for all applications and data, no matter where they exist: at the edge, in a data center, in a colocation or in a public cloud estate. While others are now publicly declaring plans to offer Everything-as-a-Service, we have been focused on this for several years and have made significant organic and inorganic investments to deliver a differentiated experience for our customers.
Our Q3 free cash flow of $924 million was up $276 million year-over-year, driven by a record cash flow from operations as a result of our improved execution this quarter. Importantly, we also declared our Q4 dividend today. Dividends remain an important part of our capital allocation framework that consists of capital return to shareholders and strategic investments that together drive long-term shareholder value.
Our customers are managing through the pandemic with even greater needs for the capabilities HPE can uniquely provide. In June, we put our strategy in the spotlight at our Discover Virtual Experience event, where we introduced new breakthrough innovation on a global virtual stage. The new solutions we introduced support our position that cloud is an experience, not a destination, and they're already gaining traction with our customers.
We launched our next-generation of HPE GreenLake cloud services. These new cloud services span machine learning operations, container management, virtualization, Infrastructure-as-a-Service, data protection and Connectivity-as-a-Service. Now our customers can access all of our HPE GreenLake cloud services via a self-service point-and-click catalog on our HPE GreenLake Central cloud portal.
Notably, in Q3, we signed several of our largest HPE GreenLake cloud services deals in history, including LyondellBasell, one of the largest plastics, chemicals and refining companies in the world, who signed a $27 million HPE GreenLake deal to drive their digital transformation and environmental efficiency. Underpinning our customer cloud experience is the need for software. That is why we introduced our new HPE Ezmeral software portfolio. Our new portfolio includes a container platform that deploys Kubernetes at scale for a wide range of use cases on bare metal and virtual machines; a data fabric that delivers enterprise-wide global access to data from edge to cloud with best-in-class reliability, security and performance; and machine learning operations solution that increases speed and agility for machine learning ops by operationalizing end-to-end processes from pilot to production; as well as IT operations and automation to improve productivity and mitigate risk of service disruption. In addition, it enables our customer to control cost and compliance across their hybrid cloud estate through our managed cloud control capabilities built into the portfolio. HPE Ezmeral can be consumed as a license or as a part of our HPE GreenLake cloud services offering.
And just a few weeks ago, as a strong endorsement of our strategy and capabilities, we announced plans to partner with SAP to deliver the customer edition of SAP HANA Enterprise Cloud with HPE GreenLake cloud services. This new joint solution will help customers leverage our cloud capabilities while keeping their SAP workloads and data on-premises.
At the same time, we continued to strengthen our core capabilities in Storage and Compute, which are essential resources to store and process customers' data. Every 60 seconds, we ship 46 terabytes of storage and 4 servers. Despite the challenging market that impacted our Storage performance overall, in Q3, we saw sequential improvement of 4% and, importantly, we gained traction and grew in key areas of investment. Big data storage, which is built on unique intellectual property from our MapR acquisition to enable real-time analytics for mission-critical big data workloads, grew revenues 31% year-over-year. Nimble distributed HCI, our new hyper-converged solution for business-critical applications and mixed workloads at scale grew revenue at 112% year-over-year.
And a great example of our organic innovation is HPE Primera, our most intelligent storage platform, grew revenues 114% year-over-year. HPE Primera gained 104 new logos this quarter, with nearly 1/4 of those being new to HPE Storage. We saw strong sequential momentum with HPC and Mission-Critical Systems that grew 10%, including a 10-year deal of $125 million with the University of Edinburgh in Scotland, who chose HPE to power the Edinburgh International Data Facility with our industry-leading HPC and AI solutions.
And finally, we had a very solid quarter in Compute, with 29% quarter-over-quarter growth, driven by the reduction in backlog and customer demand in VDI, or virtual desktop infrastructure, solutions. For example, Erasmus University Medical Center in the Netherlands wanted to upgrade its VDI environment for life cycle management needs and to prepare for future waves of COVID-19. We introduced a complete composable hyper-converged infrastructure solution based on HPE Synergy, along with HPE Primera, to meet our needs.
Our Intelligent Edge business performed in line with the market in Q3. We continued to see the edge as a significant opportunity over the long term. The explosion of data, devices and application will drive demand for secure multi-protocol connectivity, analytics and cloud computing capabilities at the edge, especially in the post-COVID world.
We are now entering the age of insights, driven by the amount of data we are generating and the utilization of new analytic tools, such as machine learning and artificial intelligence technologies. Customers are looking to power a new breed of applications and workloads that work in concert with cloud, but analyze and process data at the edge. To enable these new customer needs, we introduced the Aruba Edge Services Platform, or Aruba ESP, the industry-first AI-powered cloud platform designed for -- to unify, automate and secure the edge. The Aruba ESP combines AIOps, Aruba -- Zero Trust security and a unified infrastructure with financial and consumption flexibility, and we are seeing early customer adoption. Noble Hospitality, a luxury lifestyle brand, is standardizing on Aruba Edge services Platform as their edge cloud foundation for the hotel chain. The ability to generate actionable analytics where the data is created and deliver new on-property experiences for guests was critical to their decision.
We also announced our plans to acquire SD-WAN leader, Silver Peak. Silver Peak's advanced SD-WAN offerings strengthened our Aruba ESP and complements Aruba's existing work-from-home and branch office solutions to deliver one of the industry's most comprehensive portfolios designed to securely connect any edge to any cloud. The combination, which is expected to close in Q4 of this fiscal year, will allow enterprise customers to simplify their branch office and WAN deployments to empower remote workforces, enable cloud-native deployments and transform business operations without compromising quality or reliability. This is a great example of accelerating our strategy while maintaining a disciplined approach to capital allocation.
Building on our 5G Core Stack launch in March, we introduced a new telco Edge Orchestrator solution for telecom operators. This new solution provides revenue opportunities for telecoms in the enterprise market with 1-click deployment of applications at the edge of the new 5G networks. We are receiving positive feedback on our 5G offerings. For example, we announced an innovative technical demonstration of an automated virtual 5G network conducted with a French telecom operator, Orange, and telco infrastructure solutions provider Casa Systems. The demo highlights the expanding use cases and service agility needed to support 5G business applications, including location-based telemetry, IoT, edge computing and more that will require low latency.
Our ability to innovate for our customers is made possible by strong financial management that strengthen our core financial foundation and allows us to align resources to the most critical areas. As we exited Q2, you will recall that we took a number of decisive and prudent actions to manage our business through the evolving impacts of COVID-19. This included several short-term initiatives to reduce operating expenses and drive efficiencies as well as the introduction of a long-term cost optimization and prioritization plan designed to accelerate sustainable profitable growth. We remain on track to deliver the annualized net run rate savings of at least $800 million by the end of fiscal year '22, driven by optimizing our workplace site strategy, simplifying our product portfolio and introducing new digital customer engagement models. These efforts, backed by our diversified portfolio, robust balance sheet and investment-grade credit rating, will allow us to continue to invest in key growth areas.
In closing, I am proud of our Q3 performance, and I am proud of our HPE team. Our team members have been steadfast partners for our customers through an unprecedented period. They have moved quickly to address rapidly evolving market conditions. They have innovated with our customers in mind. They have made personal sacrifices to invest in our company's future. They have passionately committed to help HPE play a role in shaping a more equitable and inclusive society. And they have done all of this while managing the challenges of living through a global pandemic. Put it more simply, my HPE colleagues have represented our values, lived our culture and delivered on our purpose to advance the way people even work. As a result of the efforts, HPE is stronger and better able to serve our customers, partners and communities in a world that's forever changed.
While we continue to navigate through the global pandemic and macro uncertainty, we are cautiously optimistic that we will see gradual quarter-over-quarter performance improvement going forward. This is why we are providing guidance for our fiscal year '20 non-GAAP EPS, which Tarek will discuss. We look forward to seeing you virtually at our Securities Analyst Meeting on October 15, where we will provide more details about our long-term plans.
And with that, let me turn it over to Tarek to review the quarter's results."

I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2020. As usual, I'll be referencing the slides from our earnings presentation to highlight our performance in the quarter. Also, let me remind you that since the start of the fiscal year, we are reporting results according to our new segmentation.
Antonio discussed the key highlights for this quarter on Slide 4. Now let me discuss our financial performance, starting with Slide 5. Q3 was characterized by strong execution, driving sequential growth. We delivered Q3 revenues of $6.8 billion, up 14% sequentially and down 4% from the prior year period. I am especially pleased to report that we have made significant progress in clearing our backlog by more than $500 million during the quarter. We expect a return to normalized backlog levels as we exit Q4 2020. As a result, we have grown non-GAAP gross profit by 8% sequentially to $2.1 billion in Q3. Non-GAAP gross margins were 30.4% this quarter, down 160 basis points sequentially, driven by a higher mix of Compute as we executed against our backlog from prior quarters. Normalizing for the effect of backlog, both our Compute and Storage business segments grew gross margin on a sequential basis. Our non-GAAP operating profit was up 33% sequentially, resulting in a 7.1% operating margin, and our non-GAAP EPS of $0.32 was up 45% sequentially. Our GAAP EPS was $0.01 as we accelerated our transformation program and incurred restructuring costs.
Q3 cash flow from operations was approximately $1.5 billion, driven by strong operational execution. Free cash flow was $924 million, up $276 million from the prior year period, driven primarily by favorable working capital movements that I will detail later. Finally, we paid $154 million of dividends in the quarter and are declaring a Q4 dividend today of $0.12 per share payable October 7, 2020.
Let's move to Slide 6, which shows our performance in the quarter by segment. Here are the highlights. In the Intelligent Edge segment, we grew revenues 3% quarter-over-quarter, in line with the market. While wireless LAN declined single digit sequentially, we grew the campus switching business 12% quarter-over-quarter. In North America, our largest geo, revenue grew 4% quarter-over-quarter, demonstrating our continued momentum. Operating margin in Q3 was 8.6%, down 240 basis points quarter-over-quarter, impacted primarily by higher logistics and duties costs in this current environment.
In Compute, revenue grew 29% quarter-over-quarter as we executed against the backlog and improved our supply chain execution. Not only did units grow strong double digits sequentially, AUP grew 3% quarter-over-quarter as well. The increased operating leverage in this segment resulted in an operating profit margin of 8.5%, up 380 basis points quarter-over-quarter.
In High Performance Compute & Mission-Critical Systems, revenue grew 10% quarter-over-quarter, driven by strong performance in edge compute, HPC Apollo and MCS, up sequentially 82%, 16% and 2%, respectively. We expect to see sequential momentum next quarter driven by increased customer acceptance for HPC & MCS and Cray as we execute against the order book across the portfolio. Most importantly, Cray remains on track to deliver both on its FY '20 revenue targets and triple-digit run rate synergies by the end of fiscal year '21.
Within Storage, we grew revenue 4% quarter-over-quarter, driven by strong operational execution across the segment portfolio of products and reduction of backlog to normalized levels. With respect to Pointnext operational services, which is included across our Compute, HPC, MCS and Storage segments, total revenue was down 2%, while orders grew 1% on a sequential basis. Additionally, our services intensity, which is the ratio of attach revenue per hardware units sold continued to be strong with solid double-digit growth on a sequential basis across all segments: Compute, Storage and HPC & MCS. This demonstrates that the underlying profitability of the units we sell and the attach rates continue to be robust.
In Advisory & Professional Services, revenue was down 4% sequentially as COVID impacted consulting activity and the chargeability levels of our staff. This business is strategically important for us as it helps customers navigate through their digital transformation and also pulls through significant infrastructure and operational services orders.
Within HPE Financial Services, financing volume was up 1% quarter-over-quarter despite the impact of COVID-19, and our net portfolio of assets was up 4% this quarter, driven primarily by FX movements. We maintained a solid return on equity of approximately 13% this quarter. Our bad debt loss ratio this quarter was 74 basis points, which was slightly higher than previous quarters, is still best-in-class within this industry. I am particularly pleased by the collection performance in HPEFS, which attests to the quality of the book and the HPEFS franchise overall. I will come back to that later on.
Our Communications and Media Solutions business that is included in our Corporate Investments segment, is strategically important to us, providing software and services capabilities to telco service providers. Revenue was down 4% sequentially due to first half slowdown in services bookings. However, due to our improved cost of delivery, we're able to expand operating margins by 30 basis points quarter-over-quarter. We continue to make good progress in our 5G core strategy that provides multi-vendor integration and true cloud-native telco networks functions.
Slide 7 shows our growing ARR profile, which I introduced at our Securities Analyst Meeting in October 2019. I am very pleased to report that our Q3 '20 ARR came in at $528 million, representing 11% year-over-year growth. GreenLake service orders were up 82% year-over-year in constant currency, driven by outstanding performance in North America, which delivered 5x year-over-year growth. Our HPE Aruba Central SaaS platform continued to grow revenue strong double digits year-over-year as well. Based on strong customer demand, I am confident to reiterate our ARR growth guidance of 30% to 40% CAGR from fiscal year '19 to fiscal year '22.
Slide 8 highlights our EPS performance to date. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.32 in Q3, up 45% sequentially from Q2 driven by improved operating leverage, cost control and lower OI&E expenses. We now expect fiscal year '20 OI&E to be significantly less than our $100 million expense guidance provided at SAM 2019, driven by higher earnings from equity interest in HPC and better cost of debt resulting from our balance sheet funding diversification strategy that I will elaborate further on.
Turning to gross margin on Slide 9. And as I mentioned previously, non-GAAP gross profit was up 8% sequentially due to improved operating leverage. At 30.4% of revenues, our gross margin was down 160 basis points quarter-over-quarter driven by higher mix of compute as we executed against our elevated backlog from the prior quarter. Most importantly, and normalizing for the effect of backlog, both Compute and Storage business segments grew gross margins on a sequential basis.
Moving to Slide 10. Non-GAAP operating margin was 7.1% in Q3 of fiscal year '20 and non-GAAP operating income of $484 million was up 33% quarter-over-quarter. A combination of improved operating leverage and disciplined cost controls enabled us to improve profitability on a sequential basis. Last quarter, let me say this, we were prescient by proactively announcing ahead of other industry players a cost optimization and prioritization plan that would deliver annualized net run rate savings of at least $800 million by the end of fiscal year '22. We are making excellent progress there and are very much on track to emerge stronger in the post-COVID world. The actions we outlined as part of that plan to transform our core by optimizing our cost structure and aligning our resources through deep segmentation to key growth areas are now clearly starting to bear fruit.
Turning to Slide 11. We generated cash flow from operations of approximately $1.5 billion. This is the highest level for the past 11 quarters, as we improved our operational execution. Free cash flow was $924 million for the quarter, driven by timing of working capital movements that resulted in favorability in Q3. Overall, we saw an improvement in our cash conversion cycle for minus 5 days in the prior quarter to minus 10 days this quarter. For Q4, we expect free cash flow to be sequentially lower mainly due to 2 reasons: number one, working capital will be use of cash; and number two, higher restructuring payments related to our core transformation plan we announced in Q2.
As you recall, during the lockdown, we discussed our company exposure by industry vertical and company size and explained in detail that our business is highly resilient. As a proof point, I would like to highlight the performance of our credit collection teams in both our operating company and in HPEFS. Thanks to their contribution during the quarter, the level of our ARR that is current is at a record high of 99.5%, which attests of the strength of the HPE business and the quality of our franchise.
Now moving on to Slide 12, I want to spend a moment to talk about the strength of our diversified balance sheet and liquidity position and provide some insight on the puts and takes on forthcoming adjustments to our cash and debt positions. As of our 31st of July quarter end, we had approximately $8.5 billion of cash and cash equivalents, having successfully raised $1.75 billion in senior notes in July 2020 at a low cost of debt.
Post the quarter end, we redeemed $3 billion of bonds maturing in October 2020. Together with an undrawn revolving credit facility of $4.75 billion at our disposal, we currently have approximately $10.3 billion of liquidity after the redemption of the notes maturing in October 2020. Additionally, we expect to pay $925 million cash when we complete the proposed acquisition of Silver Peak, which is expected to close in Q4 of fiscal year '20. Adjusted for these known changes, our OpCo gross debt would be lower by $3 billion to approximately $4.4 billion, and our OpCo cash will also be lower by $3.9 billion to approximately $4 billion, resulting in an OpCo net debt of approximately $400 million.
Separately, we have securitized some Financial Services-related debt through the ABS market in the U.S., and as of July 301st quarter end, we have approximately $2.1 billion in outstanding ABS issuances. The refinancing of higher-cost unsecured debt with ABS financing allows us to boost access to financing markets at cheaper cost of capital, which helps diversify our balance sheet and lower interest expense payments in the future. Finally, I would like to reiterate that we remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade credit rating, which was reaffirmed by the rating agencies in July 2020. Bottom line, we have a strong cash position and ample liquidity available to run our operations, continue to invest in our business and execute on our strategy.
Now turning to outlook on Slide 13. Given the progress made in our operations, we are now in a position to provide guidance on fiscal year '20 EPS. We expect to finish fiscal year '20 with non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $1.30 to $1.34, and we expect our fiscal year '20 GAAP diluted net loss per share to be between $0.35 and $0.31.
Let me recap our key takeaways for this quarter on Slide 14. We delivered strong sequential improvement in top and bottom line and significantly improved operational and supply chain execution. We also accelerated our as-a-service pivot with very strong momentum in ARR and record GreenLake services order growth. We're taking actions to strengthen our financial foundation and align resources to critical areas to transform our core and drive sustainable profitable growth. At this stage, given all of this, we expect gradual sequential performance improvement moving forward. In Q3, we paid $154 million in dividends to shareholders. We recognize that dividends are an important part of our capital allocation framework and returns to shareholders, and today, we are very pleased to declare a Q4 dividend of $0.12 per share payable on October 7, 2020.
On a personal note, I'd like to echo Antonio's comments. We are both very proud of the way our company and team members quickly and decisively responded to the unprecedented challenges that the global COVID-19 pandemic has caused. As Antonio mentioned, we look forward to having you join us at our Virtual Securities Analyst Meeting on October 15, where we will provide an update on our strategy, financial outlook and capital management policy.
Now with that, let's open it up for questions. Thank you."

So I spent probably 50% of my time talking to customers and partners, so I have a pretty good insight of what we see in the market. What we see right now, first of all, and I made this comment in my remarks, we see steady demand and, obviously, there are areas which are stronger than others. But the general sense is as follows. First of all, they're looking to strengthen their operations and, therefore, IT plays a huge role with that, and IT resiliency is more important than ever. So anything that comes with security and enables them to digitize their processes is on the growth side.
Second is, obviously, they have a lot of data, and they need to get insight from that data. And we see an acceleration of solutions related to AI and machine learning, and that's why our big data storage saw another great, solid performance. But obviously, ML ops, and that's why we introduced an offer with HPE GreenLake cloud services around machine learning operations, is in high demand.
Obviously, as we look at the workforce, I think there are permanent and lasting changes to how we're going to work in the future. Remote connectivity is essential. And that's why I'm so excited about the acquisition of Silver Peak because together with Aruba services platform give us now the ability to provide connectivity for all the edges and the edge now is your home office, right? I consider that the micro branch to any cloud. And obviously, there are multiple clouds because it's a hybrid strategy.
And then anything that preserves CapEx is also in high demand and that's why we see significant momentum with our HP GreenLake cloud services because that's a true conceived as-a-service offering. And so obviously, that's in transition. What we see is a transition period, but I would say the enterprise has been steady. Obviously, SMB is a challenge -- from a customer segmentation perspective, is a challenge.
When I look at the verticals, I think the financial sector where you play is still very solid and the manufacturing side as well. Education, obviously, now is going to be very important. And the public sector, the public sector is very strong. And obviously, we have a unique portfolio there with our HPC and AI solutions, but also around storage as well. So that's the general theme, Shannon, that we see at this point in time.
In terms of budgets, obviously, they are assessing what happens in the context of their own revenues and profit. But overall, I will say the enterprise, which is where we participate the most, is fairly steady, and that's what Tarek meant we have a very diversified and resilient portfolio, both by customer segment and by solution."

There's still some, but that's why we feel very confident that we can totally get back to the historical levels by the end of Q4. We grew sequentially double digits in units and AUP, 3%. If you recall, commodity cost has been inflationary in the first part of the year, and we took quite significant actions on pricing and that's why our AUPs went up because of pricing, but also because of the structural changes we continue to see in that type of products. I mentioned we shipped 46 terabytes of storage, and that's not just storage in a traditional storage platform, it goes with compute, right; and for servers.
I think as you think about going forward, obviously, we'll continue to be very disciplined on pricing. In terms of commodity costs, in particular, DRAM, we've started seeing some decline, honestly. The curve is pointing downwards. But as I said before, and we lived this in 2018, right, when prices go up -- when cost goes up, prices go up faster and when the cost goes down, it takes longer. But ultimately, the next generation of our compute platform will drive even more richer configurations because there will be more gigabyte per unit that will be attached to it. And so that's why we feel good about where we are today. But that's what we see in Compute right now, it is still very competitive, there's no question about it. But the demand is shifting between enterprise, public sector and, obviously, the service provider segment."

I mean as I said before, everything in our life computes, which means Compute is embedded everywhere, not just in a server, and a lot of our storage platform is basically a compute platform with software, right? Big data storage is a great example of that. It is an Apollo platform that runs our AI software on it. It's hard to predict exactly what's going to happen there, but we saw steady demand again. We, obviously, have reallocated resources, particularly in our go-to-market where we see the growth opportunity as well. And we will continue to drive what the focus is, particularly in areas like VDI, which is, in essence, is a Compute product with a bunch of software. Traditional Compute per se, in general purpose workloads, those obviously have been kind of weakened over time, have been declining. But overall, I think a combination of AUPs, pricing, obviously, action and richer configuration, we should maintain a level of stability at this point in time considering that 2020 was fairly depressed overall.
In terms of the edge, we believe we grew in line with the market. If I look at our competitors, what they announced, I think, is in line with the market. But we saw strength, as Tarek said, in switching, which was up sequentially, 12%. Obviously, we continue to see quite a bit of strength in our subscription-based model with our Aruba platform. And also, we saw quite a bit of strength as well on the solutions around we provide, particularly remote work solutions or remote connectivity. For us, this is a business that has the long-term future. The thesis is totally intact. The Silver Peak acquisition will, obviously, accelerate the growth of Aruba going forward as well."

Thank you, Wamsi, for the question. So let me start by answering the latter part of your question on the magnitude of the restructuring.

So let me start by answering the latter part of your question on the magnitude of the restructuring. It's pretty much in line with the guidance we gave you in Q2 for fiscal year '20. $300 million to $400 million is the cost we would incur for the restructuring.
Now back to the first part of your question with respect to free cash flow. Free cash flow was exceptionally strong in Q3 as we work through the backlog, right? So this has been very, very solid and, particularly, we were able to work through the backlog and improve the cash conversion cycle. Also, we benefited from temporary favorable timing of working capital, and that component will reverse in Q4. And so in Q4, like I mentioned in my script, expect free cash flow to be lower than Q3 as a result of 2 components: one is the restructuring cost; and number two, the working capital changes. And specifically, if you want a little bit more guidance as to where in working capital the change will come, it's predominantly in payables that you will see a change that will be adverse to the generation of free cash flow."

So thank you, Katy, and I'm sure you will all be normalizing for backlog on every aspect of our business, so I want to take the opportunity to clarify this and leaving no shadows for doubt. So as you recall, in Q2, we said we exited with executable backlog in excess of $1.5 billion, which was 2x the level that we would normally see in our operations, so essentially, $750 million above the level that we normally have in our business. We reduced that $750 million by $500 million in Q3, the rest we believe we can reduce by Q4. So even if you normalize for the $500 million, and I'll let you do all the calculations, you will see that the underlying revenue performance Q3 on Q2 is better. And also, if you really ask where did that backlog get reduced, in which segment, in particular, it was mainly Compute and a tiny bit in Storage. That's where the $500 million come from. And even if you look at Compute back onto Wamsi's questions before, and you normalize for the reduction in backlog, you will observe that Compute was growing sequentially even after the normalization.
We also want to underscore the fact that the backlog reduction hides a little bit what happens at the gross margin level, right? It's very difficult for you to see this at your end. But we did -- both of us reiterate the fact that, with the pricing actions we have taken and once you normalized for backlog, both Compute and Storage saw their underlying gross margins going up. And this is partly the reason why we've done so well in growing our gross profit 8% sequentially in the year. So that, hopefully, answers the backlog question -- or part of your question.
On GreenLake, it's true that you're saying that Q-on-Q, the ARR decelerated, but the practical reality is where you look at the lead indicators that make the ARR is the order growth. The order growth that we've had in Q3, it's the record -- at record levels. We didn't experience an 82% order growth in GreenLake, and we feel very good about this order growth because we're seeing bigger deals with larger companies. And the companies that Antonio quoted are not small companies that typically start with a little spend that is valuable on their IT infrastructure. These are bigger companies that are considering as-a-service consumption as a new way to handle their IT expenditures. So Antonio, maybe you would like to add to that?"
273983758,683213884,2105869,"Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Aug 25, 2020",2020-08-25,"Earnings Calls","Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company","Executives","Yes.

Actually, I will say a couple of things to that comment on the backlog, Katy. I mean this is product shipped, right? Not all of the products was totally recognizable in the quarter, particularly in HPC because if you remember right, in the HPC segment, we got to ship it, we have to install it, we have to turn it on, and we have to run the test. And only and only when the customer signs up for the acceptance, then we can recognize revenue. And that's why we still have quite an interesting opportunity in Q4 with HPC in particular. But in Compute, once you ship it, you recognize it. So overall, very pleased with that. But even when you factor the backlog out, we actually grew sequentially on net new orders. And the net new orders, to Tarek's point, came at higher margins because of our pricing actions. The problem is the backlog was kind of dilutive to the margins because we price-protect our customers, obviously, and we stand on that commitment and also the channel, right?
On the GreenLake, I mean, this is an amazing performance. As I said in my comment, I think, it is, we believe -- I believe, is faster growth than any cloud out there. And it has -- it really comes down to the ability to provide a hybrid experience. What customers are telling us, they don't want to be on the wrong side of the house anymore, but they understand they have to have apps and data everywhere. 70% of the apps and data still on-prem, by the way, and more apps and data are moving to the edge. But ultimately, even if they have apps and data in public cloud, they like the GreenLake because it provides them the cost control, the managed aspect of it, and we can run it for them in a truly hybrid approach. And when they keep the apps and data on-prem, we give them the exact same consumption model or whether they move it to the edge. And their value proposition is resonating more and more because the world is hybrid, cloud is an experience and, obviously, our software capabilities, they are playing a huge role together with our innovation on the business model side and, obviously, the financing.
So that's what we see. And the ARR will take care of itself because, obviously, there is puts and takes because, remember, ARR is a consumption-driven metric of it and, as we go forward, very, very confident to hit that 30% to 40%."

So your math is right, but operationally, things are slightly different, meaning if you normalize Q3 performance for the $500 million, yes, you get to $6.3 billion, but it's not entirely operationally correct to add the $500 million to Q2 because as part of the backlog, you do have orders that ship in quarter but are not invoiced. You do have all sorts of different effects that come into play that distort that picture. So there is a limit to the normalization math that we can give. 
The simple point is, it's all about timing. Look, it's all about timing. This revenue should have materialized in fiscal year '20. It is materializing in fiscal year '20. And we're back to normalized levels of backlog by the end of fiscal year '20. We've taken $500 million of backlog down. There's another, you've done the math, $250 million to go. There's also another aspect that Antonio underscored before in HPC & MCS, it's very, very important for all of you to understand and it's the following. Specifically for that segment, it's slightly different than other segments because these systems are super sophisticated and even if we ship and land the system on customer premises, before we can actually invoice the customer, there's a technical acceptance process that takes place that delays our ability to invoice the customer. 
And so that is also fundamentally changing the trajectory of HPC & MCS, and we see very, very strong order demand in the public sector, which underpins the HPC & MCS segment, and you'll see the fruits of that in the foreseeable quarters.
The conclusion of it is, whatever happens on backlog is an FY '20 phenomenon driven by COVID, and there were -- essentially in Q1, the fact that we had, you remember, component shortages, the whole industry experienced those, this translated in Q2 into manufacturing closures, where manufacturing was not at the full level. And then now this issue has morphed into being, specifically for HPC & MCS, a customer acceptance issue. So all in all, what matters is that the revenue of fiscal year '20 is actually the same if you factor into the equation the fact that we will reduce the backlog we generated and we saw elevated at the end of Q2, we'll turn that into revenue by the end of Q4 in full."

I think, Toni, the other part is that we reduced the backlog by $500 million, but not all of that translated in Q3 because, again, the HPC side of this, it takes -- sometimes takes weeks, sometimes it takes months. We have installations which are very large. It takes many, many weeks. And obviously, the global pandemic, the COVID, is not allowing us to have a lot of people on site for cabling and all that as well. And even if we ship it, in many cases, depending on the timing, on the kind of more of the normal type of products, we may have a ship to, not invoice, which basically, yes, from the supply chain, it was taken care, but not from the revenue recognition perspective. That type of situation gets resolved, generally speaking, within a handful of weeks. On the HPC, it depends on customer by customer. But the point on HPC is very strong and, obviously, we have a go-forward outlook for a month of business, which is very sizable for us, and that's very good."

And then just on the Compute margins. They were down 440 basis points year-over-year despite flat volumes. Is that really the impact of the rising component prices?

So the year-over-year compares that you're seeing are less and less meaningful. And what matters more is what happens on a sequential basis. This is why we are accentuating where we are recovering from Q2 into Q3 and now Q4 with the dynamics that Antonio mentioned with respect to HPC & MCS and customer acceptances.

As I said, it depends by customer segment, depends by offer. Ultimately, what I see at this point in time is it has been steady, but the reality is that there are areas that are stronger and there are areas that are weaker. But I think it points to the diversification of our portfolio. We have a unique portfolio, and that's why we have a unique strategy to become the platform edge to cloud. And I think -- as I think about that, obviously, there is a lot of opportunities, particularly as we continue to pivot the company with more software and services-oriented type of offers. And you can see even in Q3, some of the strength with big data storage; our Primera, which is a software -- in essence, it is a software offering based on InfoSight, up over 100%. So these are the things that will continue to drive growth. And if we can sustain -- the question was asked about the Compute momentum, then you get that continued improvement, which we believe will be the case. But HPC plays a huge role for us. Let me be clear about HPC. I am very bullish about that business."

We did also articulate the fact that if you normalize for backlog, which did have an impact on gross margins, both in Compute and Storage, our gross margins would be up. But also, what you can see at OP margin is the fact that we are starting to take cost out, and we are incurring restructuring costs as a result of this.
I want to take the opportunity to remind everyone about our cost optimization and prioritization plan that we announced in Q2. We took proactive steps to strengthen our financial profile. We're -- I would tell you, I take a lot of pride about this one because we were prescient, and we did it on time, being hit very hard in a full quarter of Q2 that was disrupted by COVID. And we are on track with that program to generate net annualized run rate savings of at least $800 million by the end of fiscal year '22 relative to the fiscal year '19 exit level, and with most of those savings achieved at the end of fiscal year '21. So hopefully, that should give you some comfort with respect to also the visibility point. That's why we're saying, we expect gradual performance improvements going forward knowing that we have taken actions with this core transformation program that is about prioritizing and reducing costs where we can find opportunities to do so."

Thank you for joining us today, and I hope everyone is staying safe and healthy. Hewlett Packard Enterprise finished the year with a very strong performance. In Q4, we saw a notable rebound in our overall",2288,"Well, thanks, Andy, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today, and I hope everyone is staying safe and healthy. Hewlett Packard Enterprise finished the year with a very strong performance. In Q4, we saw a notable rebound in our overall revenue, with particular acceleration in key growth areas of our business. 
As we reviewed at the last month's Securities Analyst Meeting, we are focused on a set of strategic priorities to drive long-term sustainable profitable growth and accelerating -- sustainable profitable growth. This includes stabilization of our core businesses, doubling down in areas of growth and accelerating our pivot to as-a-service while taking decisive action to strengthen our financial foundation and become a more agile company. We executed with precision on these strategic priorities, and I'm proud of the results in what has been a very challenging fiscal year '20. 
Let me review a few Q4 highlights. First, our total revenue of $7.2 billion returned to pre-pandemic levels, up 5% sequentially and flat on a year-over-year basis. We saw increased new orders momentum across all business segments of our company. As I stated in our Q3 earnings, we expect continued gradual performance improvement moving forward. As expected, we returned our backlog to normalized levels this quarter. In Compute, revenue declined 7% sequentially but was up low single digits when normalized for backlog over the last 2 quarters. We are encouraged by new orders intake that point to stabilization in this business, taking into account the typical Q1 seasonality. 
Most importantly, if you look at the combined server view across Compute and HPC & MCS businesses, which is how the market tracks server performance, our total net revenue in the server market will be up 3% sequentially and up 1% year-over-year. As a result, we believe we gained share in total server for the second consecutive quarter. 
In Storage, revenue grew 7% sequentially to $1.2 billion. We also expanded our operating profit to 16.7%, an improvement of 380 basis points sequentially and within the target profitability range of 16% to 18% we discussed at SAM. In both Compute and Storage, we drove higher level of operational services intensity consistent with prior quarter performance. 
In Q4, we accelerated our business performance in key growth businesses. In Intelligent Edge, revenue rebounded to $786 million, up 14% sequentially and 5% year-over-year. This business performed exceptionally well against the market backdrop. High Performance Compute and Mission-Critical Systems had an outstanding quarter, recording revenue of $975 million. This business grew 50% sequentially and 25% year-over-year. Our Pivotal as a Service continued its strong momentum. Our annualized revenue run rate of $585 million was up 11% sequentially and 30% year-over-year. The on-premises as a service market is growing rapidly, especially in the hybrid environment and remains a significant long-term value driver for us and our shareholders. 
Through strong operational execution, we delivered non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.37, up 16% sequentially and above the high end of our guidance. Free cash flow of $223 million was in line with our Q3 and SAM guidance. Additionally, we declared our Q1 dividend today, which will be paid on January 6. As we have said in the past, dividends remain an important part of our capital allocation framework that consists of capital returns to shareholders and strategic investments that together drive long-term shareholder value. 
Based on the strong finish to fiscal year '20 and increased confidence in profitability going into Q1, we are raising our fiscal year '21 non-GAAP EPS guidance by $0.03 at the midpoint. Tarek will review our financial performance and outlook in greater detail, but I will first provide some context around our execution and customer reactions to our approach and offerings. 
The global pandemic has forced businesses to rethink everything from remote work and collaboration to business continuity and data insight. Over the last several months, we have seen growing momentum in our businesses as customers increasingly turned to HPE for capabilities from edge to cloud. Our unique set of capabilities help our customers empower their workforces, deploy new resilient IT solutions and extract insight from critical data while leveraging and consuming these solutions more flexibly as a service. 
We continue to strengthen our core businesses in Compute and Storage, which provide critical capabilities to customers and are foundational to our Edge to Cloud Platform as a Service strategy. In Compute, that did an outstanding job of driving supply chain efficiencies and clearing the historical levels of backlog. We will continue our focus on streamlining processes to enhance productivity in this high-volume business. 
We are a market leader in Compute, and we are being deliberate in our focus on gaining market share in profitable market segments. This quarter, we became the first company to embed silicon-based security into our industry-standard servers manufacturing through our HPE trusted supply chain in the United States. This security is critical to a growing number of U.S. customers across federal, public banking and finance and health care verticals. We also launched a new HPE Inference Solution on HPE ProLiant servers in conjunction with Red Hat and NVIDIA to accelerate machine learning directed at the AI and containers market. 
In Storage, we have been on a multiyear journey to create an intelligent data platform from H2 Cloud and pivot to software-as-a-service data storage solutions, which enable higher level of operational services attach and margin expansion. And our strategy is getting traction. Our portfolio is well positioned in high-growth areas like all-flash array, which grew 29% year-over-year; big data storage, which had its sixth consecutive quarter of growth, up 41% year-over-year; and hyperconverged infrastructure where nimble DHCI, our new hyperconverged solution, continued momentum and gained share, growing 280% year-over-year. 
We also committed to doubling down in growth businesses and investing to fuel future growth. The Intelligent Edge is a critical segment where we declared the opportunity early on and are increasingly differentiated. At the edge, customers need secure seamless connectivity to bridge the digital/physical worlds and the ability to generate actionable analytics where the data is created. This is why Aruba is seeing traction and gaining market share with a leading and highly differentiated portfolio of solutions such as our cloud native Aruba Edge Services platform, which also contributes to ARR growth. 
For example, the Pentagon is modernizing both its classified and unclassified networks to support tens of thousands of devices daily using Aruba ESP-based architecture. Comcast also chose our Aruba ESP to power its new Comcast Business Teleworker VPN. The service supports and secures multiple endpoints in our remote work site, including laptops, desktops, voice-over-IP phones and printers, and partners can centrally manage remote workers and all its infrastructure from a single Aruba ESP cloud console. 
This quarter, we expect to take share in both campus switching and wireless LAN with our best-in-class portfolio, which was just recognized as a leader for the [ 15th year ] in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for wired and wireless LAN infrastructure. 
Finally, towards the end of Q4, we closed the acquisition of Silver Peak, which will accelerate Aruba SD-WAN growth in an attractive market growing over 20% and enable our [ H2 Cloud ] Platform as a Service vision. Silver Peak brings industry-leading technology and was named a leader in the Gartner 2020 Magic Quadrant for WAN Edge Infrastructure. We believe the explosion of devices, applications and data at the edge will continue to drive demand for secure connectivity, cloud computing capabilities and analytics, especially in a post-COVID world. 
Another high-growth segment where we are extremely well positioned is in High Performance Compute. In Q4, we performed exceptionally well across the portfolio, with growth in products, mission-critical systems, operational support services and HP Apollo. The team did an outstanding job in converting the existing backlog and new orders to drive a record quarter-breaking nearly $1 billion revenue. Q4 marked our first full quarter of Cray operational activity integrated into HPE systems, and the combination of Cray and HPE is driving increased revenue and cost synergies. We signed several large customer deals during the quarter, including 3 exascale system design wins that will use the HPE Cray EX supercomputers. These wins include a $34 million contract with Supercomputer Center in Australia and a $160 million contract with a European high-performance joint undertaking initiatives to deliver one of the world's fastest supercomputers that will be used by 10 European countries. 
We extended our #1 market position in HPC with 37% market share as of calendar Q2 data, which is 10 points above the next closest competitor. According to the list of the top 500 supercomputers released 2 weeks ago, HPE and Cray systems makes 39 of the top 100 systems more than any other company. 
In addition, our HPE Apollo Systems had its highest revenue quarter ever. As an example of the traction we are seeing with Apollo -- with our Apollo value proposition, Mercedes-Benz Grand Prix, constructor of the Mercedes AMG Formula 1 team, signed a deal for the new Apollo system. Modeling and simulations are about gaining a competitive advantage on the track, and our HPE technology is critical to this team's race strategy. Going forward, we are working to bring High Performance Compute to everyday enterprise environments. Stay tuned for more announcement on this front in the coming few weeks. 
Consumption-based solutions provide an attractive alternative for customers looking to drive innovation and modernized infrastructure without the capital and operational expenses tied to overprovisioning. We are a leader in on-premises as a service and have been investing in our HPE software platform and HPE GreenLake managed services offerings to enable a true consumption-based experience that is unique. 
Customers are recognizing our differentiated products and services, which can be seen in our as-a-service order growth of 20% year-over-year. This quarter, we continue to expand our offerings and introduced HPE GreenLake VDI cloud services. Building on the success of our ready-to-go virtual desktop infrastructure solutions launched early in the year to help customers with immediate connectivity needs, this new solution provides configurations that are optimized for each type of remote worker. 
Customers can easily scale usage up and down, which is a compelling and critical capability in today's environment. By leveraging expanded partnership with Citrix, Nutanix and NVIDIA, VMware and Wipro, we can offer comprehensive solutions to an expanded customer base. Our advanced capabilities are driving strong customer demand across diverse markets and industry. We recently announced several new customers. Nokia Software is using HPE GreenLake cloud services to embed further cost and energy savings into its data storage portfolio. MicroGen, a leading precision medicine and biotechnology company, selected HPE GreenLake to modernize its IT operations to analyze large-scale medical data on-premises. 
Life Insurance, a fast-growing fintech company based in Hong Kong also selected HPE GreenLake to strengthen its online sales platform applications and fintech support systems. The momentum we are realizing in each of these areas is possible because of our focused strategy and disciplined execution by innovating and investing in the most impactful areas and optimizing how we manage our own business, we are ensuring we are in the best possible position to help our customers manage theirs. 
Early in the pandemic, we recognized there was no going back to what it used to be, only preparing for and building what comes next. This is one of the reasons we have made the recent decision to relocate HPE's headquarters to Houston. We have listened to our team members' preferences about the future of work and reimagined our real estate site to optimize and improve how both physical and virtual offices -- office spaces are used in this new area. Houston has long been HPE's largest U.S. employment hub, and we are currently constructing a state-of-the-art new campus. Obviously, we intend to maintain our innovation tech hub in San Jose, California. Our Aruba headquarters will be housed within our digital-enabled San Jose site, so storage and software. There will be no layoffs associated with this move in consolidation. We are committed to both markets as critical parts of our talent and real estate strategy in a post-pandemic world. 
As we have been transforming how we work, we have also recognized that we have an enormous opportunity for customers to transform and digitize their business to adapt and operate in a new world. Business continuity and success depend on solutions and advanced IT resiliency, empower more workforces securely, extend connectivity, reinvigorate customer engagement and enable business model evolution. Against this backdrop, HPE has delivered despite the challenging circumstances. We have brought new capabilities and experiences to our customers to meet their emerging needs. We have invested in both organic innovation and M&A that strengthen and differentiate our position in the market. We have acted quickly to protect our financial foundation and become a more agile company. And we have remained committed to our culture. We have asked a lot to our team this year, and I am personally immensely proud and grateful for the significant courageous contribution. 
There is no question there is more work to be done, but our customers have validated our vision, and we have demonstrated in Q4 and throughout 2020 that we have the right team and the right strategies in place to execute on that vision. While there remains continued uncertainty in the world, there is also a great deal of promise and optimism. HPE we created 5 years ago has an important role to play in the words recovery from an unprecedented pandemic. That presents an opportunity for our company and for our investors. I am confident we will continue to rise to the occasion and deliver in bold new ways. With that, let me turn it over to Tarek to review the quarter's results."

I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020. As usual, I'll be referencing the slides from our earnings presentation to highlight our performance in the quarter. Antonio discussed the key highlights for this quarter on Slide 4, so now let me discuss our financial performance, starting with Slide 5. 
I am very pleased to report that Q4 marked a return of revenue to pre-pandemic levels. We delivered Q4 revenues of $7.2 billion, up 5% sequentially and flat from the prior year period as our growth businesses of Intelligent Edge and HPC MCS executed strongly. We also cleared our backlog by a further $250 million during the quarter, which has now returned to normalized levels as we exited Q4. As a result of the improved revenue performance, we have grown non-GAAP gross profit by 7% sequentially to $2.2 billion in Q4. Non-GAAP gross margins of 30.6% were also up sequentially, driven by positive mix shift towards Intelligent Edge, Storage and HPC & MCS, all of which reported strong sequential revenue growth. 
Our non-GAAP operating profit was up 15% sequentially, resulting in a 7.7% operating margin, and our non-GAAP EPS of $0.37 was up 16% sequentially. Q4 cash flow from operations was $747 million, driven by strong operational execution. Free cash flow was $223 million, and that was in line with our guidance as we saw the expected reversal in the favorable working capital movements from elevated backlog in Q3. Finally, we paid $154 million of dividends in the quarter and are declaring a Q1 dividend today of $0.12 per share payable in January 2021. 
Now let's turn to our segment highlights in Slides 6 and 7. As you can see, we are doing exactly what we said we would do at SAM in October. We're doubling down on our growth businesses of Intelligent Edge and HPC & MCS while stabilizing our core business segments of Compute and Storage. In Intelligent Edge, we continued our momentum with 14% quarter-over-quarter and 5% year-over-year growth. We also expect to take share in both campus switching and wireless LAN with our best-in-class portfolio, which was just recognized as a leader for the 15th year in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Wired and Wireless LAN Access Infrastructure. 
We're also beginning to see the operating profit potential of this business with operating margin in Q4 of 10.1%, up 150 basis points quarter-over-quarter and 390 basis points year-over-year as we drove greater productivity from prior investments in this business. Finally, we closed the Silver Peak acquisition on September 21 so it had a minimal contribution in Q4, but obviously, Silver Peak will be more meaningful going forward. 
In HPC & MCS, revenue reached record levels near $1 billion, growing 50% sequentially and 25% year-over-year, driven by strong performance in Cray, HPC Apollo and MCS. We executed well against our existing order book with increased customer acceptances and grew orders further with a healthy pipeline. As you know, this business can be lumpy with revenue recognition and profitability linked to completion of critical customer milestones. While we do expect to see a normal seasonal decline in Q1 '21, we are well on our way to delivering our 8% to 12% 3-year revenue CAGR outlined at SAM. 
In Compute, revenue declined 7% sequentially but was up low single digits when normalizing Q3 and Q4 results for backlog conversion. Gross and operating margins were also pressured by clearing the backlog as we had to fulfill orders at cost levels higher than originally quoted. We are pleased to report that backlog has now returned to normalized levels, thanks to continued improvements in our supply chain execution. 
Within Storage, we grew revenue 7% quarter-over-quarter, driven by strong operational execution, reduced backlog and improved order momentum in key areas of the portfolio. We saw notable strength in big data, up 27% sequentially, driven by increased customer focus on AI, machine learning-related applications. All-flash array storage up 19% sequentially by increased -- driven by increased adoption of Primera All-flash and DHCI, which grew double digits sequentially. We also expanded operating margins this quarter, which was up 380 basis points quarter-on-quarter, ending at 16.7% of revenue and already aligned to our SAM fiscal year '23 targets. 
With respect to Pointnext operational services, which is included across our Compute, HPC & MCS and Storage segment, total revenue was up 2% while orders were down 1% on a sequential basis. Additionally, our services intensity, which is the ratio of attach revenue per hardware unit sold, continued to be strong with notable strength in Compute and Storage, excluding Nimble, which were up low single digits growth on a sequential basis. 
In Advisory & Professional Services, revenue was up 6% sequentially even as COVID impacted consulting activity and the chargeability levels of our staff. Within HPE Financial Services, financing volume was up 6%, and revenue was up 2% quarter-over-quarter despite the impact of COVID-19. We maintained a solid return on equity of approximately 13% this quarter. Our bad debt loss ratio this quarter was 1.06%, which while slightly higher than previous quarters, is still best-in-class and well within our comfort zone as cash collections have already returned back to pre-COVID levels. 
In our Communications and Media Solutions business that is included in our Corporate Investments segment, orders were up 18% and revenue was up 6% sequentially, driven by strong double-digit orders and revenue growth in Americas. Additionally, due to our improved cost of delivery, we were able to expand operating margins by 240 basis points quarter-over-quarter. We continue to make good progress in our 5G core strategy that provides multi-vendor integration and true cloud-native telco network functions. 
Slide 8 shows key metrics of our growing as-a-service business, which I elaborated on during our recent Securities Analyst Meeting. We are making great strides in our AAS offering. I am pleased to report that our Q4 '20 ARR came in at $585 million, representing 11% quarter-over-quarter and 30% year-over-year reported growth. Total as-a-service orders were up 20% year-over-year, driven by outstanding performance in North America and APJ. 
Our HPE Aruba Central SaaS platform also continued to grow revenue strong double digits year-over-year. Based on strong customer demand and recent wins, I am very happy with how this business is delivering and progressing towards its ARR growth targets of 30% to 40% CAGR from fiscal year '20 to fiscal year '23 set at our 2019 SAM and reiterated at our 2020 SAM meeting. 
Slide 9 highlights our revenue and EPS performance to date where you can clearly see Q2 was a trough. Strong operational execution has driven sequential revenue growth from a low of $6 billion in Q2 all the way back to $7.2 billion in Q4.
Turning to Slide 10. The rebound in revenue has resulted in a 15% improvement in non-GAAP gross profit from the Q2 trough, which was up to $2.2 billion in Q4. Also, the gross margin rate in Q4 of 30.6% of revenues was up 20 basis points sequentially, driven by a higher mix of Intelligent Edge, Storage and HPC & MCS, which are higher-margin businesses, offset by continued execution of elevated compute backlog, which was a headwind but is now behind us. 
Moving to Slide 11. You can see how the improvement in gross profit, combined with progress on our cost optimization plan, has delivered 53% growth in operating profit from the Q2 trough while still investing for growth. As mentioned at SAM, we are making excellent progress in our cost optimization and prioritization plan, which will strengthen our financial foundation while aligning resources to critical growth areas. As of the end of this quarter, we are on track to deliver annualized net run rate savings for at least $800 million from the FY '19 baseline by the end of fiscal year '22, with most of the savings being realized by the end of fiscal year '21. Obviously, we will keep you updated on our progress in the upcoming quarters. 
Turning to Slide 12. We generated cash flow from operations of $747 million, and free cash flow was $223 million for the quarter, driven by timing of working capital movements from clearing backlog that resulted in favorability in Q3 but a headwind we flagged for in Q4. We ended fiscal year '20 with free cash flow of $560 million, in line with our outlook provided at SAM 2020. Looking to '21, we expect free cash flow to grow over 75% at the midpoint of our outlook of $900 million to $1.1 billion. Please remember our normal cash flow seasonality, where the second half is a stronger generator of cash flow than the first half. 
Now moving on to Slide 13. Let me remind everyone about the strength of our diversified balance sheet and liquidity position, which is a competitive advantage in the current environment. As our October 31 quarter end, we had approximately $4.2 billion of cash after successfully redeeming $3 billion of bonds maturing in October 2020 and paying approximately $853 million, net of cash -- excuse me, $853 million of net cash for closing the Silver Peak transaction. Together with an undrawn revolving credit facility of $4.75 billion at our disposal, we currently have approximately $9 billion of liquidity. 
Finally, I would like to reiterate that we remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade credit rating, which was recently reaffirmed by the rating agencies. Bottom line, we have a strong cash position and ample liquidity available to run our operation, continue to invest in our business and execute on our strategy. 
Now turning to outlook on Slide 14. At our recent Securities Analyst Meeting, we provided our outlook for fiscal year '21, and I would encourage you to review my presentation for a more detailed discussion of that outlook. Having said that, let me drill down on a few key areas. We continue to expect to grow our fiscal year '21 non-GAAP operating profit by 15% to 20% and now expect FY '21 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be between $1.60 to $1.78 as a result of increased confidence in margin improvement. This is a $0.03 per share improvement on the midpoint of our prior guidance of $1.56 to $1.76 in EPS. 
From a top line perspective, we are pleased with the rebound we saw in Q4 and continue to see gradual improvement but want to remain somewhat cautious due to the uncertain pace of recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. More specifically for Q1 '21, after normalizing for excess backlog reduction in Q4 '20 of $250 million, we expect Q1 '21 revenue to be in line with our normal sequential seasonality of down mid-single digits from Q4. 
For fiscal year '21, we expect total revenue to be in line with our long-term financial targets of a CAGR of 1% to 3% presented at our recent Securities Analyst Meeting. For Q1 '21, we expect GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.02 to $0.06 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.40 to $0.44. 
So overall, I'm very pleased with the performance in the quarter and execution against our strategy and financial priorities outlined at SAM. We have navigated well through unprecedented challenges this fiscal year and had a very strong finish. Q4 was marked by a strong rebound in revenue as we reduced backlog to normalized levels and saw increased order momentum across all business segments. We saw significant acceleration in customer demand in our growth businesses of Intelligent Edge and HPC & MCS. Our core business of Compute and Storage is pointing to signs of stabilization, and our as-a-service ARR continues to show strong momentum aligned to our outlook. We have been proactive in strengthening our financial foundation and aligning resources to critical areas to transform our core. This will ultimately drive sustainable, profitable growth and shareholder returns for the long run. 
Let me close by reiterating that I'm very proud of what we have accomplished as a team during very challenging and uncertain times, and we look forward to fiscal year '21. Now with that, let's open it up for questions. Thank you."

So look, if you look at total revenue in Compute, as Antonio said and I think I reiterated, too, revenue was up low single digits when you normalize for Q3 and Q4 for backlog conversion, right? So considering where we were at the end of Q2, the team did an outstanding job of driving supply chain efficiencies and clearing that backlog. The backlog is no more a problem. It's back to normalized levels. 
Specifically with respect to order trends and momentum, order trends were encouraging, then this is pointing to further stabilization in this business. And most importantly, if you look on a combined view, for servers across Compute and HPC & MCS, which is how the market tracks service performance, our total net revenue in the servers would be up low single digits sequentially and up low double digits sequentially if you exclude the impact of backlog in Q3 and Q4. So we feel we gained revenue market share in total servers for the second consecutive quarter. 
Now when you look at margins in that context, gross and operating margins were pressurized by clearing backlog as we had to fulfill orders in Q4 at cost levels higher than they were originally quoted. Having said that, we're pleased to report now, again, that the backlog has returned to normalized levels, and we continue to improve our supply chain execution. 
As we continue to stabilize this business, we expect gross margins to expand now that backlog is no longer an issue and mix shift to more profitable market segments. We also continue to optimize R&D and sales investments and expect to achieve an operating profit margin of 10% to 12%. This is what we told you as part of our long-term outlook provided at SAM."

Wonder if you could help us understand how you weigh these various cross currents when you look out over calendar '21 opportunities for the Intelligent Edge."

I mean, we committed to doubling down on the edge 2 years ago, where I went on to say that the Intelligent Edge is the next big frontier. And when you think about digital transformation, all starts with connectivity. And in order to participate in the digital transformation, you need connectivity, you need security, and then ultimately, you need to bring the cloud computing where the data is created. And we have now seen that the vast majority of the data is created outside the data center, outside the big cloud and more and more where we live and work. 
Obviously, the pandemic has validated what I said 2 years ago that the enterprise of the future will be edge-centric, cloud-enabled and data-driven. And when I think about our Q4 performance, and I'm going to speak organically because the Silver Peak acquisition was just 4, 5 weeks in our numbers, we grew year-over-year versus our competitors in the traditional space, whether it's Cisco or others, declined. And that's where we believe we are going to gain share. 
And the reason why we believe that momentum will continue is not just because of the transformation that we see in customers, particularly as we're going to be in a much more distributed enterprise where connectivity has to be ubiquitous, is because we have a cloud-native solution. It is important that the street understand our Aruba Edge Services platform is a software company and provides cloud -- connectivity from the cloud with security, analytics, AI and all the things that you need in this environment, a massive scale. And it has to be designed for devices, people and things. 
And that's why we have, in that platform today, more than 65,000 customers, and we are adding 14,000 new devices every single day. And that momentum is all about the experience we can provide. And this is why we saw the 14% growth sequentially, and also, we saw the 5% year-over-year growth. But what is interesting is it is a Software-as-a-Service growth because ultimately, that contributes to our ARR. And by the way, our switching was up sequentially high single digits versus our competitor down. And our wireless line was up 20% quarter-over-quarter. So we believe we have something specially unique here, right in the middle of what the customer demand is. I don't know, Tarek, if you want to add any commentary."

But what I'm really pleased is the all the momentum and the sequential growth that we continue to see and the demand, particularly in the growth areas, but also very pleased with what is pointed to the stabilization of the core business. The fact that our Compute orders grew sequentially 2% is very, very good. 
We also saw sequential growth in Storage in orders. And I think it's pointed to different solutions, Wamsi. Obviously, we see containers. We see applications. We see everything that's optimized. Data recovery is one aspect of it. VDI is another aspect of it. I think there is a shift in not just buying infrastructure but that type of infrastructure, which is way more optimized. 
And one of the things we see, obviously, is GreenLake. GreenLake is a driving force for pulling through our portfolio. And when you pull that portfolio through, Compute and Storage win. And that's where we discussed at SAM, not only we need to focus on the stabilization but the transformation of the business to become more software and silicon-oriented, which the exact example of that is we introduced our silicon root of trust version 2.0, which is the most secure platform on the planet. 
But what is interesting, if you listen to some of our competitors, including [ today ], they say that 96% of the spend is still on-prem. This is not my words. It's a big cloud provider who said that. And that transition is an important transition for us to capture, and that's where we went ahead with our on-premise solutions as a service. So that's why I think there is definitely stabilization in demand. There is increased demand in certain areas associated with connectivity, AI, data. We see more world optimized solution. We see more IT resiliency needed at this point in time. And that's where as we enter Q1, we enter with a very strong momentum on our orders, and that's why we were confident with Tarek to raise our guidance for the year."

Well, that's part of the thesis why we combine Cray with the organic portfolio HPE had. You need to look at the segmentation of the business. Obviously, Cray plays on the top end of the supercomputer market with a unique set of technologies both in software and silicon. That's very important to understand. Cray brought to us a fully verticalized stack from the silicon, particularly in the interconnect fabric to the entire software to manage these very specialized world which is a significant point of differentiation for us. 
And then the HP Apollo, which is a platform I actually introduced when I was running the Compute business in 2013, plays more in the mid-range and the low end in a density-optimized and other type of workloads. The combination drives tremendous synergies across the entire segment. And it's true it is lumpy, no question about it. But it's lumpy because the way the mechanics works in terms of revenue recognition. So in this business, obviously, you take the order, then you have the time to build it. It takes sometimes months to build one of these systems. You have to ship it, you have to install it. You have to run the workload. And only when the customer give us acceptance, we can recognize revenue. 
But remember, what we show you a sum is the fact that we have more than $2 billion in backlog, meaning awarded business that we expect to ship between '21 and '22. And that business is already won, okay? And some of those include exascale systems, which obviously, we shared the data with you, which we won 5 out of 6. But since SAM, we won new deals and I quoted some of those in my opening remarks, like the deal and the European Union deal. And these are typical. And the reason why we win is because we have a very set of specialized technology and the need to co-locate data in compute is unique. 
And that's why not only we continue to grow the business at the pace you saw, but also we own 39 of the top 500 supercomputers and we own 37% of the share. So we are very pleased with this business. Altice is coming through. And the reason is because of data. Data is exploding. AI is now a democratized tool. In many ways, you need High Performance Compute capabilities to run it. By the way, we see now the momentum on margins, too. right, because now we own more of that stack."

Listen, as we look into the future, our business needs, opportunities for cost savings, simplifying our footprint and also, remember, we learned quite a bit, Sharon, about the team preferences about the future of work. Altogether, we made the decision to relocate the headquarters. 
Let me be clear, our technological hub for innovation, particularly in Aruba, software, storage, is in Silicon Valley. And basically, what we are doing is consolidating our Silicon Valley footprint in the state-of-the-art San Jose headquarters that we opened last year. This is our technological hub. Now for nontechnical hub and jobs, we decided to move the headquarters to Texas because you have access to diverse talent and ability to attract and retain is unique and differentiated. 
So what we are creating here is 2 very strong hubs with clear mandate on each of them. From a taxes perspective, there is not because we are incorporated in Delaware to begin with. Definitely, our savings associated with the real estate because you rationalize the area footprint, you expect savings. The cost of the new site in Houston was already included in our numbers because we already were building that since [ 2000 ] -- beginning of 2020. That was already in the plan. We are not changing anything. So we're just relocating that. 
And what we're doing for the unique job functions that we believe are better suited to be in Houston, we are offering a voluntary move to the employees. And there will be no jobs impact in California. So that's pretty much it. And we are creating, again, 2 very strong hubs for our company and rationalize the footprint that will drive cost savings over time, which by the way, they're part of Project Accelerate as we go along."

So when you look at the Financial Services business, the bad debt loss ratio is just over 1%. It's up modestly. I'm very comfortable personally with that level, given what happened in the pandemic. And we are absolutely satisfied with the way the business unit has performed. The team has worked incredibly hard to give payment holidays to certain customers who needed it. This is why year-over-year, you see the revenue dropping but the profitability hasn't dropped dramatically at all. And that is testing of the way the management team has performed this year. 
And it's actually what that translates into is an extremely strong position for the future because what happened is that you had contract extended as a result of those ""payment holidays"". And when those contents extend, that, over time, leads to higher returns as you know in the leasing space. So on the whole, I feel very, very positive about the performance of HPFS. We want to reiterate cash collections have already returned to pre-COVID levels, which is good. Economically, it's a sound position also for the economy. We're now collecting cash on deferrals granted earlier in the year. And that level of deferral was granted to a small subset of the customers.

Hewlett Packard Enterprise finished the year with a very strong performance. In Q4, we saw a notable rebound in our overall revenue with particular acceleration in key growth areas of our business.
As we reviewed at the last month's Securities Analyst Meeting, we are focused on a set of strategic priorities to drive long-term sustainable profitable growth and accelerating -- and pursue sustainable profitable growth. This includes stabilization of our core businesses, doubling down in areas of growth and accelerating our pivot to as a service while taking decisive action to strengthen our financial foundation and become a more agile company. We executed with precision on these strategic priorities, and I'm proud of the results in what has been a very challenging fiscal year '20.
Let me review a few Q4 highlights. First, our total revenue of $7.2 billion returned to pre-pandemic levels, up 5% sequentially and flat on a year-over-year basis. We saw increased new orders momentum across all business segments of our company. As I stated in our Q3 earnings, we expect continued gradual performance improvement moving forward. As expected, we returned our backlog to normalized levels this quarter. In Compute, revenue declined 7% sequentially but was up low single digits when normalized for backlog over the last 2 quarters. We are encouraged by new orders intake that point to stabilization in this business, taking into account the typical Q1 seasonality.
Most importantly, if you look at the combined server view across Compute and HPC & MCS businesses, which is how the market tracks server performance, our total net revenue in the server market will be up 3% sequentially and up 1% year-over-year. As a result, we believe we gained share in total server for the second consecutive quarter.
In Storage, revenue grew 7% sequentially to $1.2 billion. We also expanded our operating profit to 16.7%, an improvement of 380 basis points sequentially and within the target profitability range of 16% to 18% we discussed at SAM. In both Compute and Storage, we drove higher level of operational services intensity consistent with prior quarter performance.
In Q4, we accelerated our business performance in key growth businesses. In Intelligent Edge, revenue rebounded to $786 million, up 14% sequentially and 5% year-over-year. This business performed exceptionally well against the market backdrop. High Performance Compute and Mission Critical Systems had an outstanding quarter, recording revenue of $975 million. This business grew 50% sequentially and 25% year-over-year. Our Pivotal as a Service continued its strong momentum. Our annualized revenue run rate of $585 million was up 11% sequentially and 30% year-over-year. The on-premises as a service market is growing rapidly, especially in the hybrid environment and remains a significant long-term value driver for us and our shareholders.
Through strong operational execution, we delivered non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.37, up 16% sequentially and above the high end of our guidance. Free cash flow of $223 million was in line with our Q3 and SAM guidance. Additionally, we declared our Q1 dividend today, which will be paid on January 6. As we have said in the past, dividends remain an important part of our capital allocation framework that consists of capital returns to shareholders and strategic investments that together drive long-term shareholder value.
Based on the strong finish to fiscal year '20 and increased confidence in profitability going into Q1, we are raising our fiscal year '21 non-GAAP EPS guidance by $0.03 at the midpoint. Tarek will review our financial performance and outlook in greater detail, but I will first provide some context around our execution and customer reactions to our approach and offerings.  
The global pandemic has forced businesses to rethink everything from remote work and collaboration to business continuity and data insight. Over the last several months, we have seen growing momentum in our businesses as customers increasingly turned to HPE for capabilities from edge to cloud. Our unique set of capabilities help our customers empower their workforces, deploy new resilient IT solutions and extract insight from critical data while leveraging and consuming these solutions more flexibly as a service.
We continue to strengthen our core businesses in Compute and Storage, which provide critical capabilities to customers and are foundational to our edge to cloud platform as a service strategy. In Compute, the team did an outstanding job of driving supply chain efficiencies and clearing the historical levels of backlog. We will continue our focus on streamlining processes to enhance productivity in this high-volume business.
We are a market leader in Compute, and we are being deliberate in our focus on gaining market share in profitable market segments. This quarter, we became the first company to embed silicon-based security into our industry-standard servers being manufacturing through our HPE trusted supply chain in the United States. This security is critical to a growing number of U.S. customers across federal, public banking and finance and health care verticals.
We also launched a new HPE Inference Solution on HPE ProLiant servers in conjunction with Red Hat and NVIDIA to accelerate machine learning directed at the AI and containers market. 
In Storage, we have been on a multiyear journey to create an intelligent data platform from edge-to-cloud and pivot to software-as-a-service data storage solutions, which enable higher level of operational services attach and margin expansion. And our strategy is getting traction. Our portfolio is well positioned in high-growth areas like all-flash array, which grew 29% year-over-year; big data storage, which had its sixth consecutive quarter of growth, up 41% year-over-year; and hyperconverged infrastructure where Nimble dHCI, our new hyperconverged solution, continued momentum and gained share, growing 280% year-over-year.
We also committed to doubling down in growth businesses and investing to fuel future growth. The Intelligent Edge is a critical segment where we declared the opportunity early on and are increasingly differentiated. At the edge, customers need secure seamless connectivity to bridge the digital/physical worlds and the ability to generate actionable analytics where the data is created. This is why Aruba is seeing traction and gaining market share with a leading and highly differentiated portfolio of solutions such as our cloud native Aruba Edge Services platform, which also contributes to ARR growth.
For example, the Pentagon is modernizing both its classified and unclassified networks to support tens of thousands of devices daily using Aruba ESP-based architecture. Comcast also chose our Aruba ESP to power its new Comcast Business Teleworker VPN. The service supports and secures multiple end points in our remote work site, including laptops, desktops, voice-over-IP phones and printers, and partners can centrally manage remote workers and all its infrastructure from a single Aruba ESP cloud console.
This quarter, we expect to take share in both campus switching and wireless LAN with our best-in-class portfolio, which was just recognized as a leader for the 15th year in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for wired and wireless LAN infrastructure.
Finally, towards the end of Q4, we closed the acquisition of Silver Peak, which will accelerate Aruba SD-WAN growth in an attractive market growing over 20% and enable our edge-to-cloud platform as a service vision. Silver Peak brings industry-leading technology and was named a leader in the Gartner 2020 Magic Quadrant for WAN edge infrastructure. We believe the explosion of devices, applications and data at the edge will continue to drive demand for secure connectivity, cloud computing capabilities and analytics, especially in a post-COVID world.
Another high-growth segment where we are extremely well positioned is in high performance computing. In Q4, we performed exceptionally well across the portfolio, with growth in Cray products, mission-critical systems, operational support services and HPE Apollo. The team did an outstanding job in converting the existing backlog and new orders to drive a record quarter-breaking nearly $1 billion revenue.
Q4 marked our first full quarter of Cray operational activity integrated into HPE systems, and the combination of Cray and HPE is driving increased revenue and cost synergies. We signed several large customer deals during the quarter, including 3 exascale system design wins that will use the HPE Cray EX supercomputers. These wins include a $34 million contract with Pawsey Supercomputing Centre in Australia and a $160 million contract with a European high-performance joint undertaking initiative to deliver one of the world's fastest supercomputers that will be used by 10 European countries.
We extended our #1 market position in HPC with 37% market share as of calendar Q2 data, which is 10 points above the next closest competitor. According to the list of the top 500 supercomputers released 2 weeks ago, HPE and Cray systems makes 39 of the top 100 systems more than any other company.
In addition, our HPE Apollo Systems had its highest revenue quarter ever. As an example of the traction we are seeing with Apollo -- with our Apollo value proposition, Mercedes-Benz Grand Prix, constructor of the Mercedes-AMG Petronas Formula One Team, signed a deal for the new Apollo system. Modeling and simulations are about gaining a competitive advantage on the track, and our HPE technology is critical to this team's race strategy.
Going forward, we are working to bring high performance compute to everyday enterprise environments. Stay tuned for more announcement on this front in the coming few weeks.
Consumption-based solutions provide an attractive alternative for customers looking to drive innovation and modernized infrastructure without the capital and operational expenses tied to over-provisioning. We are a leader in on-premises as a service and have been investing in our HPE software platform and HPE GreenLake managed services offerings to enable a true consumption-based experience that is unique.
Customers are recognizing our differentiated products and services, which can be seen in our as-a-service order growth of 20% year-over-year. This quarter, we continue to expand our offerings and introduce HPE GreenLake VDI cloud services. Building on the success of our ready-to-go virtual desktop infrastructure solutions launched early in the year to help customers with immediate connectivity needs, this new solution provides configurations that are optimized for each type of remote worker.
Customers can easily scale usage up and down, which is a compelling and critical capability in today's environment. By leveraging expanded partnership with Citrix, Nutanix, NVIDIA, VMware and Wipro, we can offer comprehensive solutions to an expanded customer base. Our advanced capabilities are driving strong customer demand across diverse markets and industry. We recently announced several new customers. Nokia Software is using HPE GreenLake cloud services to embed further cost and energy savings into its data storage portfolio. Microgen, a leading precision medicine and biotechnology company, selected HPE GreenLake to modernize its IT operations to analyze large-scale medical data on-premises.
YF Life Insurance, a fast growing fintech company based in Hong Kong also selected HPE GreenLake to strengthen its online sales platform applications and fintech support systems. The momentum we are realizing in each of these areas is possible because of our focused strategy and disciplined execution. By innovating and investing in the most impactful areas and optimizing how we manage our own business, we are ensuring we are in the best possible position to help our customers manage theirs.
Early in the pandemic, we recognized there was no going back to what used to be, only preparing for and building what comes next. This is one of the reasons we have made the recent decision to relocate HPE's headquarters to Houston. We have listened to our team members' preferences about the future of work and reimagined our real estate site to optimize and improve how both physical and virtual offices -- office spaces are used in this new area. Houston has long been HPE's largest U.S. employment hub, and we are currently constructing a state-of-the-art new campus.
Obviously, we intend to maintain our innovation tech hub in San Jose, California. Our Aruba headquarters will be housed within our digital-enabled San Jose site, so storage and software. There will be no layoff associated with this move and consolidation. We are committed to both markets as critical parts of our talent and real estate strategy in a post-pandemic world.
As we have been transforming how we work, we have also recognized that we have an enormous opportunity for customers to transform and digitize their business to adapt and operate in a new world. Business continuity and success depend on solutions and advanced IT resiliency, empower more workforces securely, extend connectivity, reinvigorate customer engagement and enable business model evolution. Against this backdrop, HPE has delivered despite the challenging circumstances.
We have brought new capabilities and experiences to our customers to meet their emerging needs. We have invested in both organic innovation and M&A that strengthen and differentiate our position in the market. We have acted quickly to protect our financial foundation and become a more agile company. And we have remained committed to our culture. We have asked a lot to our team this year, and I am personally immensely proud and grateful for the significant courageous contribution.
There is no question there is more work to be done, but our customers have validated our vision, and we have demonstrated in Q4 and throughout 2020 that we have the right team and the right strategies in place to execute on that vision. While there remains continued uncertainty in the world, there is also a great deal of promise and optimism. The HPE we created 5 years ago has an important role to play in the world's recovery from an unprecedented pandemic. That presents an opportunity for our company and for our investors. I am confident we will continue to rise to the occasion and deliver in bold new ways.
With that, let me turn it over to Tarek to review the quarter's results."

I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020. As usual, I'll be referencing the slides from our earnings presentation to highlight our performance in the quarter. Antonio discu",2019,"Thank you very much, Antonio. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020. As usual, I'll be referencing the slides from our earnings presentation to highlight our performance in the quarter. Antonio discussed the key highlights for this quarter on Slide 4, so now let me discuss our financial performance starting with Slide 5.
I am very pleased to report that Q4 marked a return of revenue to pre-pandemic levels. We delivered Q4 revenues of $7.2 billion, up 5% sequentially and flat from the prior year period as our growth businesses of Intelligent Edge and HPC, MCS executed strongly. We also cleared our backlog by a further $250 million during the quarter, which has now returned to normalized levels as we exited Q4. As a result of the improved revenue performance, we have grown non-GAAP gross profit by 7% sequentially to $2.2 billion in Q4. Non-GAAP gross margins of 30.6% were also up sequentially, driven by positive mix shift towards Intelligent Edge, Storage and HPC, MCS, all of which reported strong sequential revenue growth.
Our non-GAAP operating profit was up 15% sequentially, resulting in a 7.7% operating margin, and our non-GAAP EPS of $0.37 was up 16% sequentially. Q4 cash flow from operations was $747 million, driven by strong operational execution. Free cash flow was $223 million, and that was in line with our guidance as we saw the expected reversal in the favorable working capital movements from elevated backlog in Q3. Finally, we paid $154 million of dividends in the quarter and are declaring a Q1 dividend today of $0.12 per share payable in January 2021.
Now let's turn to our segment highlights in Slides 6 and 7. As you can see, we are doing exactly what we said we would do at SAM in October. We're doubling down on our growth businesses of Intelligent Edge and HPC, MCS while stabilizing our core business segments of Compute and Storage.
In Intelligent Edge, we continued our momentum with 14% quarter-over-quarter and 5% year-over-year growth. We also expect to take share in both campus switching and wireless LAN with our best-in-class portfolio, which was just recognized as a leader for the 15th year in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for wired and wireless LAN access infrastructure.
We're also beginning to see the operating profit potential of this business with operating margin in Q4 of 10.1%, up 150 basis points quarter-over-quarter and 390 basis points year-over-year as we drove greater productivity from prior investments in this business. Finally, we closed the Silver Peak acquisition on September 21, so it had a minimal contribution in Q4. But obviously, Silver Peak will be more meaningful going forward.
In HPC & MCS, revenue reached record levels near $1 billion, growing 50% sequentially and 25% year-over-year, driven by strong performance in Cray, HPC Apollo and MCS. We executed well against our existing order book with increased customer acceptances and grew orders further with a healthy pipeline. As you know, this business can be lumpy with revenue recognition and profitability linked to completion of critical customer milestones. While we do expect to see a normal seasonal decline in Q1 '21, we are well on our way to delivering our 8% to 12% 3-year revenue CAGR outlined at SAM.
In Compute, revenue declined 7% sequentially but was up low single digits when normalizing Q3 and Q4 results for backlog conversion. Gross and operating margins were also pressured by clearing the backlog as we had to fulfill orders at cost levels higher than originally quoted. We are pleased to report that backlog has now returned to normalized levels, thanks to continued improvements in our supply chain execution.
Within Storage, we grew revenue 7% quarter-over-quarter, driven by strong operational execution, reduced backlog and improved order momentum in key areas of the portfolio. We saw notable strength in big data, up 27% sequentially, driven by increased customer focus on AI, machine learning-related applications; all-flash array storage up 19% sequentially by increased -- driven by increased adoption of Primera All-flash and dHCI, which grew double digits sequentially. We also expanded operating margins this quarter, which was up 380 basis points quarter-on-quarter, ending at 16.7% of revenue and already aligned to our SAM fiscal year '23 targets.
With respect to Pointnext operational services, which is included across our Compute, HPC, MCS and Storage segment, total revenue was up 2%, while orders were down 1% on a sequential basis. Additionally, our services intensity, which is the ratio of attach revenue per hardware unit sold, continued to be strong with notable strength in Compute and Storage, excluding Nimble, which were up low single digits growth on a sequential basis.
In Advisory & Professional Services, revenue was up 6% sequentially even as COVID impacted consulting activity and the chargeability levels of our staff. Within HPE Financial Services, financing volume was up 6%, and revenue was up 2% quarter-over-quarter despite the impact of COVID-19. We maintained a solid return on equity of approximately 13% this quarter. Our bad debt loss ratio this quarter was 1.06%, which, while slightly higher than previous quarters, is still best in class and well within our comfort zone as cash collections have already returned back to pre-COVID levels.
In our Communications and Media Solutions business that is included in our Corporate Investments segment, orders were up 18% and revenue was up 6% sequentially, driven by strong double-digit orders and revenue growth in Americas. Additionally, due to our improved cost of delivery, we were able to expand operating margins by 240 basis points quarter-over-quarter. We continue to make good progress in our 5G core strategy that provides multi-vendor integration and true cloud-native telco network functions.
Slide 8 shows key metrics of our growing as-a-service business, which I elaborated on during our recent Securities Analyst Meeting. We are making great strides in our AAS offering. I am pleased to report that our Q4 '20 ARR came in at $585 million, representing 11% quarter-over-quarter and 30% year-over-year reported growth. Total as-a-service orders were up 20% year-over-year, driven by outstanding performance in North America and APJ.
Our HPE Aruba Central SaaS platform also continued to grow revenue strong double digits year-over-year. Based on strong customer demand and recent wins, I am very happy with how this business is delivering and progressing towards its ARR growth targets of 30% to 40% CAGR from fiscal year '20 to fiscal year '23 set at our 2019 SAM and reiterated at our 2020 SAM meeting.
Slide 9 highlights our revenue and EPS performance to date where you can clearly see Q2 was a trough. Strong operational execution has driven sequential revenue growth from a low of $6 billion in Q2 all the way back to $7.2 billion in Q4.
Turning to Slide 10. The rebound in revenue has resulted in a 15% improvement in non-GAAP gross profit from the Q2 trough, which was up to $2.2 billion in Q4. Also, the gross margin rate in Q4 of 30.6% of revenues was up 20 basis points sequentially, driven by a higher mix of Intelligent Edge, Storage and HPC, MCS, which are higher-margin businesses, offset by continued execution of elevated compute backlog, which was a headwind but is now behind us.
Moving to Slide 11. You can see how the improvement in gross profit, combined with progress on our cost optimization plan, has delivered 53% growth in operating profit from the Q2 trough while still investing for growth. As mentioned at SAM, we are making excellent progress in our cost optimization and prioritization plan, which will strengthen our financial foundation while aligning resources to critical growth areas. As of the end of this quarter, we are on track to deliver annualized net run rate savings for at least $800 million from the FY '19 baseline by the end of fiscal year '22, with most of the savings being realized by the end of fiscal year '21. Obviously, we will keep you updated on our progress in the upcoming quarters.
Turning to Slide 12. We generated cash flow from operations of $747 million, and free cash flow was $223 million for the quarter, driven by timing of working capital movements from clearing backlog that resulted in favorability in Q3 but a headwind we flagged for in Q4. We ended fiscal year '20 with free cash flow of $560 million, in line with our outlook provided at SAM 2020. Looking to '21, we expect free cash flow to grow over 75% at the midpoint of our outlook of $900 million to $1.1 billion. Please remember our normal cash flow seasonality, where the second half is a stronger generator of cash flow than the first half.
Now moving on to Slide 13. Let me remind everyone about the strength of our diversified balance sheet and liquidity position, which is a competitive advantage in the current environment. As our October 31 quarter end, we had approximately $4.2 billion of cash after successfully redeeming $3 billion of bonds maturing in October 2020 and paying approximately $853 million, net of cash -- excuse me, $853 million of net cash for closing the Silver Peak transaction. Together with an undrawn revolving credit facility of $4.75 billion at our disposal, we currently have approximately $9 billion of liquidity. 
Finally, I would like to reiterate that we remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade credit rating, which was recently reaffirmed by the rating agencies. Bottom line, we have a strong cash position and ample liquidity available to run our operation, continue to invest in our business and execute on our strategy.
Now turning to outlook on Slide 14. At our recent Securities Analyst Meeting, we provided our outlook for fiscal year '21, and I would encourage you to review my presentation for a more detailed discussion of that outlook. Having said that, let me drill down on a few key areas. We continue to expect to grow our fiscal year '21 non-GAAP operating profit by 15% to 20% and now expect FY '21 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be between $1.60 to $1.78 as a result of increased confidence in margin improvement. This is a $0.03 per share improvement on the midpoint of our prior guidance of $1.56 to $1.76 in EPS.
From a top line perspective, we are pleased with the rebound we saw in Q4 and continue to see gradual improvement but want to remain somewhat cautious due to the uncertain pace of recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. More specifically for Q1 '21, after normalizing for excess backlog reduction in Q4 '20 of $250 million, we expect Q1 '21 revenue to be in line with our normal sequential seasonality of down mid-single digits from Q4.
For fiscal year '21, we expect total revenue to be in line with our long-term financial targets of a CAGR of 1% to 3% presented at our recent Securities Analyst Meeting. For Q1 '21, we expect GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.02 to $0.06 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.40 to $0.44.
So overall, I'm very pleased with the performance in the quarter and execution against our strategy and financial priorities outlined at SAM. We have navigated well through unprecedented challenges this fiscal year and had a very strong finish. Q4 was marked by a strong rebound in revenue as we reduced backlog to normalized levels and saw increased order momentum across all business segments. We saw significant acceleration in customer demand in our growth businesses of Intelligent Edge and HPC, MCS. Our core business of Compute and Storage is pointing to signs of stabilization, and our as-a-service ARR continues to show strong momentum aligned to our outlook. We have been proactive in strengthening our financial foundation and aligning resources to critical areas to transform our core. This will ultimately drive sustainable profitable growth and shareholder returns for the long run.
Let me close by reiterating that I'm very proud of what we have accomplished as a team during very challenging and uncertain times, and we look forward to fiscal year '21. Now with that, let's open it up for questions. Thank you."

So look, if you look at total revenue in Compute, as Antonio said and I think I reiterated, too, revenue was up low single digits when you normalize for Q3 and Q4 for backlog conversion, right? So considering where we were at the end of Q2, the team did an outstanding job of driving supply chain efficiencies and clearing that backlog. The backlog is no more a problem. It's back to normalized levels.
Specifically with respect to order trends and momentum, order trends were encouraging, then this is pointing to further stabilization in this business. And most importantly, if you look on a combined view, for servers across Compute and HPC, MCS, which is how the market tracks service performance, our total net revenue in the servers would be up low single digits sequentially and up low double digits sequentially if you exclude the impact of backlog in Q3 and Q4. So we feel we gained revenue market share in total servers for the second consecutive quarter.
Now when you look at margins in that context, gross and operating margins were pressurized by clearing backlog as we had to fulfill orders in Q4 at cost levels higher than they were originally quoted. Having said that, we're pleased to report now, again, that the backlog has returned to normalized levels, and we continue to improve our supply chain execution.
As we continue to stabilize this business, we expect gross margins to expand now that backlog is no longer an issue and mix shift to more profitable market segments. We also continue to optimize R&D and sales investments and expect to achieve an operating profit margin of 10% to 12%. This is what we told you as part of our long-term outlook provided at SAM."

And then as we think about the total server category, which is Compute plus HPC plus MCS, you combine all of that and basically, when you normalize for the backlog, we would have been up quite a bit sequentially and up low single digits year-over-year.

I mean, we committed to doubling down on the edge 2 years ago, where I went on to say that the Intelligent Edge is the next big frontier. And when you think about digital transformation, all starts with a connectivity. And in order to participate in the digital transformation, you need connectivity, you need security, and then ultimately, you need to bring the cloud computing where the data is created. And we have now seen that the vast majority of the data is created outside the data center, outside the big cloud and more and more where we live and work.
Obviously, the pandemic has validated what I said 2 years ago that the enterprise of the future will be edge centric, cloud enabled and data driven. And when I think about our Q4 performance, and I'm going to speak organically because the Silver Peak acquisition was just 4, 5 weeks in our numbers, we grew year-over-year versus our competitors in the traditional space, whether Cisco or others declined. And that's where we believe we are going to gain share.
And the reason why we believe that momentum will continue is not just because of the transformation that we see in customers, particularly as we're going to be in a much more distributed enterprise where connectivity has to be ubiquitous, is because we have a cloud-native solution. It is important that the Street understand our Aruba Edge Services platform is a software company and provides cloud connectivity -- connectivity from the cloud with security, analytics, AI and all the things that you need in this environment, a massive scale. And it has to be designed for devices, people and things.
And that's why we have, in that platform today, more than 65,000 customers, and we are adding 14,000 new devices every single day. And that momentum is all about the experience we can provide. And this is why we saw the 14% growth sequentially, and also, we saw the 5% year-over-year growth. But what is interesting is it is a Software-as-a-Service growth because, ultimately, that contributes to our ARR. And by the way, our switching was up sequentially high single digits versus our competitor down. And our wireless line was up 20% quarter-over-quarter. So we believe we have something specially unique here, right in the middle of what the customer demand is. I don't know, Tarek, if you want to add any commentary."

But what I'm really pleased is the -- all the momentum and the sequential growth that we continue to see and the demand, particularly in the growth areas but also very pleased with what is pointed to the stabilization of the core business. The fact that our Compute orders grew sequentially 2% is very, very good.
We also saw sequential growth in Storage, in orders. And I think it's pointed to different solutions, Wamsi. Obviously, we see containers. We see bare metal applications. We see everything that's workload optimized. Data recovery is one aspect of it. VDI is another aspect of it. I think there is a shift in not just buying infrastructure but that type of infrastructure, which is way more optimized.
And one of the things we see, obviously, is GreenLake. GreenLake is a driving force for pulling through our portfolio. And when you pull that portfolio through, Compute and Storage win. And that's where we discussed at SAM not only we need to focus on the stabilization but the transformation of the business to become more software and silicon oriented, which the exact example of that is we introduced our silicon root of trust version 2.0, which is the most secure platform on the planet.
But what is interesting, if you listen to some of our competitors, including today, they say that 96% of the spend is still on-prem. This is not my words. It's a big cloud provider who said that. And that transition is an important transition for us to capture, and that's where we went ahead with our on-premise solutions as a service. So that's why I think there is definitely stabilization in demand. There is increased demand in certain areas associated with connectivity, AI, data. We see more workload-optimized solution. We see more IT resiliency needed at this point in time. And that's where, as we enter Q1, we enter with a very strong momentum on our orders, and that's why we were confident with Tarek to raise our guidance for the year."

The appeal has been fully briefed, and we are awaiting the California Court of Appeal to schedule oral argument.
Although we are hopeful that we will receive a ruling from the California Court of Appeal in 2021, obviously, the timing of this is out of our control. We remain confident that the outcome on appeal will be favorable to HPE. And also, I want to remind you all that we would have to share any sort of payment with our cousins at HP Inc."

During your recent Analyst Day, you alluded to this business in addition to Intelligent Edge being contributors to growth. And clearly, this quarter puts an emphasis on that viewpoint. Can you perhaps highlight some of the underlying demand vectors for a business that's been historically lumpy in nature, perhaps the durability of this level of growth looking forward and perhaps progress on reaching customers beyond Cray's historically public sector customer base?"

Well, that's part of the thesis why we combine Cray with the organic portfolio HPE had. You need to look at the segmentation of the business. Obviously, Cray plays on the top end of the supercomputer market with a unique set of technologies both in software and silicon. That's very important to understand. Cray brought to us a fully verticalized stack from the silicon, particularly in the interconnect fabric to the entire software to manage these very specialized workloads, which is a significant point of differentiation for us.
And then the HPE Apollo, which is a platform I actually introduced when I was running the Compute business in 2013, plays more in the mid-range and the low end in a density optimized and other type of workloads. The combination drives tremendous synergies across the entire segment. And it's true it is lumpy, no question about it. But it's lumpy because the way the mechanics works in terms of revenue recognition. So in this business, obviously, you take the order. Then you have the time to build it. It takes sometimes months to build one of these systems. You have to ship it. You have to install it. You have to run the workload. And only when the customer give us acceptance, we can recognize revenue.
But remember, what we showed you at SAM is the fact that we have more than $2 billion in backlog, meaning awarded business that we expect to ship between '21 and '22. And that business is already won, okay? And some of those include exascale systems, which, obviously, we shared the data with you, which we won 5 out of 6. But since SAM, we won new deals, and I quoted some of those in my opening remarks, like the Pawsey deal and the European Union deal. And these are typical. And the reason why we win is because we have a very set of specialized technology, and the need to co-locate data in compute is unique.
And that's why not only we continue to grow the business at the pace you saw, but also we own 39 of the top 500 supercomputers and we own 37% of the share. So we are very pleased with this business. Now our thesis is coming through, and the reason is because of data. Data is exploding. AI is now a democratized tool. In many ways, you need high performance compute capabilities to run it. By the way, we see now the momentum on margins, too, right, because now we own more of that stack."

Listen, as we look into the future, our business needs, opportunities for cost savings, simplifying our footprint and also, remember, we learned quite a bit, Sharon, about the team preferences about the future of work. Altogether, we made the decision to relocate the headquarters.
Let me be clear. Our technological hub for innovation, particularly in Aruba, Software, Storage is in Silicon Valley. And basically, what we are doing is consolidating our Silicon Valley footprint in the state-of-the-art San Jose headquarters that we opened last year. This is our technological hub. Now for nontechnical hub and jobs, we decided to move the headquarters to Texas because you have access to diverse talent, and ability to attract and retain is unique and differentiated.
So what we are creating here is 2 very strong hubs with clear mandate on each of them. From the taxes perspective, there is none because we are incorporated in Delaware to begin with. Definitely, our savings are associated with the real estate because you rationalize the area footprint. You expect savings. The cost of the new site in Houston was already included in our numbers because we already were building that since beginning of 2020. That was already in the plan. We are not changing anything. So we're just relocating that.
And what we're doing for the unique job functions that we believe are better suited to be in Houston, we are offering a voluntary move to employees. And there will be no jobs impact in California. So that's pretty much it. And we are creating, again, 2 very strong hubs for our company and rationalize the footprint that will drive cost savings over time, which, by the way, they're part of Project Accelerate as we go along."

But again, there's still a lot of uncertainty out there. I'm not sure yet what real impact it is. Also, we'll say that customers are now kind of accustomed to deal with this way to work. Obviously, we have been now 9, 10 months in this situation and so business continues. There may be certain things may be slowed down over time because you need access to certain facilities.

And so when you take the combination of the revenue growth, which is outpaced by the operating profit growth, yes, surely, there will be operating margin expansion.
And what's fueling that expansion is the cost optimization and prioritization program, which is well on track and most of the benefits of that program will be attained towards the end of fiscal year '21. And I would want to remind everybody that we are foreseeing $800 million of net run rate savings off the fiscal year '19 baseline. And so you can infer from this where the margins would be by the end of fiscal year '21 leading into fiscal year '22."

So when you look at the Financial Services business, the bad debt loss ratio is just over 1%. It's up modestly. I'm very comfortable personally with that level given what happened in the pandemic. And we are absolutely satisfied with the way the business unit has performed. The team has worked incredibly hard to give payment holidays to certain customers who needed it. This is why year-over-year, you see the revenue dropping but the profitability hasn't dropped dramatically at all. And that is testing of the way the management team has performed this year.
And it's actually what that translates into, is an extremely strong position for the future because what happened is that you had contract extended as a result of those ""payment holidays"". And when those contracts extend, that, over time, leads to higher returns as you know in the leasing space. So on the whole, I feel very, very positive about the performance of HPFS. We want to reiterate cash collections have already returned to pre-COVID levels, which is good. Economically, it's a sound position also for the economy. We're now collecting cash on deferrals granted earlier in the year, and that level of deferral was granted to a small subset of the customers. And we do expect the return on equity to trend back to the 15%-plus levels over the next couple of years."
