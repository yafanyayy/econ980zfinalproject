As usual, I'll begin by providing an update on recent developments at the company, after which Chris Wampler will review our financials in detail. 
As we finish a very important year for the company in 2019. I want to take this opportunity to first review a few highlights of our strong performance. Our team has been working diligently over the past 3 years, improving all of our operations, developing our product portfolio, driving new technologies, focusing on providing high-value to customers and making strategic acquisitions, among others. 
In 2019, Ducommun  sales grew to $721 million, up 15% over 2018 and its highest since 2014. In conjunction with that increase, we grew gross profit to $152 million or 21.1%. Net margin rate for 2019 has not been realized at the company in more than 15 years. 
Adjusted margins rose as well to 7.9% from 6.4% in 2018, and we generated $51 million in cash from operations. Just as important with great top and bottom line growth, EBITDA rose to $92.3 million in 2019 or 12.8% of sales versus $70.7 million or 11.2% of sales last year. We're very proud of all these gains as we develop the company for sustained high-performance in the years ahead. 
Now turning specifically to the fourth quarter, revenue rose 14% year-over-year and marked the sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit increases, averaging 15% growth, which was mainly organic. The majority of the gains were driven by important military programs, such as the F-35, F-15, the Apache helicopter and several missile programs. It also included good growth with Airbus and Boeing. The other real for the quarter was ending the year with a backlog of about $910 million. Boosted by strong orders across numerous key platforms, particularly within our defense business. We also posted an impressive book-to-bill ratio in the quarter of $1.4 million. Again, driven by defense. As mentioned in the press release, we have spent a good amount of time during the past few years improving the performance of our defense operations and business development team. And now are seeing the results. It's also great to see our team leveraging Ducommun's  capability and structures, more and more within the defense markets. And orders in that part of the Ducommun's  business increased sequentially in the second half of the year by 45%. At the same time, we completed another important acquisition, Noble's Worldwide who supplies advanced technical products for a variety of aircraft, naval vessels and military vehicles. The integration is going very well and the team is already adding great value, opening new markets and opportunities for Ducommun, along with expanding our engineered products portfolio. 
As also mentioned in the press release, we're off to a strong start in 2020 within many areas of the company. In addition, we are also working closely with Boeing and spirit Aerosystems on the 737 MAX. After the announcements in December from both companies Ducommun took action in January to ensure all costs within our affected operations  are being closely and practically managed. All of our affected operations have been working to minimize the impact. And due to some of our successes with new business, we have been able to redeploy some employees. The amount of personnel furloughed in January due to the MAX is less than 3%. And though difficult, we are proud of our performance center teams proactively dealing with the situation. 
That being said, we are looking forward to starting production back later in Q1 with Spirit, based on public comments and communication from them and with Boeing as soon as April. We're also well positioned operationally to meet any rate requirements along with the ramp-up in the future. In regards to the 2020 outlook, we see our strong backlog in defense, growing business with Airbus and our strategic supplier agreement with Raytheon, which we announced in July 2019, as all examples of programs, helping to offset this year's revenue headwind with 737 MAX production. 
Company is also benefiting from new process technologies, exemplified by our $200 million 10-year contract to supply Middle River Aerostructures with LEAP engine to sell components for the A320 platform. This business utilizes the Ducommun's proprietary Versacore composite process technology will deliver over $10 million in 2020 revenue with a full ramp-up to $20 million in 2021 and is now all being fully produced at our Mexico performance Center. 
The Nobles acquisition closed in October 2019, will also help provide additional revenue this year. Finally, all the hard work in the past 3 years, including process improvements, restructuring, leadership development, cost discipline and other initiatives will also contribute in 2020. Therefore, Ducommun's  2020 revenue growth based on both Spirit and Boeing following through on their public comments regarding their production plans should be flat to slightly down low single digit in the first half of 2020 and up low single digits in the second half of 2020. 
Coming off the last few years, this is certainly more modest, but other the circumstances, with 737 -- with the 737 MAX situation, we feel it's an excellent outcome shows the company's development in the past few years, and we will deliver on our commitments. 
Now let me provide some additional color on our markets, products and programs. Beginning with our military and space sector. We posted fourth quarter revenue of $89.5 million, up 22% versus 2018. In 2019, we drove sales of nearly $325 million, a gain of over 17% over 2018 reflecting growth across a broad variety of defense platforms, including nearly every aspect of our product portfolio. We saw a double-digit increase in demand for our military fixed-wing aircraft programs particularly strong shipments from the F-15 and F-35 as well as substantial top line expansion for helicopters like the Apache, Black Hawk and Chinook. 
In addition, the Patriot missile system rose to become one of our top sellers last year. We saw significant growth across many other military and space applications. We are well positioned for future growth across our defense platforms in 2020, again, in all sectors and began the year with a backlog of roughly $450 million, up 32% year-over-year. 
Within our commercial aerospace operations, fourth quarter sales declined slightly year-over-year to $83 million, while the 2019 as a whole, revenue grew 15% to just over $350 million. Ducommun's  growth continues to be fueled by large narrow-body aircraft platforms, nearly all of which saw double-digit growth last year. 
While Boeing is still our largest customer, and the 737 MAX, a major contributor to revenue, Ducommun's expansion with Airbus since 2017 has clearly helped and put important balance in our portfolio. The Airbus A320 and A220 families, in particular, has become very important factors in our growth trajectory. And Airbus in total represents a larger and larger share, both directly and indirectly into Ducommun's  commercial revenue last quarter. The backlog within our commercial aerospace sector stood at roughly $431 million at the end of 2019 positioning us well for solid performance going forward. Despite some uncertainty with the 737 MAX production schedule, we remain optimistic about the commercial market, given the breadth of key platforms, we serve in this market in 2020. 
With that, I'll have Chris review our financial results in detail. Chris?"

As a reminder, please see the company's filings and today's press release for further description of matters under discussion during the call.  2019, as Steve discussed, was a year of great accomplishment fo",1084,"Thank you, Steve. And good afternoon, everyone. As a reminder, please see the company's filings and today's press release for further description of matters under discussion during the call.  2019, as Steve discussed, was a year of great accomplishment for Ducommun that included strong top line growth, solid margin expansion, adjusted EBITDA growth and a variety of wins that position us well for the future. Our Ducommun operating system and its performance center focused factory approach continues to be a catalyst in driving the improvement of the year-over-year operating results. We feel confident that our efforts to broaden our customer base and streamline the business will continue to serve us well as we head into 2020 and beyond. 
Now I'll move to the details of our overall results. A review of the fourth quarter 2019. Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2019 was $186.9 million versus $164.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2018. The performance was driven primarily by $16.1 million of higher sales within the military and space sector and, to a lesser extent, $3.6 million of greater revenue from our commercial aerospace customers. Both end markets saw increased demand across a variety of platforms and programs. Ducommun's overall backlog at the end of the fourth quarter was approximately $910 million, a new record for the company. As a reminder, we define backlog as potential revenue based on customer purchase orders and long-term agreements with firm fixed prices and expected delivery dates of 24 months or less. Our focused factory approach at our performance centers continues to drive strong margins as our gross margin was 21.5% in the fourth quarter versus 19.9% in the prior year's comparable period. The increase year-over-year was primarily due to the impact of favorable volume, along with the manufacturing efficiencies. This was our highest gross profit percentage quarter since the second quarter of 2010. And our Q4 gross profit amount of $40.1 million was the highest gross profit dollar result in the company's history. 
SG&A was $24.9 million in the fourth quarter versus $22.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, with the increase primarily reflecting incremental SG&A from the Nobles business and higher compensation and benefit costs. The company reported operating income for the fourth quarter of $15.2 million or 8.1% of revenue compared to $6.3 million or 3.8% of revenue in the prior period. The year-over-year improvement was due to higher revenue, higher gross profit and the fact that the prior year included, in aggregate, $4.5 million of restructure charges and refinancing costs. 
The 2019 fourth quarter by comparison included a total of $0.6 million of purchase accounting adjustments and refinancing costs. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $15.8 million or 8.4% of sales in the fourth quarter of 2019 versus $10.8 million or 6.6% of sales in 2018. 
Interest expense was $5.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 and versus $3.8 million in the prior year period due to higher debt levels related to the company's acquisition of Nobles in October 2019. As announced on December 20, 2019, we executed a debt refinancing, which included entering into a term loan A of $140 million to clear our $100 million revolver as well as pay down some of our term loan B which carries a higher interest rate. The company reported net income for the fourth quarter of $8.9 million or $0.75 per diluted share compared to net income of $0.7 million or $0.06 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2018. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to $7.4 million of higher gross profit and lower restructure and other charges, as I previously mentioned. 
Adjusted net income was $9.5 million or $0.80 per diluted share in the fourth quarter and 2019 fourth quarter versus $5.2 million or $0.44 per share in the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2019 was $25.2 million or 13.5% of revenue compared to $19.4 million or 11.8% of revenue for the comparable period in 2018, an increase of 170 basis points. 
Now let me turn to the segment results. Electronic Systems. Our Electronic Systems segment posted revenue of $96.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 versus $85.3 million in the prior year period. These results reflect a $9.3 million increase in sales to our military and space customers, while commercial aerospace shipments were down slightly year-over-year. Electronic Systems posted operating income for the fourth quarter of $9.9 million or 10.2% of revenue versus $7.5 million or 8.7% of revenue in the prior period. Excluding restructure -- restructuring charges last year. Electronic's adjusted operating margin was 11.5% for the 2018 fourth quarter, with the year-over-year decline reflecting product mix. 
Structural systems. Our Structural Systems segment posted revenue of $90.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 versus $78.9 million last year. The year-over-year increase was due to $4.9 million of higher sales across our commercial aerospace applications, primarily large airframe single-aisle platforms and a $6.8 million increase in revenue within the company's military and space markets. 
Structural Systems posted operating income for the quarter of $11.6 million or 12.8% of revenue compared to $5.7 million or 7.2% of revenue last year. Excluding restructuring charges and inventory purchase accounting adjustments, Structure's adjusted operating margin was 13.4% for the 20,194th quarter and 8.7% for the 20,184th quarter. The year-over-year operating margin improvement reflects favorable product mix and improved manufacturing efficiencies. 
Corporate, general and administrative expense. CG&A expense for the fourth quarter of 2019 was $6.3 million or 3.4% of revenue versus $6.9 million or 4.2% of revenue in 2018. The year-over-year decrease was due to lower restructuring charges of $0.3 million and lower general corporate expenses of $0.2 million. 
Turning to liquidity and capital resources. We generated $31 million of cash from operations in the fourth quarter of 2019 and $51 million for the full year compared with $13 million during the prior year quarter and $46 million for 2018 in total. We remain committed to managing working capital effectively and improving asset utilization to maintain solid margins and generate as much operating cash as possible. 
In terms of capital expenditures, we spent $3.9 million during the fourth quarter and $18.8 million for the full year. We anticipate spending $16 million to $18 million in 2020 to support new programs and product development. 
We're again pleased with our full year and fourth quarter performance and remain upbeat on our future results. 
I'll now turn it back over to Steve for his closing remarks. Steve?"

But I mean, on the question related to what we're currently doing or as these assets are being -- taking a step back on the level of utilization. The benefit we have is we're not -- we don't have one facility that is our MAX 737 facility, that's carrying the brunt of all of this, the headwind that's coming at us. So the headwind is splitted out amongst 3 to 4 facilities that all have pieces of that and so with that, and then with having the other commercial and then the defense customers that we have that can pick up the slack. That's what gives us the increased flexibility versus if we were sitting there with 1 facility that was going to take on all this headwind. So that's why we can -- that's why we flex what we did. That's why we feel like we can manage. And certainly, as Steve alluded to, first half of the year, but a little more challenging. And then as the growth is kicking and all the other things, along with the MAX rate picking up the second half of the year certainly helps out. And then as we go forward, then that, again, makes it easier to sort of ramp up because you're not talking about -- you're not talking about for a company our size of hundreds of people at 1 location, you're talking about sort of just ramping it up a little bit."

As usual, I'll begin by providing an update on recent developments at the company, after which Chris Wampler will review our financials in detail. 
As we finish a very important year for the company in 2019, I want to take this opportunity to first review a few highlights of our strong performance. Our team has been working diligently over the past 3 years, improving all of our operations, developing our product portfolio, driving new technologies, focusing on providing high-value to customers and making strategic acquisitions, among others. 
In 2019, Ducommun sales grew to $721 million, up 15% over 2018 and its highest since 2014. In conjunction with that increase, we grew gross profit to $152 million or 21.1%. Net margin rate for 2019 has not been realized at the company in more than 15 years. 
Adjusted margins rose as well to 7.9% from 6.4% in 2018, and we generated $51 million in cash from operations. Just as important with great top and bottom line growth, EBITDA rose to $92.3 million in 2019 or 12.8% of sales versus $70.7 million or 11.2% of sales last year. We're very proud of all these gains as we develop the company for sustained high-performance in the years ahead. 
Now turning specifically to the fourth quarter, revenue rose 14% year-over-year and marked the sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit increases, averaging 15% growth, which was mainly organic. The majority of the gains were driven by important military programs, such as the F-35, F-15, the Apache helicopter and several missile programs. It also included good growth with Airbus and Boeing. The other real bright spot for the quarter was ending the year with a backlog of about $910 million bolstered by strong orders across numerous key platforms, particularly within our defense business. We also posted an impressive book-to-bill ratio in the quarter of 1.4, again driven by defense. As mentioned in the press release, we have spent a good amount of time during the past few years improving the performance of our defense operations and business development team, and now are seeing the results. It's also great to see our team leveraging Ducommun's  capabilities and structures, more and more within the defense markets. And orders in that part of the Ducommun's  business increased sequentially in the second half of the year by 45%. At the same time, we completed another important acquisition, Nobles Worldwide, who supplies advanced technical products for a variety of aircraft, naval vessels and military vehicles. The integration is going very well and the team is already adding great value, opening new markets and opportunities for Ducommun, along with expanding our engineered products portfolio. 
As also mentioned in the press release, we're off to a strong start in 2020 within many areas of the company. In addition, we are also working closely with Boeing and Spirit AeroSystems on the 737 MAX. After the announcements in December from both companies, Ducommun took action in January to ensure all costs within our affected operations are being closely and proactively managed. All of our affected operations have been working to minimize the impact. And due to some of our successes with new business, we have been able to redeploy some employees. The amount of personnel furloughed in January due to the MAX is less than 3%. And though difficult, we are proud of our performance center teams proactively dealing with the situation. 
That being said, we are looking forward to starting production back later in Q1 with Spirit, based on public comments and communication from them and with Boeing as soon as April. We're also well positioned operationally to meet any rate requirements along with the ramp-up in the future. In regards to the 2020 outlook, we see our strong backlog in defense, growing business with Airbus and our strategic supplier agreement with Raytheon, which we announced in July 2019, as all examples of programs, helping to offset this year's revenue headwind with 737 MAX production. 
Company is also benefiting from new process technologies, exemplified by our $200 million 10-year contract to supply Middle River AeroStructures with LEAP engine nacelle components for the A320 platform. This business utilizing Ducommun's proprietary VersaCore Composite process technology will deliver over $10 million in 2020 revenue with a full ramp-up to $20 million in 2021 and is now all being fully produced at our Guaymas, Mexico performance center. 
The Nobles acquisition closed in October 2019, will also help provide additional revenue this year. Finally, all the hard work in the past few years, including process improvements, restructuring, leadership development, cost discipline and other initiatives will also contribute in 2020. Therefore, Ducommun's  2020 revenue growth based on both Spirit and Boeing following through on their public comments regarding their production plans should be flat to slightly down low single digit in the first half of 2020 and up low single digits in the second half of 2020. 
Coming off the last few years, this is certainly more modest, but other than the circumstances with 737 -- with the 737 MAX situation, we feel it's an excellent outcome, shows the company's development in the past few years, and we will deliver on our commitments. 
Now let me provide some additional color on our markets, products and programs. Beginning with our military and space sector, we posted fourth quarter revenue of $89.5 million, up 22% versus 2018. In 2019, we drove sales of nearly $325 million, a gain of over 17% over 2018 reflecting growth across a broad variety of defense platforms, including nearly every aspect of our product portfolio. We saw a double-digit increase in demand for our military fixed-wing aircraft programs particularly strong shipments from the F-15 and F-35 as well as substantial top line expansion for helicopters like the Apache, Black Hawk and Chinook. 
In addition, the Patriot missile system rose to become one of our top sellers last year. We saw significant growth across many other military and space applications. We are well positioned for future growth across our defense platforms in 2020, again, in all sectors and began the year with a backlog of roughly $450 million, up 32% year-over-year. 
Within our commercial aerospace operations, fourth quarter sales declined slightly year-over-year to $83 million, while the 2019 as a whole, revenue grew 15% to just over $350 million. Ducommun's  growth continues to be fueled by large narrow-body aircraft platforms, nearly all of which saw double-digit growth last year. 
While Boeing is still our largest customer, and the 737 MAX, a major contributor to revenue, Ducommun's expansion with Airbus since 2017 has clearly helped and put important balance in our portfolio. The Airbus A320 and A220 families, in particular, have become very important factors in our growth trajectory. And Airbus in total represents a larger and larger share, both directly and indirectly in Ducommun's commercial revenue last quarter. The backlog within our commercial aerospace sector stood at roughly $431 million at the end of 2019 positioning us well for solid performance going forward. Despite some uncertainty with the 737 MAX production schedule, we remain optimistic about the commercial market, given the breadth of key platforms, we serve in this market in 2020. 
With that, I'll have Chris review our financial results in detail. Chris?"
267761,653448935,1916601,"Ducommun Incorporated, Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Feb 20, 2020",2020-02-20,"Earnings Calls","Ducommun Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. As a reminder, please see the company's filings and today's press release for further descriptions of matters under discussion during the call. 2019, as Steve discussed, was a year of great accomplishment fo",1082,"Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. As a reminder, please see the company's filings and today's press release for further descriptions of matters under discussion during the call. 2019, as Steve discussed, was a year of great accomplishment for Ducommun that included strong top line growth, solid margin expansion, adjusted EBITDA growth and a variety of wins that position us well for the future. Our Ducommun operating system and its performance-center-focused factory approach continues to be a catalyst in driving the improvement of the year-over-year operating results. We feel confident that our efforts to broaden our customer base and streamline the business will continue to serve us well as we head into 2020 and beyond. 
Now I'll move to the details of our overall results. Review of the fourth quarter 2019. Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2019 was $186.9 million versus $164.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2018. The performance was driven primarily by $16.1 million of higher sales within the military and space sector and to a lesser extent, $3.6 million of greater revenue from our commercial aerospace customers. Both end markets saw increased demand across a variety of platforms and programs. Ducommun's overall backlog at the end of the fourth quarter was approximately $910 million, a new record for the company. As a reminder, we define backlog as potential revenue based on customer purchase orders and long-term agreements with firm fixed prices and expected delivery dates of 24 months or less. Our focused factory approach at our performance centers continues to drive strong margins as our gross margin was 21.5% in the fourth quarter versus 19.9% in the prior year's comparable period. The increase year-over-year was primarily due to the impact of favorable volume, along with the manufacturing efficiencies. This was our highest gross profit percentage quarter since the second quarter of 2010. And our Q4 gross profit amount of $40.1 million was the highest gross profit dollar result in the company's history. 
SG&A was $24.9 million in the fourth quarter versus $22.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, with the increase primarily reflecting incremental SG&A from the Nobles business and higher compensation and benefit costs. The company reported operating income for the fourth quarter of $15.2 million or 8.1% of revenue compared to $6.3 million or 3.8% of revenue in the prior period. The year-over-year improvement was due to higher revenue, higher gross profit and the fact that the prior year included, in aggregate, $4.5 million of restructure charges and refinancing costs. 
The 2019 fourth quarter by comparison included a total of $0.6 million of purchase accounting adjustments and refinancing costs. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $15.8 million or 8.4% of sales in the fourth quarter of 2019 versus $10.8 million or 6.6% of sales in 2018. 
Interest expense was $5.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 versus $3.8 million in the prior year period due to higher debt levels related to the company's acquisition of Nobles in October 2019. As announced on December 20, 2019, we executed a debt refinancing, which included entering into a term loan A of $140 million to clear our $100 million revolver as well as pay down some of our term loan B which carries a higher interest rate. The company reported net income for the fourth quarter of $8.9 million or $0.75 per diluted share compared to net income of $0.7 million or $0.06 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2018. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to $7.4 million of higher gross profit and lower restructure and other charges, as I previously mentioned. 
Adjusted net income was $9.5 million or $0.80 per diluted share in the fourth quarter -- 2019 fourth quarter versus $5.2 million or $0.44 per share in the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2019 was $25.2 million or 13.5% of revenue compared to $19.4 million or 11.8% of revenue for the comparable period in 2018, an increase of 170 basis points. 
Now let me turn to the segment results. Electronic Systems. Our Electronic Systems segment posted revenue of $96.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 versus $85.3 million in the prior year period. These results reflect a $9.3 million increase in sales to our military and space customers, while commercial aerospace shipments were down slightly year-over-year. Electronic Systems posted operating income for the fourth quarter of $9.9 million or 10.2% of revenue versus $7.5 million or 8.7% of revenue in the prior period. Excluding restructure -- restructuring charges last year. Electronic's adjusted operating margin was 11.5% for the 2018 fourth quarter, with the year-over-year decline reflecting product mix. 
Structural Systems. Our Structural Systems segment posted revenue of $90.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 versus $78.9 million last year. The year-over-year increase was due to $4.9 million of higher sales across our commercial aerospace applications, primarily large airframe single-aisle platforms and a $6.8 million increase in revenue within the company's military and space markets. 
Structural Systems posted operating income for the quarter of $11.6 million or 12.8% of revenue compared to $5.7 million or 7.2% of revenue last year. Excluding restructuring charges and inventory purchase accounting adjustments, Structure's adjusted operating margin was 13.4% for the 2019 fourth quarter and 8.7% for the 2018 fourth quarter. The year-over-year operating margin improvement reflects favorable product mix and improved manufacturing efficiencies. 
Corporate, general and administrative expense. CG&A expense for the fourth quarter of 2019 was $6.3 million or 3.4% of revenue versus $6.9 million or 4.2% of revenue in 2018. The year-over-year decrease was due to lower restructure charges of $0.3 million and lower general corporate expenses of $0.2 million. 
Turning to liquidity and capital resources. We generated $31 million of cash from operations in the fourth quarter of 2019 and $51 million for the full year compared with $13 million during the prior year quarter and $46 million for 2018 in total. We remain committed to managing working capital effectively and improving asset utilization to maintain solid margins and generate as much operating cash as possible. 
In terms of capital expenditures, we spent $3.9 million during the fourth quarter and $18.8 million for the full year. We anticipate spending $16 million to $18 million in 2020 to support new programs and product development. 
We're again pleased with our full year and fourth quarter performance and remain upbeat about our future results.

So the headwind is splintered out amongst 3 to 4 facilities that all have pieces of that and so with that, and then with having the other commercial and then the defense customers that we have that can pick up the slack, that's what gives us the increased flexibility versus if we were sitting there with one facility that was going to take on all this headwind. So that's why we can -- that all reflects to what we did. That's why we feel like we can manage. And certainly, as Steve alluded to, first half of the year, but a little more challenging.

We're going to get their work about where we're headed. And then on Boeing, we're still sorting out exactly what it means for each one of them. 
Back to your question on sort of which facilities, you do. You have -- you've got the main facilities, Monrovia; Coxsackie, New York; Parsons, Kansas. You also have our Gardena facility doing some as well. So it is spread out and that's why the impact is sort of what it is and why we think we can mitigate some of the impact that somebody looking at it might think we're going to have but that's where we're at.

As usual, I'll begin by providing an update on recent developments at the company, after which Chris Wampler will review our financials in detail. 
As we finish a very important year for the company in 2019, I want to take this opportunity to first review a few highlights of our strong performance. Our team has been working diligently over the past 3 years, improving all of our operations, developing our product portfolio, driving new technologies, focusing on providing high-value to customers and making strategic acquisitions, among others. 
In 2019, Ducommun sales grew to $721 million, up 15% over 2018 and its highest since 2014. In conjunction with that increase, we grew gross profit to $152 million or 21.1%. Net margin rate for 2019 has not been realized at the company in more than 15 years. 
Adjusted margins rose as well to 7.9% from 6.4% in 2018, and we generated $51 million in cash from operations. Just as important with great top and bottom line growth, EBITDA rose to $92.3 million in 2019 or 12.8% of sales versus $70.7 million or 11.2% of sales last year. We're very proud of all these gains as we develop the company for sustained high-performance in the years ahead. 
Now turning specifically to the fourth quarter, revenue rose 14% year-over-year and marked the sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit increases, averaging 15% growth, which was mainly organic. The majority of the gains were driven by important military programs, such as the F-35, F-15, the Apache helicopter and several missile programs. It also included good growth with Airbus and Boeing. 
The other real bright spot for the quarter was ending the year with a backlog of about $910 million bolstered by strong orders across numerous key platforms, particularly within our defense business. We also posted an impressive book-to-bill ratio in the quarter of 1.4, again driven by defense. As mentioned in the press release, we have spent a good amount of time during the past few years improving the performance of our defense operations and business development team, and now are seeing the results. It's also great to see our team leveraging Ducommun's  capabilities and structures, more and more within the defense markets. And orders in that part of the Ducommun's  business increased sequentially in the second half of the year by 45%. At the same time, we completed another important acquisition, Nobles Worldwide, who supplies advanced technical products for a variety of aircraft, naval vessels and military vehicles. The integration is going very well and the team is already adding great value, opening new markets and opportunities for Ducommun, along with expanding our engineered products portfolio. 
As also mentioned in the press release, we're off to a strong start in 2020 within many areas of the company. In addition, we are also working closely with Boeing and Spirit AeroSystems on the 737 MAX. After the announcements in December from both companies, Ducommun took action in January to ensure all costs within our affected operations  are being closely and proactively managed. All of our affected operations have been working to minimize the impact. And due to some of our successes with new business, we have been able to redeploy some employees. The amount of personnel furloughed in January due to the MAX is less than 3%. And though difficult, we are proud of our performance center teams proactively dealing with the situation. 
That being said, we are looking forward to starting production back later in Q1 with Spirit, based on public comments and communication from them and with Boeing as soon as April. We're also well positioned operationally to meet any rate requirements along with the ramp-up in the future. In regards to the 2020 outlook, we see our strong backlog in defense, growing business with Airbus and our strategic supplier agreement with Raytheon, which we announced in July 2019, as all examples of programs, helping to offset this year's revenue headwind with 737 MAX production. 
Company is also benefiting from new process technologies, exemplified by our $200 million 10-year contract to supply Middle River AeroStructures with LEAP engine nacelle components for the A320 platform. This business utilizing Ducommun's proprietary VersaCore Composite process technology will deliver over $10 million in 2020 revenue with a full ramp-up to $20 million in 2021 and is now all being fully produced at our Guaymas,  Mexico performance center. 
The Nobles acquisition closed in October 2019, will also help provide additional revenue this year. Finally, all the hard work in the past few years, including process improvements, restructuring, leadership development, cost discipline and other initiatives will also contribute in 2020. Therefore, Ducommun's  2020 revenue growth based on both Spirit and Boeing following through on their public comments regarding their production plans should be flat to slightly down low single digit in the first half of 2020 and up low single digits in the second half of 2020. 
Coming off the last few years, this is certainly more modest, but other than the circumstances with 737 -- with the 737 MAX situation, we feel it's an excellent outcome, shows the company's development in the past few years, and we will deliver on our commitments. 
Now let me provide some additional color on our markets, products and programs. Beginning with our military and space sector, we posted fourth quarter revenue of $89.5 million, up 22% versus 2018. In 2019, we drove sales of nearly $325 million, a gain of over 17% over 2018 reflecting growth across a broad variety of defense platforms, including nearly every aspect of our product portfolio. We saw a double-digit increase in demand for our military fixed-wing aircraft programs particularly strong shipments from the F-15 and F-35 as well as substantial top line expansion for helicopters like the Apache, Black Hawk and Chinook. 
In addition, the Patriot missile system rose to become one of our top sellers last year. We saw significant growth across many other military and space applications. We are well positioned for future growth across our defense platforms in 2020, again, in all sectors and began the year with a backlog of roughly $450 million, up 32% year-over-year. 
Within our commercial aerospace operations, fourth quarter sales declined slightly year-over-year to $83 million, while the 2019 as a whole, revenue grew 15% to just over $350 million. Ducommun's  growth continues to be fueled by large narrow-body aircraft platforms, nearly all of which saw double-digit growth last year. 
While Boeing is still our largest customer, and the 737 MAX, a major contributor to revenue, Ducommun's expansion with Airbus since 2017 has clearly helped and put important balance in our portfolio. The Airbus A320 and A220 families, in particular, have become very important factors in our growth trajectory. And Airbus in total represents a larger and larger share, both directly and indirectly in Ducommun's commercial revenue last quarter. The backlog within our commercial aerospace sector stood at roughly $431 million at the end of 2019 positioning us well for solid performance going forward. Despite some uncertainty with the 737 MAX production schedule, we remain optimistic about the commercial market, given the breadth of key platforms, we serve in this market in 2020. 
With that, I'll have Chris review our financial results in detail. Chris?"

As a reminder, please see the company's filings and today's press release for further descriptions of matters under discussion during the call. 2019, as Steve discussed, was a year of great accomplishment fo",1082,"Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. As a reminder, please see the company's filings and today's press release for further descriptions of matters under discussion during the call. 2019, as Steve discussed, was a year of great accomplishment for Ducommun that included strong top line growth, solid margin expansion, adjusted EBITDA growth and a variety of wins that position us well for the future. Our Ducommun operating system and its performance-center-focused factory approach continues to be a catalyst in driving the improvement of the year-over-year operating results. We feel confident that our efforts to broaden our customer base and streamline the business will continue to serve us well as we head into 2020 and beyond. 
Now I'll move to the details of our overall results. Review of the fourth quarter 2019. Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2019 was $186.9 million versus $164.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2018. The performance was driven primarily by $16.1 million of higher sales within the military and space sector and to a lesser extent, $3.6 million of greater revenue from our commercial aerospace customers. Both end markets saw increased demand across a variety of platforms and programs. Ducommun's overall backlog at the end of the fourth quarter was approximately $910 million, a new record for the company. As a reminder, we define backlog as potential revenue based on customer purchase orders and long-term agreements with firm fixed prices and expected delivery dates of 24 months or less. Our focused factory approach at our performance centers continues to drive strong margins as our gross margin was 21.5% in the fourth quarter versus 19.9% in the prior year's comparable period. The increase year-over-year was primarily due to the impact of favorable volume, along with the manufacturing efficiencies. This was our highest gross profit percentage quarter since the second quarter of 2010. And our Q4 gross profit amount of $40.1 million was the highest gross profit dollar result in the company's history. 
SG&A was $24.9 million in the fourth quarter versus $22.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, with the increase primarily reflecting incremental SG&A from the Nobles business and higher compensation and benefit costs. The company reported operating income for the fourth quarter of $15.2 million or 8.1% of revenue compared to $6.3 million or 3.8% of revenue in the prior period. The year-over-year improvement was due to higher revenue, higher gross profit and the fact that the prior year included, in aggregate, $4.5 million of restructure charges and refinancing costs. 
The 2019 fourth quarter by comparison included a total of $0.6 million of purchase accounting adjustments and refinancing costs. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $15.8 million or 8.4% of sales in the fourth quarter of 2019 versus $10.8 million or 6.6% of sales in 2018. 
Interest expense was $5.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 versus $3.8 million in the prior year period due to higher debt levels related to the company's acquisition of Nobles in October 2019. As announced on December 20, 2019, we executed a debt refinancing, which included entering into a term loan A of $140 million to clear our $100 million revolver as well as pay down some of our term loan B which carries a higher interest rate. The company reported net income for the fourth quarter of $8.9 million or $0.75 per diluted share compared to net income of $0.7 million or $0.06 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2018. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to $7.4 million of higher gross profit and lower restructure and other charges, as I previously mentioned. 
Adjusted net income was $9.5 million or $0.80 per diluted share in the fourth quarter -- 2019 fourth quarter versus $5.2 million or $0.44 per share in the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2019 was $25.2 million or 13.5% of revenue compared to $19.4 million or 11.8% of revenue for the comparable period in 2018, an increase of 170 basis points. 
Now let me turn to the segment results. Electronic Systems. Our Electronic Systems segment posted revenue of $96.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 versus $85.3 million in the prior year period. These results reflect a $9.3 million increase in sales to our military and space customers, while commercial aerospace shipments were down slightly year-over-year. Electronic Systems posted operating income for the fourth quarter of $9.9 million or 10.2% of revenue versus $7.5 million or 8.7% of revenue in the prior period. Excluding restructure -- restructuring charges last year. Electronic's adjusted operating margin was 11.5% for the 2018 fourth quarter, with the year-over-year decline reflecting product mix. 
Structural Systems. Our Structural Systems segment posted revenue of $90.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 versus $78.9 million last year. The year-over-year increase was due to $4.9 million of higher sales across our commercial aerospace applications, primarily large airframe single-aisle platforms and a $6.8 million increase in revenue within the company's military and space markets. 
Structural Systems posted operating income for the quarter of $11.6 million or 12.8% of revenue compared to $5.7 million or 7.2% of revenue last year. Excluding restructuring charges and inventory purchase accounting adjustments, Structure's adjusted operating margin was 13.4% for the 2019 fourth quarter and 8.7% for the 2018 fourth quarter. The year-over-year operating margin improvement reflects favorable product mix and improved manufacturing efficiencies. 
Corporate, general and administrative expense. CG&A expense for the fourth quarter of 2019 was $6.3 million or 3.4% of revenue versus $6.9 million or 4.2% of revenue in 2018. The year-over-year decrease was due to lower restructure charges of $0.3 million and lower general corporate expenses of $0.2 million. 
Turning to liquidity and capital resources. We generated $31 million of cash from operations in the fourth quarter of 2019 and $51 million for the full year compared with $13 million during the prior year quarter and $46 million for 2018 in total. We remain committed to managing working capital effectively and improving asset utilization to maintain solid margins and generate as much operating cash as possible. 
In terms of capital expenditures, we spent $3.9 million during the fourth quarter and $18.8 million for the full year. We anticipate spending $16 million to $18 million in 2020 to support new programs and product development. 
We're again pleased with our full year and fourth quarter performance and remain upbeat about our future results. 
I'll now turn it back over to Steve for his closing remarks. Steve?"

I'd also add that we do have the right footprint, cost structure, discipline and operational leadership to continue developments at the company and strengthen it this year. Finally, you can be assured that everyone at the company is fully engaged as we move through the first quarter.

So the headwind is splintered out amongst 3 to 4 facilities that all have pieces of that and so with that, and then with having the other commercial and then the defense customers that we have that can pick up the slack, that's what gives us the increased flexibility versus if we were sitting there with one facility that was going to take on all this headwind. So that's why we can -- that all reflects to what we did. That's why we feel like we can manage. And certainly, as Steve alluded to, first half of the year, but a little more challenging.

As usual, I'll begin by providing an update on recent developments at the company, after which Chris Wampler will review our financials in detail. 
As we finish a very important year for the company in 2019, I want to take this opportunity to first review a few highlights of our strong performance. Our team has been working diligently over the past 3 years, improving all of our operations, developing our product portfolio, driving new technologies, focusing on providing high-value to customers and making strategic acquisitions, among others. 
In 2019, Ducommun sales grew to $721 million, up 15% over 2018 and its highest since 2014. In conjunction with that increase, we grew gross profit to $152 million or 21.1%. Net margin rate for 2019 has not been realized at the company in more than 15 years. 
Adjusted margins rose as well to 7.9% from 6.4% in 2018, and we generated $51 million in cash from operations. Just as important with great top and bottom line growth, EBITDA rose to $92.3 million in 2019 or 12.8% of sales versus $70.7 million or 11.2% of sales last year. We're very proud of all these gains as we develop the company for sustained high-performance in the years ahead. 
Now turning specifically to the fourth quarter, revenue rose 14% year-over-year and marked the sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit increases, averaging 15% growth, which was mainly organic. The majority of the gains were driven by important military programs, such as the F-35, F-15, the Apache helicopter and several missile programs. It also included good growth with Airbus and Boeing. 
The other real bright spot for the quarter was ending the year with a backlog of about $910 million bolstered by strong orders across numerous key platforms, particularly within our defense business. We also posted an impressive book-to-bill ratio in the quarter of 1.4, again driven by defense. As mentioned in the press release, we have spent a good amount of time during the past few years improving the performance of our defense operations and business development team, and now are seeing the results. It's also great to see our team leveraging Ducommun's capabilities and structures, more and more within the defense markets. 
And orders in that part of the Ducommun's business increased sequentially in the second half of the year by 45%. At the same time, we completed another important acquisition, Nobles Worldwide, who supplies advanced technical products for a variety of aircraft, naval vessels and military vehicles. The integration is going very well and the team is already adding great value, opening new markets and opportunities for Ducommun, along with expanding our engineered products portfolio. 
As also mentioned in the press release, we're off to a strong start in 2020 within many areas of the company. In addition, we are also working closely with Boeing and Spirit AeroSystems on the 737 MAX. After the announcements in December from both companies, Ducommun took action in January to ensure all costs within our affected operations are being closely and proactively managed. All of our affected operations have been working to minimize the impact. And due to some of our successes with new business, we have been able to redeploy some employees. The amount of personnel furloughed in January due to the MAX is less than 3%. And though difficult, we are proud of our performance center teams proactively dealing with the situation. 
That being said, we are looking forward to starting production back later in Q1 with Spirit, based on public comments and communication from them and with Boeing as soon as April. We're also well positioned operationally to meet any rate requirements along with the ramp-up in the future. In regards to the 2020 outlook, we see our strong backlog in defense, growing business with Airbus and our strategic supplier agreement with Raytheon, which we announced in July 2019, as all examples of programs, helping to offset this year's revenue headwind with 737 MAX production. 
Company is also benefiting from new process technologies, exemplified by our $200 million 10-year contract to supply Middle River AeroStructures with LEAP engine nacelle components for the A320 platform. This business utilizing Ducommun's proprietary VersaCore Composite process technology will deliver over $10 million in 2020 revenue with a full ramp-up to $20 million in 2021 and is now all being fully produced at our Guaymas, Mexico performance center. 
The Nobles acquisition closed in October 2019, will also help provide additional revenue this year. Finally, all the hard work in the past few years, including process improvements, restructuring, leadership development, cost discipline and other initiatives will also contribute in 2020. Therefore, Ducommun's 2020 revenue growth based on both Spirit and Boeing following through on their public comments regarding their production plans should be flat to slightly down low single digit in the first half of 2020 and up low single digits in the second half of 2020. 
Coming off the last few years, this is certainly more modest, but other than the circumstances with 737 -- with the 737 MAX situation, we feel it's an excellent outcome, shows the company's development in the past few years, and we will deliver on our commitments. 
Now let me provide some additional color on our markets, products and programs. Beginning with our military and space sector, we posted fourth quarter revenue of $89.5 million, up 22% versus 2018. In 2019, we drove sales of nearly $325 million, a gain of over 17% over 2018 reflecting growth across a broad variety of defense platforms, including nearly every aspect of our product portfolio. We saw a double-digit increase in demand for our military fixed-wing aircraft programs particularly strong shipments from the F-15 and F-35 as well as substantial top line expansion for helicopters like the Apache, Black Hawk and Chinook. 
In addition, the Patriot missile system rose to become one of our top sellers last year. We saw significant growth across many other military and space applications. We are well positioned for future growth across our defense platforms in 2020, again, in all sectors and began the year with a backlog of roughly $450 million, up 32% year-over-year. 
Within our commercial aerospace operations, fourth quarter sales declined slightly year-over-year to $83 million, while the 2019 as a whole, revenue grew 15% to just over $350 million. Ducommun's growth continues to be fueled by large narrow-body aircraft platforms, nearly all of which saw double-digit growth last year. 
While Boeing is still our largest customer, and the 737 MAX, a major contributor to revenue, Ducommun's expansion with Airbus since 2017 has clearly helped and put important balance in our portfolio. The Airbus A320 and A220 families, in particular, have become very important factors in our growth trajectory. And Airbus in total represents a larger and larger share, both directly and indirectly in Ducommun's commercial revenue last quarter. The backlog within our commercial aerospace sector stood at roughly $431 million at the end of 2019 positioning us well for solid performance going forward. Despite some uncertainty with the 737 MAX production schedule, we remain optimistic about the commercial market, given the breadth of key platforms, we serve in this market in 2020. 
With that, I'll have Chris review our financial results in detail. Chris?"
267761,653448935,1927697,"Ducommun Incorporated, Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Feb 20, 2020",2020-02-20,"Earnings Calls","Ducommun Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. As a reminder, please see the company's filings and today's press release for further descriptions of matters under discussion during the call. 2019, as Steve discussed, was a year of great accomplishment fo",1082,"Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. As a reminder, please see the company's filings and today's press release for further descriptions of matters under discussion during the call. 2019, as Steve discussed, was a year of great accomplishment for Ducommun that included strong top line growth, solid margin expansion, adjusted EBITDA growth and a variety of wins that position us well for the future. Our Ducommun operating system and its performance-center-focused factory approach continues to be a catalyst in driving the improvement of the year-over-year operating results. We feel confident that our efforts to broaden our customer base and streamline the business will continue to serve us well as we head into 2020 and beyond. 
Now I'll move to the details of our overall results. Review of the fourth quarter 2019. Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2019 was $186.9 million versus $164.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2018. The performance was driven primarily by $16.1 million of higher sales within the military and space sector and to a lesser extent, $3.6 million of greater revenue from our commercial aerospace customers. Both end markets saw increased demand across a variety of platforms and programs. Ducommun's overall backlog at the end of the fourth quarter was approximately $910 million, a new record for the company. As a reminder, we define backlog as potential revenue based on customer purchase orders and long-term agreements with firm fixed prices and expected delivery dates of 24 months or less. 
Our focused factory approach at our performance centers continues to drive strong margins as our gross margin was 21.5% in the fourth quarter versus 19.9% in the prior year's comparable period. The increase year-over-year was primarily due to the impact of favorable volume, along with the manufacturing efficiencies. This was our highest gross profit percentage quarter since the second quarter of 2010. And our Q4 gross profit amount of $40.1 million was the highest gross profit dollar result in the company's history. 
SG&A was $24.9 million in the fourth quarter versus $22.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, with the increase primarily reflecting incremental SG&A from the Nobles business and higher compensation and benefit costs. The company reported operating income for the fourth quarter of $15.2 million or 8.1% of revenue compared to $6.3 million or 3.8% of revenue in the prior period. The year-over-year improvement was due to higher revenue, higher gross profit and the fact that the prior year included, in aggregate, $4.5 million of restructure charges and refinancing costs. 
The 2019 fourth quarter by comparison included a total of $0.6 million of purchase accounting adjustments and refinancing costs. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $15.8 million or 8.4% of sales in the fourth quarter of 2019 versus $10.8 million or 6.6% of sales in 2018. 
Interest expense was $5.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 versus $3.8 million in the prior year period due to higher debt levels related to the company's acquisition of Nobles in October 2019. As announced on December 20, 2019, we executed a debt refinancing, which included entering into a term loan A of $140 million to clear our $100 million revolver as well as pay down some of our term loan B which carries a higher interest rate. The company reported net income for the fourth quarter of $8.9 million or $0.75 per diluted share compared to net income of $0.7 million or $0.06 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2018. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to $7.4 million of higher gross profit and lower restructure and other charges, as I previously mentioned. 
Adjusted net income was $9.5 million or $0.80 per diluted share in the fourth quarter -- 2019 fourth quarter versus $5.2 million or $0.44 per share in the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2019 was $25.2 million or 13.5% of revenue compared to $19.4 million or 11.8% of revenue for the comparable period in 2018, an increase of 170 basis points. 
Now let me turn to the segment results. Electronic Systems. Our Electronic Systems segment posted revenue of $96.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 versus $85.3 million in the prior year period. These results reflect a $9.3 million increase in sales to our military and space customers, while commercial aerospace shipments were down slightly year-over-year. Electronic Systems posted operating income for the fourth quarter of $9.9 million or 10.2% of revenue versus $7.5 million or 8.7% of revenue in the prior period. Excluding restructure -- restructuring charges last year. Electronic's adjusted operating margin was 11.5% for the 2018 fourth quarter, with the year-over-year decline reflecting product mix. 
Structural Systems. Our Structural Systems segment posted revenue of $90.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 versus $78.9 million last year. The year-over-year increase was due to $4.9 million of higher sales across our commercial aerospace applications, primarily large airframe single-aisle platforms and a $6.8 million increase in revenue within the company's military and space markets. 
Structural Systems posted operating income for the quarter of $11.6 million or 12.8% of revenue compared to $5.7 million or 7.2% of revenue last year. Excluding restructuring charges and inventory purchase accounting adjustments, Structure's adjusted operating margin was 13.4% for the 2019 fourth quarter and 8.7% for the 2018 fourth quarter. The year-over-year operating margin improvement reflects favorable product mix and improved manufacturing efficiencies. 
Corporate, general and administrative expense. CG&A expense for the fourth quarter of 2019 was $6.3 million or 3.4% of revenue versus $6.9 million or 4.2% of revenue in 2018. The year-over-year decrease was due to lower restructure charges of $0.3 million and lower general corporate expenses of $0.2 million. 
Turning to liquidity and capital resources. We generated $31 million of cash from operations in the fourth quarter of 2019 and $51 million for the full year compared with $13 million during the prior year quarter and $46 million for 2018 in total. We remain committed to managing working capital effectively and improving asset utilization to maintain solid margins and generate as much operating cash as possible. 
In terms of capital expenditures, we spent $3.9 million during the fourth quarter and $18.8 million for the full year. We anticipate spending $16 million to $18 million in 2020 to support new programs and product development. 
We're again pleased with our full year and fourth quarter performance and remain upbeat about our future results.

But I also feel that if you look at a Northrop, if you look at a Lockheed, our penetration in those councils is fairly low. So I see a lot of runway ahead for Ducommun in those areas."

As you move out another year and if the rate doubles up as we head into that year, then incrementally, we'll get that margin back on the structure side.

But I mean on the question related to what we're currently doing or as these assets are being -- taking a step back on the level of utilization, the benefit we have is we're not -- we don't have one facility that is our MAX 737 facility, that's carrying the brunt of all of this, the headwind that's coming at us. So the headwind is splintered out amongst 3 to 4 facilities that all have pieces of that and so with that, and then with having the other commercial and then the defense customers that we have that can pick up the slack, that's what gives us the increased flexibility versus if we were sitting there with one facility that was going to take on all this headwind. 
So that's why we can -- that all reflects to what we did. That's why we feel like we can manage. And certainly, as Steve alluded to, first half of the year, but a little more challenging. And then as the growth is kicking in all the other things, along with the MAX rate picking up the second half of the year certainly helps out.

We're going to get their work about where we're headed. And then on Boeing, we're still sorting out exactly what it means for each one of them. 
Back to your question on sort of which facilities, you do. You have -- you've got the main facilities, Monrovia; Coxsackie, New York; Parsons, Kansas. You also have our Gardena facility doing some as well. So it is spread out and that's why the impact is sort of what it is and why we think we can mitigate some of the impact that somebody looking at it might think we're going to have but that's where we're at.

As usual, I'll begin by providing an update on recent developments at the company, after which Chris Wampler will review our financials in detail. 
As we finish a very important year for the company in 2019, I want to take this opportunity to first review a few highlights of our strong performance. Our team has been working diligently over the past 3 years, improving all of our operations, developing our product portfolio, driving new technologies, focusing on providing high-value to customers and making strategic acquisitions, among others. 
In 2019, Ducommun sales grew to $721 million, up 15% over 2018 and its highest since 2014. In conjunction with that increase, we grew gross profit to $152 million or 21.1%. Net margin rate for 2019 has not been realized at the company in more than 15 years. 
Adjusted margins rose as well to 7.9% from 6.4% in 2018, and we generated $51 million in cash from operations. Just as important with great top and bottom line growth, EBITDA rose to $92.3 million in 2019 or 12.8% of sales versus $70.7 million or 11.2% of sales last year. We're very proud of all these gains as we develop the company for sustained high-performance in the years ahead. 
Now turning specifically to the fourth quarter, revenue rose 14% year-over-year and marked the sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit increases, averaging 15% growth, which was mainly organic. The majority of the gains were driven by important military programs, such as the F-35, F-15, the Apache helicopter and several missile programs. It also included good growth with Airbus and Boeing. 
The other real bright spot for the quarter was ending the year with a backlog of about $910 million bolstered by strong orders across numerous key platforms, particularly within our defense business. We also posted an impressive book-to-bill ratio in the quarter of 1.4, again driven by defense. As mentioned in the press release, we have spent a good amount of time during the past few years improving the performance of our defense operations and business development team, and now are seeing the results. It's also great to see our team leveraging Ducommun's capabilities and structures, more and more within the defense markets. 
And orders in that part of the Ducommun's business increased sequentially in the second half of the year by 45%. At the same time, we completed another important acquisition, Nobles Worldwide, who supplies advanced technical products for a variety of aircraft, naval vessels and military vehicles. The integration is going very well and the team is already adding great value, opening new markets and opportunities for Ducommun, along with expanding our engineered products portfolio. 
As also mentioned in the press release, we're off to a strong start in 2020 within many areas of the company. In addition, we are also working closely with Boeing and Spirit AeroSystems on the 737 MAX. After the announcements in December from both companies, Ducommun took action in January to ensure all costs within our affected operations are being closely and proactively managed. All of our affected operations have been working to minimize the impact. And due to some of our successes with new business, we have been able to redeploy some employees. The amount of personnel furloughed in January due to the MAX is less than 3%. And though difficult, we are proud of our performance center teams proactively dealing with the situation. 
That being said, we are looking forward to starting production back later in Q1 with Spirit, based on public comments and communication from them and with Boeing as soon as April. We're also well positioned operationally to meet any rate requirements along with the ramp-up in the future. In regards to the 2020 outlook, we see our strong backlog in defense, growing business with Airbus and our strategic supplier agreement with Raytheon, which we announced in July 2019, as all examples of programs, helping to offset this year's revenue headwind with 737 MAX production. 
Company is also benefiting from new process technologies, exemplified by our $200 million 10-year contract to supply Middle River AeroStructures with LEAP engine nacelle components for the A320 platform. This business utilizing Ducommun's proprietary VersaCore Composite process technology will deliver over $10 million in 2020 revenue with a full ramp-up to $20 million in 2021 and is now all being fully produced at our Guaymas, Mexico performance center. 
The Nobles acquisition closed in October 2019, will also help provide additional revenue this year. Finally, all the hard work in the past few years, including process improvements, restructuring, leadership development, cost discipline and other initiatives will also contribute in 2020. Therefore, Ducommun's 2020 revenue growth based on both Spirit and Boeing following through on their public comments regarding their production plans should be flat to slightly down low single digit in the first half of 2020 and up low single digits in the second half of 2020. 
Coming off the last few years, this is certainly more modest, but other than the circumstances with 737 -- with the 737 MAX situation, we feel it's an excellent outcome, shows the company's development in the past few years, and we will deliver on our commitments. 
Now let me provide some additional color on our markets, products and programs. Beginning with our military and space sector, we posted fourth quarter revenue of $89.5 million, up 22% versus 2018. In 2019, we drove sales of nearly $325 million, a gain of over 17% over 2018 reflecting growth across a broad variety of defense platforms, including nearly every aspect of our product portfolio. We saw a double-digit increase in demand for our military fixed-wing aircraft programs particularly strong shipments from the F-15 and F-35 as well as substantial top line expansion for helicopters like the Apache, Black Hawk and Chinook. 
In addition, the Patriot missile system rose to become one of our top sellers last year. We saw significant growth across many other military and space applications. We are well positioned for future growth across our defense platforms in 2020, again, in all sectors and began the year with a backlog of roughly $450 million, up 32% year-over-year. 
Within our commercial aerospace operations, fourth quarter sales declined slightly year-over-year to $83 million, while the 2019 as a whole, revenue grew 15% to just over $350 million. Ducommun's growth continues to be fueled by large narrow-body aircraft platforms, nearly all of which saw double-digit growth last year. 
While Boeing is still our largest customer, and the 737 MAX, a major contributor to revenue, Ducommun's expansion with Airbus since 2017 has clearly helped and put important balance in our portfolio. The Airbus A320 and A220 families, in particular, have become very important factors in our growth trajectory. And Airbus in total represents a larger and larger share, both directly and indirectly in Ducommun's commercial revenue last quarter. The backlog within our commercial aerospace sector stood at roughly $431 million at the end of 2019 positioning us well for solid performance going forward. Despite some uncertainty with the 737 MAX production schedule, we remain optimistic about the commercial market, given the breadth of key platforms, we serve in this market in 2020. 
With that, I'll have Chris review our financial results in detail. Chris?"
267761,653448935,1956453,"Ducommun Incorporated, Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Feb 20, 2020",2020-02-20,"Earnings Calls","Ducommun Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. As a reminder, please see the company's filings and today's press release for further descriptions of matters under discussion during the call. 2019, as Steve discussed, was a year of great accomplishment fo",1082,"Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. As a reminder, please see the company's filings and today's press release for further descriptions of matters under discussion during the call. 2019, as Steve discussed, was a year of great accomplishment for Ducommun that included strong top line growth, solid margin expansion, adjusted EBITDA growth and a variety of wins that position us well for the future. Our Ducommun operating system and its performance-center-focused factory approach continues to be a catalyst in driving the improvement of the year-over-year operating results. We feel confident that our efforts to broaden our customer base and streamline the business will continue to serve us well as we head into 2020 and beyond. 
Now I'll move to the details of our overall results. Review of the fourth quarter 2019. Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2019 was $186.9 million versus $164.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2018. The performance was driven primarily by $16.1 million of higher sales within the military and space sector and to a lesser extent, $3.6 million of greater revenue from our commercial aerospace customers. Both end markets saw increased demand across a variety of platforms and programs. Ducommun's overall backlog at the end of the fourth quarter was approximately $910 million, a new record for the company. As a reminder, we define backlog as potential revenue based on customer purchase orders and long-term agreements with firm fixed prices and expected delivery dates of 24 months or less. 
Our focused factory approach at our performance centers continues to drive strong margins as our gross margin was 21.5% in the fourth quarter versus 19.9% in the prior year's comparable period. The increase year-over-year was primarily due to the impact of favorable volume, along with the manufacturing efficiencies. This was our highest gross profit percentage quarter since the second quarter of 2010. And our Q4 gross profit amount of $40.1 million was the highest gross profit dollar result in the company's history. 
SG&A was $24.9 million in the fourth quarter versus $22.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, with the increase primarily reflecting incremental SG&A from the Nobles business and higher compensation and benefit costs. The company reported operating income for the fourth quarter of $15.2 million or 8.1% of revenue compared to $6.3 million or 3.8% of revenue in the prior period. The year-over-year improvement was due to higher revenue, higher gross profit and the fact that the prior year included, in aggregate, $4.5 million of restructure charges and refinancing costs. 
The 2019 fourth quarter by comparison included a total of $0.6 million of purchase accounting adjustments and refinancing costs. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $15.8 million or 8.4% of sales in the fourth quarter of 2019 versus $10.8 million or 6.6% of sales in 2018. 
Interest expense was $5.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 versus $3.8 million in the prior year period due to higher debt levels related to the company's acquisition of Nobles in October 2019. As announced on December 20, 2019, we executed a debt refinancing, which included entering into a term loan A of $140 million to clear our $100 million revolver as well as pay down some of our term loan B which carries a higher interest rate. The company reported net income for the fourth quarter of $8.9 million or $0.75 per diluted share compared to net income of $0.7 million or $0.06 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2018. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to $7.4 million of higher gross profit and lower restructure and other charges, as I previously mentioned. 
Adjusted net income was $9.5 million or $0.80 per diluted share in the fourth quarter -- 2019 fourth quarter versus $5.2 million or $0.44 per share in the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2019 was $25.2 million or 13.5% of revenue compared to $19.4 million or 11.8% of revenue for the comparable period in 2018, an increase of 170 basis points. 
Now let me turn to the segment results. Electronic Systems. Our Electronic Systems segment posted revenue of $96.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 versus $85.3 million in the prior year period. These results reflect a $9.3 million increase in sales to our military and space customers, while commercial aerospace shipments were down slightly year-over-year. Electronic Systems posted operating income for the fourth quarter of $9.9 million or 10.2% of revenue versus $7.5 million or 8.7% of revenue in the prior period. Excluding restructure -- restructuring charges last year. Electronic's adjusted operating margin was 11.5% for the 2018 fourth quarter, with the year-over-year decline reflecting product mix. 
Structural Systems. Our Structural Systems segment posted revenue of $90.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 versus $78.9 million last year. The year-over-year increase was due to $4.9 million of higher sales across our commercial aerospace applications, primarily large airframe single-aisle platforms and a $6.8 million increase in revenue within the company's military and space markets. 
Structural Systems posted operating income for the quarter of $11.6 million or 12.8% of revenue compared to $5.7 million or 7.2% of revenue last year. Excluding restructuring charges and inventory purchase accounting adjustments, Structure's adjusted operating margin was 13.4% for the 2019 fourth quarter and 8.7% for the 2018 fourth quarter. The year-over-year operating margin improvement reflects favorable product mix and improved manufacturing efficiencies. 
Corporate, general and administrative expense. CG&A expense for the fourth quarter of 2019 was $6.3 million or 3.4% of revenue versus $6.9 million or 4.2% of revenue in 2018. The year-over-year decrease was due to lower restructure charges of $0.3 million and lower general corporate expenses of $0.2 million. 
Turning to liquidity and capital resources. We generated $31 million of cash from operations in the fourth quarter of 2019 and $51 million for the full year compared with $13 million during the prior year quarter and $46 million for 2018 in total. We remain committed to managing working capital effectively and improving asset utilization to maintain solid margins and generate as much operating cash as possible. 
In terms of capital expenditures, we spent $3.9 million during the fourth quarter and $18.8 million for the full year. We anticipate spending $16 million to $18 million in 2020 to support new programs and product development. 
We're again pleased with our full year and fourth quarter performance and remain upbeat about our future results. 
I'll now turn it back over to Steve for his closing remarks. Steve?"

Again, a few final thoughts here. 2019 was certainly a terrific year where the company was just 3 years ago, and despite the short-term challenges to MAX, I believe we have a lot of runway ahead. 2020 will be one that sees increasing content with Airbus, continued strength across all of our defense platforms and determined focus on serving Boeing and Spirit as we support this important program, along with the subsequent resumption of production. I'd also add that we do have the right footprint, cost structure, discipline and operational leadership to continue developments at the company and strengthen it this year. Finally, you can be assured that everyone at the company is fully engaged as we move through the first quarter. And like our track record during the past few years despite the short-term challenge, we will deliver on our commitments.

So the headwind is splintered out amongst 3 to 4 facilities that all have pieces of that and so with that, and then with having the other commercial and then the defense customers that we have that can pick up the slack, that's what gives us the increased flexibility versus if we were sitting there with one facility that was going to take on all this headwind. 
So that's why we can -- that all reflects to what we did. That's why we feel like we can manage. And certainly, as Steve alluded to, first half of the year, but a little more challenging. And then as the growth is kicking in all the other things, along with the MAX rate picking up the second half of the year certainly helps out.

Thank you, Chris, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today for our first quarter conference call. I also hope that you and your families are healthy and getting through this pandemic as best as possible. Today, and as usual, I will give an update",1436,"Okay. Thank you, Chris, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today for our first quarter conference call. I also hope that you and your families are healthy and getting through this pandemic as best as possible. Today, and as usual, I will give an update of the current situation of the company, after which Chris Wampler will review our financials in detail. 
Generally has been a time of rapid change and adjustment at the common as we manage through these challenges with the top priority being the health and safety of our employees. I'm happy to report that despite having facilities in high impacted areas, such as Southern California and 1 operation south of Albany in New York state, the virus spread has mostly had 0 impact on our team with only 1 case reported, which we believe was not contracted at work. We also remain diligent on putting even more effective safety protocols in place as we move forward. And our facilities are sharing best practices and ideas across the company to sustain this performance. 
Despite the challenges of the pandemic and the nation of the markets, Ducommun's first quarter performance was excellent. The reasons for this result, I believe as our team has been working diligently over the past 3 years, improving all our operations, developing our product portfolio, driving new technologies, focusing on providing high value to customers, having an effective cost structure and making strategic acquisitions. This has been particularly evident recently in the progress of Ducommun's defense business revenues and orders. Overall, the company's first quarter revenue rose 1% year-over-year and marked the ninth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. Though not a material increase, I want to remind everyone that we improved revenue with not only the impact from the virus in March, but also over $25 million of 737 MAX headwind from last year, which for the size of our P&L is impressive. 
As mentioned previously, Ducommun's defense business has really started showing its strength, especially in Q1. The majority of the gains in the quarter include increases from our new weapon system business, [ Nobles ] worldwide with the cloud and leppard armored fighting vehicle, the F-35, the Patriot missile, Apache helicopter, F-15, F-16 and F-18 and other industry programs. And many areas of defense were just getting started, pulling some great progress in developing business in UAVs. One of the things we're most proud of and I highlight is the continued defense revenue growth of Raytheon. As you may recall, Icon was the first company selected to sign a preferred supplier agreement last July with the former Raytheon Missile Systems business, now known as Raytheon Missile and Defense. Through that relationship, I am happy to report that we have fully commercialized our first structures product for them, which is the missile case for the toll missile program. 
This is a major step forward as all of other current deliveries for Raytheon are electronic products. This win also continues to build a value offering in the areas [indiscernible] within Ducommun's Structures business. We throwed the opportunity and booked a $20 million plus order for the program in Q1. In addition, another major story is the rotation of our customer rankings. Although it was only 1 quarter, the top 5 companies ranked by revenue now are Raytheon, Boeing, United Technologies, Northrop Grumman and Spirit Aero Systems. For context, since I arrived at the company in January of 2017, each and every quarter, Boeing and Spirit always held you the first, second or third place. It should be a clear indicator that the diversification of our portfolio and balance is working yet to come. Showing material strength, while the commercial aerospace business is significantly impacted by the pandemic and the 737 MAX. 
We believe at least in the next year or 2, this trending will continue in favor of defense, and the team is driving every opportunity. Also, despite the tough news and current situation with commercial aerospace, Ducommun continues to gain share at Airbus, achieving positive growth year-over-year in Q1. As you may recall, Airbus was not even a customer of the company 4 years ago. Though the rates are down, opportunity still exists for a larger percentage of the A320 program. The other bright spot for the quarter ending in Q1 was the backlog of $876 million. It is sequentially down from Q4, but still a great number based on the environment, bolstered by strong orders across numerous key defense platforms, which included Apache, the [indiscernible] missile case previously discussed, UAVs, weapon systems for ground vehicles, F-35, F-18 and others. This part of U coma continues to deliver. Obviously, the strength helped offset commercial aerospace order pressure. 
Overall, the company is off to a solid start in 2020, both revenues and earnings. As previously communicated, the comments action early in January to ensure all costs that our effective operations were proactively managed due to the 737 MAX production shutdowns at Boeing and Spirit aero systems announced in December 2019. Action has continued as we now do with the pandemic to ensure the company adjusts its costs. You can certainly see the effect in this of our actions within this tough environment in Q1, with both very positive gross profit and operating income percentage posted. And the team has certainly done a great job. We continue to be proactive in the areas. And I also want to mention our leadership team has the experience in the background for the managing through the financial crisis in 2008, 2009, to be affected through this difficult time as well. 
In regards to the Q2 outlook, we see our strong backlog in defense with the many growth programs mentioned earlier, including the strategic supplier agreement with Raytheon providing year-over-year growth. The Nobles acquisition will also help provide additional inorganic growth. But with the unprecedented challenges in commercial aero, along with the 737 MAX, the company revenue should be lower in Q2 in the range of 16% to 20% year-over-year. We think that within the current circumstances, it's a very good effort and also expect operating income percentage for the quarter to be between 5.5% and 6%. As we look to the second half of the year, we estimate that defense revenue will improve again, but the business overall will be down year-over-year by 8% to 12% due to commercial aerospace. 
Operating income, we believe, this time will be between 6% to 7%. As you saw, though, in the first quarter, overcoming $25 million plus for MAX, at the beginning with the pandemic, all the hard work the past 3 years, including process improvements, restructuring, leadership development, cost discipline and others have clearly made a material difference. And despite the short-term outlook, the business has a great long-term future. 
Now let me provide you some additional color on our markets, products and programs. Beginning with our military and space sector, we posted first quarter revenue of $100.8 million, up 32% versus 2019. We drove sales across a broad variety of defense platforms on nearly every aspect of our product portfolio. As mentioned earlier, we saw increases in demand for our military fixed-wing aircraft programs with particular strength in shipments for the F-15, F-16, F-18 and F-35 as well as top line expansion for helicopters like the Apache. In addition, the Patriot missile system rose again this quarter, we saw significant growth across many other military and space applications. We are well positioned for further growth across our defense platform over the next 3 quarters in all sectors. And ended the first quarter with a backlog roughly $474 million for defense, up an impressive 36% year-over-year. 
I'm also happy to announce that Tom was recognized as the Black Hawk supplier of the year in 2019 by Sikorsky, a Lockheed Martin company. 
Within our commercial aerospace operations, first quarter sales declined year-over-year to $62.5 million, but we did see continued share gain at Airbus and despite the rates posted year-over-year gains with this customer. Ducommun also continues to work on adjusting costs and managing the downturn and is well positioned once rates start to stabilize and in the long term. Ducommun's expansion with Airbus since 2017 is clearly helping and puts important balance in our portfolio. 
Airbus A320 and Airbus A220 fabs represented a larger and larger share, both directly and directly in Ducommun's commercial revenue in Q1. The backlog within our commercial aerospace sector stood at roughly $376 million at the end of the first quarter, with the majority of the decline for the 737 MAX program. 
At this point, I'll turn it over to Chris."
267761,664835703,1967377,"Ducommun Incorporated, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",2020-04-30,"Earnings Calls","Ducommun Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. As a reminder, please see the company's filings and Q1 earnings release for further description of information mentioned on today's call. As Steve discussed, we were pleased with the first quarter's overal",1080,"Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. As a reminder, please see the company's filings and Q1 earnings release for further description of information mentioned on today's call. 
As Steve discussed, we were pleased with the first quarter's overall results, even as we faced the dual challenges of lower 737 MAX production and the growing economic impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. We feel confident that our ability to flex production parameters and rapidly evolve our lean operating structure to external conditions, will serve us well in the months and quarters ahead. 
Now I'll move to the details of our overall results. Revenue for the first quarter of 2020 was $173.5 million versus $172.6 million in the first quarter of 2019. This performance was driven by $24.2 million of higher sales within the military and space sector partially offset by $23 million of lower revenue from our commercial aerospace customers. Industrial sales were essentially flat year-over-year. As mentioned in our year-end earnings call, we expected our military and space business to directionally offset the headwind in Boeing MAX, 737 MAX commercial demand. 
Ducommun's overall backlog at the end of the first quarter was approximately $876 million, near record levels. Growth in the military and space backlog continues to drive a sustained, strong backlog. As a reminder, we define backlog as potential revenue based on customer purchase orders and long-term agreements with firm-fixed prices and expected delivery dates of 24 months or less. Once again posted solid gross profit for the quarter as gross margins rose to 21.2% from 20.7% in the prior year's comparable period. The increase year-over-year was due to favorable mix and lower compensation and benefit costs. Gross profit rose to $36.8 million from $35.7 million last year. We do expect downward pressure on gross profit as we move through 2020, and we manage through the environment of reduced commercial aerospace demand. 
SG&A was $23.2 million in the first quarter versus $22.8 million in the first quarter of 2019. The company reported operating income for the first quarter of $13.6 million or 7.8% of revenue compared to $12.8 million or 7.5% of revenue in the prior year period. The year-over-year improvement was due to the increased revenue and the higher gross margins. Interest expense was $4.2 million in the first quarter versus $4.4 million in the prior year period. Reflecting the favorable impact of lower interest rates on our new credit facilities, more than offsetting the higher amount of debt outstanding during the quarter. The increased debt outstanding during the quarter was primarily due to funding the company's acquisition of Nobles in October 2019. 
The company reported net income for the first quarter of $7.9 million or $0.67 per diluted share compared to net income of $7.5 million or $0.64 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2019. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to higher revenue, stronger gross margins, as I previously mentioned. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2020 was $23.2 million or 13.4% of revenue compared to $21.1 million or 12.2% of revenue for the comparable period in 2019, an increase of 120 basis points. 
Now let me turn to the segment results. Our Electronic Systems segment posted revenue of $98.1 million in the first quarter of 2020 versus $84.2 million in the prior year period. These results reflect a $12.9 million increase in sales with the company's military and space customers and a modest uptick in revenue across our commercial aerospace platforms. Electronic Systems posted operating income for the first quarter of $15.1 million or 15.4% of revenues versus $9.2 million or 10.9% of revenues in the prior year period. The improved performance reflects favorable manufacturing volumes and product mix. 
Our Structural Systems segment posted revenues of $75.4 million in the first quarter of 2020 versus $88.4 million last year. The year-over-year decrease was due to $24.3 million of lower sales across our commercial aerospace applications, reflecting current demand dynamics partially offset by $11.3 million of higher revenue within the company's military and space markets. Structural Systems posted operating income for the quarter of $5.4 million or 7.2% of revenue compared to $10.5 million or 11.9% of revenue last year. The year-over-year operating margin decline reflected unfavorable manufacturing volumes and product mix partially offset by lower compensation and benefit costs. 
Corporate, general and administrative expense, CG&A expenses for the first quarter of 2020 were $6.9 million or 4% of revenue versus $6.9 million and 4% of revenue as well in 2019. 
Turning to liquidity and capital resources. We have available liquidity of $115 million. We drew down $50 million on our $100 million revolver toward the end of the first quarter and an abundance of caution as the uncertainty grew related to the potential impacts of COVID-19. We held this drawdown in cash on our balance sheet at quarter end. We used $12 million of cash from operations during the first quarter of 2020 compared with $1.7 million during the prior year period. The first quarter is historically our weakest cash flow quarter. We operate with significant performance variable compensation, performance-based -- the significant performance-based variable compensation and the annual incentive for the prior year is paid out in the first quarter of the subsequent year. Additionally, accounts receivable and inventory investments partially offset by higher net income added to the outflow from operations. We are in full compliance with the covenants of our credit facilities, which are not scheduled to expire until 2024 and 2025. As a reminder, we have a covenant life credit facility with a leverage ratio of covenant ceiling of 4.75. Our debt-to-EBITDA was 3.0 at quarter end. We have reinforced our focus on cash generation with our lean operations and lean structure, and as we are restricting discretionary spending and optimizing working capital in this volatile environment. As a result, we expect to generate positive free cash flow during the remainder of 2020. 
In terms of capital expenditures, we spent $3.9 million during the first quarter and anticipate spending between $12 million and $14 million in 2020. In alignment with our cash conservation initiative, this anticipated spending will result in a capital expenditure decrease of more than 20% from our 2019 capital spending level. We're again pleased with our quarterly performance and remain cautiously optimistic about the future even as we manage through the uncertainty of the COVID-19 impacts, which create a very challenging operating environment. 
I'll now turn it back over to Steve for his closing remarks."

So with our with our variable debt facilities, I mean we are -- we should come through a little cleaner in Q2 through than the $4.2 million that you saw and get there in Q1. So definitely where we were at the year-end call, it's a more favorable interest rate environment. And so that number should probably be more in the $4 million a quarter what we -- versus what we were talking about at the year-end call. So that will help out at that line. And then on the tax side, I think we're still -- we've gotten to a pretty decent repeat process on where we're at under the new tax laws over the last couple of years. And poiting you to a 19% to 20% full year is probably still the right answer. We definitely cut some favorability with some of the SBC tax laws hit in Q1. That were a discrete item for us. But generally, it should be back to that 19% to 20% as we go through the year."

Thank you, Chris, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today for our first quarter conference call. I also hope that you and your families are healthy and getting through this pandemic as best as possible. 
Today, and as usual, I will give an update of the current situation of the company, after which Chris Wampler will review our financials in detail. 
Generally, it's been a time of rapid change and the judgment to comment as we manage through these challenges with the top priority being the health and safety of our employees. I'm happy to report that despite having facilities in high-impacted areas, such as Southern California and one operation south of Albany in New York state, the virus spread has mostly had 0 impact on our team with only 1 case reported, which we believe was not contracted at work. We also remain diligent on putting even more effective safety protocols in place. As we move forward, our facilities are sharing best practices and ideas across the company to sustain this performance. 
Despite the challenges of the pandemic to the nation in the markets, Ducommun's first quarter performance was excellent. Reasons for this result I believe is our team has been working diligently over the past 3 years, improving all our operations, developing our product portfolio, driving new technologies, focusing on providing high value to customers, having an effective cost structure and making strategic acquisitions. This has been particularly evident recently in the progress of Ducommun's defense business revenues and orders. 
Overall, the company's first quarter revenue rose 1% year-over-year and marked the ninth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. So not a material increase, I want to remind everyone that we improved revenue with not only the impact from the virus in March, but also over $25 million of 737 MAX headwind from last year, which for the size of our P&L is impressive. 
As mentioned previously, Ducommun's defense business has really started showing its strength, especially in Q1. Majority of the gains in the quarter include increases from our new weapon system business, Nobles Worldwide with the Clouded Leopard armored fighting vehicle, the F-35, the Patriot Missile, Apache helicopter, F-15, F-16 and F-18 and other industry programs. And many areas of defense were just getting started, pulling some great progress in developing business in UAVs. 
One of the things we're most proud of and I highlight is the continued defense revenue growth of Raytheon. As you may recall, Ducommun was the first company selected to sign a preferred supplier agreement last July with the former Raytheon Missile Systems business, now known as Raytheon Missile and Defense. Through that relationship, I am happy to report that we have fully commercialized our first structures product for them, which is the missile case for the toll missile program. This is a major step forward as all of other current deliveries for Raytheon are electronic products. This win also continues to build a value offering in the areas of defense within Ducommun's structures business. We throwed the opportunity and booked a $20 million plus order for the program in Q1. 
In addition, another major story is the rotation of our customer rankings. Although it was only 1 quarter, the top 5 companies ranked by revenue now are Raytheon, Boeing, United Technologies, Northrop Grumman and Spirit Aerosystems. For context, since I arrived at the company in January of 2017, each and every quarter, Boeing and Spirit always held you the first, second or third place. It should be a clear indicator that the diversification of our portfolio and balance is working at Ducommun, showing material strength, while the commercial aerospace business is significantly impacted by the pandemic and the 737 MAX. 
We believe at least in the next year or 2, this trending will continue in favor of defense, and the team is driving every opportunity. Also, despite the tough news and current situation with commercial aerospace, Ducommun continues to gain share at Airbus, achieving positive growth year-over-year in Q1. As you may recall, Airbus was not even a customer of the company 4 years ago. Though the rates are down, opportunity still exists for a larger percentage of the A320 program. 
The other bright spot for the quarter ending in Q1 was the backlog of $876 million. It is sequentially down from Q4, but still a great number based on the environment, bolstered by strong orders across numerous key defense platforms, which included Apache, the Tomahawk missile case previously discussed, UAVs, weapon systems for ground vehicles, F-35, F-18 and others. This part of Ducommun continues to deliver. Obviously, the strength helped offset commercial aerospace order pressure. 
Overall, the company is off to a solid start in 2020, in both revenues and earnings. As previously communicated, Ducommun took action early in January to ensure all costs that our effective operations were proactively managed due to the 737 MAX production shutdowns at Boeing and Spirit Aerosystems announced in December 2019. Actions have continued as we now deal with the pandemic to ensure the company adjusts its costs. You can certainly see the effusiveness of our actions within this tough environment in Q1, with both very positive gross profit and operating income percentage posted, and the team has certainly done a great job. We continue to be proactive in the area of cost, and I also want to mention that our leadership team has the experience in the background for the managing through the financial crisis in 2008, 2009, to be affected through this difficult time as well. 
In regards to the Q2 outlook, we see our strong backlog in defense with the many growth programs mentioned earlier, including the strategic supplier agreement with Raytheon, providing year-over-year growth. The Nobles acquisition will also help provide additional inorganic growth. But with the unprecedented challenges in commercial aero, along with the 737 MAX, the company revenue should be lower in Q2 in the range of 16% to 20% year-over-year. We think that within the current circumstances, it's a very good effort and also expect operating income percentage for the quarter to be between 5.5% and 6%. As we look to the second half of the year, we estimate that defense revenue will improve again, but the business overall will be down year-over-year by 8% to 12% due to commercial aerospace. 
Operating income, we believe, this time will be between 6% to 7%. As you saw, though, in the first quarter, overcoming $25 million plus for MAX, at the beginning of the pandemic, all the hard work the past 3 years, including process improvements, restructuring, leadership development, cost discipline and others have clearly made a material difference. And despite the short-term outlook, the business has a great long-term future. 
Now let me provide you some additional color on our markets, products and programs. Beginning with our military and space sector, we posted first quarter revenue of $100.8 million, up 32% versus 2019. We drove sales across a broad variety of defense platforms in nearly every aspect of our product portfolio. 
As mentioned earlier, we saw increases in demand for our military fixed-wing aircraft programs with particular strength in shipments for the F-15, F-16, F-18 and F-35 as well as top line expansion for helicopters like the Apache. In addition, the Patriot missile system rose again this quarter, we saw significant growth across many other military and space applications. We are well positioned for further growth across our defense platform over the next 3 quarters in all sectors and ended the first quarter with a backlog roughly $474 million for defense, up an impressive 36% year-over-year. 
I'm also happy to announce that Ducommun was recognized as the Black Hawk supplier of the year in 2019 by Sikorsky, a Lockheed Martin company. 
Within our commercial aerospace operations, first quarter sales declined year-over-year to $62.5 million, but we did see continued share gain at Airbus and despite the rates posted year-over-year gains with this customer. Ducommun also continues to work on adjusting costs and managing the downturn and is well positioned once rates start to stabilize and in the long term. Ducommun's expansion with Airbus since 2017 is clearly helping and puts important balance in our portfolio. 
Airbus A320 and Airbus A220 families represented a larger and larger share, both directly and indirectly in Ducommun's commercial revenue in Q1. The backlog within our commercial aerospace sector stood at roughly $376 million at the end of the first quarter, with the majority of the decline for the 737 MAX program. 
At this point, I'll turn it over to Chris."

As a reminder, please see the company's filings and Q1 earnings release for further description of information mentioned on today's call. As Steve discussed, we were pleased with the first quarter's overal",1081,"Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. As a reminder, please see the company's filings and Q1 earnings release for further description of information mentioned on today's call. 
As Steve discussed, we were pleased with the first quarter's overall results, even as we faced the dual challenges of lower 737 MAX production and the growing economic impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. We feel confident that our ability to flex production parameters and rapidly evolve our lean operating structure to external conditions will serve us well in the months and quarters ahead. 
Now I'll move to the details of our overall results. Revenue for the first quarter of 2020 was $173.5 million versus $172.6 million in the first quarter of 2019. This performance was driven by $24.2 million of higher sales within the military and space sector partially offset by $23 million of lower revenue from our commercial aerospace customers. Industrial sales were essentially flat year-over-year. 
As mentioned in our year-end earnings call, we expected our military and space business to directionally offset the headwind in Boeing MAX, 737 MAX commercial demand. 
Ducommun's overall backlog at the end of the first quarter was approximately $876 million, near record levels. Growth in the military and space backlog continues to drive a sustained, strong backlog. As a reminder, we define backlog as potential revenue based on customer purchase orders and long-term agreements with firm-fixed prices and expected delivery dates of 24 months or less. 
Once again posted solid gross profit for the quarter as gross margins rose to 21.2% from 20.7% in the prior year's comparable period. The increase year-over-year was due to favorable mix and lower compensation and benefit costs. Gross profit rose to $36.8 million from $35.7 million last year. We do expect downward pressure on gross profit as we move through 2020, and we manage through the environment of reduced commercial aerospace demand. 
SG&A was $23.2 million in the first quarter versus $22.8 million in the first quarter of 2019. The company reported operating income for the first quarter of $13.6 million or 7.8% of revenue compared to $12.8 million or 7.5% of revenue in the prior year period. The year-over-year improvement was due to the increased revenue and the higher gross margins. 
Interest expense was $4.2 million in the first quarter versus $4.4 million in the prior year period, reflecting the favorable impact of lower interest rates on our new credit facilities, more than offsetting the higher amount of debt outstanding during the quarter. The increased debt outstanding during the quarter was primarily due to funding the company's acquisition of Nobles in October 2019. 
The company reported net income for the first quarter of $7.9 million or $0.67 per diluted share compared to net income of $7.5 million or $0.64 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2019. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to higher revenue, stronger gross margins, as I previously mentioned. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2020 was $23.2 million or 13.4% of revenue compared to $21.1 million or 12.2% of revenue for the comparable period in 2019, an increase of 120 basis points. 
Now let me turn to the segment results. Our Electronic Systems segment posted revenue of $98.1 million in the first quarter of 2020 versus $84.2 million in the prior year period. These results reflect a $12.9 million increase in sales with the company's military and space customers and a modest uptick in revenue across our commercial aerospace platforms. Electronic Systems posted operating income for the first quarter of $15.1 million or 15.4% of revenues versus $9.2 million or 10.9% of revenues in the prior year period. The improved performance reflects favorable manufacturing volumes and product mix. 
Our Structural Systems segment posted revenues of $75.4 million in the first quarter of 2020 versus $88.4 million last year. The year-over-year decrease was due to $24.3 million of lower sales across our commercial aerospace applications, reflecting current demand dynamics partially offset by $11.3 million of higher revenue within the company's military and space markets. Structural Systems posted operating income for the quarter of $5.4 million or 7.2% of revenue compared to $10.5 million or 11.9% of revenue last year. The year-over-year operating margin decline reflected unfavorable manufacturing volumes and product mix partially offset by lower compensation and benefit costs. 
Corporate, general and administrative expense, CG&A expenses for the first quarter of 2020 were $6.9 million or 4% of revenue versus $6.9 million and 4% of revenue as well in 2019. 
Turning to liquidity and capital resources. We have available liquidity of $115 million. We drew down $50 million on our $100 million revolver toward the end of the first quarter and an abundance of caution as the uncertainty grew related to the potential impacts of COVID-19. We held this drawdown in cash on our balance sheet at quarter end. We used $12 million of cash from operations during the first quarter of 2020 compared with $1.7 million during the prior year period. The first quarter is historically our weakest cash flow quarter. We operate with significant performance variable compensation -- performance-based -- the significant performance-based variable compensation and the annual incentive for the prior year is paid out in the first quarter of the subsequent year. Additionally, accounts receivable and inventory investments partially offset by higher net income added to the outflow from operations. We are in full compliance with the covenants of our credit facilities, which are not scheduled to expire until 2024 and 2025. As a reminder, we have a covenant life credit facility with a leverage ratio of covenant ceiling of 4.75. Our debt-to-EBITDA was 3.0 at quarter end. We have reinforced our focus on cash generation with our lean operations and lean structure, and as we are restricting discretionary spending and optimizing working capital in this volatile environment. As a result, we expect to generate positive free cash flow during the remainder of 2020. 
In terms of capital expenditures, we spent $3.9 million during the first quarter and anticipate spending between $12 million and $14 million in 2020. In alignment with our cash conservation initiative, this anticipated spending will result in a capital expenditure decrease of more than 20% from our 2019 capital spending level. We're again pleased with our quarterly performance and remain cautiously optimistic about the future even as we manage through the uncertainty of the COVID-19 impacts, which create a very challenging operating environment. 
I'll now turn it back over to Steve for his closing remarks."

So with our with our variable debt facilities, I mean we are -- we should come through a little cleaner in Q2 through Q4 than the $4.2 million that you saw and get there in Q1. So definitely where we were at the year-end call, it's a more favorable interest rate environment. And so that number should probably be more in the $4 million a quarter versus what we were talking about at the year-end call. So that will help out at that line. 
And then on the tax side, I think we're still -- we've gotten to a pretty decent repeat process on where we're at under the new tax laws over the last couple of years. And pointing you to a 19% to 20% full year is probably still the right answer. We definitely cut some favorability with some of the SBC tax laws hit in Q1, that were a discrete item for us.

Thank you, Chris, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today for our first quarter conference call. I also hope that you and your families are healthy and getting through this pandemic as best as possible. 
Today, and as usual, I will give an update of the current situation of the company, after which Chris Wampler will review our financials in detail. 
Generally, it's been a time of rapid change and the adjustment at Ducommun as we manage through these challenges with the top priority being the health and safety of our employees. I'm happy to report that despite having facilities in high-impacted areas, such as Southern California and one operation south of Albany in New York state, the virus spread has mostly had 0 impact on our team with only 1 case reported, which we believe was not contracted at work. We also remain diligent on putting even more effective safety protocols in place. As we move forward, our facilities are sharing best practices and ideas across the company to sustain this performance. 
Despite the challenges of the pandemic to the nation in the markets, Ducommun's first quarter performance was excellent. The reasons for this result I believe is our team has been working diligently over the past 3 years, improving all our operations, developing our product portfolio, driving new technologies, focusing on providing high value to customers, having an effective cost structure and making strategic acquisitions. This has been particularly evident recently in the progress of Ducommun's defense business revenues and orders. 
Overall, the company's first quarter revenue rose 1% year-over-year and marked the ninth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. So not a material increase. I want to remind everyone that we improved revenue with not only the impact from the virus in March, but also over $25 million of 737 MAX headwind from last year, which for the size of our P&L is impressive. 
As mentioned previously, Ducommun's defense business has really started showing its strength, especially in Q1. Majority of the gains in the quarter include increases from our new weapon system business, Nobles Worldwide with the Clouded Leopard armored fighting vehicle, the F-35, the Patriot Missile, the Apache helicopter, F-15, F-16 and F-18 and other industry programs. And many areas of defense were just getting started, pulling some great progress in developing business in UAVs. 
One of the things we're most proud of and I highlight is the continued defense revenue growth of Raytheon. As you may recall, Ducommun was the first company selected to sign a preferred supplier agreement last July with the former Raytheon Missile Systems business, now known as Raytheon Missile and Defense. Through that relationship, I am happy to report that we have fully commercialized our first structures product for them, which is the missile case for the toll missile program. This is a major step forward as all of other current deliveries for Raytheon are electronic products. This win also continues to build a value offering in the areas of defense within Ducommun's structures business. We throwed the opportunity and booked a $20 million-plus order for the program in Q1. 
In addition, another major story is the rotation of our customer rankings. Although it was only 1 quarter, the top 5 companies ranked by revenue now are Raytheon, Boeing, United Technologies, Northrop Grumman and Spirit Aerosystems. For context, since I arrived at the company in January of 2017, each and every quarter, Boeing and Spirit always held the first, second or third place. It should be a clear indicator that the diversification of our portfolio and balance is working at Ducommun, showing material strength, while the commercial aerospace business is significantly impacted by the pandemic and the 737 MAX. 
We believe at least in the next year or 2, this trending will continue in favor of defense, and the team is driving every opportunity. Also, despite the tough news and current situation with commercial aerospace, Ducommun continues to gain share at Airbus, achieving positive growth year-over-year in Q1. As you may recall, Airbus was not even a customer of the company 4 years ago. Though the rates are down, opportunity still exists for a larger percentage of the A320 program. 
The other bright spot for the quarter ending in Q1 was the backlog of $876 million. It is sequentially down from Q4, but still a great number based on the environment, bolstered by strong orders across numerous key defense platforms, which included Apache, the Tomahawk missile case previously discussed, UAVs, weapon systems for ground vehicles, F-35, F-18 and others. This part of Ducommun continues to deliver. Obviously, the strength helped offset commercial aerospace order pressure. 
Overall, the company is off to a solid start in 2020, in both revenues and earnings. As previously communicated, Ducommun took action early in January to ensure all costs that our effective operations were proactively managed due to the 737 MAX production shutdowns at Boeing and Spirit Aerosystems announced in December 2019. Actions have continued as we now deal with the pandemic to ensure the company adjusts its costs. You can certainly see the effectiveness of our actions within this tough environment in Q1, with both very positive gross profit and operating income percentage posted, and the team has certainly done a great job. We continue to be proactive in the area of cost, and I also want to mention that our leadership team has the experience in the background for managing through the financial crisis in 2008, 2009, to be effective through this difficult time as well. 
In regards to the Q2 outlook, we see our strong backlog in defense with the many growth programs mentioned earlier, including the strategic supplier agreement with Raytheon, providing year-over-year growth. The Nobles acquisition will also help provide additional inorganic growth. But with the unprecedented challenges in commercial aero, along with the 737 MAX, the company revenue should be lower in Q2 in the range of 16% to 20% year-over-year. We think that within the current circumstances, it's a very good effort and also expect operating income percentage for the quarter to be between 5.5% and 6%. As we look to the second half of the year, we estimate that defense revenue will improve again, but the business overall will be down year-over-year by 8% to 12% due to commercial aerospace. 
Operating income, we believe, this time will be between 6% to 7%. As you saw, though, in the first quarter, overcoming $25 million plus for MAX, at the beginning of the pandemic, all the hard work the past 3 years, including process improvements, restructuring, leadership development, cost discipline and others have clearly made a material difference. And despite the short-term outlook, the business has a great long-term future. 
Now let me provide you some additional color on our markets, products and programs. Beginning with our military and space sector, we posted first quarter revenue of $100.8 million, up 32% versus 2019. We drove sales across a broad variety of defense platforms in nearly every aspect of our product portfolio. 
As mentioned earlier, we saw increases in demand for our military fixed-wing aircraft programs with particular strength in shipments for the F-15, F-16, F-18 and F-35 as well as top line expansion for helicopters like the Apache. In addition, the Patriot missile system rose again this quarter, we saw significant growth across many other military and space applications. We are well positioned for further growth across our defense platform over the next 3 quarters in all sectors, and ended the first quarter with a backlog roughly $474 million for defense, up an impressive 36% year-over-year. 
I'm also happy to announce that Ducommun was recognized as the Black Hawk supplier of the year in 2019 by Sikorsky, a Lockheed Martin company. 
Within our commercial aerospace operations, first quarter sales declined year-over-year to $62.5 million, but we did see continued share gain at Airbus and despite the rates posted year-over-year gains with this customer. Ducommun also continues to work on adjusting costs and managing the downturn and is well positioned once rates start to stabilize and in the long term. Ducommun's expansion with Airbus since 2017 is clearly helping and puts important balance in our portfolio. 
Airbus A320 and Airbus A220 families represented a larger and larger share, both directly and indirectly in Ducommun's commercial revenue in Q1. The backlog within our commercial aerospace sector stood at roughly $376 million at the end of the first quarter, with the majority of the decline for the 737 MAX program. 
At this point, I'll turn it over to Chris."
267761,664835703,1968963,"Ducommun Incorporated, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",2020-04-30,"Earnings Calls","Ducommun Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. As a reminder, please see the company's filings and Q1 earnings release for further description of information mentioned on today's call. As Steve discussed, we were pleased with the first quarter's overal",1081,"Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. As a reminder, please see the company's filings and Q1 earnings release for further description of information mentioned on today's call. 
As Steve discussed, we were pleased with the first quarter's overall results, even as we faced the dual challenges of lower 737 MAX production and the growing economic impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. We feel confident that our ability to flex production parameters and rapidly evolve our lean operating structure to external conditions will serve us well in the months and quarters ahead. 
Now I'll move to the details of our overall results. Revenue for the first quarter of 2020 was $173.5 million versus $172.6 million in the first quarter of 2019. This performance was driven by $24.2 million of higher sales within the military and space sector partially offset by $23 million of lower revenue from our commercial aerospace customers. Industrial sales were essentially flat year-over-year. 
As mentioned in our year-end earnings call, we expected our military and space business to directionally offset the headwind in Boeing MAX, 737 MAX commercial demand. 
Ducommun's overall backlog at the end of the first quarter was approximately $876 million, near record levels. Growth in the military and space backlog continues to drive a sustained, strong backlog. As a reminder, we define backlog as potential revenue based on customer purchase orders and long-term agreements with firm-fixed prices and expected delivery dates of 24 months or less. 
Once again posted solid gross profit for the quarter as gross margins rose to 21.2% from 20.7% in the prior year's comparable period. The increase year-over-year was due to favorable mix and lower compensation and benefit costs. Gross profit rose to $36.8 million from $35.7 million last year. We do expect downward pressure on gross profit as we move through 2020, and we manage through the environment of reduced commercial aerospace demand. 
SG&A was $23.2 million in the first quarter versus $22.8 million in the first quarter of 2019. The company reported operating income for the first quarter of $13.6 million or 7.8% of revenue compared to $12.8 million or 7.5% of revenue in the prior year period. The year-over-year improvement was due to the increased revenue and the higher gross margins. 
Interest expense was $4.2 million in the first quarter versus $4.4 million in the prior year period, reflecting the favorable impact of lower interest rates on our new credit facilities, more than offsetting the higher amount of debt outstanding during the quarter. The increased debt outstanding during the quarter was primarily due to funding the company's acquisition of Nobles in October 2019. 
The company reported net income for the first quarter of $7.9 million or $0.67 per diluted share compared to net income of $7.5 million or $0.64 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2019. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to higher revenue, stronger gross margins, as I previously mentioned. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2020 was $23.2 million or 13.4% of revenue compared to $21.1 million or 12.2% of revenue for the comparable period in 2019, an increase of 120 basis points. 
Now let me turn to the segment results. Our Electronic Systems segment posted revenue of $98.1 million in the first quarter of 2020 versus $84.2 million in the prior year period. These results reflect a $12.9 million increase in sales with the company's military and space customers and a modest uptick in revenue across our commercial aerospace platforms. Electronic Systems posted operating income for the first quarter of $15.1 million or 15.4% of revenues versus $9.2 million or 10.9% of revenues in the prior year period. The improved performance reflects favorable manufacturing volumes and product mix. 
Our Structural Systems segment posted revenues of $75.4 million in the first quarter of 2020 versus $88.4 million last year. The year-over-year decrease was due to $24.3 million of lower sales across our commercial aerospace applications, reflecting current demand dynamics partially offset by $11.3 million of higher revenue within the company's military and space markets. Structural Systems posted operating income for the quarter of $5.4 million or 7.2% of revenue compared to $10.5 million or 11.9% of revenue last year. The year-over-year operating margin decline reflected unfavorable manufacturing volumes and product mix partially offset by lower compensation and benefit costs. 
Corporate, general and administrative expense, CG&A expenses for the first quarter of 2020 were $6.9 million or 4% of revenue versus $6.9 million and 4% of revenue as well in 2019. 
Turning to liquidity and capital resources. We have available liquidity of $115 million. We drew down $50 million on our $100 million revolver toward the end of the first quarter and an abundance of caution as the uncertainty grew related to the potential impacts of COVID-19. We held this drawdown in cash on our balance sheet at quarter end. We used $12 million of cash from operations during the first quarter of 2020 compared with $1.7 million during the prior year period. The first quarter is historically our weakest cash flow quarter. We operate with significant performance variable compensation -- performance-based -- the significant performance-based variable compensation and the annual incentive for the prior year is paid out in the first quarter of the subsequent year. Additionally, accounts receivable and inventory investments partially offset by higher net income added to the outflow from operations. We are in full compliance with the covenants of our credit facilities, which are not scheduled to expire until 2024 and 2025. As a reminder, we have a covenant life credit facility with a leverage ratio of covenant ceiling of 4.75. Our debt-to-EBITDA was 3.0 at quarter end. 
We have reinforced our focus on cash generation with our lean operations and lean structure, and as we are restricting discretionary spending and optimizing working capital in this volatile environment. As a result, we expect to generate positive free cash flow during the remainder of 2020. 
In terms of capital expenditures, we spent $3.9 million during the first quarter and anticipate spending between $12 million and $14 million in 2020. In alignment with our cash conservation initiative, this anticipated spending will result in a capital expenditure decrease of more than 20% from our 2019 capital spending level. We're again pleased with our quarterly performance and remain cautiously optimistic about the future even as we manage through the uncertainty of the COVID-19 impacts, which create a very challenging operating environment. 
I'll now turn it back over to Steve for his closing remarks."

I would also add that we do have the right footprint, cost structure, discipline and operational leadership to continue developments in the face of this current crisis. 
I also want to thank our customers, shareholders and all of our other business partners as we work through these difficult times together. 
In closing, and most important, I'd like to take this time to tell Ducommun employees, I'm proud of them and all their efforts, dealing with the many challenges from the pandemic. Roughly 90% of our team members show up at our operations every day. And those stressful, get the job done for our customers and our nation. I also want to thank their families for the support. It is never easy when loved ones leave the home with shelter-in-place orders from the authorities. 
We've also given out $700,000 to local area charities, where we operate, and we'll add another $300,000 to reach $1 million in donations from the company to help our neighbors.

Thank you, Chris, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today for our first quarter conference call. I also hope that you and your families are healthy and getting through this pandemic as best as possible. 
Today, and as usual, I will give an update of the current situation of the company, after which Chris Wampler will review our financials in detail. 
Generally, it's been a time of rapid change and the adjustment at Ducommun as we manage through these challenges with the top priority being the health and safety of our employees. I'm happy to report that despite having facilities in high-impacted areas, such as Southern California and one operation south of Albany in New York state, the virus spread has mostly had 0 impact on our team with only 1 case reported, which we believe was not contracted at work. We also remain diligent on putting even more effective safety protocols in place. As we move forward, our facilities are sharing best practices and ideas across the company to sustain this performance. 
Despite the challenges of the pandemic to the nation in the markets, Ducommun's first quarter performance was excellent. The reasons for this result I believe is our team has been working diligently over the past 3 years, improving all our operations, developing our product portfolio, driving new technologies, focusing on providing high value to customers, having an effective cost structure and making strategic acquisitions. This has been particularly evident recently in the progress of Ducommun's defense business revenues and orders. 
Overall, the company's first quarter revenue rose 1% year-over-year and marked the ninth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. So not a material increase. I want to remind everyone that we improved revenue with not only the impact from the virus in March, but also over $25 million of 737 MAX headwind from last year, which for the size of our P&L is impressive. 
As mentioned previously, Ducommun's defense business has really started showing its strength, especially in Q1. Majority of the gains in the quarter include increases from our new weapon system business, Nobles Worldwide with the Clouded Leopard armored fighting vehicle, the F-35, the Patriot Missile, the Apache helicopter, F-15, F-16 and F-18 and other industry programs. And many areas of defense were just getting started, pulling some great progress in developing business in UAVs. 
One of the things we're most proud of and I highlight is the continued defense revenue growth of Raytheon. As you may recall, Ducommun was the first company selected to sign a preferred supplier agreement last July with the former Raytheon Missile Systems business, now known as Raytheon Missile and Defense. Through that relationship, I am happy to report that we have fully commercialized our first structures product for them, which is the missile case for the toll missile program. This is a major step forward as all of other current deliveries for Raytheon are electronic products. This win also continues to build a value offering in the areas of defense within Ducommun's structures business. We throwed the opportunity and booked a $20 million-plus order for the program in Q1. 
In addition, another major story is the rotation of our customer rankings. Although it was only 1 quarter, the top 5 companies ranked by revenue now are Raytheon, Boeing, United Technologies, Northrop Grumman and Spirit Aerosystems. For context, since I arrived at the company in January of 2017, each and every quarter, Boeing and Spirit always held the first, second or third place. It should be a clear indicator that the diversification of our portfolio and balance is working at Ducommun, showing material strength, while the commercial aerospace business is significantly impacted by the pandemic and the 737 MAX. 
We believe at least in the next year or 2, this trending will continue in favor of defense, and the team is driving every opportunity. Also, despite the tough news and current situation with commercial aerospace, Ducommun continues to gain share at Airbus, achieving positive growth year-over-year in Q1. As you may recall, Airbus was not even a customer of the company 4 years ago. Though the rates are down, opportunity still exists for a larger percentage of the A320 program. 
The other bright spot for the quarter ending in Q1 was the backlog of $876 million. It is sequentially down from Q4, but still a great number based on the environment, bolstered by strong orders across numerous key defense platforms, which included Apache, the Tomahawk missile case previously discussed, UAVs, weapon systems for ground vehicles, F-35, F-18 and others. This part of Ducommun continues to deliver. Obviously, the strength helped offset commercial aerospace order pressure. 
Overall, the company is off to a solid start in 2020, in both revenues and earnings. As previously communicated, Ducommun took action early in January to ensure all costs that our effective operations were proactively managed due to the 737 MAX production shutdowns at Boeing and Spirit Aerosystems announced in December 2019. Actions have continued as we now deal with the pandemic to ensure the company adjusts its costs. You can certainly see the effectiveness of our actions within this tough environment in Q1, with both very positive gross profit and operating income percentage posted, and the team has certainly done a great job. We continue to be proactive in the area of cost, and I also want to mention that our leadership team has the experience in the background for managing through the financial crisis in 2008, 2009, to be effective through this difficult time as well. 
In regards to the Q2 outlook, we see our strong backlog in defense with the many growth programs mentioned earlier, including the strategic supplier agreement with Raytheon, providing year-over-year growth. The Nobles acquisition will also help provide additional inorganic growth. But with the unprecedented challenges in commercial aero, along with the 737 MAX, the company revenue should be lower in Q2 in the range of 16% to 20% year-over-year. We think that within the current circumstances, it's a very good effort and also expect operating income percentage for the quarter to be between 5.5% and 6%. As we look to the second half of the year, we estimate that defense revenue will improve again, but the business overall will be down year-over-year by 8% to 12% due to commercial aerospace. 
Operating income, we believe, this time will be between 6% to 7%. As you saw, though, in the first quarter, overcoming $25 million plus for MAX, at the beginning of the pandemic, all the hard work the past 3 years, including process improvements, restructuring, leadership development, cost discipline and others have clearly made a material difference. And despite the short-term outlook, the business has a great long-term future. 
Now let me provide you some additional color on our markets, products and programs. Beginning with our military and space sector, we posted first quarter revenue of $100.8 million, up 32% versus 2019. We drove sales across a broad variety of defense platforms in nearly every aspect of our product portfolio. 
As mentioned earlier, we saw increases in demand for our military fixed-wing aircraft programs with particular strength in shipments for the F-15, F-16, F-18 and F-35 as well as top line expansion for helicopters like the Apache. In addition, the Patriot missile system rose again this quarter, we saw significant growth across many other military and space applications. We are well positioned for further growth across our defense platform over the next 3 quarters in all sectors, and ended the first quarter with a backlog roughly $474 million for defense, up an impressive 36% year-over-year. 
I'm also happy to announce that Ducommun was recognized as the Black Hawk supplier of the year in 2019 by Sikorsky, a Lockheed Martin company. 
Within our commercial aerospace operations, first quarter sales declined year-over-year to $62.5 million, but we did see continued share gain at Airbus and despite the rates posted year-over-year gains with this customer. Ducommun also continues to work on adjusting costs and managing the downturn and is well positioned once rates start to stabilize and in the long term. Ducommun's expansion with Airbus since 2017 is clearly helping and puts important balance in our portfolio. 
Airbus A320 and Airbus A220 families represented a larger and larger share, both directly and indirectly in Ducommun's commercial revenue in Q1. The backlog within our commercial aerospace sector stood at roughly $376 million at the end of the first quarter, with the majority of the decline for the 737 MAX program. 
At this point, I'll turn it over to Chris."
267761,664835703,1979634,"Ducommun Incorporated, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",2020-04-30,"Earnings Calls","Ducommun Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. As a reminder, please see the company's filings and Q1 earnings release for further description of information mentioned on today's call. As Steve discussed, we were pleased with the first quarter's overal",1081,"Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. As a reminder, please see the company's filings and Q1 earnings release for further description of information mentioned on today's call. 
As Steve discussed, we were pleased with the first quarter's overall results, even as we faced the dual challenges of lower 737 MAX production and the growing economic impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. We feel confident that our ability to flex production parameters and rapidly evolve our lean operating structure to external conditions will serve us well in the months and quarters ahead. 
Now I'll move to the details of our overall results. Revenue for the first quarter of 2020 was $173.5 million versus $172.6 million in the first quarter of 2019. This performance was driven by $24.2 million of higher sales within the military and space sector partially offset by $23 million of lower revenue from our commercial aerospace customers. Industrial sales were essentially flat year-over-year. 
As mentioned in our year-end earnings call, we expected our military and space business to directionally offset the headwind in Boeing MAX, 737 MAX commercial demand. 
Ducommun's overall backlog at the end of the first quarter was approximately $876 million, near record levels. Growth in the military and space backlog continues to drive a sustained, strong backlog. As a reminder, we define backlog as potential revenue based on customer purchase orders and long-term agreements with firm-fixed prices and expected delivery dates of 24 months or less. 
Once again posted solid gross profit for the quarter as gross margins rose to 21.2% from 20.7% in the prior year's comparable period. The increase year-over-year was due to favorable mix and lower compensation and benefit costs. Gross profit rose to $36.8 million from $35.7 million last year. We do expect downward pressure on gross profit as we move through 2020, and we manage through the environment of reduced commercial aerospace demand. 
SG&A was $23.2 million in the first quarter versus $22.8 million in the first quarter of 2019. The company reported operating income for the first quarter of $13.6 million or 7.8% of revenue compared to $12.8 million or 7.5% of revenue in the prior year period. The year-over-year improvement was due to the increased revenue and the higher gross margins. 
Interest expense was $4.2 million in the first quarter versus $4.4 million in the prior year period, reflecting the favorable impact of lower interest rates on our new credit facilities, more than offsetting the higher amount of debt outstanding during the quarter. The increased debt outstanding during the quarter was primarily due to funding the company's acquisition of Nobles in October 2019. 
The company reported net income for the first quarter of $7.9 million or $0.67 per diluted share compared to net income of $7.5 million or $0.64 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2019. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to higher revenue, stronger gross margins, as I previously mentioned. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2020 was $23.2 million or 13.4% of revenue compared to $21.1 million or 12.2% of revenue for the comparable period in 2019, an increase of 120 basis points. 
Now let me turn to the segment results. Our Electronic Systems segment posted revenue of $98.1 million in the first quarter of 2020 versus $84.2 million in the prior year period. These results reflect a $12.9 million increase in sales with the company's military and space customers and a modest uptick in revenue across our commercial aerospace platforms. Electronic Systems posted operating income for the first quarter of $15.1 million or 15.4% of revenues versus $9.2 million or 10.9% of revenues in the prior year period. The improved performance reflects favorable manufacturing volumes and product mix. 
Our Structural Systems segment posted revenues of $75.4 million in the first quarter of 2020 versus $88.4 million last year. The year-over-year decrease was due to $24.3 million of lower sales across our commercial aerospace applications, reflecting current demand dynamics partially offset by $11.3 million of higher revenue within the company's military and space markets. Structural Systems posted operating income for the quarter of $5.4 million or 7.2% of revenue compared to $10.5 million or 11.9% of revenue last year. The year-over-year operating margin decline reflected unfavorable manufacturing volumes and product mix partially offset by lower compensation and benefit costs. 
Corporate, general and administrative expense, CG&A expenses for the first quarter of 2020 were $6.9 million or 4% of revenue versus $6.9 million and 4% of revenue as well in 2019. 
Turning to liquidity and capital resources. We have available liquidity of $115 million. We drew down $50 million on our $100 million revolver toward the end of the first quarter and an abundance of caution as the uncertainty grew related to the potential impacts of COVID-19. We held this drawdown in cash on our balance sheet at quarter end. We used $12 million of cash from operations during the first quarter of 2020 compared with $1.7 million during the prior year period. The first quarter is historically our weakest cash flow quarter. We operate with significant performance variable compensation -- performance-based -- the significant performance-based variable compensation and the annual incentive for the prior year is paid out in the first quarter of the subsequent year. Additionally, accounts receivable and inventory investments partially offset by higher net income added to the outflow from operations. We are in full compliance with the covenants of our credit facilities, which are not scheduled to expire until 2024 and 2025. As a reminder, we have a covenant life credit facility with a leverage ratio of covenant ceiling of 4.75. Our debt-to-EBITDA was 3.0 at quarter end. 
We have reinforced our focus on cash generation with our lean operations and lean structure, and as we are restricting discretionary spending and optimizing working capital in this volatile environment. As a result, we expect to generate positive free cash flow during the remainder of 2020. 
In terms of capital expenditures, we spent $3.9 million during the first quarter and anticipate spending between $12 million and $14 million in 2020. In alignment with our cash conservation initiative, this anticipated spending will result in a capital expenditure decrease of more than 20% from our 2019 capital spending level. We're again pleased with our quarterly performance and remain cautiously optimistic about the future even as we manage through the uncertainty of the COVID-19 impacts, which create a very challenging operating environment. 
I'll now turn it back over to Steve for his closing remarks."

There was a nice leap this year, this sort this quarter in Q1. Can we sustain it? Yes, if the volumes do. I mean the key here was getting a little more volume at several of the performance centers, which dropped certainly much stronger than I know we've mentioned as we've gone through. But also getting all of the performance centers up to a more efficient level, and we sort of had that breakthrough as well. So Q1, the shine that Electronics had on it in Q1 certainly helped us balance out the quarter. And we're going to look for that as we move forward. Yes, there'll be a little more headwind. And Q2 is a little bit -- as Steve alluded to, is going to be a tough one overall. We do look for Electronics to continue to keep a very strong profile."

So definitely where we were at the year-end call, it's a more favorable interest rate environment. And so that number should probably be more in the $4 million a quarter versus what we were talking about at the year-end call. So that will help out at that line. 
And then on the tax side, I think we're still -- we've gotten to a pretty decent repeat process on where we're at under the new tax laws over the last couple of years. And pointing you to a 19% to 20% full year is probably still the right answer. We definitely cut some favorability with some of the SBC tax laws hit in Q1, that were a discrete item for us.

As usual, I'll begin by providing an update on recent developments at the company, after which Chris Wampler will review our financials in detail. 
As we finish a very important year for the company in 2019, I want to take this opportunity to first review a few highlights of our strong performance. Our team has been working diligently over the past 3 years, improving all of our operations, developing our product portfolio, driving new technologies, focusing on providing high-value to customers and making strategic acquisitions, among others. 
In 2019, Ducommun sales grew to $721 million, up 15% over 2018 and its highest since 2014. In conjunction with that increase, we grew gross profit to $152 million or 21.1%. Net margin rate for 2019 has not been realized at the company in more than 15 years. 
Adjusted margins rose as well to 7.9% from 6.4% in 2018, and we generated $51 million in cash from operations. Just as important with great top and bottom line growth, EBITDA rose to $92.3 million in 2019 or 12.8% of sales versus $70.7 million or 11.2% of sales last year. We're very proud of all these gains as we develop the company for sustained high-performance in the years ahead. 
Now turning specifically to the fourth quarter, revenue rose 14% year-over-year and marked the sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit increases, averaging 15% growth, which was mainly organic. The majority of the gains were driven by important military programs, such as the F-35, F-15, the Apache helicopter and several missile programs. It also included good growth with Airbus and Boeing. 
The other real bright spot for the quarter was ending the year with a backlog of about $910 million bolstered by strong orders across numerous key platforms, particularly within our defense business. We also posted an impressive book-to-bill ratio in the quarter of 1.4, again driven by defense. As mentioned in the press release, we have spent a good amount of time during the past few years improving the performance of our defense operations and business development team, and now are seeing the results. It's also great to see our team leveraging Ducommun's capabilities and structures, more and more within the defense markets. 
And orders in that part of the Ducommun's business increased sequentially in the second half of the year by 45%. At the same time, we completed another important acquisition, Nobles Worldwide, who supplies advanced technical products for a variety of aircraft, naval vessels and military vehicles. The integration is going very well and the team is already adding great value, opening new markets and opportunities for Ducommun, along with expanding our engineered products portfolio. 
As also mentioned in the press release, we're off to a strong start in 2020 within many areas of the company. In addition, we are also working closely with Boeing and Spirit AeroSystems on the 737 MAX. After the announcements in December from both companies, Ducommun took action in January to ensure all costs within our affected operations are being closely and proactively managed. All of our affected operations have been working to minimize the impact. And due to some of our successes with new business, we have been able to redeploy some employees. The amount of personnel furloughed in January due to the MAX is less than 3%. And though difficult, we are proud of our performance center teams proactively dealing with the situation. 
That being said, we are looking forward to starting production back later in Q1 with Spirit, based on public comments and communication from them and with Boeing as soon as April. We're also well positioned operationally to meet any rate requirements along with the ramp-up in the future. In regards to the 2020 outlook, we see our strong backlog in defense, growing business with Airbus and our strategic supplier agreement with Raytheon, which we announced in July 2019, as all examples of programs, helping to offset this year's revenue headwind with 737 MAX production. 
Company is also benefiting from new process technologies, exemplified by our $200 million 10-year contract to supply Middle River AeroStructures with LEAP engine nacelle components for the A320 platform. This business utilizing Ducommun's proprietary VersaCore Composite process technology will deliver over $10 million in 2020 revenue with a full ramp-up to $20 million in 2021 and is now all being fully produced at our Guaymas, Mexico performance center. 
The Nobles acquisition closed in October 2019, will also help provide additional revenue this year. Finally, all the hard work in the past few years, including process improvements, restructuring, leadership development, cost discipline and other initiatives will also contribute in 2020. Therefore, Ducommun's 2020 revenue growth based on both Spirit and Boeing following through on their public comments regarding their production plans should be flat to slightly down low single digit in the first half of 2020 and up low single digits in the second half of 2020. 
Coming off the last few years, this is certainly more modest, but other than the circumstances with 737 -- with the 737 MAX situation, we feel it's an excellent outcome, shows the company's development in the past few years, and we will deliver on our commitments. 
Now let me provide some additional color on our markets, products and programs. Beginning with our military and space sector, we posted fourth quarter revenue of $89.5 million, up 22% versus 2018. In 2019, we drove sales of nearly $325 million, a gain of over 17% over 2018 reflecting growth across a broad variety of defense platforms, including nearly every aspect of our product portfolio. We saw a double-digit increase in demand for our military fixed-wing aircraft programs particularly strong shipments from the F-15 and F-35 as well as substantial top line expansion for helicopters like the Apache, Black Hawk and Chinook. 
In addition, the Patriot missile system rose to become one of our top sellers last year. We saw significant growth across many other military and space applications. We are well positioned for future growth across our defense platforms in 2020, again, in all sectors and began the year with a backlog of roughly $450 million, up 32% year-over-year. 
Within our commercial aerospace operations, fourth quarter sales declined slightly year-over-year to $83 million, while the 2019 as a whole, revenue grew 15% to just over $350 million. Ducommun's growth continues to be fueled by large narrow-body aircraft platforms, nearly all of which saw double-digit growth last year. 
While Boeing is still our largest customer, and the 737 MAX, a major contributor to revenue, Ducommun's expansion with Airbus since 2017 has clearly helped and put important balance in our portfolio. The Airbus A320 and A220 families, in particular, have become very important factors in our growth trajectory. And Airbus in total represents a larger and larger share, both directly and indirectly in Ducommun's commercial revenue last quarter. The backlog within our commercial aerospace sector stood at roughly $431 million at the end of 2019 positioning us well for solid performance going forward. Despite some uncertainty with the 737 MAX production schedule, we remain optimistic about the commercial market, given the breadth of key platforms, we serve in this market in 2020. 
With that, I'll have Chris review our financial results in detail. Chris?"

As a reminder, please see the company's filings and today's press release for further descriptions of matters under discussion during the call. 2019, as Steve discussed, was a year of great accomplishment for Ducommun that included strong top line growth, solid margin expansion, adjusted EBITDA growth and a variety of wins that position us well for the future. Our Ducommun operating system and its performance-center-focused factory approach continues to be a catalyst in driving the improvement of the year-over-year operating results. We feel confident that our efforts to broaden our customer base and streamline the business will continue to serve us well as we head into 2020 and beyond. 
Now I'll move to the details of our overall results. Review of the fourth quarter 2019. Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2019 was $186.9 million versus $164.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2018. The performance was driven primarily by $16.1 million of higher sales within the military and space sector and to a lesser extent, $3.6 million of greater revenue from our commercial aerospace customers. Both end markets saw increased demand across a variety of platforms and programs. Ducommun's overall backlog at the end of the fourth quarter was approximately $910 million, a new record for the company. As a reminder, we define backlog as potential revenue based on customer purchase orders and long-term agreements with firm fixed prices and expected delivery dates of 24 months or less. 
Our focused factory approach at our performance centers continues to drive strong margins as our gross margin was 21.5% in the fourth quarter versus 19.9% in the prior year's comparable period. The increase year-over-year was primarily due to the impact of favorable volume, along with the manufacturing efficiencies. This was our highest gross profit percentage quarter since the second quarter of 2010. And our Q4 gross profit amount of $40.1 million was the highest gross profit dollar result in the company's history. 
SG&A was $24.9 million in the fourth quarter versus $22.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, with the increase primarily reflecting incremental SG&A from the Nobles business and higher compensation and benefit costs. The company reported operating income for the fourth quarter of $15.2 million or 8.1% of revenue compared to $6.3 million or 3.8% of revenue in the prior period. The year-over-year improvement was due to higher revenue, higher gross profit and the fact that the prior year included, in aggregate, $4.5 million of restructure charges and refinancing costs. 
The 2019 fourth quarter by comparison included a total of $0.6 million of purchase accounting adjustments and refinancing costs. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $15.8 million or 8.4% of sales in the fourth quarter of 2019 versus $10.8 million or 6.6% of sales in 2018. 
Interest expense was $5.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 versus $3.8 million in the prior year period due to higher debt levels related to the company's acquisition of Nobles in October 2019. As announced on December 20, 2019, we executed a debt refinancing, which included entering into a term loan A of $140 million to clear our $100 million revolver as well as pay down some of our term loan B which carries a higher interest rate. The company reported net income for the fourth quarter of $8.9 million or $0.75 per diluted share compared to net income of $0.7 million or $0.06 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2018. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to $7.4 million of higher gross profit and lower restructure and other charges, as I previously mentioned. 
Adjusted net income was $9.5 million or $0.80 per diluted share in the fourth quarter -- 2019 fourth quarter versus $5.2 million or $0.44 per share in the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2019 was $25.2 million or 13.5% of revenue compared to $19.4 million or 11.8% of revenue for the comparable period in 2018, an increase of 170 basis points. 
Now let me turn to the segment results. Electronic Systems. Our Electronic Systems segment posted revenue of $96.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 versus $85.3 million in the prior year period. These results reflect a $9.3 million increase in sales to our military and space customers, while commercial aerospace shipments were down slightly year-over-year. Electronic Systems posted operating income for the fourth quarter of $9.9 million or 10.2% of revenue versus $7.5 million or 8.7% of revenue in the prior period. Excluding restructure -- restructuring charges last year. Electronic's adjusted operating margin was 11.5% for the 2018 fourth quarter, with the year-over-year decline reflecting product mix. 
Structural Systems. Our Structural Systems segment posted revenue of $90.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 versus $78.9 million last year. The year-over-year increase was due to $4.9 million of higher sales across our commercial aerospace applications, primarily large airframe single-aisle platforms and a $6.8 million increase in revenue within the company's military and space markets. 
Structural Systems posted operating income for the quarter of $11.6 million or 12.8% of revenue compared to $5.7 million or 7.2% of revenue last year. Excluding restructuring charges and inventory purchase accounting adjustments, Structure's adjusted operating margin was 13.4% for the 2019 fourth quarter and 8.7% for the 2018 fourth quarter. The year-over-year operating margin improvement reflects favorable product mix and improved manufacturing efficiencies. 
Corporate, general and administrative expense. CG&A expense for the fourth quarter of 2019 was $6.3 million or 3.4% of revenue versus $6.9 million or 4.2% of revenue in 2018. The year-over-year decrease was due to lower restructure charges of $0.3 million and lower general corporate expenses of $0.2 million. 
Turning to liquidity and capital resources. We generated $31 million of cash from operations in the fourth quarter of 2019 and $51 million for the full year compared with $13 million during the prior year quarter and $46 million for 2018 in total. We remain committed to managing working capital effectively and improving asset utilization to maintain solid margins and generate as much operating cash as possible. 
In terms of capital expenditures, we spent $3.9 million during the fourth quarter and $18.8 million for the full year. We anticipate spending $16 million to $18 million in 2020 to support new programs and product development. 
We're again pleased with our full year and fourth quarter performance and remain upbeat about our future results. 
I'll now turn it back over to Steve for his closing remarks. Steve?"

Again, a few final thoughts here. 2019 was certainly a terrific year where the company was just 3 years ago, and despite the short-term challenges to MAX, I believe we have a lot of runway ahead. 2020 will be one that sees increasing content with Airbus, continued strength across all of our defense platforms and determined focus on serving Boeing and Spirit as we support this important program, along with the subsequent resumption of production. I'd also add that we do have the right footprint, cost structure, discipline and operational leadership to continue developments at the company and strengthen it this year. Finally, you can be assured that everyone at the company is fully engaged as we move through the first quarter. And like our track record during the past few years despite the short-term challenge, we will deliver on our commitments.

So the headwind is splintered out amongst 3 to 4 facilities that all have pieces of that and so with that, and then with having the other commercial and then the defense customers that we have that can pick up the slack, that's what gives us the increased flexibility versus if we were sitting there with one facility that was going to take on all this headwind. 
So that's why we can -- that all reflects to what we did. That's why we feel like we can manage. And certainly, as Steve alluded to, first half of the year, but a little more challenging.

And thanks, everyone, for joining us today for our second quarter conference call. I also hope that you and your families are healthy and continuing to get through this pandemic as best as possible.Today, and as usual, I will give",1341,"Well, thank you, Chris. And thanks, everyone, for joining us today for our second quarter conference call. I also hope that you and your families are healthy and continuing to get through this pandemic as best as possible.Today, and as usual, I will give an update on the current situation at the company, after which Chris Wampler will review our financials in detail.The company remains focused, first and foremost, on the health and safety of our employees. The team has done an excellent job, and despite facilities around the country, and quite a few in Southern California, the impact has been mostly zero and the amount of positive cases across the company less than 25. We also continue to remain diligent on communication and ensuring best practices are followed in all facilities to sustain this performance.Ducommun's second quarter results were strong in light of the unprecedented challenges due to the pandemic in the commercial aerospace markets. As mentioned in our April call, the reasons for the strength is that since 2017 the team has been improving all of our operations, developing and rationalizing the product portfolio, driving new technologies, focusing on providing high value to customers, along with pricing, developing an effective cost structure with a flat organization and making 3 strategic acquisitions. This has been particularly evident in the revenue and order progress over the last few quarters for Ducommun's defense business, along with the overall margin performance for the company.The company's second quarter revenue was down 18.4% year-over-year, all due to the commercial aerospace markets and in line with our communication and expectations. Ducommun's defense business, however, showed great strength, being up 23% versus prior year. Though not ever wanting to show negative growth, the revenue number is impressive, from not only the virus impact but also overcoming $30 million of 737 MAX headwind in the quarter.Ducommun's defense business, on the other hand, continues to show excellent progress, with big opportunities ahead. A majority of the gains in defense included increases from our new weapons systems business, Nobles Worldwide, along with the F-35, Patriot missile, CH-53K Heavy-Lift, V-22 Osprey, F-15, F-16 and other industry programs.Another growth area this year which I mentioned during our last call was Ducommun's new efforts with UAVs. I'm happy today to announce at this time our first major customer in this new area is General Atomics Aeronautical Systems. We are thrilled to be selected as a strategic supplier by GA, providing critical components on the Predator series remotely piloted aircraft, and look forward to many productive years together.Ducommun also continues to leverage its preferred supplier agreement signed last July with the former Raytheon Missile Systems business, now known as Raytheon Missile and Defense. The TOW missile case, a new structures program with RMS, mentioned in the previous call, is now in full production at our Monrovia, California, performance center.We have 2 other wins this year for the TOW missile at other Ducommun performance centers in the Midwest, and in total this one program will generate over $30 million of revenue in 2021. These types of wins have allowed us to build a compelling value story and now track record, utilizing Ducommun's full portfolio of products and services as we move further to drive sales gains at Raytheon Technologies and other defense OEMs.The other real bright spot for the quarter was ending Q2 with a backlog of $505 million for the defense business, which is an all-time record for Ducommun. Total backlog was $831 million for the company, sequentially down from Q1 but still is a great number based on the environment.The defense business grew year-over-year by 38%, bolstered by strong orders across numerous key defense platforms, which included the TOW missile, previously discussed, GA, weapon systems for ground vehicles, F-18, Patriot, F-35, Aegis and others, as this is part of Ducommun that continues to deliver.Obviously, this strength helped offset commercial aerospace order pressure.As in Q1, cost actions have continued with the pandemic and the Q2 737 MAX schedule changes to ensure we have adjusted our costs. You can certainly see the effectiveness of our actions in both the positive gross profit expansion year-over-year and a solid operating income percentage. The team has certainly done a great job moving quickly in managing this difficult environment, with no material pandemic-related costs incurred.In regards to the Q3 outlook, our significant backlog in defense, due to the many growth programs mentioned earlier, will provide the same strong revenue. However, we see the revenue profile for Q3 the same as Q2: being 16% to 20% down year-over-year. Our comments on the April 30 call were for better sequential revenue in Q3, but this was based at the time of 216 shipments for Spirit Aerosystems in 2020 for the 737 MAX. As we know, this changed later in the quarter, from 216 to 125 and now 72. Therefore, this was the main reason we had to adjust the outlook.A real bright spot, though, is that we see our operating income margins now between 7% and 8% in the quarter, up 100 basis points more from our comments in April.As we look to Q4, we estimate that revenue will again be led by defense, but the business, over all, will be down year-over-year by 14% to 18%, again due to commercial aerospace, and operating margins will again be in the same range as Q3, at 7% to 8%.As you have seen through the first half of the year, the unprecedented challenges with the pandemic, along with $55 million of headwind for the MAX, created an historic challenge for Ducommun and our team. The business, though, has shown great strength due to the many strategic initiatives since 2017 and has clearly made a material difference for the company, our customers and the shareholder.Ducommun also has a great long-term future. Despite the current challenges, we look forward to a return to revenue growth for the full year in 2021, leveraging our many defense wins, an historic defense backlog, along with benefiting from share gain at Airbus and also a modest level of recovery for some of our commercial OEM customers.Now let me provide some additional color on our markets, products and programs. Beginning with our military and space sector, we posted second quarter revenue of $94.6 million, once again representing strong growth versus 2019, up 23%. We drove revenues across a broad variety of defense platforms, including nearly every aspect of our product portfolio. As mentioned earlier, we saw increases in demand for our military fixed-wing aircraft programs, with particularly strong shipments for the F-35, F-15 and F-16 as well as top line expansion for helicopters such as the CH-53K and the V-22.In addition, the Patriot missile system rose again this quarter. We can see significant growth across many military and space applications, going forward.We also had significant growth on a number of ground vehicle programs, such as the Clouded Leopard.The second quarter military and space revenue represented 64% of Ducommun's revenue in the period. We also continue to be very well positioned for further growth across our defense platforms over the next several quarters in all sectors and, again, ended the second quarter with an all-time record-high backlog. This was up an impressive 38% year-over-year, representing over 60% of Ducommun's backlog at the end of Q2.Within our commercial aerospace operations, second quarter revenue declined year-over-year to $40.4 million, as expected, driven by [ build rate ] declines on the 737 MAX as well as many other programs impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Ducommun, as stated earlier, has effectively adjusted costs and managed the downturn and is well positioned once rates stabilize and increase over the long term.Ducommun's expansion with Airbus since 2017 is clearly going to be a benefit as we move forward and puts important balance in our portfolio for the future.The backlog within our commercial aerospace sector stands at roughly $307 million at the end of the second quarter, with a majority of the decline attributed to the 737 MAX program.With that, I'll have Chris review our financial results. Chris?"

As a reminder, when it shows up on the SEC website, you can see the company's filing, along with the Q2 earnings release that is already out there, for a further description of information mentioned on today",1373,"Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. As a reminder, when it shows up on the SEC website, you can see the company's filing, along with the Q2 earnings release that is already out there, for a further description of information mentioned on today's call.As Steve discussed, we were pleased with our overall second quarter results, particularly during a global pandemic that has severely impacted commercial and aircraft demand. We remain confident that our ability to flex production at our performance centers while leveraging ongoing strong demand within the military and defense sector will serve us well, going forward.Now I'll move to the details of our overall results. Review of the second quarter 2020. Revenue for the second quarter of 2020 was $147.3 million, versus $180.5 million in the second quarter of 2019. The performance reflected $17.4 million of higher sales within the military and space sector, offset by $51.6 million of lower revenue from our commercial aerospace customers. As Steve discussed, nearly all of our commercial platforms have been negatively impacted by lower demand due to COVID-19.Ducommun's overall backlog at the end of the second quarter was approximately $831 million. Growth in the military and space sector continues to drive a sustained solid base of business. As a reminder, we define backlog as a potential revenue based on customer purchase orders and long-term agreements, with firm fixed prices and expected delivery dates of 24 months or less.We posted strong gross margins for the quarter, as gross margins rose to 22.2%, from 21.1% in the prior year's comparable period. The increase year-over-year was due to favorable product mix and lower compensation of benefit costs.Gross profit fell to $32.7 million, from $38.1 million last year, due to the lower commercial aerospace revenue. We continue to focus on execution and sustaining margins and, where possible, expanding margins even as overall manufacturing volumes remain under pressure.SG&A was $22 million in the quarter, versus $24.5 million last year, as the prior year included $1.7 million of one-time severance expense and execution of current year cost control initiatives.The company reported operating income for the second quarter of $10 million, or 6.8% of revenue, and adjusted operating income of $10.7 million, or 7.3%. This compares to an adjusted operating income of $13.6 million, or 7.5% of revenue, in the prior year period. The year-over-year decline was due to lower revenue, partially offset by higher gross margin and lower SG&A expense.Interest expense was $3.7 million in the second quarter of 2020, versus $4.4 million in the prior year period, reflecting the favorable impact from lower interest rates which more than offset higher debt levels. The increased debt outstanding was primarily due to funding the company's acquisition of Nobles in October 2019, along with drawing down $50 million on our revolver, which remained as cash on hand at the end of the  second quarter 2020.The company reported net income for the second quarter of $5.1 million, or $0.43 per diluted share, and an adjusted net income of $5.6 million, or $0.48 per diluted share. This compares to an adjusted net income of $7.8 million, or $0.66 per diluted share, for the second quarter of 2019. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to lower revenue, as noted earlier.Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2020 was $20.3 million, or 13.8% of revenue, compared to $22.4 million, or 12.4% of revenue, for the comparable period in 2019.Now let me turn to our segment results. Our Electronic Systems segment posted revenue of $92 million in the second quarter of 2020, versus $89.3 million in the prior year period. These results reflect a $7.7 million increase in sales to the company's military and space customers, partially offset by $6 million of lower revenue across the commercial aerospace platforms.Electronic Systems posted operating income for the second quarter of $10.4 million, or 11.4% of revenue, versus $9.9 million, or 11.1% of revenue, in the prior year period. The performance reflected lower compensation and benefit costs compared to 2019, but both manufacturing volumes and product mix negatively impacted margins sequentially versus the first quarter of 2020.Our Structural Systems segment posted revenue of $55.4 million in the second quarter of 2020, versus $91.2 million last year. The year-over-year decrease was due to $45.5 million of lower sales across our commercial aerospace applications, reflecting current demand dynamics, as Steve discussed, partially offset by $9.7 million of higher revenue within the company's military and space markets.Structural Systems posted operating income for the quarter of $6.2 million, or 11.2% of revenue, and adjusted operating income of $6.8 million, or 12.4% of revenue. This compares to an adjusted operating income of $11.8 million, or 12.9% of revenue, last year. The year-over-year operating margin decline reflected unfavorable manufacturing volumes, partially offset by favorable product mix.As I finish my update on Structural Systems, I want to briefly mention an incident that occurred subsequent to the close of our second quarter related to our Guaymas, Mexico, performance center. This manufacturing facility is a part of our Structural Systems segment. Our second fiscal quarter ended June 27, 2020. On June 29, 2020, a fire severely damaged the facility, which is comprised of 2 buildings totaling approximately 62,000 square feet. Thankfully, there were no injuries.However, inventory and property and equipment in this leased facility were damaged. This has historically been a site where we perform secondary operations for a number of our performance centers. In addition, this location has supported our VersaCore product line.We have insurance coverage for the losses and expect the majority, if not all, of the items will be covered under the policy. We are currently working with our insurance carrier to assess the losses and work through the claims process.In the near term, we will utilize our contingency plan that incorporates significant redundant manufacturing capabilities, which will allow us to absorb the production that was planned for the Guaymas performance center in several of our other performance centers. We do not expect a material change to the production levels, and we will continue to focus on meeting our customers' needs for these products.For the remainder of 2020, the adjusted results we will be reporting will exclude our restructure activities and the impact related to the Guaymas fire.Corporate General and Administrative expense. CG&A expense for the second quarter of 2020 was $6.6 million, or 4.5% of revenue, versus $8.1 million, or 4.5% of revenue, in 2019. This reflects one-time severance charges of $1.7 million in the second quarter of Fiscal 2019.Turning to liquidity and capital resources, we have available liquidity of $120 million, comprised of $70 million of cash on hand, plus the remaining $50 million on our revolver, at the end of second quarter 2020.We generated $8.6 million of cash from operations during the second quarter of 2020, compared to $9.7 million during the prior year period. This performance reflected effective working capital management, partially offset by lower net income.We continue to be in compliance with our debt covenants, and our credit facilities do not mature until 2024 and 2025. As a reminder, our leverage ratio covenant ceiling is 4.75. Our leverage ratio was 3.0 at the end of the second quarter of 2020.Cash generation and cost management within our efficient operating structure remains our priority, and we expect to generate positive free cash flow for the remainder of 2020.In terms of capital expenditures, we spent $1.1 million during the second quarter of 2020 and anticipate spending between $12 million and $14 million in 2020. This aligns with our cash conservation initiatives and should result in a capital spending decrease of more than 20% versus 2019. These estimates do not reflect the incremental spending required to replace the manufacturing capabilities damaged in the fire in Guaymas. We expect the majority, if not all, of the spending to be funded from insurance recoveries.Employee safety is always top of mind, even as we continue to focus on cost management, flexing our performance center production schedules and optimizing working capital as we move forward. Our Q2 performance was the result of a strong resilient effort by all the Ducommun employees, who remain focused on execution and satisfying the customers' demands during this very challenging period.I'll now turn it back over to Steve for his closing remarks.

If you look sequentially, Q1 was sort of a perfect storm in terms of we came into Q1 where we had demand that during that quarter started to get pushed out with Boeing and Spirit, and the pandemic was sort of hitting right there at the end as well. So we had a lot of ripple effect on the costs and being able to absorb as cleanly as we'd like, certainly in Q1. Along with the mix, that put us in a tough spot for the number in Q1, and that's why that margin for Q1 was lower than it had been for several quarters.And then in Q2, mix changed a little bit. That certainly helped us. But also some of the initiatives and sort of the realignment and flexing that was taking place during Q1, at the end of Q1, and as we got into Q2 helped clear the path for a better performance."

And thanks, everyone, for joining us today for our second quarter conference call. I also hope that you and your families are healthy and continuing to get through this pandemic as best as possible.
Today, and as usual, I will give an update on the current situation at the company, after which Chris Wampler will review our financials in detail.
The company remains focused, first and foremost, on the health and safety of our employees. The team has done an excellent job, and despite facilities around the country, and quite a few in Southern California, the impact has been mostly zero and the amount of positive cases across the company less than 25. We also continue to remain diligent on communication and ensuring best practices are followed in all facilities to sustain this performance.
Ducommun's second quarter results were strong in light of the unprecedented challenges due to the pandemic in the commercial aerospace markets. As mentioned in our April call, the reasons for the strength is that since 2017 the team has been improving all of our operations, developing and rationalizing the product portfolio, driving new technologies, focusing on providing high value to customers, along with pricing, developing an effective cost structure with a flat organization and making 3 strategic acquisitions. This has been particularly evident in the revenue and order progress over the last few quarters for Ducommun's defense business, along with the overall margin performance for the company.
The company's second quarter revenue was down 18.4% year-over-year, all due to the commercial aerospace markets and in line with our communication and expectations. Ducommun's defense business, however, showed great strength, being up 23% versus prior year. Though not ever wanting to show negative growth, the revenue number is impressive, from not only the virus impact but also overcoming $30 million of 737 MAX headwind in the quarter.
Ducommun's defense business, on the other hand, continues to show excellent progress, with big opportunities ahead. A majority of the gains in defense included increases from our new weapons systems business, Nobles Worldwide, along with the F-35, Patriot missile, CH-53K Heavy-Lift, V-22 Osprey, F-15, F-16 and other industry programs.
Another growth area this year which I mentioned during our last call was Ducommun's new efforts with UAVs. I'm happy today to announce at this time our first major customer in this new area is General Atomics Aeronautical Systems. We are thrilled to be selected as a strategic supplier by GA, providing critical components on the Predator series remotely piloted aircraft, and look forward to many productive years together.
Ducommun also continues to leverage its preferred supplier agreement signed last July with the former Raytheon Missile Systems business, now known as Raytheon Missile and Defense. The TOW missile case, a new structures program with RMS, mentioned in the previous call, is now in full production at our Monrovia, California, performance center.
We have 2 other wins this year for the TOW missile at other Ducommun performance centers in the Midwest, and in total this one program will generate over $30 million of revenue in 2021. These types of wins have allowed us to build a compelling value story and now track record, utilizing Ducommun's full portfolio of products and services as we move further to drive sales gains at Raytheon Technologies and other defense OEMs.
The other real bright spot for the quarter was ending Q2 with a backlog of $505 million for the defense business, which is an all-time record for Ducommun. Total backlog was $831 million for the company, sequentially down from Q1 but still is a great number based on the environment.
The defense business grew year-over-year by 38%, bolstered by strong orders across numerous key defense platforms, which included the TOW missile, previously discussed, GA, weapon systems for ground vehicles, F-18, Patriot, F-35, Aegis and others, as this is part of Ducommun that continues to deliver.
Obviously, this strength helped offset commercial aerospace order pressure.
As in Q1, cost actions have continued with the pandemic and the Q2 737 MAX schedule changes to ensure we have adjusted our costs. You can certainly see the effectiveness of our actions in both the positive gross profit expansion year-over-year and a solid operating income percentage. The team has certainly done a great job moving quickly in managing this difficult environment, with no material pandemic-related costs incurred.
In regards to the Q3 outlook, our significant backlog in defense, due to the many growth programs mentioned earlier, will provide the same strong revenue. However, we see the revenue profile for Q3 the same as Q2: being 16% to 20% down year-over-year. Our comments on the April 30 call were for better sequential revenue in Q3, but this was based at the time of 216 shipments for Spirit Aerosystems in 2020 for the 737 MAX. As we know, this changed later in the quarter, from 216 to 125 and now 72. Therefore, this was the main reason we had to adjust the outlook.
A real bright spot, though, is that we see our operating income margins now between 7% and 8% in the quarter, up 100 basis points more from our comments in April.
As we look to Q4, we estimate that revenue will again be led by defense, but the business, over all, will be down year-over-year by 14% to 18%, again due to commercial aerospace, and operating margins will again be in the same range as Q3, at 7% to 8%.
As you have seen through the first half of the year, the unprecedented challenges with the pandemic, along with $55 million of headwind for the MAX, created an historic challenge for Ducommun and our team. The business, though, has shown great strength due to the many strategic initiatives since 2017 and has clearly made a material difference for the company, our customers and the shareholder.
Ducommun also has a great long-term future. Despite the current challenges, we look forward to a return to revenue growth for the full year in 2021, leveraging our many defense wins, an historic defense backlog, along with benefiting from share gain at Airbus and also a modest level of recovery for some of our commercial OEM customers.
Now let me provide some additional color on our markets, products and programs. Beginning with our military and space sector, we posted second quarter revenue of $94.6 million, once again representing strong growth versus 2019, up 23%. We drove revenues across a broad variety of defense platforms, including nearly every aspect of our product portfolio. As mentioned earlier, we saw increases in demand for our military fixed-wing aircraft programs, with particularly strong shipments for the F-35, F-15 and F-16 as well as top line expansion for helicopters such as the CH-53K and the V-22.
In addition, the Patriot missile system rose again this quarter. We can see significant growth across many military and space applications, going forward.
We also had significant growth on a number of ground vehicle programs, such as the Clouded Leopard.
The second quarter military and space revenue represented 64% of Ducommun's revenue in the period. We also continue to be very well positioned for further growth across our defense platforms over the next several quarters in all sectors and, again, ended the second quarter with an all-time record-high backlog. This was up an impressive 38% year-over-year, representing over 60% of Ducommun's backlog at the end of Q2.
Within our commercial aerospace operations, second quarter revenue declined year-over-year to $40.4 million, as expected, driven by [ build rate ] declines on the 737 MAX as well as many other programs impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Ducommun, as stated earlier, has effectively adjusted costs and managed the downturn and is well positioned once rates stabilize and increase over the long term.
Ducommun's expansion with Airbus since 2017 is clearly going to be a benefit as we move forward and puts important balance in our portfolio for the future.
The backlog within our commercial aerospace sector stands at roughly $307 million at the end of the second quarter, with a majority of the decline attributed to the 737 MAX program.
With that, I'll have Chris review our financial results. Chris?"
267761,677124913,2053192,"Ducommun Incorporated, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2020",2020-07-30,"Earnings Calls","Ducommun Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. As a reminder, when it shows up on the SEC website, you can see the company's filing, along with the Q2 earnings release that is already out there, for a further description of information mentioned on today",1400,"Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. As a reminder, when it shows up on the SEC website, you can see the company's filing, along with the Q2 earnings release that is already out there, for a further description of information mentioned on today's call.
As Steve discussed, we were pleased with our overall second quarter results, particularly during a global pandemic that has severely impacted commercial and aircraft demand. We remain confident that our ability to flex production at our performance centers while leveraging ongoing strong demand within the military and defense sector will serve us well, going forward.
Now I'll move to the details of our overall results. Review of the second quarter 2020. Revenue for the second quarter of 2020 was $147.3 million, versus $180.5 million in the second quarter of 2019. The performance reflected $17.4 million of higher sales within the military and space sector, offset by $51.6 million of lower revenue from our commercial aerospace customers. As Steve discussed, nearly all of our commercial platforms have been negatively impacted by lower demand due to COVID-19.
Ducommun's overall backlog at the end of the second quarter was approximately $831 million. Growth in the military and space sector continues to drive a sustained solid base of business. As a reminder, we define backlog as a potential revenue based on customer purchase orders and long-term agreements, with firm fixed prices and expected delivery dates of 24 months or less.
We posted strong gross margins for the quarter, as gross margins rose to 22.2%, from 21.1% in the prior year's comparable period. The increase year-over-year was due to favorable product mix and lower compensation of benefit costs.
Gross profit fell to $32.7 million, from $38.1 million last year, due to the lower commercial aerospace revenue. We continue to focus on execution and sustaining margins and, where possible, expanding margins even as overall manufacturing volumes remain under pressure.
SG&A was $22 million in the quarter, versus $24.5 million last year, as the prior year included $1.7 million of one-time severance expense and execution of current year cost control initiatives.
The company reported operating income for the second quarter of $10 million, or 6.8% of revenue, and adjusted operating income of $10.7 million, or 7.3%. This compares to an adjusted operating income of $13.6 million, or 7.5% of revenue, in the prior year period. The year-over-year decline was due to lower revenue, partially offset by higher gross margin and lower SG&A expense.
Interest expense was $3.7 million in the second quarter of 2020, versus $4.4 million in the prior year period, reflecting the favorable impact from lower interest rates which more than offset higher debt levels. The increased debt outstanding was primarily due to funding the company's acquisition of Nobles in October 2019, along with drawing down $50 million on our revolver, which remained as cash on hand at the end of the  second quarter 2020.
The company reported net income for the second quarter of $5.1 million, or $0.43 per diluted share, and an adjusted net income of $5.6 million, or $0.48 per diluted share. This compares to an adjusted net income of $7.8 million, or $0.66 per diluted share, for the second quarter of 2019. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to lower revenue, as noted earlier.
Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2020 was $20.3 million, or 13.8% of revenue, compared to $22.4 million, or 12.4% of revenue, for the comparable period in 2019.
Now let me turn to our segment results. Our Electronic Systems segment posted revenue of $92 million in the second quarter of 2020, versus $89.3 million in the prior year period. These results reflect a $7.7 million increase in sales to the company's military and space customers, partially offset by $6 million of lower revenue across the commercial aerospace platforms.
Electronic Systems posted operating income for the second quarter of $10.4 million, or 11.4% of revenue, versus $9.9 million, or 11.1% of revenue, in the prior year period. The performance reflected lower compensation and benefit costs compared to 2019, but both manufacturing volumes and product mix negatively impacted margins sequentially versus the first quarter of 2020.
Our Structural Systems segment posted revenue of $55.4 million in the second quarter of 2020, versus $91.2 million last year. The year-over-year decrease was due to $45.5 million of lower sales across our commercial aerospace applications, reflecting current demand dynamics, as Steve discussed, partially offset by $9.7 million of higher revenue within the company's military and space markets.
Structural Systems posted operating income for the quarter of $6.2 million, or 11.2% of revenue, and adjusted operating income of $6.8 million, or 12.4% of revenue. This compares to an adjusted operating income of $11.8 million, or 12.9% of revenue, last year. The year-over-year operating margin decline reflected unfavorable manufacturing volumes, partially offset by favorable product mix.
As I finish my update on Structural Systems, I want to briefly mention an incident that occurred subsequent to the close of our second quarter related to our Guaymas, Mexico, performance center. This manufacturing facility is a part of our Structural Systems segment. Our second fiscal quarter ended June 27, 2020. On June 29, 2020, a fire severely damaged the facility, which is comprised of 2 buildings totaling approximately 62,000 square feet. Thankfully, there were no injuries.
However, inventory and property and equipment in this leased facility were damaged. This has historically been a site where we perform secondary operations for a number of our performance centers. In addition, this location has supported our VersaCore product line.
We have insurance coverage for the losses and expect the majority, if not all, of the items will be covered under the policy. We are currently working with our insurance carrier to assess the losses and work through the claims process.
In the near term, we will utilize our contingency plan that incorporates significant redundant manufacturing capabilities, which will allow us to absorb the production that was planned for the Guaymas performance center in several of our other performance centers. We do not expect a material change to the production levels, and we will continue to focus on meeting our customers' needs for these products.
For the remainder of 2020, the adjusted results we will be reporting will exclude our restructure activities and the impact related to the Guaymas fire.
Corporate General and Administrative expense. CG&A expense for the second quarter of 2020 was $6.6 million, or 4.5% of revenue, versus $8.1 million, or 4.5% of revenue, in 2019. This reflects one-time severance charges of $1.7 million in the second quarter of Fiscal 2019.
Turning to liquidity and capital resources, we have available liquidity of $120 million, comprised of $70 million of cash on hand, plus the remaining $50 million on our revolver, at the end of second quarter 2020.
We generated $8.6 million of cash from operations during the second quarter of 2020, compared to $9.7 million during the prior year period. This performance reflected effective working capital management, partially offset by lower net income.
We continue to be in compliance with our debt covenants, and our credit facilities do not mature until 2024 and 2025. As a reminder, our leverage ratio covenant ceiling is 4.75. Our leverage ratio was 3.0 at the end of the second quarter of 2020.
Cash generation and cost management within our efficient operating structure remains our priority, and we expect to generate positive free cash flow for the remainder of 2020.
In terms of capital expenditures, we spent $1.1 million during the second quarter of 2020 and anticipate spending between $12 million and $14 million in 2020. This aligns with our cash conservation initiatives and should result in a capital spending decrease of more than 20% versus 2019. These estimates do not reflect the incremental spending required to replace the manufacturing capabilities damaged in the fire in Guaymas. We expect the majority, if not all, of the spending to be funded from insurance recoveries.
Employee safety is always top of mind, even as we continue to focus on cost management, flexing our performance center production schedules and optimizing working capital as we move forward. Our Q2 performance was the result of a strong resilient effort by all the Ducommun employees, who remain focused on execution and satisfying the customers' demands during this very challenging period.
I'll now turn it back over to Steve for his closing remarks. Steve?"

If you look sequentially, Q1 was sort of a perfect storm in terms of we came into Q1 where we had demand that during that quarter started to get pushed out with Boeing and Spirit, and the pandemic was sort of hitting right there at the end as well. So we had a lot of ripple effect on the costs and being able to absorb as cleanly as we'd like, certainly in Q1. Along with the mix, that put us in a tough spot for the number in Q1, and that's why that margin for Q1 was lower than it had been for several quarters.
And then in Q2, mix changed a little bit. That certainly helped us. But also some of the initiatives and sort of the realignment and flexing that was taking place during Q1, at the end of Q1, and as we got into Q2 helped clear the path for a better performance."

We're fairly conservative with our backlog, and I think that's a good thing. But the other, I think, story here is to break $0.5 billion in defense backlog for the first time is a big deal."

And thanks, everyone, for joining us today for our second quarter conference call.

And thanks, everyone, for joining us today for our second quarter conference call. I also hope that you and your families are healthy and continuing to get through this pandemic as best as possible.
Today, and as usual, I will give an update on the current situation at the company, after which Chris Wampler will review our financials in detail.
The company remains focused, first and foremost, on the health and safety of our employees. The team has done an excellent job, and despite facilities around the country, and quite a few in Southern California, the impact has been mostly zero and the amount of positive cases across the company less than 25. We also continue to remain diligent on communication and ensuring best practices are followed in all facilities to sustain this performance.
Ducommun's second quarter results were strong in light of the unprecedented challenges due to the pandemic in the commercial aerospace markets. As mentioned in our April call, the reasons for the strength is that since 2017 the team has been improving all of our operations, developing and rationalizing the product portfolio, driving new technologies, focusing on providing high value to customers, along with pricing, developing an effective cost structure with a flat organization and making 3 strategic acquisitions. This has been particularly evident in the revenue and order progress over the last few quarters for Ducommun's defense business, along with the overall margin performance for the company.
The company's second quarter revenue was down 18.4% year-over-year, all due to the commercial aerospace markets and in line with our communication and expectations. Ducommun's defense business, however, showed great strength, being up 23% versus prior year. Though not ever wanting to show negative growth, the revenue number is impressive, from not only the virus impact but also overcoming $30 million of 737 MAX headwind in the quarter.
Ducommun's defense business, on the other hand, continues to show excellent progress, with big opportunities ahead. A majority of the gains in defense included increases from our new weapons systems business, Nobles Worldwide, along with the F-35, Patriot missile, CH-53K Heavy-Lift, V-22 Osprey, F-15, F-16 and other industry programs.
Another growth area this year which I mentioned during our last call was Ducommun's new efforts with UAVs. I'm happy today to announce at this time our first major customer in this new area is General Atomics Aeronautical Systems. We are thrilled to be selected as a strategic supplier by GA, providing critical components on the Predator series remotely piloted aircraft, and look forward to many productive years together.
Ducommun also continues to leverage its preferred supplier agreement signed last July with the former Raytheon Missile Systems business, now known as Raytheon Missile and Defense. The TOW missile case, a new structures program with RMS, mentioned in the previous call, is now in full production at our Monrovia, California, performance center.
We have 2 other wins this year for the TOW missile at other Ducommun performance centers in the Midwest, and in total this one program will generate over $30 million of revenue in 2021. These types of wins have allowed us to build a compelling value story and now track record, utilizing Ducommun's full portfolio of products and services as we move further to drive sales gains at Raytheon Technologies and other defense OEMs.
The other real bright spot for the quarter was ending Q2 with a backlog of $505 million for the defense business, which is an all-time record for Ducommun. Total backlog was $831 million for the company, sequentially down from Q1 but still is a great number based on the environment.
The defense business grew year-over-year by 38%, bolstered by strong orders across numerous key defense platforms, which included the TOW missile, previously discussed, GA, weapon systems for ground vehicles, F-18, Patriot, F-35, Aegis and others, as this is part of Ducommun that continues to deliver.
Obviously, this strength helped offset commercial aerospace order pressure.
As in Q1, cost actions have continued with the pandemic and the Q2 737 MAX schedule changes to ensure we have adjusted our costs. You can certainly see the effectiveness of our actions in both the positive gross profit expansion year-over-year and a solid operating income percentage. The team has certainly done a great job moving quickly in managing this difficult environment, with no material pandemic-related costs incurred.
In regards to the Q3 outlook, our significant backlog in defense, due to the many growth programs mentioned earlier, will provide the same strong revenue. However, we see the revenue profile for Q3 the same as Q2: being 16% to 20% down year-over-year. Our comments on the April 30 call were for better sequential revenue in Q3, but this was based at the time of 216 shipments for Spirit Aerosystems in 2020 for the 737 MAX. As we know, this changed later in the quarter, from 216 to 125 and now 72. Therefore, this was the main reason we had to adjust the outlook.
A real bright spot, though, is that we see our operating income margins now between 7% and 8% in the quarter, up 100 basis points more from our comments in April.
As we look to Q4, we estimate that revenue will again be led by defense, but the business, over all, will be down year-over-year by 14% to 18%, again due to commercial aerospace, and operating margins will again be in the same range as Q3, at 7% to 8%.
As you have seen through the first half of the year, the unprecedented challenges with the pandemic, along with $55 million of headwind for the MAX, created an historic challenge for Ducommun and our team. The business, though, has shown great strength due to the many strategic initiatives since 2017 and has clearly made a material difference for the company, our customers and the shareholder.
Ducommun also has a great long-term future. Despite the current challenges, we look forward to a return to revenue growth for the full year in 2021, leveraging our many defense wins, an historic defense backlog, along with benefiting from share gain at Airbus and also a modest level of recovery for some of our commercial OEM customers.
Now let me provide some additional color on our markets, products and programs. Beginning with our military and space sector, we posted second quarter revenue of $94.6 million, once again representing strong growth versus 2019, up 23%. We drove revenues across a broad variety of defense platforms, including nearly every aspect of our product portfolio. As mentioned earlier, we saw increases in demand for our military fixed-wing aircraft programs, with particularly strong shipments for the F-35, F-15 and F-16 as well as top line expansion for helicopters such as the CH-53K and the V-22.
In addition, the Patriot missile system rose again this quarter. We can see significant growth across many military and space applications, going forward.
We also had significant growth on a number of ground vehicle programs, such as the Clouded Leopard.
The second quarter military and space revenue represented 64% of Ducommun's revenue in the period. We also continue to be very well positioned for further growth across our defense platforms over the next several quarters in all sectors and, again, ended the second quarter with an all-time record-high backlog. This was up an impressive 38% year-over-year, representing over 60% of Ducommun's backlog at the end of Q2.
Within our commercial aerospace operations, second quarter revenue declined year-over-year to $40.4 million, as expected, driven by build rate declines on the 737 MAX as well as many other programs impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Ducommun, as stated earlier, has effectively adjusted costs and managed the downturn and is well positioned once rates stabilize and increase over the long term.
Ducommun's expansion with Airbus since 2017 is clearly going to be a benefit as we move forward and puts important balance in our portfolio for the future.
The backlog within our commercial aerospace sector stands at roughly $307 million at the end of the second quarter, with a majority of the decline attributed to the 737 MAX program.
With that, I'll have Chris review our financial results. Chris?"
267761,677124913,2053202,"Ducommun Incorporated, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2020",2020-07-30,"Earnings Calls","Ducommun Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. As a reminder, when it shows up on the SEC website, you can see the company's filing, along with the Q2 earnings release that is already out there, for a further description of information mentioned on today",1400,"Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. As a reminder, when it shows up on the SEC website, you can see the company's filing, along with the Q2 earnings release that is already out there, for a further description of information mentioned on today's call.
As Steve discussed, we were pleased with our overall second quarter results, particularly during a global pandemic that has severely impacted commercial and aircraft demand. We remain confident that our ability to flex production at our performance centers while leveraging ongoing strong demand within the military and defense sector will serve us well, going forward.
Now I'll move to the details of our overall results. Review of the second quarter 2020. Revenue for the second quarter of 2020 was $147.3 million, versus $180.5 million in the second quarter of 2019. The performance reflected $17.4 million of higher sales within the military and space sector, offset by $51.6 million of lower revenue from our commercial aerospace customers. As Steve discussed, nearly all of our commercial platforms have been negatively impacted by lower demand due to COVID-19.
Ducommun's overall backlog at the end of the second quarter was approximately $831 million. Growth in the military and space sector continues to drive a sustained solid base of business. As a reminder, we define backlog as a potential revenue based on customer purchase orders and long-term agreements, with firm fixed prices and expected delivery dates of 24 months or less.
We posted strong gross margins for the quarter, as gross margins rose to 22.2%, from 21.1% in the prior year's comparable period. The increase year-over-year was due to favorable product mix and lower compensation of benefit costs.
Gross profit fell to $32.7 million, from $38.1 million last year, due to the lower commercial aerospace revenue. We continue to focus on execution and sustaining margins and, where possible, expanding margins even as overall manufacturing volumes remain under pressure.
SG&A was $22 million in the quarter, versus $24.5 million last year, as the prior year included $1.7 million of onetime severance expense and execution of current year cost control initiatives.
The company reported operating income for the second quarter of $10 million, or 6.8% of revenue, and adjusted operating income of $10.7 million, or 7.3%. This compares to an adjusted operating income of $13.6 million, or 7.5% of revenue, in the prior year period. The year-over-year decline was due to lower revenue, partially offset by higher gross margin and lower SG&A expense.
Interest expense was $3.7 million in the second quarter of 2020, versus $4.4 million in the prior year period, reflecting the favorable impact from lower interest rates which more than offset higher debt levels. The increased debt outstanding was primarily due to funding the company's acquisition of Nobles in October 2019, along with drawing down $50 million on our revolver, which remained as cash on hand at the end of the second quarter 2020.
The company reported net income for the second quarter of $5.1 million, or $0.43 per diluted share, and an adjusted net income of $5.6 million, or $0.48 per diluted share. This compares to an adjusted net income of $7.8 million, or $0.66 per diluted share, for the second quarter of 2019. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to lower revenue, as noted earlier.
Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2020 was $20.3 million, or 13.8% of revenue, compared to $22.4 million, or 12.4% of revenue, for the comparable period in 2019.
Now let me turn to our segment results. Our Electronic Systems segment posted revenue of $92 million in the second quarter of 2020, versus $89.3 million in the prior year period. These results reflect a $7.7 million increase in sales to the company's military and space customers, partially offset by $6 million of lower revenue across the commercial aerospace platforms.
Electronic Systems posted operating income for the second quarter of $10.4 million, or 11.4% of revenue, versus $9.9 million, or 11.1% of revenue, in the prior year period. The performance reflected lower compensation and benefit costs compared to 2019, but both manufacturing volumes and product mix negatively impacted margins sequentially versus the first quarter of 2020.
Our Structural Systems segment posted revenue of $55.4 million in the second quarter of 2020, versus $91.2 million last year. The year-over-year decrease was due to $45.5 million of lower sales across our commercial aerospace applications, reflecting current demand dynamics, as Steve discussed, partially offset by $9.7 million of higher revenue within the company's military and space markets.
Structural Systems posted operating income for the quarter of $6.2 million, or 11.2% of revenue, and adjusted operating income of $6.8 million, or 12.4% of revenue. This compares to an adjusted operating income of $11.8 million, or 12.9% of revenue, last year. The year-over-year operating margin decline reflected unfavorable manufacturing volumes, partially offset by favorable product mix.
As I finish my update on Structural Systems, I want to briefly mention an incident that occurred subsequent to the close of our second quarter related to our Guaymas, Mexico, performance center. This manufacturing facility is a part of our Structural Systems segment. Our second fiscal quarter ended June 27, 2020. On June 29, 2020, a fire severely damaged the facility, which is comprised of 2 buildings totaling approximately 62,000 square feet. Thankfully, there were no injuries.
However, inventory and property and equipment in this leased facility were damaged. This has historically been a site where we perform secondary operations for a number of our performance centers. In addition, this location has supported our VersaCore product line.
We have insurance coverage for the losses and expect the majority, if not all, of the items will be covered under the policy. We are currently working with our insurance carrier to assess the losses and work through the claims process.
In the near term, we will utilize our contingency plan that incorporates significant redundant manufacturing capabilities, which will allow us to absorb the production that was planned for the Guaymas performance center in several of our other performance centers. We do not expect a material change to the production levels, and we will continue to focus on meeting our customers' needs for these products.
For the remainder of 2020, the adjusted results we will be reporting will exclude our restructure activities and the impact related to the Guaymas fire.
Corporate General and Administrative expense. CG&A expense for the second quarter of 2020 was $6.6 million, or 4.5% of revenue, versus $8.1 million, or 4.5% of revenue, in 2019. This reflects onetime severance charges of $1.7 million in the second quarter of Fiscal 2019.
Turning to liquidity and capital resources, we have available liquidity of $120 million, comprised of $70 million of cash on hand, plus the remaining $50 million on our revolver, at the end of second quarter 2020.
We generated $8.6 million of cash from operations during the second quarter of 2020, compared to $9.7 million during the prior year period. This performance reflected effective working capital management, partially offset by lower net income.
We continue to be in compliance with our debt covenants, and our credit facilities do not mature until 2024 and 2025. As a reminder, our leverage ratio covenant ceiling is 4.75. Our leverage ratio was 3.0 at the end of the second quarter of 2020.
Cash generation and cost management within our efficient operating structure remains our priority, and we expect to generate positive free cash flow for the remainder of 2020.
In terms of capital expenditures, we spent $1.1 million during the second quarter of 2020 and anticipate spending between $12 million and $14 million in 2020. This aligns with our cash conservation initiatives and should result in a capital spending decrease of more than 20% versus 2019. These estimates do not reflect the incremental spending required to replace the manufacturing capabilities damaged in the fire in Guaymas. We expect the majority, if not all, of the spending to be funded from insurance recoveries.
Employee safety is always top of mind, even as we continue to focus on cost management, flexing our performance center production schedules and optimizing working capital as we move forward. Our Q2 performance was the result of a strong resilient effort by all the Ducommun employees, who remain focused on execution and satisfying the customers' demands during this very challenging period.
I'll now turn it back over to Steve for his closing remarks. Steve?"

If you look sequentially, Q1 was sort of a perfect storm in terms of we came into Q1 where we had demand that during that quarter started to get pushed out with Boeing and Spirit, and the pandemic was sort of hitting right there at the end as well. So we had a lot of ripple effect on the costs and being able to absorb as cleanly as we'd like, certainly in Q1. Along with the mix, that put us in a tough spot for the number in Q1, and that's why that margin for Q1 was lower than it had been for several quarters.
And then in Q2, mix changed a little bit. That certainly helped us. But also some of the initiatives and sort of the realignment and flexing that was taking place during Q1, at the end of Q1, and as we got into Q2 helped clear the path for a better performance."

As in the second quarter call, I hope that you and your families are healthy and continuing to get through this pandemic as best as possible. 
Today, as you know, I will give an update of the current situation at the company, after which, Chris Wampler will review our financials in detail. The company remains focused first and foremost on the health and safety of our employees. The team has done an excellent job with the safety protocols put in place since March, We continue to work with authorities on best practices. The amount of cases is also less than 55 year-to-date, and we remain diligent on communication with weekly updates through our human resources team. 
As mentioned in the press release, Ducommun's third quarter results really shined despite the continued unprecedented challenges due to the pandemic in the commercial aerospace markets. All the actions, initiatives and hard work since we began this journey in 2017, have shown in the strong operating results for Q3. 
Our defense business again was the real star, along with cost reductions, having the right product portfolio, operational leadership and leveraging the Ducommun operating model of lean and highly focused performance centers. This was particularly evident as well in the margin expansion for gross profit, operating income and EBITDA despite year-over-year headwind from commercial aerospace. 
The quality of earnings, too, was very high with the company reaching $0.69 per share on an adjusted basis, almost flat to 2019 and despite overall revenue being down 17% from Q3 last year. It is a great story for our investors and as mentioned in our Q2 call, we see a return to revenue growth in 2021 and very good years ahead in 2022 and 2023. 
As mentioned, the company's third quarter revenue was down 17% year-over-year, all due to the commercial aerospace markets and on the low end of our expectation communicated in the last earnings call of being down 16% to 20%. Ducommun's defense business, however, showed great strength being up 41% versus prior year. Though not ever wanting to show negative growth, the revenue number is impressive for not only the pandemic impact, but also overcoming another $30 million of 737 MAX headwind in the quarter. 
Ducommun's defense business continues to show excellent progress with big opportunities ahead. The majority of the game defense included radar systems for Northrop Grumman, increases for our new weapon systems business Nobles Worldwide, along with ViaSat, the Patriot, UAVs at General Atomics, the F-15 and the tow program. I mentioned in our last call about Ducommun's new efforts with UAVs. 
Again, we are thrilled to be a strategic partner with GA, anticipate our first month of over $1 million in revenue in December, with 2021 bringing higher and higher levels of volume. Ducommun's missile program for the Raytheon Missiles and Defense business, mentioned in previous calls, is now in full production at Monrovia, California for the case and at other Ducommun sites, which are providing electronic products. 
As we move forward in time, we see greater and greater value for customers when we leverage both our structure and electronic systems product lines, providing a one-company approach for defense primes. We're on track for over $35 million in revenue in 2021 for this program alone, an increase from $12 million in revenue this year. This partnering across the company at this type of revenue level is something new at to common, and we are excited to see this progress. Also, as you see in the 10-Q, Northrop Grumman was the #2 customer in the quarter for the first time in our history. 
NG is a key part of the Ducommun's defense growth strategy, and we continue to expand our business with them supporting F-35 projects, major radar programs and structural applications. I've mentioned in the past, a key theme for the company is account share opportunities for Ducommun at defense fracs other than Raytheon. And ENGIE is a great example. We're just getting started, and the company sees lots of new areas to develop within the defense markets. 
The other bright spot for the quarter was ending Q3 with a backlog of $506 million for the defense business, which is another all-time record for Ducommun. The total backlog was $796 million for the company sequential down from Q2, but still is a great number based on the environment. Defense business grew year-over-year by 36% and in bookings bolstered by strong orders across numerous key defense platforms, which include the F-18, as mentioned previously, the tow missile, UAVs, F-35, Aegis, weapon systems for Round Vehicles and Nobles and others, and this part of Ducommun continues to deliver. Obviously, the strength helped offset commercial aerospace order pressure. 
As in Q2, cost actions have continued in Q3. You can certainly see the effectiveness of our actions in the positive growth profit margin expansion year-over-year and a solid operating income percentage along with EPS. The team has certainly done a great job in 2020 moving quickly and managing this difficult environment with no material pandemic-related costs incurred or major restructuring. 
In regards to the Q4 outlook, our significant backlog in defense with the many growth programs mentioned earlier, will provide the same strong revenue. We estimate that revenue will again be led by defense, but the business overall as mentioned in the Q2 call, will be down year-over-year by 14% to 18% due to commercial aerospace. Adjusted operating margins outlook will now be above 8% in Q4, which is an improvement from the previous call in Q2 of the outlook of 7% to 8%. 
Ducommun also has a great long-term future, and we look forward, as mentioned earlier, to return to revenue growth for the full year in 2020 alone, along with very good years in 2022 and 2023. This will be accomplished by leveraging our new built-out defense portfolio, which is currently over 90 programs. Ducommun's strong position in commercial aerospace, especially on narrow-body with a better than 2:1 ratio with wide-bodies, share gain at Airbus, our Engineered Products portfolio and the recent acquisitions. 
We're also actively in the market for M&A. And with our track record, these past 3 years, I believe it will only be an accelerator to higher results in the future. 
Now let me provide some additional color on our markets, products and programs. Beginning with our military and space sector, we posted third quarter revenue of $113.9 million. Once again, representing strong growth versus 2019, up 41%. We drove revenue across a broad range of defense platforms for nearly every aspect of our product portfolio. 
As mentioned earlier, we saw increases in demand for our military fixed-wing aircraft programs with particularly strong revenue, as mentioned earlier, from Northrop Grumman, Nobles Worldwide, Viasat, Patriot, GA, F-15 and the TOW missile. The third quarter military and space revenue represented 76% of Ducommun's revenue in the period. We also continue to be very well positioned for further growth across our defense platforms over the next several quarters in all sectors. And again, ended the third quarter with an all-time record high backlog of $506 million, which is up an impressive 36% year-over-year, and that represents 60% of the common overall backlog. 
Within our commercial aerospace operations, third quarter revenue declined year-over-year to $26 million, as expected, driven by build rate declines on the 737 MAX as well as many other programs impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Ducommun also has effectively adjusted costs and manage the downturn and is well positioned once rates stabilize and increase over the long term. Ducommun's expansion with Airbus since 2017 is clearly going to be a benefit in the future and puts important balance in our portfolio. 
The backlog within commercial aerospace sector stands at roughly $269 million at the end of the third quarter. The majority of the decline obviously is due to the 737 MAX program. 
With that, I'll have Chris review our financial results in detail. Chris?"

As a reminder, please see the company's filings and Q3 earnings release for a further description of information mentioned on today's call. As Steve discussed, we are pleased with our third quarter results",1252,"Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. As a reminder, please see the company's filings and Q3 earnings release for a further description of information mentioned on today's call. 
As Steve discussed, we are pleased with our third quarter results as they once again reflect the strength and diversity of our business, even as we continue to navigate the impacts of the ongoing pandemic. We remain confident in our ability to continue to provide strong returns for our shareholders through these challenging times. Now I'll move on to the details of our overall results. 
Revenue for the third quarter of 2020 was $150.4 million versus $181.1 million in the third quarter of 2019. This performance reflected $33.4 million of higher sales within the military and space sector, offset by $62.9 million of lower revenue from our commercial aerospace customers. 
As Steve mentioned, nearly all of our commercial platforms saw year-over-year declines due to the economic impact of COVID-19 on our customers, continued grounding of the 737 MAX and a decrease in air travel in general. Ducommun's overall backlog at the end of the third quarter, was approximately $796 million. Our military and space backlog is at an all-time high of $506 million. As a reminder, we define backlog as potential revenue based on customer purchase orders and long-term agreements, with firm fixed prices and expected delivery dates of 24 months or less. 
We posted strong gross profit for the quarter as gross margins rose to 22.3% from 21.2% in the prior year's comparable period. The increase year-over-year was primarily due to favorable product mix and reduced discretionary spending, along with all -- was partially offset by unfavorable manufacturing volume. 
Total gross profit fell to $33.5 million from $38.3 million last year as a result of lower commercial revenue. Despite the top line headwind from COVID-19 and the related issues impacting domestic travel, we've continued to drive margin expansion. 
SG&A was $22.1 million in the third quarter versus $23.7 million last year, reflecting our ongoing cost control savings, as Steve discussed. The company reported operating income for the third quarter of $10.3 million or 6.8% of revenue and adjusted operating income of $12.4 million or 8.2% of revenue compared to $14.6 million or 8.1% of revenue in the prior year period. The year-over-year decline in operating income dollars was due to lower revenue, partially offset by higher gross margins and lower SG&A. 
Interest expense was $3.1 million in the third quarter of 2020 versus $4.4 million in the prior year period as lower interest rates more than offset the impact from higher debt levels. As a reminder, our interest expense has been favorably impacted by the credit refinancing we did in Q4 of 2019, as the Term Loan A was added, along with the replacement of our revolving credit line of credit, lowered our overall rate interest rate exposure. The increased debt outstanding was primarily due to funding the company's acquisition of Nobles in October 2019, and that we drew down $50 million in Q1 to have cash on hand during the pandemic. 
The company reported net income for the third quarter of $6.5 million or $0.54 per diluted share and adjusted net income of $8.3 million or $0.69 per diluted share compared to net income of $8.3 million or $0.70 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2019. Our adjusted net income gives effect for the impact of our restructure activities and our Guaymas fire-related expenses. The similar adjusted EPS year-over-year exhibits a strong quality of earnings as we expanded gross margins, expanded adjusted operating margins and incurred lower interest expense in the third quarter compared to the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $21.6 million or 14.4% of revenue compared to $23.6 million or 13.1% of revenue for the comparable period in 2019. 
Now let me turn to the segment results. Our Electronic Systems segment posted revenue of $103.5 million in the third quarter of 2020 versus $90.6 million in the prior year period. These results reflect a $23.1 million increase in sales to the company's military and space customers, partially offset by $9 million of lower revenue across our commercial aerospace platforms. Electronic Systems posted operating income for the third quarter of $14.9 million or 14.4% of revenue versus $9.7 million or 10.7% of revenue in the prior year period. The strong performance reflects favorable volume, improved product mix along with robust cost controls. 
Our Structural Systems segment posted revenue of $46.9 million in the third quarter of 2020 versus $90.5 million last year. The year-over-year decrease was due to $53.9 million of lower sales across commercial aerospace applications reflecting current demand dynamics, as Steve discussed, partially offset by $10.3 million of higher revenue within the company's military and space markets. 
Structural Systems posted operating income for the quarter of $1.8 million or 3.8% of revenue compared to $12.9 million or 14.2% of revenue last year. The year-over-year operating margin decline reflects unfavorable manufacturing volumes and $1.8 million of aggregate expenses tied to the restructuring activities and the Guaymas facility fire, without which adjusted operating margin was 7.7% in the third quarter of 2020. 
Corporate, general and administrative expense. CG&A expenses for the third quarter of 2020 were $6.4 million or 4.2% of revenue versus $7.9 million or 4.4% of revenue in 2019. The decrease in CG&A expense was mainly due to lower professional service fees of $1.1 million. 
Turning to liquidity and capital resources. We have available liquidity of $125 million comprised of $75 million of cash on hand plus the remaining $50 million on our revolver at the end of the third quarter of 2020. We generated $4.9 million of cash from operations during the third quarter of 2020 compared with $12 million during the prior year period. This performance reflected working capital investment to support customer demand and lower net income. 
We continue to be in compliance with our debt covenants and our credit facilities do not mature until 2024 and 2025. As a reminder, our leverage ratio covenant ceiling is 4.75. Our leverage ratio was roughly 2.9 at the end of the third quarter of 2020, cash generation and cash management within our already efficient operating structure remains a top priority, and we expect to generate positive free cash flow in Q4. In terms of capital expenditures, we spent $3.2 million during the third quarter and anticipate spending between $12 million to $14 million in 2020. This estimate does not include the capital expenditures for Guaymas as we replace the capability destroyed in the fire in June of this year. We expect the related insurance proceeds will support these reinvestment requirements. In alignment with our cash conservation initiatives, this anticipated level will result in a capital spending decrease of more than 20% versus 2019. 
Our year-to-date effective rate of income tax expense is roughly 15% as of the third quarter. For the full year of 2020, we expect an effective rate of approximately 10%. We anticipate having a significant release of FIN 48 reserves during the fourth quarter that will significantly reduce our fourth quarter tax expense. 
With employee safety top of mind, we continue to also focus on execution to drive strong and resilient performance as we satisfy customer demand. We anticipate that our electronic and structural applications on a multitude of key platforms spanning both commercial and military end markets will continue to serve us well. 
I'll now turn it back over to Steve for his closing remarks. Steve?"

Well, we're certainly proud of these results this quarter and the overall track record of performance in 2017. We continue to meet our commitments. As mentioned, plan to start to growing the business again next year. I would add as well that we do have the right footprint, operating system, cost structure, discipline and leadership to continue performing in the face of this current crisis and feel very confident in our future. 
I'm also pleased to announce at this time that Ducommun will have an investor meeting, our second, during the first half of next year. We look forward to sharing the exciting things ahead in 2021 and subsequent years to many stakeholders, and we will be following up. 
As in the Q2 call, I also want to thank our customers, shareholders and all of our business partners for their continued support as we work through these difficult times together. We have now given out as well more than $1.1 million from the newly formed Ducommun foundation start last year to the local area of charities where we operate to help our neighbors and communities. In Q3, we have partnered 2 with 3 new organizations to help improve equality in our nation and assist small business recovery due to the social unrest in Los Angeles. 
In closing, I'd like to again this quarter take this time to thank as well Ducommun employees. I'm proud of them and all their efforts dealing with the many challenges from the pandemic. Our team shows up at the operation every day and though stressful gets the job done with excellent results for our customers and nation. 
And with that, I will turn it over for questions."

Today",1337,"Well, thank you, Chris, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today for our third quarter conference call. As in the second quarter call, I hope that you and your families are healthy and continuing to get through this pandemic as best as possible. 
Today, as you know, I will give an update of the current situation at the company, after which, Chris Wampler will review our financials in detail. The company remains focused first and foremost on the health and safety of our employees. The team has done an excellent job with the safety protocols put in place since March. We continue to work with authorities on best practices. The amount of cases is also less than 55 year-to-date, and we remain diligent on communication with weekly updates through our human resources team. 
As mentioned in the press release, Ducommun's third quarter results really shined despite the continued unprecedented challenges due to the pandemic in the commercial aerospace markets. All the actions, initiatives and hard work since we began this journey in 2017 have shown in the strong operating results for Q3. 
Our defense business again was the real star, along with cost reductions, having the right product portfolio, operational leadership and leveraging the Ducommun operating model of lean and highly focused performance centers. This was particularly evident as well in the margin expansion for gross profit, operating income and EBITDA despite year-over-year headwind from commercial aerospace. 
The quality of earnings, too, was very high with the company reaching $0.69 per share on an adjusted basis, almost flat to 2019, despite overall revenue being down 17% from Q3 last year. It is a great story for our investors and, as mentioned in our Q2 call, we see a return to revenue growth in 2021 and very good years ahead in 2022 and 2023. 
As mentioned, the company's third quarter revenue was down 17% year-over-year, all due to the commercial aerospace markets and on the low end of our expectation communicated in the last earnings call of being down 16% to 20%. Ducommun's defense business, however, showed great strength being up 41% versus prior year. Though not ever wanting to show negative growth, the revenue number is impressive for not only the pandemic impact, but also overcoming another $30 million of 737 MAX headwind in the quarter. 
Ducommun's defense business continues to show excellent progress with big opportunities ahead. The majority of the gains in defense included radar systems for Northrop Grumman, increases for our new weapon systems business, Nobles Worldwide, along with ViaSat, the Patriot, UAVs at General Atomics, the F-15 and the TOW program. I mentioned in our last call about Ducommun's new efforts with UAVs. 
Again, we are thrilled to be a strategic partner with GA, anticipate our first month of over $1 million in revenue in December, with 2021 bringing higher and higher levels of volume. The TOW missile program for the Raytheon Missiles and Defense business mentioned in previous calls is now in full production at Monrovia, California for the case and at other Ducommun sites which are providing electronic products. 
As we move forward in time, we see greater and greater value for customers when we leverage both our structure and electronic systems product lines, providing a one-company approach for defense Primes. We're on track for over $35 million in revenue in 2021 for this program alone, an increase from $12 million in revenue this year. This partnering across the company at this type of revenue level is something new at Ducommun, and we are excited to see this progress. Also, as you see in the 10-Q, Northrop Grumman was the #2 customer in the quarter for the first time in our history. 
NG is a key part of Ducommun's defense growth strategy, and we continue to expand our business with them supporting F-35 projects, major radar programs and structural applications. I've mentioned in the past, a key theme for the company is account share opportunities for Ducommun at defense Primes other than Raytheon. And NG is a great example. We're just getting started, and the company sees lots of new areas to develop within the defense markets. 
The other bright spot for the quarter was ending Q3 with a backlog of $506 million for the defense business, which is another all-time record for Ducommun. The total backlog was $796 million for the company, sequentially down from Q2 but still is a great number based on the environment. Defense business grew year-over-year by 36% in bookings bolstered by strong orders across numerous key defense platforms, which include the F-18, as mentioned previously, the TOW missile, UAVs, F-35, Aegis, weapon systems for ground vehicles at Nobles and others, and this part of Ducommun continues to deliver. Obviously, the strength helped offset commercial aerospace order pressure. 
As in Q2, cost actions have continued in Q3. You can certainly see the effectiveness of our actions and the positive growth profit margin expansion year-over-year and a solid operating income percentage along with EPS. The team has certainly done a great job in 2020 moving quickly and managing this difficult environment with no material pandemic-related costs incurred or major restructuring. 
In regards to the Q4 outlook, our significant backlog in defense with the many growth programs mentioned earlier will provide the same strong revenue. We estimate that revenue will again be led by defense, but the business overall, as mentioned in the Q2 call, will be down year-over-year by 14% to 18% due to commercial aerospace. Adjusted operating margins outlook will now be above 8% in Q4, which is an improvement from the previous call in Q2 of the outlook of 7% to 8%. 
Ducommun also has a great long-term future, and we look forward, as mentioned earlier, to return to revenue growth for the full year in 2020 alone, along with very good years in 2022 and 2023. This will be accomplished by leveraging our new built-out defense portfolio, which is currently over 90 programs. Ducommun's strong position in commercial aerospace, especially on narrow-body with a better than 2:1 ratio with wide-bodies, share gain at Airbus, our Engineered Products portfolio and the recent acquisitions. 
We're also actively in the market for M&A. And with our track record these past 3 years, I believe it will only be an accelerator to higher results in the future. 
Now let me provide some additional color on our markets, products and programs. Beginning with our military and space sector, we posted third quarter revenue of $113.9 million. Once again, representing strong growth versus 2019, up 41%. We drove revenue across a broad variety of defense platforms for nearly every aspect of our product portfolio. 
As mentioned earlier, we saw increases in demand for our military fixed-wing aircraft programs with particularly strong revenue, as mentioned earlier, from Northrop Grumman, Nobles Worldwide, ViaSat, Patriot, GA, F-15 and the TOW missile. The third quarter military and space revenue represented 76% of Ducommun's revenue in the period. We also continue to be very well positioned for further growth across our defense platforms over the next several quarters in all sectors. And again, ended the third quarter with an all-time record high backlog of $506 million, which is up an impressive 36% year-over-year, and that represents 6% of Ducommun's overall backlog. 
Within our commercial aerospace operations, third quarter revenue declined year-over-year to $26 million, as expected, driven by build rate declines on the 737 MAX as well as many other programs impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Ducommun also has effectively adjusted costs and managed the downturn and is well positioned once rates stabilize and increase over the long term. Ducommun's expansion with Airbus since 2017 is clearly going to be a benefit in the future and puts important balance in our portfolio. 
The backlog within commercial aerospace sector stands at roughly $269 million at the end of the third quarter. The majority of the decline, obviously, is due to the 737 MAX program. 
With that, I'll have Chris review our financial results in detail. Chris?"
267761,691491271,2121350,"Ducommun Incorporated, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2020",2020-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Ducommun Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. As a reminder, please see the company's filings and Q3 earnings release for a further description of information mentioned on today's call. As Steve discussed, we are pleased with our third quarter results",1252,"Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. As a reminder, please see the company's filings and Q3 earnings release for a further description of information mentioned on today's call. 
As Steve discussed, we are pleased with our third quarter results as they once again reflect the strength and diversity of our business, even as we continue to navigate the impacts of the ongoing pandemic. We remain confident in our ability to continue to provide strong returns for our shareholders through these challenging times. Now I'll move on to the details of our overall results. 
Revenue for the third quarter of 2020 was $150.4 million versus $181.1 million in the third quarter of 2019. This performance reflected $33.4 million of higher sales within the military and space sector, offset by $62.9 million of lower revenue from our commercial aerospace customers. 
As Steve mentioned, nearly all of our commercial platforms saw year-over-year declines due to the economic impact of COVID-19 on our customers, continued grounding of the 737 MAX and a decrease in air travel in general. Ducommun's overall backlog at the end of the third quarter was approximately $796 million. Our military and space backlog is at an all-time high of $506 million. As a reminder, we define backlog as potential revenue based on customer purchase orders and long-term agreements, with firm fixed prices and expected delivery dates of 24 months or less. 
We posted strong gross profit for the quarter as gross margins rose to 22.3% from 21.2% in the prior year's comparable period. The increase year-over-year was primarily due to favorable product mix and reduced discretionary spending, along with -- it was partially offset by unfavorable manufacturing volume. 
Total gross profit fell to $33.5 million from $38.3 million last year as a result of lower commercial revenue. Despite the top line headwind from COVID-19 and the related issues impacting domestic travel, we've continued to drive margin expansion. 
SG&A was $22.1 million in the third quarter versus $23.7 million last year, reflecting our ongoing cost control savings, as Steve discussed. The company reported operating income for the third quarter of $10.3 million or 6.8% of revenue and adjusted operating income of $12.4 million or 8.2% of revenue compared to $14.6 million or 8.1% of revenue in the prior year period. The year-over-year decline in operating income dollars was due to lower revenue, partially offset by higher gross margins and lower SG&A. 
Interest expense was $3.1 million in the third quarter of 2020 versus $4.4 million in the prior year period as lower interest rates more than offset the impact from higher debt levels. As a reminder, our interest expense has been favorably impacted by the credit refinancing we did in Q4 of 2019, as the Term Loan A was added, along with the replacement of our revolving credit line of credit, lowered our overall rate interest rate exposure. The increased debt outstanding was primarily due to funding the company's acquisition of Nobles in October 2019, and that we drew down $50 million in Q1 to have cash on hand during the pandemic. 
The company reported net income for the third quarter of $6.5 million or $0.54 per diluted share and adjusted net income of $8.3 million or $0.69 per diluted share compared to net income of $8.3 million or $0.70 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2019. Our adjusted net income gives effect for the impact of our restructure activities and our Guaymas fire-related expenses. The similar adjusted EPS year-over-year exhibits a strong quality of earnings as we expanded gross margins, expanded adjusted operating margins and incurred lower interest expense in the third quarter compared to the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $21.6 million or 14.4% of revenue compared to $23.6 million or 13.1% of revenue for the comparable period in 2019. 
Now let me turn to the segment results. Our Electronic Systems segment posted revenue of $103.5 million in the third quarter of 2020 versus $90.6 million in the prior year period. These results reflect a $23.1 million increase in sales to the company's military and space customers, partially offset by $9 million of lower revenue across our commercial aerospace platforms. Electronic Systems posted operating income for the third quarter of $14.9 million or 14.4% of revenue versus $9.7 million or 10.7% of revenue in the prior year period. The strong performance reflects favorable volume, improved product mix along with robust cost controls. 
Our Structural Systems segment posted revenue of $46.9 million in the third quarter of 2020 versus $90.5 million last year. The year-over-year decrease was due to $53.9 million of lower sales across commercial aerospace applications reflecting current demand dynamics, as Steve discussed, partially offset by $10.3 million of higher revenue within the company's military and space markets. 
Structural Systems posted operating income for the quarter of $1.8 million or 3.8% of revenue compared to $12.9 million or 14.2% of revenue last year. The year-over-year operating margin decline reflects unfavorable manufacturing volumes and $1.8 million of aggregate expenses tied to the restructuring activities and the Guaymas facility fire, without which adjusted operating margin was 7.7% in the third quarter of 2020. 
Corporate, general and administrative expense. CG&A expenses for the third quarter of 2020 were $6.4 million or 4.2% of revenue versus $7.9 million or 4.4% of revenue in 2019. The decrease in CG&A expense was mainly due to lower professional service fees of $1.1 million. 
Turning to liquidity and capital resources. We have available liquidity of $125 million comprised of $75 million of cash on hand plus the remaining $50 million on our revolver at the end of the third quarter of 2020. We generated $4.9 million of cash from operations during the third quarter of 2020 compared with $12 million during the prior year period. This performance reflected working capital investment to support customer demand and lower net income. 
We continue to be in compliance with our debt covenants, and our credit facilities do not mature until 2024 and 2025. As a reminder, our leverage ratio covenant ceiling is 4.75. Our leverage ratio was roughly 2.9 at the end of the third quarter of 2020. Cash generation and cash management within our already efficient operating structure remains a top priority, and we expect to generate positive free cash flow in Q4. 
In terms of capital expenditures, we spent $3.2 million during the third quarter and anticipate spending between $12 million to $14 million in 2020. This estimate does not include the capital expenditures for Guaymas as we replace the capability destroyed in the fire in June of this year. We expect the related insurance proceeds will support these reinvestment requirements. In alignment with our cash conservation initiatives, this anticipated level will result in a capital spending decrease of more than 20% versus 2019. 
Our year-to-date effective rate of income tax expense is roughly 15% as of the third quarter. For the full year of 2020, we expect an effective rate of approximately 10%. We anticipate having a significant release of FIN 48 reserves during the fourth quarter that will significantly reduce our fourth quarter tax expense. 
With employee safety top of mind, we continue to also focus on execution to drive strong and resilient performance as we satisfy customer demand. We anticipate that our electronic and structural applications on a multitude of key platforms spanning both commercial and military end markets will continue to serve us well. 
I'll now turn it back over to Steve for his closing remarks. Steve?"

As in the second quarter call, I hope that you and your families are healthy and continuing to get through this pandemic as best as possible. Today",1337,"Well, thank you, Chris, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today for our third quarter conference call. As in the second quarter call, I hope that you and your families are healthy and continuing to get through this pandemic as best as possible. 
Today, as you know, I will give an update of the current situation at the company, after which, Chris Wampler will review our financials in detail. The company remains focused first and foremost on the health and safety of our employees. The team has done an excellent job with the safety protocols put in place since March. We continue to work with authorities on best practices. The amount of cases is also less than 55 year-to-date, and we remain diligent on communication with weekly updates through our human resources team. 
As mentioned in the press release, Ducommun's third quarter results really shined despite the continued unprecedented challenges due to the pandemic in the commercial aerospace markets. All the actions, initiatives and hard work since we began this journey in 2017 have shown in the strong operating results for Q3. 
Our defense business again was the real star, along with cost reductions, having the right product portfolio, operational leadership and leveraging the Ducommun operating model of lean and highly focused performance centers. This was particularly evident as well in the margin expansion for gross profit, operating income and EBITDA despite year-over-year headwind from commercial aerospace. 
The quality of earnings, too, was very high with the company reaching $0.69 per share on an adjusted basis, almost flat to 2019, despite overall revenue being down 17% from Q3 last year. It is a great story for our investors and, as mentioned in our Q2 call, we see a return to revenue growth in 2021 and very good years ahead in 2022 and 2023. 
As mentioned, the company's third quarter revenue was down 17% year-over-year, all due to the commercial aerospace markets and on the low end of our expectation communicated in the last earnings call of being down 16% to 20%. Ducommun's defense business, however, showed great strength being up 41% versus prior year. Though not ever wanting to show negative growth, the revenue number is impressive for not only the pandemic impact, but also overcoming another $30 million of 737 MAX headwind in the quarter. 
Ducommun's defense business continues to show excellent progress with big opportunities ahead. The majority of the gains in defense included radar systems for Northrop Grumman, increases for our new weapon systems business, Nobles Worldwide, along with ViaSat, the Patriot, UAVs at General Atomics, the F-15 and the TOW program. I mentioned in our last call about Ducommun's new efforts with UAVs. 
Again, we are thrilled to be a strategic partner with GA, anticipate our first month of over $1 million in revenue in December, with 2021 bringing higher and higher levels of volume. The TOW missile program for the Raytheon Missiles and Defense business mentioned in previous calls is now in full production at Monrovia, California for the case and at other Ducommun sites which are providing electronic products. 
As we move forward in time, we see greater and greater value for customers when we leverage both our structure and electronic systems product lines, providing a one-company approach for defense Primes. We're on track for over $35 million in revenue in 2021 for this program alone, an increase from $12 million in revenue this year. This partnering across the company at this type of revenue level is something new at Ducommun, and we are excited to see this progress. Also, as you see in the 10-Q, Northrop Grumman was the #2 customer in the quarter for the first time in our history. 
NG is a key part of Ducommun's defense growth strategy, and we continue to expand our business with them supporting F-35 projects, major radar programs and structural applications. I've mentioned in the past, a key theme for the company is account share opportunities for Ducommun at defense Primes other than Raytheon. And NG is a great example. We're just getting started, and the company sees lots of new areas to develop within the defense markets. 
The other bright spot for the quarter was ending Q3 with a backlog of $506 million for the defense business, which is another all-time record for Ducommun. The total backlog was $796 million for the company, sequentially down from Q2 but still is a great number based on the environment. Defense business grew year-over-year by 36% in bookings bolstered by strong orders across numerous key defense platforms, which include the F-18, as mentioned previously, the TOW missile, UAVs, F-35, Aegis, weapon systems for ground vehicles at Nobles and others, and this part of Ducommun continues to deliver. Obviously, the strength helped offset commercial aerospace order pressure. 
As in Q2, cost actions have continued in Q3. You can certainly see the effectiveness of our actions and the positive growth profit margin expansion year-over-year and a solid operating income percentage along with EPS. The team has certainly done a great job in 2020 moving quickly and managing this difficult environment with no material pandemic-related costs incurred or major restructuring. 
In regards to the Q4 outlook, our significant backlog in defense with the many growth programs mentioned earlier will provide the same strong revenue. We estimate that revenue will again be led by defense, but the business overall, as mentioned in the Q2 call, will be down year-over-year by 14% to 18% due to commercial aerospace. Adjusted operating margins outlook will now be above 8% in Q4, which is an improvement from the previous call in Q2 of the outlook of 7% to 8%. 
Ducommun also has a great long-term future, and we look forward, as mentioned earlier, to return to revenue growth for the full year in 2020 alone, along with very good years in 2022 and 2023. This will be accomplished by leveraging our new built-out defense portfolio, which is currently over 90 programs. Ducommun's strong position in commercial aerospace, especially on narrow-body with a better than 2:1 ratio with wide-bodies, share gain at Airbus, our Engineered Products portfolio and the recent acquisitions. 
We're also actively in the market for M&A. And with our track record these past 3 years, I believe it will only be an accelerator to higher results in the future. 
Now let me provide some additional color on our markets, products and programs. Beginning with our military and space sector, we posted third quarter revenue of $113.9 million. Once again, representing strong growth versus 2019, up 41%. We drove revenue across a broad variety of defense platforms for nearly every aspect of our product portfolio. 
As mentioned earlier, we saw increases in demand for our military fixed-wing aircraft programs with particularly strong revenue, as mentioned earlier, from Northrop Grumman, Nobles Worldwide, ViaSat, Patriot, GA, F-15 and the TOW missile. The third quarter military and space revenue represented 76% of Ducommun's revenue in the period. We also continue to be very well positioned for further growth across our defense platforms over the next several quarters in all sectors. And again, ended the third quarter with an all-time record high backlog of $506 million, which is up an impressive 36% year-over-year, and that represents 6% of Ducommun's overall backlog. 
Within our commercial aerospace operations, third quarter revenue declined year-over-year to $26 million, as expected, driven by build rate declines on the 737 MAX as well as many other programs impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Ducommun also has effectively adjusted costs and managed the downturn and is well positioned once rates stabilize and increase over the long term. Ducommun's expansion with Airbus since 2017 is clearly going to be a benefit in the future and puts important balance in our portfolio. 
The backlog within commercial aerospace sector stands at roughly $269 million at the end of the third quarter. The majority of the decline, obviously, is due to the 737 MAX program. 
With that, I'll have Chris review our financial results in detail. Chris?"
267761,691491271,2155485,"Ducommun Incorporated, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2020",2020-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Ducommun Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. As a reminder, please see the company's filings and Q3 earnings release for a further description of information mentioned on today's call. As Steve discussed, we are pleased with our third quarter results",1252,"Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. As a reminder, please see the company's filings and Q3 earnings release for a further description of information mentioned on today's call. 
As Steve discussed, we are pleased with our third quarter results as they once again reflect the strength and diversity of our business, even as we continue to navigate the impacts of the ongoing pandemic. We remain confident in our ability to continue to provide strong returns for our shareholders through these challenging times. Now I'll move on to the details of our overall results. 
Revenue for the third quarter of 2020 was $150.4 million versus $181.1 million in the third quarter of 2019. This performance reflected $33.4 million of higher sales within the military and space sector, offset by $62.9 million of lower revenue from our commercial aerospace customers. 
As Steve mentioned, nearly all of our commercial platforms saw year-over-year declines due to the economic impact of COVID-19 on our customers, continued grounding of the 737 MAX and a decrease in air travel in general. Ducommun's overall backlog at the end of the third quarter was approximately $796 million. Our military and space backlog is at an all-time high of $506 million. As a reminder, we define backlog as potential revenue based on customer purchase orders and long-term agreements, with firm fixed prices and expected delivery dates of 24 months or less. 
We posted strong gross profit for the quarter as gross margins rose to 22.3% from 21.2% in the prior year's comparable period. The increase year-over-year was primarily due to favorable product mix and reduced discretionary spending, along with -- it was partially offset by unfavorable manufacturing volume. 
Total gross profit fell to $33.5 million from $38.3 million last year as a result of lower commercial revenue. Despite the top line headwind from COVID-19 and the related issues impacting domestic travel, we've continued to drive margin expansion. 
SG&A was $22.1 million in the third quarter versus $23.7 million last year, reflecting our ongoing cost control savings, as Steve discussed. The company reported operating income for the third quarter of $10.3 million or 6.8% of revenue and adjusted operating income of $12.4 million or 8.2% of revenue compared to $14.6 million or 8.1% of revenue in the prior year period. The year-over-year decline in operating income dollars was due to lower revenue, partially offset by higher gross margins and lower SG&A. 
Interest expense was $3.1 million in the third quarter of 2020 versus $4.4 million in the prior year period as lower interest rates more than offset the impact from higher debt levels. As a reminder, our interest expense has been favorably impacted by the credit refinancing we did in Q4 of 2019, as the Term Loan A was added, along with the replacement of our revolving credit line of credit, lowered our overall rate interest rate exposure. The increased debt outstanding was primarily due to funding the company's acquisition of Nobles in October 2019, and that we drew down $50 million in Q1 to have cash on hand during the pandemic. 
The company reported net income for the third quarter of $6.5 million or $0.54 per diluted share and adjusted net income of $8.3 million or $0.69 per diluted share compared to net income of $8.3 million or $0.70 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2019. Our adjusted net income gives effect for the impact of our restructure activities and our Guaymas fire-related expenses. The similar adjusted EPS year-over-year exhibits a strong quality of earnings as we expanded gross margins, expanded adjusted operating margins and incurred lower interest expense in the third quarter compared to the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $21.6 million or 14.4% of revenue compared to $23.6 million or 13.1% of revenue for the comparable period in 2019. 
Now let me turn to the segment results. Our Electronic Systems segment posted revenue of $103.5 million in the third quarter of 2020 versus $90.6 million in the prior year period. These results reflect a $23.1 million increase in sales to the company's military and space customers, partially offset by $9 million of lower revenue across our commercial aerospace platforms. Electronic Systems posted operating income for the third quarter of $14.9 million or 14.4% of revenue versus $9.7 million or 10.7% of revenue in the prior year period. The strong performance reflects favorable volume, improved product mix along with robust cost controls. 
Our Structural Systems segment posted revenue of $46.9 million in the third quarter of 2020 versus $90.5 million last year. The year-over-year decrease was due to $53.9 million of lower sales across commercial aerospace applications reflecting current demand dynamics, as Steve discussed, partially offset by $10.3 million of higher revenue within the company's military and space markets. 
Structural Systems posted operating income for the quarter of $1.8 million or 3.8% of revenue compared to $12.9 million or 14.2% of revenue last year. The year-over-year operating margin decline reflects unfavorable manufacturing volumes and $1.8 million of aggregate expenses tied to the restructuring activities and the Guaymas facility fire, without which adjusted operating margin was 7.7% in the third quarter of 2020. 
Corporate, general and administrative expense. CG&A expenses for the third quarter of 2020 were $6.4 million or 4.2% of revenue versus $7.9 million or 4.4% of revenue in 2019. The decrease in CG&A expense was mainly due to lower professional service fees of $1.1 million. 
Turning to liquidity and capital resources. We have available liquidity of $125 million comprised of $75 million of cash on hand plus the remaining $50 million on our revolver at the end of the third quarter of 2020. We generated $4.9 million of cash from operations during the third quarter of 2020 compared with $12 million during the prior year period. This performance reflected working capital investment to support customer demand and lower net income. 
We continue to be in compliance with our debt covenants, and our credit facilities do not mature until 2024 and 2025. As a reminder, our leverage ratio covenant ceiling is 4.75. Our leverage ratio was roughly 2.9 at the end of the third quarter of 2020. Cash generation and cash management within our already efficient operating structure remains a top priority, and we expect to generate positive free cash flow in Q4. 
In terms of capital expenditures, we spent $3.2 million during the third quarter and anticipate spending between $12 million to $14 million in 2020. This estimate does not include the capital expenditures for Guaymas as we replace the capability destroyed in the fire in June of this year. We expect the related insurance proceeds will support these reinvestment requirements. In alignment with our cash conservation initiatives, this anticipated level will result in a capital spending decrease of more than 20% versus 2019. 
Our year-to-date effective rate of income tax expense is roughly 15% as of the third quarter. For the full year of 2020, we expect an effective rate of approximately 10%. We anticipate having a significant release of FIN 48 reserves during the fourth quarter that will significantly reduce our fourth quarter tax expense. 
With employee safety top of mind, we continue to also focus on execution to drive strong and resilient performance as we satisfy customer demand. We anticipate that our electronic and structural applications on a multitude of key platforms spanning both commercial and military end markets will continue to serve us well. 
I'll now turn it back over to Steve for his closing remarks. Steve?"

As in the Q2 call, I also want to thank our customers, shareholders and all of our business partners for their continued support as we work through these difficult times together. We have now given out as well more than $1.1 million from the newly formed Ducommun foundation start last year to the local area of charities where we operate to help our neighbors and communities. In Q3, we have partnered too with 3 new organizations to help improve equality in our nation and assist small business recovery due to the social unrest in Los Angeles. 
In closing, I'd like to again this quarter take this time to thank as well Ducommun employees. I'm proud of them and all their efforts dealing with the many challenges from the pandemic. Our team shows up at the operation every day, and though stressful, gets the job done with excellent results for our customers and nation.

Today",1337,"Well, thank you, Chris, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today for our third quarter conference call. As in the second quarter call, I hope that you and your families are healthy and continuing to get through this pandemic as best as possible. 
Today, as you know, I will give an update of the current situation at the company, after which, Chris Wampler will review our financials in detail. The company remains focused first and foremost on the health and safety of our employees. The team has done an excellent job with the safety protocols put in place since March. We continue to work with authorities on best practices. The amount of cases is also less than 55 year-to-date, and we remain diligent on communication with weekly updates through our human resources team. 
As mentioned in the press release, Ducommun's third quarter results really shined despite the continued unprecedented challenges due to the pandemic in the commercial aerospace markets. All the actions, initiatives and hard work since we began this journey in 2017 have shown in the strong operating results for Q3. 
Our defense business again was the real star, along with cost reductions, having the right product portfolio, operational leadership and leveraging the Ducommun operating model of lean and highly focused performance centers. This was particularly evident as well in the margin expansion for gross profit, operating income and EBITDA despite year-over-year headwind from commercial aerospace. 
The quality of earnings, too, was very high with the company reaching $0.69 per share on an adjusted basis, almost flat to 2019, despite overall revenue being down 17% from Q3 last year. It is a great story for our investors and, as mentioned in our Q2 call, we see a return to revenue growth in 2021 and very good years ahead in 2022 and 2023. 
As mentioned, the company's third quarter revenue was down 17% year-over-year, all due to the commercial aerospace markets and on the low end of our expectation communicated in the last earnings call of being down 16% to 20%. Ducommun's defense business, however, showed great strength being up 41% versus prior year. Though not ever wanting to show negative growth, the revenue number is impressive for not only the pandemic impact, but also overcoming another $30 million of 737 MAX headwind in the quarter. 
Ducommun's defense business continues to show excellent progress with big opportunities ahead. The majority of the gains in defense included radar systems for Northrop Grumman, increases for our new weapon systems business, Nobles Worldwide, along with ViaSat, the Patriot, UAVs at General Atomics, the F-15 and the TOW program. I mentioned in our last call about Ducommun's new efforts with UAVs. 
Again, we are thrilled to be a strategic partner with GA, anticipate our first month of over $1 million in revenue in December, with 2021 bringing higher and higher levels of volume. The TOW missile program for the Raytheon Missiles and Defense business mentioned in previous calls is now in full production at Monrovia, California for the case and at other Ducommun sites which are providing electronic products. 
As we move forward in time, we see greater and greater value for customers when we leverage both our structure and electronic systems product lines, providing a one-company approach for defense Primes. We're on track for over $35 million in revenue in 2021 for this program alone, an increase from $12 million in revenue this year. This partnering across the company at this type of revenue level is something new at Ducommun, and we are excited to see this progress. Also, as you see in the 10-Q, Northrop Grumman was the #2 customer in the quarter for the first time in our history. 
NG is a key part of Ducommun's defense growth strategy, and we continue to expand our business with them supporting F-35 projects, major radar programs and structural applications. I've mentioned in the past, a key theme for the company is account share opportunities for Ducommun at defense Primes other than Raytheon. And NG is a great example. We're just getting started, and the company sees lots of new areas to develop within the defense markets. 
The other bright spot for the quarter was ending Q3 with a backlog of $506 million for the defense business, which is another all-time record for Ducommun. The total backlog was $796 million for the company, sequentially down from Q2 but still is a great number based on the environment. Defense business grew year-over-year by 36% in bookings bolstered by strong orders across numerous key defense platforms, which include the F-18, as mentioned previously, the TOW missile, UAVs, F-35, Aegis, weapon systems for ground vehicles at Nobles and others, and this part of Ducommun continues to deliver. Obviously, the strength helped offset commercial aerospace order pressure. 
As in Q2, cost actions have continued in Q3. You can certainly see the effectiveness of our actions and the positive growth profit margin expansion year-over-year and a solid operating income percentage along with EPS. The team has certainly done a great job in 2020 moving quickly and managing this difficult environment with no material pandemic-related costs incurred or major restructuring. 
In regards to the Q4 outlook, our significant backlog in defense with the many growth programs mentioned earlier will provide the same strong revenue. We estimate that revenue will again be led by defense, but the business overall, as mentioned in the Q2 call, will be down year-over-year by 14% to 18% due to commercial aerospace. Adjusted operating margins outlook will now be above 8% in Q4, which is an improvement from the previous call in Q2 of the outlook of 7% to 8%. 
Ducommun also has a great long-term future, and we look forward, as mentioned earlier, to return to revenue growth for the full year in 2020 alone, along with very good years in 2022 and 2023. This will be accomplished by leveraging our new built-out defense portfolio, which is currently over 90 programs. Ducommun's strong position in commercial aerospace, especially on narrow-body with a better than 2:1 ratio with wide-bodies, share gain at Airbus, our Engineered Products portfolio and the recent acquisitions. 
We're also actively in the market for M&A. And with our track record these past 3 years, I believe it will only be an accelerator to higher results in the future. 
Now let me provide some additional color on our markets, products and programs. Beginning with our military and space sector, we posted third quarter revenue of $113.9 million. Once again, representing strong growth versus 2019, up 41%. We drove revenue across a broad variety of defense platforms for nearly every aspect of our product portfolio. 
As mentioned earlier, we saw increases in demand for our military fixed-wing aircraft programs with particularly strong revenue, as mentioned earlier, from Northrop Grumman, Nobles Worldwide, ViaSat, Patriot, GA, F-15 and the TOW missile. The third quarter military and space revenue represented 76% of Ducommun's revenue in the period. We also continue to be very well positioned for further growth across our defense platforms over the next several quarters in all sectors. And again, ended the third quarter with an all-time record high backlog of $506 million, which is up an impressive 36% year-over-year, and that represents 6% of Ducommun's overall backlog. 
Within our commercial aerospace operations, third quarter revenue declined year-over-year to $26 million, as expected, driven by build rate declines on the 737 MAX as well as many other programs impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Ducommun also has effectively adjusted costs and managed the downturn and is well positioned once rates stabilize and increase over the long term. Ducommun's expansion with Airbus since 2017 is clearly going to be a benefit in the future and puts important balance in our portfolio. 
The backlog within commercial aerospace sector stands at roughly $269 million at the end of the third quarter. The majority of the decline, obviously, is due to the 737 MAX program. 
With that, I'll have Chris review our financial results in detail. Chris?"

As a reminder, please see the company's filings and Q3 earnings release for a further description of information mentioned on today's call. As Steve discussed, we are pleased with our third quarter results",1252,"Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. As a reminder, please see the company's filings and Q3 earnings release for a further description of information mentioned on today's call. 
As Steve discussed, we are pleased with our third quarter results as they once again reflect the strength and diversity of our business, even as we continue to navigate the impacts of the ongoing pandemic. We remain confident in our ability to continue to provide strong returns for our shareholders through these challenging times. Now I'll move on to the details of our overall results. 
Revenue for the third quarter of 2020 was $150.4 million versus $181.1 million in the third quarter of 2019. This performance reflected $33.4 million of higher sales within the military and space sector, offset by $62.9 million of lower revenue from our commercial aerospace customers. 
As Steve mentioned, nearly all of our commercial platforms saw year-over-year declines due to the economic impact of COVID-19 on our customers, continued grounding of the 737 MAX and a decrease in air travel in general. Ducommun's overall backlog at the end of the third quarter was approximately $796 million. Our military and space backlog is at an all-time high of $506 million. As a reminder, we define backlog as potential revenue based on customer purchase orders and long-term agreements, with firm fixed prices and expected delivery dates of 24 months or less. 
We posted strong gross profit for the quarter as gross margins rose to 22.3% from 21.2% in the prior year's comparable period. The increase year-over-year was primarily due to favorable product mix and reduced discretionary spending, along with -- it was partially offset by unfavorable manufacturing volume. 
Total gross profit fell to $33.5 million from $38.3 million last year as a result of lower commercial revenue. Despite the top line headwind from COVID-19 and the related issues impacting domestic travel, we've continued to drive margin expansion. 
SG&A was $22.1 million in the third quarter versus $23.7 million last year, reflecting our ongoing cost control savings, as Steve discussed. The company reported operating income for the third quarter of $10.3 million or 6.8% of revenue and adjusted operating income of $12.4 million or 8.2% of revenue compared to $14.6 million or 8.1% of revenue in the prior year period. The year-over-year decline in operating income dollars was due to lower revenue, partially offset by higher gross margins and lower SG&A. 
Interest expense was $3.1 million in the third quarter of 2020 versus $4.4 million in the prior year period as lower interest rates more than offset the impact from higher debt levels. As a reminder, our interest expense has been favorably impacted by the credit refinancing we did in Q4 of 2019, as the Term Loan A was added, along with the replacement of our revolving credit line of credit, lowered our overall rate interest rate exposure. The increased debt outstanding was primarily due to funding the company's acquisition of Nobles in October 2019, and that we drew down $50 million in Q1 to have cash on hand during the pandemic. 
The company reported net income for the third quarter of $6.5 million or $0.54 per diluted share and adjusted net income of $8.3 million or $0.69 per diluted share compared to net income of $8.3 million or $0.70 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2019. Our adjusted net income gives effect for the impact of our restructure activities and our Guaymas fire-related expenses. The similar adjusted EPS year-over-year exhibits a strong quality of earnings as we expanded gross margins, expanded adjusted operating margins and incurred lower interest expense in the third quarter compared to the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $21.6 million or 14.4% of revenue compared to $23.6 million or 13.1% of revenue for the comparable period in 2019. 
Now let me turn to the segment results. Our Electronic Systems segment posted revenue of $103.5 million in the third quarter of 2020 versus $90.6 million in the prior year period. These results reflect a $23.1 million increase in sales to the company's military and space customers, partially offset by $9 million of lower revenue across our commercial aerospace platforms. Electronic Systems posted operating income for the third quarter of $14.9 million or 14.4% of revenue versus $9.7 million or 10.7% of revenue in the prior year period. The strong performance reflects favorable volume, improved product mix along with robust cost controls. 
Our Structural Systems segment posted revenue of $46.9 million in the third quarter of 2020 versus $90.5 million last year. The year-over-year decrease was due to $53.9 million of lower sales across commercial aerospace applications reflecting current demand dynamics, as Steve discussed, partially offset by $10.3 million of higher revenue within the company's military and space markets. 
Structural Systems posted operating income for the quarter of $1.8 million or 3.8% of revenue compared to $12.9 million or 14.2% of revenue last year. The year-over-year operating margin decline reflects unfavorable manufacturing volumes and $1.8 million of aggregate expenses tied to the restructuring activities and the Guaymas facility fire, without which adjusted operating margin was 7.7% in the third quarter of 2020. 
Corporate, general and administrative expense. CG&A expenses for the third quarter of 2020 were $6.4 million or 4.2% of revenue versus $7.9 million or 4.4% of revenue in 2019. The decrease in CG&A expense was mainly due to lower professional service fees of $1.1 million. 
Turning to liquidity and capital resources. We have available liquidity of $125 million comprised of $75 million of cash on hand plus the remaining $50 million on our revolver at the end of the third quarter of 2020. We generated $4.9 million of cash from operations during the third quarter of 2020 compared with $12 million during the prior year period. This performance reflected working capital investment to support customer demand and lower net income. 
We continue to be in compliance with our debt covenants, and our credit facilities do not mature until 2024 and 2025. As a reminder, our leverage ratio covenant ceiling is 4.75. Our leverage ratio was roughly 2.9 at the end of the third quarter of 2020. Cash generation and cash management within our already efficient operating structure remains a top priority, and we expect to generate positive free cash flow in Q4. 
In terms of capital expenditures, we spent $3.2 million during the third quarter and anticipate spending between $12 million to $14 million in 2020. This estimate does not include the capital expenditures for Guaymas as we replace the capability destroyed in the fire in June of this year. We expect the related insurance proceeds will support these reinvestment requirements. In alignment with our cash conservation initiatives, this anticipated level will result in a capital spending decrease of more than 20% versus 2019. 
Our year-to-date effective rate of income tax expense is roughly 15% as of the third quarter. For the full year of 2020, we expect an effective rate of approximately 10%. We anticipate having a significant release of FIN 48 reserves during the fourth quarter that will significantly reduce our fourth quarter tax expense. 
With employee safety top of mind, we continue to also focus on execution to drive strong and resilient performance as we satisfy customer demand. We anticipate that our electronic and structural applications on a multitude of key platforms spanning both commercial and military end markets will continue to serve us well. 
I'll now turn it back over to Steve for his closing remarks. Steve?"

Well, we're certainly proud of these results this quarter and the overall track record of performance in 2017. We continue to meet our commitments. As mentioned, plan to start to growing the business again next year. I would add as well that we do have the right footprint, operating system, cost structure, discipline and leadership to continue performing in the face of this current crisis and feel very confident in our future. 
I'm also pleased to announce at this time that Ducommun will have an investor meeting, our second, during the first half of next year. We look forward to sharing the exciting things ahead in 2021 and subsequent years with our many stakeholders, and we will be following up. 
As in the Q2 call, I also want to thank our customers, shareholders and all of our business partners for their continued support as we work through these difficult times together. We have now given out as well more than $1.1 million from the newly formed Ducommun foundation start last year to the local area of charities where we operate to help our neighbors and communities. In Q3, we have partnered too with 3 new organizations to help improve equality in our nation and assist small business recovery due to the social unrest in Los Angeles. 
In closing, I'd like to again this quarter take this time to thank as well Ducommun employees. I'm proud of them and all their efforts dealing with the many challenges from the pandemic. Our team shows up at the operation every day, and though stressful, gets the job done with excellent results for our customers and nation. 
And with that, I will turn it over for questions."

Well, look, overall, and this includes the defense business, we've made a commitment we're going to return to growth for the full year next year, okay? So that's the first thing. All right. So -- and we will talk more about that in our February call. As far as things really picking up. I mean like I mentioned in my remarks, one of the things that investors need to remember is that we're building a lot of balance in the business. Okay? Three years ago, we had a really big Raytheon business. We had a really big Boeing business, and we had some other things and that was it. 
Now we have much, much bigger defense breadth with many customer -- many Primes with lots of headroom there. And we have our Boeing business, which we obviously appreciate and have for decades. And then we have Airbus and other things happening. So for us to pinpoint it, not sure that I'm going to go there right now. But I will tell you that, overall, the portfolio is continuing to get a lot of ballast. And when those build rates break, we'll be there."

Missiles is clearly an area of focus and strength for your portfolio. There have been a number of big missile type program awards recently, and it is one of the areas that continues to get funding support in the budgets. Are there any other programs that we should think of as major areas of opportunity for Ducommun?"

So other than missiles, we're very bullish on structural products. We think there's a lot of opportunity there. We're actually good at it, okay? And we can actually make good money with it. So I'd say structures. 
The other thing I would say other than missiles is all the electronics. And we're doing lots of stuff on radar. We're doing lots of stuff on box bills. And that's outside of just putting -- making cards for the Paveway missile. So as you -- again, we'll get ready. We're going to -- we'll have an excellent investor meeting, early or mid next year before the end of June. We will give you more color on that. But things are moving positively."
