1342651,648557890,1923339,"TechnipFMC plc, Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Feb 27, 2020",2020-02-27,"Earnings Calls","TechnipFMC plc","Executives","Thank you very much, Matt. Good morning, and good afternoon. Thank you for participating in our fourth quarter earnings call. 2019 proved to be a year of significant growth for our company. We achieved an unprecedented level of inbound in the year equal",1506,"Thank you very much, Matt. Good morning, and good afternoon. Thank you for participating in our fourth quarter earnings call. 
2019 proved to be a year of significant growth for our company. We achieved an unprecedented level of inbound in the year equaling $22.7 billion, representing order growth of nearly 60% versus the prior year. 
Our success was driven by an acceleration in the market adoption of our new Subsea technologies; our integrated subsea model, iEPCI; and continued strength in both LNG and downstream project sanctioning. 
In Subsea, full year inbound of $8 billion grew more than 50% versus 2018. This was the highest annual growth rate for our company in over a decade and more than 2x the industry's growth. 
This growth was driven by iEPCI with our award value more than doubling prior year levels and accounting for more than 40% of total inbound orders. 
IEPCI is no longer just an alternative commercial model, it has become the model of choice for most of our customers. 
In Onshore/Offshore, inbound orders grew almost 80% versus 2018, driven by more than $8 billion in LNG awards. This included the Artic LNG 2 contract from NovaTek, which builds upon the success of Yamal LNG. 
We were also part of the winning consortium on ExxonMobil's Rovuma LNG project, although we recorded limited inbound value ahead of the project FID expected this year. 
Total company backlog now stands at $24.3 billion, an increase of 67% from the same time last year. Backlog grew across all segments, with Onshore/Offshore increasing almost 90% versus 2018. Importantly, over half of our total backlog is scheduled for execution beyond 2020, providing us with unrivaled visibility. 
Total company revenue in 2019 exceeded $13 billion, benefiting from higher activity across all segments. Full year Subsea revenue increased 14% in the year, led by a 15% growth in Subsea services and an increasing mix of integrated project activity. 
2019 also marked a trough for segment revenue in Onshore/Offshore. We have seen the revenue inflection and have now experienced 3 consecutive quarters of sequential revenue growth. And when excluding Yamal LNG, total segment revenue increased more than 25% versus 2018, demonstrating solid growth and diversity in the remaining businesses. 
And in Surface Technologies, we experienced growth of more than 15% outside North America. Our international business now accounts for more than half of segment revenue. This strong growth more than offset the decline in North America, with a total segment delivering a modest revenue increase. 
Now let me turn to our market outlook and segment guidance for the coming year. Starting with Subsea, we anticipate ongoing momentum in activity for small to midsized brownfield projects and a continued healthy outlook for greenfield projects. Activity continues to be driven in part by emerging markets such as Mozambique and Guyana and strengthening activity in important markets such as Brazil and Africa. 
We also anticipate that subsea services will again experience double-digit revenue growth, driven in part by digital monitoring services, well intervention and asset refurbishment activities. This strength in both project activity and subsea services provides the framework for 2020 Subsea orders to approach the level achieved in 2019. However, this remains dependent upon the timing of 1 or 2 major project awards. 
Turning to Subsea guidance. We see revenue in a range of $6.2 billion to $6.5 billion and adjusted EBITDA margin of at least 11%. 
In the first quarter, we expect to see normal seasonal impact with margin improvement over the remainder of the year due to project timing and increased asset utilization. 
For Onshore/Offshore, we remain confident that additional LNG projects will be sanctioned in the near to intermediate term. The outlook for long-term demand requires this additional capacity. And just this morning, Sempra Energy announced the selection of TechnipFMC as the EPC contractor for their Energia Costa Azul LNG project. We are very proud to have been chosen for this strategic development. 
Beyond LNG, we continue to selectively pursue refining, petrochemical and biofuel project opportunities in Europe, the Middle East, Asia and North America, particularly where we can benefit from early engagement or leverage our process technology portfolio. 
For Onshore/Offshore guidance, we see revenue in a range of $7.5 billion to $7.8 billion and adjusted EBITDA margin of at least 10%, reflecting a lower contribution from Yamal LNG and an increasing contribution from projects in early stages. This guidance includes the impacts that we can estimate at this time for the coronavirus. 
In Surface Technologies, we anticipate double-digit revenue growth outside of North America, driven by market activity and supported by our high tier products and technologies. This growth serves as a strong foundation to our outlook as our international franchise makes up more than 50% of total segment revenue. 
We anticipate North America activity to decline 10% versus 2019, which assumes an improvement in drilling and completions activity in the second half of the year. 
For Surface Technologies guidance, we expect revenue in a range of $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion and adjusted EBITDA margin of at least 12%. 
Maryann will cover all other guidance related topics later in this call. In addition to this tremendous commercial success in 2019, we have been taking actions to better position ourselves for 2020 and beyond. The announced separation of our company is a bold visible step in this regard. But only represents one aspect of the transformation that is taking place in our company. 
In Subsea, we are further optimizing our organization. To maintain market leadership, you need a combination of innovative technologies, fit-for-purpose assets and global execution capabilities in order to deliver an integrated value chain. 
Part of our optimization efforts are focused on our assets, ensuring that we have the right assets with the right partners in the right geographies. And to achieve this, we will continue to rightsize and reallocate our assets to better align with the advantages of new technologies such as Subsea 2.0 and integrated project delivery. And we are also forming new strategic partnerships as demonstrated in our recent announcement with Allseas that can provide us with access to unique assets in a more capital-efficient manner. These actions will lower our operating and capital costs and increased asset utilization. And when coupled with the accelerating adoption of our next-generation Subsea products and technologies, it can help our customers reduce cost and cycle time for greater efficiency. 
In Surface Technologies, we will leverage the strength of our international franchise in order to capitalize on the growth we anticipate in the Middle East, Asia Pacific and the North Sea. 
In North America, we continue to transform our business by working with our customers to further drive well site operational efficiencies and lower greenhouse gas emissions. 
We are optimizing our services in operating geographies and when the economic returns don't make sense, we will look to exit rather than simply optimize to the status quo. 
And in Onshore/Offshore, which will very soon become Technip Energies, we are transitioning into a new growth cycle, one that is underpinned by the strength of more than $15 billion in project backlog. Our global teams have successfully executed complex projects in some of the most remote regions, and we will continue to leverage this experience and intense focus on the work that lies ahead. 
And we will remain selective in our project choices focusing on those prospects that offer the best opportunity for success for both our customers and TechnipFMC. 
As you can see, we are taking actions across all of our businesses. Importantly, these initiatives are supportive of our strategy focused on market leadership and business transformation. 
2019 was another transformational year for TechnipFMC. In August, we announced we would further reshape our future through the separation of our company into 2 industry-leading, diversified pure-plays. The spinoff remains on track for completion in the second quarter. As we have also shared, our new company, Technip Energies, plans to host a Capital Markets Day in Paris ahead of the transaction close. 
In 2019, we reinforced our position as the only fully integrated technology and services company. In Subsea, we exceeded 100% growth in iEPCI inbound, driven by an acceleration in the market adoption of our integrated model. 
IEPCI, which served as the catalyst for the merger, accounted for more than 40% of the total Subsea inbound orders in 2019 and has become the model of choice for most of our customers. When combined with double-digit growth in subsea services, we delivered full year Subsea inbound of $8 billion, an increase of more than 50% versus 2018. And in Surface Technologies, we grew more than 15% outside of North America when compared to the prior year, with international revenues now accounting for more than half of the segment revenue. 
Our significant growth in backlog across all segments validates our strategy and provides us with confidence in our outlook. We continue to demonstrate our global leadership in Subsea, LNG and the international surface market. 
I will now turn the call over to Maryann to further discuss our financial results."

Total company revenue in the fourth quarter was $3.7 billion, with adjusted EBITDA of $404 million. Fourth quarter cash flow from operations was $559 million. Adjusted EPS was $0.03 in the quarter, when excluding after-tax charges and credit",1103,"Thanks, Doug. Total company revenue in the fourth quarter was $3.7 billion, with adjusted EBITDA of $404 million. Fourth quarter cash flow from operations was $559 million. Adjusted EPS was $0.03 in the quarter, when excluding after-tax charges and credits of $5.43 per diluted share. 
The total after-tax charges and credits largely reflect noncash goodwill and asset impairment charges of $2.3 billion, which we disclosed earlier this month and are detailed in our earnings release: a valuation allowance of $108 million impacting the tax provision, separation costs of $47 million and a net restructuring credit of $1 million, which included gain of $83 million in Subsea related to the consolidation of a PLSV joint venture. These charges reflect the specific actions we are taking to better position our company for 2020 and beyond, as Doug outlined in his remarks. 
Included in our adjusted earnings are items for which we do not provide guidance, including an expense resulted from increased liability to joint venture partners of $0.22 per diluted share and foreign exchange losses of $0.13 per diluted share. The FX impact, which is included in corporate expense, was almost entirely driven by the significant devaluation of the Angolan kwanza in the period. These 2 items impacted our adjusted EPS by $0.35 in the period and excluded our adjusted EPS would have been $0.38 per diluted share. 
And lastly, with regard to internal control, we have fully remediated all previously disclosed material weaknesses. This will be reflected in our upcoming annual filings. 
Turning to the operational highlights in the quarter. Subsea delivered fourth quarter revenues of $1.5 billion, a 21% increase versus the prior year quarter. We experienced double-digit growth in both project and services activity in the period. 
IEPCI project activity continues to represent an increasing share of revenue, reflective of the well-established market trend towards integrated project development. 
The increase in services revenue was driven by higher installation, well intervention and asset refurbishment activities. Subsequently, subsea services' revenue was essentially unchanged despite the seasonal impact of weather. And adjusted EBITDA for Subsea was $185 million, with a margin of 12.4%. Adjusted EBITDA improved modestly from the prior year as cost reduction activities and project completions offset the impact of a more competitively priced backlog. 
Onshore/Offshore reported fourth quarter revenue of $1.8 billion, an increase of 10% from the prior year quarter, primarily driven by higher activity. Adjusted EBITDA was $260 million with a margin of 14.2%. Operating results in the period benefited from the strength in execution across the portfolio. 
And finally, in Surface Technologies, revenue of $408 million was down 2% versus the prior year, while sequentially, we saw modest improvement as we benefited from the strength in international markets, offset by the lower North American activity. Sequentially, adjusted EBITDA margin of 13.7% increased 250 basis points and reflects the benefit of a higher international mix of business and cost reduction activities. 
Turning to cash. We have now generated positive operating cash flow for 6 consecutive quarters. In the fourth quarter, we recorded $459 million of cash flow from operations, some of which resulted from the timing differences between project milestones and vendor payments. 
Operating cash flow was $849 million for the full year. Beyond the operating line, capital expenditures were $86 million in the period. Our full year spend was $374 million when excluding the $80 million impact of the sale-leaseback transaction for the support vessel we recorded earlier in the year. 
We paid $58 million in shareholder dividends in the quarter and for the full year, we made $233 million in total dividend payments. Additionally, we made a distribution of $119 million to the Yamal joint venture partners. We ended the year with $5.2 billion of cash on hand. 
Now I would like to provide additional details around our 2020 financial guidance. With regard to our revenue guidance, please note that the segments reflect the new business perimeters as reflected in our separation announcement. Businesses with approximately $120 million of revenue in 2019, most of which came from Surface Technologies, are now included in our Onshore/Offshore segment in 2020. 
Let me highlight the revenue coverage from backlog. In Subsea, at the midpoint of our guidance approximately 71% of our anticipated 2020 revenue is expected from backlog scheduled for execution in the current year. We anticipate the remaining revenue, approximately $1.8 billion, will be met by book and turn activity from both subsea services and projects. 
Subsea services' revenue is expected to exceed $1 billion in the year. Only a modest amount of this revenue potentially is in backlog today and most services orders quickly convert into revenues. 
In Onshore/Offshore, backlog supports approximately 86% of our expected revenue for 2020 at the midpoint. We anticipate approximately $400 million to $500 million in revenue from Yamal LNG. 
Turning to the remaining guidance items for 2020. We expect corporate expense net to be $180 million to $190 million for the full year, when excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. We expect net interest expense of $80 million to $90 million for the full year, when excluding the impact of revaluation of partners mandatorily redeemable financial liability. The increase from the prior year is largely the result of lower interest income associated with the company's cash balances. We forecast a full year tax rate in the range of 28% to 32%. Capital expenditures for 2020 should be no greater than $450 million, and we expect cash flow from operating activities to exceed $1 billion, with the back half of the year being a little stronger than the first half. 
In closing, Subsea revenue benefited from increasing activity in both projects and services, while order growth reflected the acceleration in market adoption of our new Subsea Technologies and integrated Subsea model. Onshore/Offshore revenue has clearly inflected from the 2018 trough as evidenced by the achievement of our third quarter of sequential revenue growth. While in Surface Technologies, we continue to leverage the strength of our international franchise. 
Lastly, we generated nearly $850 million in operating cash flow in 2018, with positive results in all 4 quarters. 
Looking ahead, we begin 2020 with more than $24 billion of secured backlog. We have strong revenue coverage for the year in both Subsea and Onshore/Offshore. We see revenue growth in all 3 segments at the midpoint of our revenue guidance range. As importantly, we are proactively taking actions across all our businesses in support of our focus on market leadership and continued business transformation. And in 2020, we expect operating cash flow to exceed $1 billion.

Obviously, a decent Q4, the guidance is pretty good, quite high restructuring charges. I just wondered if you could give us a little bit more detail there on what you're doing to drive improved performance as we head into next year? And what the ultimate size of the opportunity is? 
And secondly, around Subsea, I mean, I think the guide for 2020 is maybe a little bit weaker than had been expected. I mean can you just clarify any reason for the deviation? And just actually an update on comments on the external environment, things like pricing, et cetera, and also, just the gap between margins on integrated awards and normal awards and when we see that benefit really coming through your business in the results you deliver?"

I think I captured 4, if not 5, there. What I'm going to do is, I'm going to walk us a little bit through the Subsea margin guidance because I actually think that will, in some ways, address most of the other parts of your question, and quite frankly, maybe is the most prevalent and what is most new at this point. And if you don't mind, James, I'm going to take just a little bit of time on this, and I think it's important that we kind of walk through the progression of this cycle and would ended up resulting in our 2020 guidance. 
So as you know, for TechnipFMC, we had tremendous inbound order growth of more than 50% in 2019. And by the middle of the year, following the very robust orders of the first half, our integrated projects or iEPCI was representing more than 50% of the total Subsea orders. And at that time, I stated my confidence that 2019 would likely mark the margin trough at the time. However, I also noted that 2020 would be a transition year, with the main outstanding question for us being more about the progression of the margin improvement. 
If we go back to what we talked about a few times, as an iEPCI company and the only integrated company, we have the benefit of being involved in the whole life cycle, but that also means that the conversion of the inbound or the orders into revenue happens over a longer period of time. So again, we first have to design and build the equipment and this takes 18 to 24 months before we can install and commission, which can take up to another 18 months. Meaning that the orders from the first half of 2019 won't really drive margin improvement until late 2020 and beyond, as I had stated in earlier calls. 
I've also said the inception of the integrated business model that we will continue to prioritize our assets for these iEPCI projects and for our alliance partners. This was quite important as it has been a very competitive period when bidding only day rate contracts on vessels. And while I was clear that this strategy would result in lower utilization during this period. We ultimately will benefit from a higher quality backlog, driven by direct awards from both our alliance partners and those that we convert from integrated feed to iEPCI projects. And we now have delivered on the first part of this strategy as evidenced by the strength of our 2019 inbound. 
Our Subsea guidance that was issued last night is also consistent with this message. And while it is still possible that 2019 was the absolute margin trough, the significant ramp in activity we are experiencing not only impacts our company directly, but also our suppliers in the supply chain in general. 
The elasticity of the supply base has not proven to be as robust as that of our own company. Therefore, we are experiencing incremental costs to strengthen our supply chain. These efforts are well underway. As these transitory costs come down and as we move further into the offshore campaigns, we remain confident in our ability to achieve or exceed our stated guidance, driven in part by the higher utilization of all of our assets. It's important to emphasize our strategy and outlook remain unchanged, and we are confident we will deliver double-digit revenue growth in 2020, and we will remain confident that we will deliver margin expansion over the coming years. 
With that, I'll pass it to Maryann to talk a little bit about the restructuring charges that we have announced today."

I think your first question was referencing the restructuring charges in North America, as you've probably seen, we've recorded about $37 million directly attributable to Surface. You heard Doug say we're taking a very focused approach in ensuring that we are exiting businesses and product lines where we are not meeting the profitability there. So that charge that we recorded in the quarter represents the exit of certain product lines and certain headcount reductions. And as you can imagine, that is largely North America related, so that we see performance improvement deliver the margin improvement and the success that we are focused on for 2020. So that's what you're seeing being recorded in the third quarter, again, largely attributed to North America."

We've resolved most of the matters we're very well advanced. I don't want to leave any doubt, and I appreciate the follow-up question that the matters are well under control. I'm just pointing to the fact of going back to 6 -- almost 9 months ago now and the comments about the 2019 being the trough in the margin and where we came out with the guidance, which was, I think, just a small rounding year below that, was really just to emphasize and put a little bit of color around what's actually happening. So to your question, yes, we see -- we'll have the normal seasonal activity, decrease in activity in the first quarter, there's no way around that, that just has to do with certain geographies at which there's very little subsea activity because of the sea conditions in the first quarter, but we would expect to see a ramp in through the end of the year and an exit rate that would be more reflective of the type of margins that we will be able to generate from this much high-quality and high level of inbound that we had in the first half of 2019."

In terms of the iEPCI, the way I look at it, Angie, is it is kind of -- it's just our way of doing business going forward. We so I think that we've somewhat established that.

In terms of the iEPCI, the way I look at it, Angie, is it is kind of -- it's just our way of doing business going forward. We so I think that we've somewhat established that. And I believe even the rest of the industry is now acknowledging that, which I guess is somewhat flattering. Where we go in 2020 versus 2019, I see no reason why the percentage of iEPCI would not be at a similar or greater level than it was in 2019. Again, we have a very healthy portfolio of integrated FEED studies it's important to remember that our ability -- when we convert those integrated FEED studies to integrated EPCI projects, these become direct awards to our company. We also have an expanding list of exclusive iEPCI alliances. We added 2 more in 2019 with 2 additional customers, meaning 100% of their integrated work is coming -- or 100% of their Subsea work is coming to us through our new integrated model. 
So with that, I would expect, over time, as we've clearly demonstrated in just 2 years from 0 to close to 50% of our business being integrated, a trend that is very likely to continue, not just for us, but eventually for the rest of the industry as well. 
So I think that continues to look quite strong. In terms of the absolute order level, always hard to tell -- hard to state at this point in the year, and we don't give absolute guidance on on order intake. It's very difficult, given the size of our projects and the difficulty to time them within a particular 12-month period but what we do show is an opportunity set over the next 24 months, we published that, we update that regularly. It remains robust. But I remind you that a large percentage of our awards don't show on that list. That is the projects that are, let's say, publicly available to us and to our competition or some of our competition that would qualify to do that work. We have that exclusive set of proprietary opportunities, again, from our alliance partners or from the iEPCI, integrated FEED studies, excuse me, that can turn into direct award iEPCIs if we reach a certain project economic threshold that benefits both the client as well as ourselves, typically driven by an accelerated time to first oil. 
When we look at it, and that's the reason I made the comment I did, yes, 2019 was a very robust year. Some things, obviously, would have to continue to have a very strong year and would have to have some things go right in 2020 to be able to match that level of order inbound. We had some $1 billion-plus awards in 2018 and in '19. We may not see those $1 billion-plus awards in 2020, although we do have a portfolio of large opportunities that if they all came together, and the timing will happen by the 31st of December of 2020, we could be in that -- we could be in a very similar range as we are going forward from 2020 versus 2019."

So the issue, as we know, is there's a phenomenon called stress corrosion cracking. It happens when a few conditions are met. Those conditions are very prevalent in the presalt reservoirs and the presalt composition of the hydrocarbons that are produced. And therefore, we see an accelerated rate of stress corrosion cracking in that environment. Why am I emphasizing that? This is a well-known physical phenomenon. It happens anywhere where they're steel in -- placed in a certain condition where this type of event can occur. By the way, a standing structure, a bridge, if you will, made out of steel is experiencing stress corrosion cracking. It's not -- it's absolutely well-known and understood. 
When the presalt was developed because of the high CO2 content and the fact that a flexible riser when the annulus is flooded, can accelerate that phenomenon. So it's a well known phenomenon. It just becomes accelerated. So look, the industry had a -- this is an industry phenomenon. We are, obviously, the leader in the flexible pipe, both technology and certainly in the installed base and continue to be. 
So we've been working very actively, actually, with industry, but very much directly with Petrobras and making sure that we could clearly understand the phenomenon in this condition and then be able to model it so that we could predict the -- let's say, the impact of the effects of distressed corrosion cracking, whilst at the same time and in parallel, developing solutions that will be less -- will be more resistant or even stress corrosion crack -- SEC, if you will, stress corrosion cracking free. And that's exactly the process -- and that's what we're doing. So it's multidimensional as I'm pointing out. 
We are well advanced on the first element, which is now being able to model and predict and working very closely with Petrobras on that. So it's very -- it's a combined issue, and it's now a well-understood issue, and we're able to model it. 
At the same time, we're developing the solutions hand-in-hand with Petrobras. And we're very pleased. And they are -- more importantly, they are very pleased with the progress that we're making. We just had a review on the subject matter 2 weeks ago with the Petrobras leadership team, and we'll continue to work with them in an open and collaborative way to solve this industry -- to solve this industry phenomenon and ensure that we will have a product that they'll be able to use across their portfolio because it's important to understand what we're really talking about is a small application of flexible pipe. If you look at the total amount of flexible pipes sold, this is a very small portion of that total market that is impacted. It's not all of Brazil, it's not all of Petrobras, it's not all of pre-salt. It's in a very specific isolated situation. That being said, we're committed to solving it, as I pointed out and are making good progress in that situation. 
In regards to the rest of the business around our flexible product line, it continues unchanged, if you will, and continues to be quite robust."

The commercial model has been hugely successful, but the ability to be able to merge that with a technology program that not only drives the Subsea -- expansion of the Subsea market in an example like 20K that you pointed out, which is very important, indeed. It also can be fundamentally changed the way that we conduct our business or our operating model, both in terms of our physical footprint as well as in terms of our assets. 
So Subsea 2.0 has had a profound impact on our manufacturing footprint in a positive way, if you will, from a cost point of view or from a returns point of view, and I strongly believe that Subsea 3.0 and beyond will have the same type of impact on the installation capabilities going forward for ourselves and ultimately for the industry."

Thank you for participating in our fourth quarter earnings call. 2019 proved to be a year of significant growth for our company. We achieved an unprecedented level of inbound in the year equal",1506,"Thank you very much, Matt. Good morning, and good afternoon. Thank you for participating in our fourth quarter earnings call. 
2019 proved to be a year of significant growth for our company. We achieved an unprecedented level of inbound in the year equaling $22.7 billion, representing order growth of nearly 60% versus the prior year. 
Our success was driven by an acceleration in the market adoption of our new Subsea technologies; our integrated subsea model, iEPCI; and continued strength in both LNG and downstream project sanctioning. 
In Subsea, full year inbound of $8 billion grew more than 50% versus 2018. This was the highest annual growth rate for our company in over a decade and more than 2x the industry's growth. 
This growth was driven by iEPCI with our award value more than doubling prior year levels and accounting for more than 40% of total inbound orders. 
IEPCI is no longer just an alternative commercial model, it has become the model of choice for most of our customers. 
In Onshore/Offshore, inbound orders grew almost 80% versus 2018, driven by more than $8 billion in LNG awards. This included the Artic LNG 2 contract from NovaTek, which builds upon the success of Yamal LNG. 
We were also part of the winning consortium on ExxonMobil's Rovuma LNG project, although we recorded limited inbound value ahead of the project FID expected this year. 
Total company backlog now stands at $24.3 billion, an increase of 67% from the same time last year. Backlog grew across all segments, with Onshore/Offshore increasing almost 90% versus 2018. Importantly, over half of our total backlog is scheduled for execution beyond 2020, providing us with unrivaled visibility. 
Total company revenue in 2019 exceeded $13 billion, benefiting from higher activity across all segments. Full year Subsea revenue increased 14% in the year, led by a 15% growth in Subsea services and an increasing mix of integrated project activity. 
2019 also marked a trough for segment revenue in Onshore/Offshore. We have seen the revenue inflection and have now experienced 3 consecutive quarters of sequential revenue growth. And when excluding Yamal LNG, total segment revenue increased more than 25% versus 2018, demonstrating solid growth and diversity in the remaining businesses. 
And in Surface Technologies, we experienced growth of more than 15% outside North America. Our international business now accounts for more than half of segment revenue. This strong growth more than offset the decline in North America, with a total segment delivering a modest revenue increase. 
Now let me turn to our market outlook and segment guidance for the coming year. Starting with Subsea, we anticipate ongoing momentum in activity for small to midsized brownfield projects and a continued healthy outlook for greenfield projects. Activity continues to be driven in part by emerging markets such as Mozambique and Guyana and strengthening activity in important markets such as Brazil and Africa. 
We also anticipate that subsea services will again experience double-digit revenue growth, driven in part by digital monitoring services, well intervention and asset refurbishment activities. This strength in both project activity and subsea services provides the framework for 2020 Subsea orders to approach the level achieved in 2019. However, this remains dependent upon the timing of 1 or 2 major project awards. 
Turning to Subsea guidance. We see revenue in a range of $6.2 billion to $6.5 billion and adjusted EBITDA margin of at least 11%. 
In the first quarter, we expect to see normal seasonal impact with margin improvement over the remainder of the year due to project timing and increased asset utilization. 
For Onshore/Offshore, we remain confident that additional LNG projects will be sanctioned in the near to intermediate term. The outlook for long-term demand requires this additional capacity. And just this morning, Sempra Energy announced the selection of TechnipFMC as the EPC contractor for their Energia Costa Azul LNG project. We are very proud to have been chosen for this strategic development. 
Beyond LNG, we continue to selectively pursue refining, petrochemical and biofuel project opportunities in Europe, the Middle East, Asia and North America, particularly where we can benefit from early engagement or leverage our process technology portfolio. 
For Onshore/Offshore guidance, we see revenue in a range of $7.5 billion to $7.8 billion and adjusted EBITDA margin of at least 10%, reflecting a lower contribution from Yamal LNG and an increasing contribution from projects in early stages. This guidance includes the impacts that we can estimate at this time for the coronavirus. 
In Surface Technologies, we anticipate double-digit revenue growth outside of North America, driven by market activity and supported by our high tier products and technologies. This growth serves as a strong foundation to our outlook as our international franchise makes up more than 50% of total segment revenue. 
We anticipate North America activity to decline 10% versus 2019, which assumes an improvement in drilling and completions activity in the second half of the year. 
For Surface Technologies guidance, we expect revenue in a range of $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion and adjusted EBITDA margin of at least 12%. 
Maryann will cover all other guidance related topics later in this call. In addition to this tremendous commercial success in 2019, we have been taking actions to better position ourselves for 2020 and beyond. The announced separation of our company is a bold visible step in this regard. But only represents one aspect of the transformation that is taking place in our company. 
In Subsea, we are further optimizing our organization. To maintain market leadership, you need a combination of innovative technologies, fit-for-purpose assets and global execution capabilities in order to deliver an integrated value chain. 
Part of our optimization efforts are focused on our assets, ensuring that we have the right assets with the right partners in the right geographies. And to achieve this, we will continue to rightsize and reallocate our assets to better align with the advantages of new technologies such as Subsea 2.0 and integrated project delivery. And we are also forming new strategic partnerships as demonstrated in our recent announcement with Allseas that can provide us with access to unique assets in a more capital-efficient manner. These actions will lower our operating and capital costs and increase asset utilization. And when coupled with the accelerating adoption of our next-generation Subsea products and technologies, they can help our customers reduce cost and cycle time for greater efficiency. 
In Surface Technologies, we will leverage the strength of our international franchise in order to capitalize on the growth we anticipate in the Middle East, Asia Pacific and the North Sea. 
In North America, we continue to transform our business by working with our customers to further drive well site operational efficiencies and lower greenhouse gas emissions. 
We are optimizing our services in operating geographies and when the economic returns don't make sense, we will look to exit rather than simply optimize to the status quo. 
And in Onshore/Offshore, which will very soon become Technip Energies, we are transitioning into a new growth cycle, one that is underpinned by the strength of more than $15 billion in project backlog. Our global teams have successfully executed complex projects in some of the most remote regions, and we will continue to leverage this experience and intense focus on the work that lies ahead. 
And we will remain selective in our project choices focusing on those prospects that offer the best opportunity for success for both our customers and TechnipFMC. 
As you can see, we are taking actions across all of our businesses. Importantly, these initiatives are supportive of our strategy focused on market leadership and business transformation. 
2019 was another transformational year for TechnipFMC. In August, we announced we would further reshape our future through the separation of our company into 2 industry-leading, diversified pure-plays. The spinoff remains on track for completion in the second quarter. As we have also shared, our new company, Technip Energies, plans to host a Capital Markets Day in Paris ahead of the transaction close. 
In 2019, we reinforced our position as the only fully integrated technology and services company. In Subsea, we exceeded 100% growth in iEPCI inbound, driven by an acceleration in the market adoption of our integrated model. 
IEPCI, which served as the catalyst for the merger, accounted for more than 40% of the total Subsea inbound orders in 2019 and has become the model of choice for most of our customers. When combined with double-digit growth in subsea services, we delivered full year Subsea inbound of $8 billion, an increase of more than 50% versus 2018. And in Surface Technologies, we grew more than 15% outside of North America when compared to the prior year, with international revenues now accounting for more than half of the segment revenue. 
Our significant growth in backlog across all segments validates our strategy and provides us with confidence in our outlook. We continue to demonstrate our global leadership in Subsea, LNG and the international surface market. 
I will now turn the call over to Maryann to further discuss our financial results."

Total company revenue in the fourth quarter was $3.7 billion, with adjusted EBITDA of $404 million. Fourth quarter cash flow from operations was $559 million. Adjusted EPS was $0.03 in the quarter, when excluding after-tax charges and credit",1104,"Thanks, Doug. Total company revenue in the fourth quarter was $3.7 billion, with adjusted EBITDA of $404 million. Fourth quarter cash flow from operations was $559 million. Adjusted EPS was $0.03 in the quarter, when excluding after-tax charges and credits of $5.43 per diluted share. 
The total after-tax charges and credits largely reflect noncash goodwill and asset impairment charges of $2.3 billion, which we disclosed earlier this month and are detailed in our earnings release: a valuation allowance of $108 million impacting the tax provision, separation cost of $47 million and a net restructuring credit of $1 million, which included gain of $83 million in Subsea related to the consolidation of a PLSV joint venture. These charges reflect the specific actions we are taking to better position our company for 2020 and beyond, as Doug outlined in his remarks. 
Included in our adjusted earnings are items for which we do not provide guidance, including an expense resulted from increased liability to joint venture partners of $0.22 per diluted share and foreign exchange losses of $0.13 per diluted share. The FX impact, which is included in corporate expense, was almost entirely driven by the significant devaluation of the Angolan Kwanza in the period. These 2 items impacted our adjusted EPS by $0.35 in the period and excluded our adjusted EPS would have been $0.38 per diluted share. 
And lastly, with regard to internal control, we have fully remediated all previously disclosed material weaknesses. This will be reflected in our upcoming annual filings. 
Turning to the operational highlights in the quarter. Subsea delivered fourth quarter revenues of $1.5 billion, a 21% increase versus the prior year quarter. We experienced double-digit growth in both project and services activity in the period. 
IEPCI project activity continues to represent an increasing share of revenue, reflective of the well-established market trend towards integrated project development. 
The increase in services revenue was driven by higher installation, well intervention and asset refurbishment activities. Subsequently, subsea services' revenue was essentially unchanged despite the seasonal impact of weather. And adjusted EBITDA for Subsea was $185 million, with a margin of 12.4%. Adjusted EBITDA improved modestly from the prior year as cost reduction activities and project completions offset the impact of a more competitively priced backlog. 
Onshore/Offshore reported fourth quarter revenue of $1.8 billion, an increase of 10% from the prior year quarter, primarily driven by higher activity. Adjusted EBITDA was $260 million with a margin of 14.2%. Operating results in the period benefited from the strength in execution across the portfolio. 
And finally, in Surface Technologies, revenue of $408 million was down 2% versus the prior year, while sequentially, we saw modest improvement as we benefited from the strength in international markets, offset by the lower North American activity. Sequentially, adjusted EBITDA margin of 13.7% increased 250 basis points and reflects the benefit of a higher international mix of business and cost reduction activities. 
Turning to cash. We have now generated positive operating cash flow for 6 consecutive quarters. In the fourth quarter, we recorded $459 million of cash flow from operations, some of which resulted from the timing differences between project milestones and vendor payments. 
Operating cash flow was $849 million for the full year. Beyond the operating line, capital expenditures were $86 million in the period. Our full year spend was $374 million when excluding the $80 million impact of the sale-leaseback transaction for the Dive Support Vessel we recorded earlier in the year. 
We paid $58 million in shareholder dividends in the quarter and for the full year, we made $233 million in total dividend payments. Additionally, we made a distribution of $119 million to the Yamal joint venture partners. We ended the year with $5.2 billion of cash on hand. 
Now I would like to provide additional details around our 2020 financial guidance. With regard to our revenue guidance, please note that the segments reflect the new business perimeters as reflected in our separation announcement. Businesses with approximately $120 million of revenue in 2019, most of which came from Surface Technologies, are now included in our Onshore/Offshore segment in 2020. 
Let me highlight the revenue coverage from backlog. In Subsea, at the midpoint of our guidance approximately 71% of our anticipated 2020 revenue is expected from backlog scheduled for execution in the current year. We anticipate the remaining revenue, approximately $1.8 billion, will be met by book and turn activity from both subsea services and projects. 
Subsea services' revenue is expected to exceed $1 billion in the year. Only a modest amount of this revenue potentially is in backlog today and most services orders quickly convert into revenues. 
In Onshore/Offshore, backlog supports approximately 86% of our expected revenue for 2020 at the midpoint. We anticipate approximately $400 million to $500 million in revenue from Yamal LNG. 
Turning to the remaining guidance items for 2020. We expect corporate expense net to be $180 million to $190 million for the full year, when excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. We expect net interest expense of $80 million to $90 million for the full year, when excluding the impact of revaluation of partners mandatorily redeemable financial liability. The increase from the prior year is largely the result of lower interest income associated with the company's cash balances. We forecast a full year tax rate in the range of 28% to 32%. Capital expenditures for 2020 should be no greater than $450 million, and we expect cash flow from operating activities to exceed $1 billion, with the back half of the year being a little stronger than the first half. 
In closing, Subsea revenue benefited from increasing activity in both projects and services, while order growth reflected the acceleration in market adoption of our new Subsea Technologies and integrated Subsea model. Onshore/Offshore revenue has clearly inflected from the 2018 trough as evidenced by the achievement of our third quarter of sequential revenue growth. While in Surface Technologies, we continue to leverage the strength of our international franchise. 
Lastly, we generated nearly $850 million in operating cash flow in 2018, with positive results in all 4 quarters. 
Looking ahead, we begin 2020 with more than $24 billion of secured backlog. We have strong revenue coverage for the year in both Subsea and Onshore/Offshore. We see revenue growth in all 3 segments at the midpoint of our revenue guidance range. As importantly, we are proactively taking actions across all our businesses in support of our focus on market leadership and continued business transformation. And in 2020, we expect operating cash flow to exceed $1 billion.

Obviously, a decent Q4, the guidance is pretty good, quite high restructuring charges. I just wondered if you could give us a little bit more detail there on what you're doing to drive improved performance as we head into next year? And what the ultimate size of the opportunity is? 
And secondly, around Subsea, I mean, I think the guide for 2020 is maybe a little bit weaker than had been expected. I mean can you just clarify any reason for the deviation? And just actually an update on comments on the external environment, things like pricing, et cetera, and also, just the gap between margins on integrated awards and normal awards and when we see that benefit really coming through your business in the results you deliver?"

I think I captured 4, if not 5, there. What I'm going to do is, I'm going to walk us a little bit through the Subsea margin guidance because I actually think that will, in some ways, address most of the other parts of your question, and quite frankly, maybe is the most prevalent and what is most new at this point. And if you don't mind, James, I'm going to take just a little bit of time on this, and I think it's important that we kind of walk through the progression of this cycle and would ended up resulting in our 2020 guidance. 
So as you know, for TechnipFMC, we had tremendous inbound order growth of more than 50% in 2019. And by the middle of the year, following the very robust orders of the first half, our integrated projects or iEPCI was representing more than 50% of the total Subsea orders. And at that time, I stated my confidence that 2019 would likely mark the margin trough at the time. However, I also noted that 2020 would be a transition year, with the main outstanding question for us being more about the progression of the margin improvement. 
If we go back to what we talked about a few times, as an iEPCI company and the only integrated company, we have the benefit of being involved in the whole life cycle, but that also means that the conversion of the inbound or the orders into revenue happens over a longer period of time. So again, we first have to design and build the equipment and this takes 18 to 24 months before we can install and commission, which can take up to another 18 months. Meaning that the orders from the first half of 2019 won't really drive margin improvement until late 2020 and beyond, as I had stated in earlier calls. 
I've also said the inception of the integrated business model that we will continue to prioritize our assets for these iEPCI projects and for our alliance partners. This was quite important as it has been a very competitive period when bidding only day rate contracts on vessels. And while I was clear that this strategy would result in lower utilization during this period we ultimately will benefit from a higher quality backlog, driven by direct awards from both our alliance partners and those that we convert from integrated feed to iEPCI projects. And we now have delivered on the first part of this strategy as evidenced by the strength of our 2019 inbound. 
Our Subsea guidance that was issued last night is also consistent with this message. And while it is still possible that 2019 was the absolute margin trough, the significant ramp in activity we are experiencing not only impacts our company directly, but also our suppliers in the supply chain in general. 
The elasticity of the supply base has not proven to be as robust as that of our own company. Therefore, we are experiencing incremental costs to strengthen our supply chain. These efforts are well underway. As these transitory costs come down and as we move further into the offshore campaigns, we remain confident in our ability to achieve or exceed our stated guidance, driven in part by the higher utilization of all of our assets. It's important to emphasize our strategy and outlook remain unchanged, and we are confident we will deliver double-digit revenue growth in 2020, and we will remain confident that we will deliver margin expansion over the coming years. 
With that, I'll pass it to Maryann to talk a little bit about the restructuring charges that we have announced today."

I think your first question was referencing the restructuring charges in North America, as you've probably seen, we've recorded about $37 million directly attributable to Surface. You heard Doug say we're taking a very focused approach in ensuring that we are exiting businesses and product lines where we are not meeting the profitability there. So that charge that we recorded in the quarter represents the exit of certain product lines and certain headcount reductions. And as you can imagine, that is largely North America related, so that we see performance improvement deliver the margin improvement and the success that we are focused on for 2020. So that's what you're seeing being recorded in the third quarter, again, largely attributed to North America."

But maybe if we could ask a little bit more on that on the comments you said to strengthen our supply chain, which is obviously very fair, is that an occurrence that we'll see only or predominantly in the first half.

And all of that combined at the same time, has to be translated through this, has to trickle through the supply chain, if you will. We've been working with the supply chain. We've resolved most of the matters, we're very well advanced. I don't want to leave any doubt, and I appreciate the follow-up question that the matters are well under control. 
I'm just pointing to the fact of going back to 6 -- almost 9 months ago now and the comments about the 2019 being the trough in the margin and where we came out with the guidance, which was, I think, just a small rounding year below that, was really just to emphasize and put a little bit of color around what's actually happening. So to your question, yes, we see -- we'll have the normal seasonal activity, decrease in activity in the first quarter, there's no way around that, that just has to do with certain geographies at which there's very little subsea activity because of the sea conditions in the first quarter, but we would expect to see a ramp in through the end of the year and an exit rate that would be more reflective of the type of margins that we will be able to generate from this much high-quality and high level of inbound that we had in the first half of 2019."

And I believe even the rest of the industry is now acknowledging that,",527,"Sure. In terms of the iEPCI, the way I look at it, Angie, is it is kind of -- it's just our way of doing business going forward. We -- so I think that we've somewhat established that. And I believe even the rest of the industry is now acknowledging that, which I guess is somewhat flattering. Where we go in 2020 versus 2019, I see no reason why the percentage of iEPCI would not be at a similar or a greater level than it was in 2019. Again, we have a very healthy portfolio of integrated FEED studies, it's important to remember that our ability -- when we convert those integrated FEED studies to integrated EPCI projects, these become direct awards to our company. We also have an expanding list of exclusive iEPCI alliances. We added 2 more in 2019 with 2 additional customers, meaning 100% of their integrated work is coming -- or 100% of their Subsea work is coming to us through our new integrated model. 
So with that, I would expect, over time, as we've clearly demonstrated in just 2 years from 0 to close to 50% of our business being integrated, a trend that is very likely to continue, not just for us, but eventually for the rest of the industry as well. 
So I think that continues to look quite strong. In terms of the absolute order level, always hard to tell -- hard to state at this point in the year, and we don't give absolute guidance on order intake. It's very difficult, given the size of our projects and the difficulty to time them within a particular 12-month period but what we do show is an opportunity set over the next 24 months, we publish that, we update that regularly. It remains robust. But I remind you that a large percentage of our awards don't show on that list. That is the projects that are, let's say, publicly available to us and to our competition or some of our competition that would qualify to do that work. We have that exclusive set of proprietary opportunities, again, from our alliance partners or from the iEPCI, integrated FEED studies, excuse me, that can turn into direct award iEPCIs if we reach a certain project economic threshold that benefits both the client as well as ourselves, typically driven by an accelerated time to first oil. 
When we look at it, and that's the reason I made the comment I did, yes, 2019 was a very robust year. Some things, obviously, would have to continue to have a very strong year and would have to have some things go right in 2020 to be able to match that level of order inbound. We had some $1 billion-plus awards in 2018 and in '19. We may not see those $1 billion-plus awards in 2020, although we do have a portfolio of large opportunities that if they all came together, and the timing all happen by the 31st of December of 2020, we could be in that -- we could be in a very similar range as we are going forward from 2020 versus 2019."

We announced some asset sales during the last year, and we'll continue -- and we announced a very important partnership as well with Allseas, and we will continue to look at ways that we can work collaboratively with anyone, anyone at all, in order to ensure success for the industry going forward, and once again, make it a very attractive place for the investment community to put their money because of the type of margins that we'll be able to demonstrate on a through-cycle basis. 
If we keep looking at it individually as to the own size of our assets, regardless of what type of assets they are, we tend to end up in a situation where the industry is overcapitalized and we don't generate the type of returns that are required. 
So look, we are very open to working with anybody, and we have demonstrated that, and we will benefit from that in terms of the type of returns that we'll be able to generate because of that type of behavior."

So the issue, as we know, is there's a phenomenon called stress corrosion cracking. It happens when a few conditions are met. Those conditions are very prevalent in the pre-salt reservoirs and the pre-salt composition of the hydrocarbons that are pr",530,"Sure. So the issue, as we know, is there's a phenomenon called stress corrosion cracking. It happens when a few conditions are met. Those conditions are very prevalent in the pre-salt reservoirs and the pre-salt composition of the hydrocarbons that are produced. And therefore, we see an accelerated rate of stress corrosion cracking in that environment. Why am I emphasizing that? This is a well-known physical phenomenon. It happens anywhere where they're steel in -- placed in a certain condition where this type of event can occur. By the way, a standing structure, a bridge, if you will, made out of steel is experiencing stress corrosion cracking. It's not -- it's absolutely well-known and understood. 
When the pre-salt was developed because of the high CO2 content and the fact that a flexible riser when the annulus is flooded, can accelerate that phenomenon. So it's a well known phenomenon. It just becomes accelerated. So look, the industry had a -- this is an industry phenomenon. We are, obviously, the leader in the flexible pipe, both technology and certainly in the installed base and continue to be. 
So we've been working very actively, actually, with industry, but very much directly with Petrobras and making sure that we could clearly understand the phenomenon in this condition and then be able to model it so that we could predict the -- let's say, the impact of the effects of distressed corrosion cracking, whilst at the same time and in parallel, developing solutions that will be less -- will be more resistant or even stress corrosion crack -- SEC, if you will, stress corrosion cracking free. And that's exactly the process -- and that's what we're doing. So it's multidimensional as I'm pointing out. 
We are well advanced on the first element, which is now being able to model and predict and working very closely with Petrobras on that. So it's very -- it's a combined issue, and it's now a well-understood issue, and we're able to model it. 
At the same time, we're developing the solutions hand-in-hand with Petrobras. And we're very pleased. And they are -- more importantly, they are very pleased with the progress that we're making. We just had a review on the subject matter 2 weeks ago with the Petrobras leadership team, and we'll continue to work with them in an open and collaborative way to solve this industry -- to solve this industry phenomenon and ensure that we will have a product that they'll be able to use across their portfolio because it's important to understand what we're really talking about is a small application of flexible pipe. If you look at the total amount of flexible pipes sold, this is a very small portion of that total market that is impacted. It's not all of Brazil, it's not all of Petrobras, it's not all of pre-salt. It's in a very specific isolated situation. That being said, we're committed to solving it, as I pointed out and are making good progress in that situation. 
In regards to the rest of the business around our flexible product line, it continues unchanged, if you will, and continues to be quite robust."

I'm sure they're talking about it. I'm sure they're trying to figure that out right now. It's not evident to me what they're doing, but what is clearly evident is this is the way that the market is going. We're real thankful that in 2016 we had the vision. We're even more thankful that in 2017, we completed the transaction and, obviously, most thankful for the recognition by our clients in the amount of over $7 billion of integrated awards that they've given us thus far, the vast majority of those being direct awarded to our company. So we're just very thankful for the situation we're in. 
In regards to technology leadership in Subsea, it's, obviously, an important -- it's one of the important elements. The commercial model has been hugely successful, but the ability to be able to merge that with a technology program that not only drives the Subsea -- expansion of the Subsea market in an example like 20K that you pointed out, which is very important, indeed. It also can be fundamentally change the way that we conduct our business or our operating model, both in terms of our physical footprint as well as in terms of our assets. 
So Subsea 2.0 has had a profound impact on our manufacturing footprint in a positive way, if you will, from a cost point of view or from a returns point of view, and I strongly believe that Subsea 3.0 and beyond will have the same type of impact on the installation capabilities going forward for ourselves and ultimately for the industry."

Thank you for participating in our fourth quarter earnings call. 2019 proved to be a year of significant growth for our company. We achieved an unprecedented level of inbound in the year equal",1506,"Thank you very much, Matt. Good morning, and good afternoon. Thank you for participating in our fourth quarter earnings call. 
2019 proved to be a year of significant growth for our company. We achieved an unprecedented level of inbound in the year equaling $22.7 billion, representing order growth of nearly 60% versus the prior year. Our success was driven by an acceleration in the market adoption of our new Subsea technologies; our integrated subsea model, iEPCI; and continued strength in both LNG and downstream project sanctioning. 
In Subsea, full year inbound of $8 billion grew more than 50% versus 2018. This was the highest annual growth rate for our company in over a decade and more than 2x the industry's growth. This growth was driven by iEPCI with our award value more than doubling prior year levels and accounting for more than 40% of total inbound orders. IEPCI is no longer just an alternative commercial model, it has become the model of choice for most of our customers. 
In Onshore/Offshore, inbound orders grew almost 80% versus 2018, driven by more than $8 billion in LNG awards. This included the Arctic LNG 2 contract from NovaTek, which builds upon the success of Yamal LNG. We were also part of the winning consortium on ExxonMobil's Rovuma LNG project, although we recorded limited inbound value ahead of the project FID expected this year. 
Total company backlog now stands at $24.3 billion, an increase of 67% from the same time last year. Backlog grew across all segments, with Onshore/Offshore increasing almost 90% versus 2018. Importantly, over half of our total backlog is scheduled for execution beyond 2020, providing us with unrivaled visibility. 
Total company revenue in 2019 exceeded $13 billion, benefiting from higher activity across all segments. Full year Subsea revenue increased 14% in the year led by a 15% growth in Subsea services and an increasing mix of integrated project activity. 
2019 also marked a trough for segment revenue in Onshore/Offshore. We have seen the revenue inflection and have now experienced 3 consecutive quarters of sequential revenue growth. And when excluding Yamal LNG, total segment revenue increased more than 25% versus 2018, demonstrating solid growth and diversity in the remaining businesses. 
And in Surface Technologies, we experienced growth of more than 15% outside North America. Our international business now accounts for more than half of segment revenue. This strong growth more than offset the decline in North America, with a total segment delivering a modest revenue increase. 
Now let me turn to our market outlook and segment guidance for the coming year. Starting with Subsea, we anticipate ongoing momentum in activity for small to midsized brownfield projects and a continued healthy outlook for greenfield projects. Activity continues to be driven in part by emerging markets such as Mozambique and Guyana and strengthening activity in important markets such as Brazil and Africa. 
We also anticipate that subsea services will again experience double-digit revenue growth, driven in part by digital monitoring services, well intervention and asset refurbishment activities. This strength in both project activity and subsea services provides the framework for 2020 Subsea orders to approach the level achieved in 2019. However, this remains dependent upon the timing of 1 or 2 major project awards.
Turning to Subsea guidance. We see revenue in a range of $6.2 billion to $6.5 billion and adjusted EBITDA margin of at least 11%. In the first quarter, we expect to see normal seasonal impact with margin improvement over the remainder of the year due to project timing and increased asset utilization. 
For Onshore/Offshore, we remain confident that additional LNG projects will be sanctioned in the near to intermediate term. The outlook for long-term demand requires this additional capacity. And just this morning, Sempra Energy announced the selection of TechnipFMC as the EPC contractor for their Energia Costa Azul LNG project. We are very proud to have been chosen for this strategic development. 
Beyond LNG, we continue to selectively pursue refining, petrochemical and biofuel project opportunities in Europe, the Middle East, Asia and North America, particularly where we can benefit from early engagement or leverage our process technology portfolio. 
For Onshore/Offshore guidance, we see revenue in a range of $7.5 billion to $7.8 billion and adjusted EBITDA margin of at least 10%, reflecting a lower contribution from Yamal LNG and an increasing contribution from projects in early stages. This guidance includes the impacts that we can estimate at this time for the coronavirus. 
In Surface Technologies, we anticipate double-digit revenue growth outside of North America, driven by market activity and supported by our high tier products and technologies. This growth serves as a strong foundation to our outlook as our international franchise makes up more than 50% of total segment revenue. We anticipate North America activity to decline 10% versus 2019, which assumes an improvement in drilling and completions activity in the second half of the year. 
For Surface Technologies guidance, we expect revenue in a range of $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion and adjusted EBITDA margin of at least 12%. 
Maryann will cover all other guidance related topics later in this call. In addition to this tremendous commercial success in 2019, we have been taking actions to better position ourselves for 2020 and beyond. The announced separation of our company is a bold visible step in this regard. But only represents one aspect of the transformation that is taking place in our company. 
In Subsea, we are further optimizing our organization. To maintain market leadership, you need a combination of innovative technologies, fit-for-purpose assets and global execution capabilities in order to deliver an integrated value chain. 
Part of our optimization efforts are focused on our assets, ensuring that we have the right assets with the right partners in the right geographies. And to achieve this, we will continue to rightsize and reallocate our assets to better align with the advantages of new technologies such as Subsea 2.0 and integrated project delivery. And we are also forming new strategic partnerships as demonstrated in our recent announcement with Allseas that can provide us with access to unique assets in a more capital-efficient manner. These actions will lower our operating and capital costs and increase asset utilization. And when coupled with the accelerating adoption of our next-generation Subsea products and technologies, they can help our customers reduce cost and cycle time for greater efficiency. 
In Surface Technologies, we will leverage the strength of our international franchise in order to capitalize on the growth we anticipate in the Middle East, Asia Pacific and the North Sea. In North America, we continue to transform our business by working with our customers to further drive well site operational efficiencies and lower greenhouse gas emissions. We are optimizing our services in operating geographies and when the economic returns don't make sense, we will look to exit rather than simply optimize to the status quo. 
And in Onshore/Offshore, which will very soon become Technip Energies, we are transitioning into a new growth cycle, one that is underpinned by the strength of more than $15 billion in project backlog. Our global teams have successfully executed complex projects in some of the most remote regions, and we will continue to leverage this experience and intense focus on the work that lies ahead. And we will remain selective in our project choices focusing on those prospects that offer the best opportunity for success for both our customers and TechnipFMC. 
As you can see, we are taking actions across all of our businesses. Importantly, these initiatives are supportive of our strategy focused on market leadership and business transformation. 2019 was another transformational year for TechnipFMC. In August, we announced we would further reshape our future through the separation of our company into 2 industry-leading, diversified pure-plays. The spinoff remains on track for completion in the second quarter. As we have also shared, our new company, Technip Energies, plans to host a Capital Markets Day in Paris ahead of the transaction close. 
In 2019, we reinforced our position as the only fully integrated technology and services company. In Subsea, we exceeded 100% growth in iEPCI inbound, driven by an acceleration in the market adoption of our integrated model. 
IEPCI, which served as the catalyst for the merger, accounted for more than 40% of the total Subsea inbound orders in 2019 and has become the model of choice for most of our customers. When combined with double-digit growth in subsea services, we delivered full year Subsea inbound of $8 billion, an increase of more than 50% versus 2018. And in Surface Technologies, we grew more than 15% outside of North America when compared to the prior year, with international revenues now accounting for more than half of the segment revenue. 
Our significant growth in backlog across all segments validates our strategy and provides us with confidence in our outlook. We continue to demonstrate our global leadership in Subsea, LNG and the international surface market. 
I will now turn the call over to Maryann to further discuss our financial results."

Total company revenue in the fourth quarter was $3.7 billion, with adjusted EBITDA of $404 million. Fourth quarter cash flow from operations was $559 million. Adjusted EPS was $0.03 in the quarter, when excluding after-tax charges and credit",1104,"Thanks, Doug. Total company revenue in the fourth quarter was $3.7 billion, with adjusted EBITDA of $404 million. Fourth quarter cash flow from operations was $559 million. Adjusted EPS was $0.03 in the quarter, when excluding after-tax charges and credits of $5.43 per diluted share. 
The total after-tax charges and credits largely reflect noncash goodwill and asset impairment charges of $2.3 billion, which we disclosed earlier this month and are detailed in our earnings release: a valuation allowance of $108 million impacting the tax provision, separation cost of $47 million and a net restructuring credit of $1 million, which included gain of $83 million in Subsea related to the consolidation of a PLSV joint venture. These charges reflect the specific actions we are taking to better position our company for 2020 and beyond, as Doug outlined in his remarks. 
Included in our adjusted earnings are items for which we do not provide guidance, including an expense resulted from increased liability to joint venture partners of $0.22 per diluted share and foreign exchange losses of $0.13 per diluted share. The FX impact, which is included in corporate expense, was almost entirely driven by the significant devaluation of the Angolan Kwanza in the period. These 2 items impacted our adjusted EPS by $0.35 in the period and excluded our adjusted EPS would have been $0.38 per diluted share. And lastly, with regard to internal control, we have fully remediated all previously disclosed material weaknesses. This will be reflected in our upcoming annual filings. 
Turning to the operational highlights in the quarter. Subsea delivered fourth quarter revenues of $1.5 billion, a 21% increase versus the prior year quarter. We experienced double-digit growth in both project and services activity in the period. IEPCI project activity continues to represent an increasing share of revenue, reflective of the well-established market trend towards integrated project development. 
The increase in services revenue was driven by higher installation, well intervention and asset refurbishment activities. Subsequently, subsea services' revenue was essentially unchanged despite the seasonal impact of weather. And adjusted EBITDA for Subsea was $185 million, with a margin of 12.4%. Adjusted EBITDA improved modestly from the prior year as cost reduction activities and project completions offset the impact of a more competitively priced backlog. 
Onshore/Offshore reported fourth quarter revenue of $1.8 billion, an increase of 10% from the prior year quarter, primarily driven by higher activity. Adjusted EBITDA was $260 million with a margin of 14.2%. Operating results in the period benefited from the strength in execution across the portfolio. 
And finally, in Surface Technologies, revenue of $408 million was down 2% versus the prior year, while sequentially, we saw modest improvement as we benefited from the strength in international markets, offset by the lower North American activity. Sequentially, adjusted EBITDA margin of 13.7% increased 250 basis points and reflects the benefit of a higher international mix of business and cost reduction activities. 
Turning to cash. We have now generated positive operating cash flow for 6 consecutive quarters. In the fourth quarter, we recorded $459 million of cash flow from operations, some of which resulted from the timing differences between project milestones and vendor payments. 
Operating cash flow was $849 million for the full year. Beyond the operating line, capital expenditures were $86 million in the period. Our full year spend was $374 million when excluding the $80 million impact of the sale-leaseback transaction for the Dive Support Vessel we recorded earlier in the year. 
We paid $58 million in shareholder dividends in the quarter and for the full year, we made $233 million in total dividend payments. Additionally, we made a distribution of $119 million to the Yamal joint venture partners. We ended the year with $5.2 billion of cash on hand. 
Now I would like to provide additional details around our 2020 financial guidance. With regard to our revenue guidance, please note that the segments reflect the new business perimeters as reflected in our separation announcement. Businesses with approximately $120 million of revenue in 2019, most of which came from Surface Technologies, are now included in our Onshore/Offshore segment in 2020. 
Let me highlight the revenue coverage from backlog. In Subsea, at the midpoint of our guidance approximately 71% of our anticipated 2020 revenue is expected from backlog scheduled for execution in the current year. We anticipate the remaining revenue, approximately $1.8 billion, will be met by book and turn activity from both subsea services and projects. Subsea services' revenue is expected to exceed $1 billion in the year. Only a modest amount of this revenue potentially is in backlog today and most services orders quickly convert into revenues. In Onshore/Offshore, backlog supports approximately 86% of our expected revenue for 2020 at the midpoint. We anticipate approximately $400 million to $500 million in revenue from Yamal LNG. 
Turning to the remaining guidance items for 2020. We expect corporate expense net to be $180 million to $190 million for the full year, when excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. We expect net interest expense of $80 million to $90 million for the full year, when excluding the impact of revaluation of partners mandatorily redeemable financial liability. The increase from the prior year is largely the result of lower interest income associated with the company's cash balances. We forecast a full year tax rate in the range of 28% to 32%. Capital expenditures for 2020 should be no greater than $450 million, and we expect cash flow from operating activities to exceed $1 billion, with the back half of the year being a little stronger than the first half. 
In closing, Subsea revenue benefited from increasing activity in both projects and services, while order growth reflected the acceleration in market adoption of our new Subsea Technologies and integrated Subsea model. Onshore/Offshore revenue has clearly inflected from the 2018 trough as evidenced by the achievement of our third quarter of sequential revenue growth. While in Surface Technologies, we continue to leverage the strength of our international franchise. Lastly, we generated nearly $850 million in operating cash flow in 2018, with positive results in all 4 quarters. 
Looking ahead, we begin 2020 with more than $24 billion of secured backlog. We have strong revenue coverage for the year in both Subsea and Onshore/Offshore. We see revenue growth in all 3 segments at the midpoint of our revenue guidance range. As importantly, we are proactively taking actions across all our businesses in support of our focus on market leadership and continued business transformation. And in 2020, we expect operating cash flow to exceed $1 billion.

Obviously, a decent Q4, the guidance is pretty good, quite high restructuring charges. I just wondered if you could give us a little bit more detail there on what you're doing to drive improved performance as we head into next year? And what the ultimate size of the opportunity is? 
And secondly, around Subsea, I mean I think the guide for 2020 is maybe a little bit weaker than had been expected. I mean can you just clarify any reason for the deviation? And just actually an update on comments on the external environment, things like pricing, et cetera, and also just the gap between margins on integrated awards and normal awards and when we see that benefit really coming through your business in the results you deliver?"

I think I captured 4, if not 5, there. What I'm going to do is, I'm going to walk us a little bit through the Subsea margin guidance because I actually think that will, in some ways, address most of the other parts of your question, and quite frankly, maybe is the most prevalent and what is most new at this point. And if you don't mind, James, I'm going to take just a little bit of time on this, and I think it's important that we kind of walk through the progression of this cycle and would ended up resulting in our 2020 guidance. 
So as you know, for TechnipFMC, we had tremendous inbound order growth of more than 50% in 2019. And by the middle of the year, following the very robust orders of the first half, our integrated projects or iEPCI was representing more than 50% of the total Subsea orders. And at that time, I stated my confidence that 2019 would likely mark the margin trough at the time. However, I also noted that 2020 would be a transition year, with the main outstanding question for us being more about the progression of the margin improvement. 
If we go back to what we talked about a few times, as an iEPCI company and the only integrated company, we have the benefit of being involved in the whole life cycle, but that also means that the conversion of the inbound or the orders into revenue happens over a longer period of time. So again, we first have to design and build the equipment and this takes 18 to 24 months before we can install and commission, which can take up to another 18 months. Meaning that the orders from the first half of 2019 won't really drive margin improvement until late 2020 and beyond, as I had stated in earlier calls. 
I've also said the inception of the integrated business model that we will continue to prioritize our assets for these iEPCI projects and for our alliance partners. This was quite important as it has been a very competitive period when bidding only day rate contracts on vessels. And while I was clear that this strategy would result in lower utilization during this period we ultimately will benefit from a higher quality backlog, driven by direct awards from both our alliance partners and those that we convert from integrated feed to iEPCI projects. And we now have delivered on the first part of this strategy as evidenced by the strength of our 2019 inbound. 
Our Subsea guidance that was issued last night is also consistent with this message. And while it is still possible that 2019 was the absolute margin trough, the significant ramp in activity we are experiencing not only impacts our company directly, but also our suppliers in the supply chain in general. 
The elasticity of the supply base has not proven to be as robust as that of our own company. Therefore, we are experiencing incremental costs to strengthen our supply chain. These efforts are well underway. As these transitory costs come down and as we move further into the offshore campaigns, we remain confident in our ability to achieve or exceed our stated guidance, driven in part by the higher utilization of all of our assets. It's important to emphasize our strategy and outlook remain unchanged, and we are confident we will deliver double-digit revenue growth in 2020, and we will remain confident that we will deliver margin expansion over the coming years. 
With that, I'll pass it to Maryann to talk a little bit about the restructuring charges that we have announced today."

I think your first question was referencing the restructuring charges in North America, as you've probably seen, we've recorded about $37 million directly attributable to Surface. You heard Doug say we're taking a very focused approach in ensuring that we are exiting businesses and product lines where we are not meeting the profitability there. So that charge that we recorded in the quarter represents the exit of certain product lines and certain head count reductions. And as you can imagine, that is largely North America related, so that we see performance improvement deliver the margin improvement and the success that we are focused on for 2020. So that's what you're seeing being recorded in the third quarter, again, largely attributed to North America."

And all of that combined at the same time, has to be translated through this, has to trickle through the supply chain, if you will. We've been working with the supply chain. We've resolved most of the matters, we're very well advanced. I don't want to leave any doubt, and I appreciate the follow-up question that the matters are well under control. 
I'm just pointing to the fact of going back to 6 -- almost 9 months ago now and the comments about the 2019 being the trough in the margin and where we came out with the guidance, which was, I think, just a small rounding year below that, was really just to emphasize and put a little bit of color around what's actually happening. So to your question, yes, we see -- we'll have the normal seasonal activity, decrease in activity in the first quarter, there's no way around that that just has to do with certain geographies at which there's very little subsea activity because of the sea conditions in the first quarter, but we would expect to see a ramp in through the end of the year and an exit rate that would be more reflective of the type of margins that we will be able to generate from this much high-quality and high level of inbound that we had in the first half of 2019."

In terms of the iEPCI, the way I look at it, Angie, is it is kind of -- it's just our way of doing business going forward. We -- so I think that we've somewhat established that. And I believe even the rest of the industry is now acknowledging that, which I guess is somewhat flattering. Where we go in 2020 versus 2019, I see no reason why the percentage of iEPCI would not be at a similar or a greater level than it was in 2019. Again, we have a very healthy portfolio of integrated FEED studies, it's important to remember that our ability -- when we convert those integrated FEED studies to integrated EPCI projects, these become direct awards to our company. We also have an expanding list of exclusive iEPCI alliances. We added 2 more in 2019 with 2 additional customers, meaning 100% of their integrated work is coming -- or 100% of their Subsea work is coming to us through our new integrated model. 
So with that, I would expect, over time, as we've clearly demonstrated in just 2 years from 0 to close to 50% of our business being integrated, a trend that is very likely to continue, not just for us, but eventually for the rest of the industry as well. 
So I think that continues to look quite strong. In terms of the absolute order level, always hard to tell -- hard to state at this point in the year, and we don't give absolute guidance on order intake. It's very difficult, given the size of our projects and the difficulty to time them within a particular 12-month period but what we do show is an opportunity set over the next 24 months, we publish that, we update that regularly. It remains robust. But I remind you that a large percentage of our awards don't show on that list. That is the projects that are, let's say, publicly available to us and to our competition or some of our competition that would qualify to do that work. We have that exclusive set of proprietary opportunities, again, from our alliance partners or from the iEPCI, integrated FEED studies, excuse me, that can turn into direct award iEPCIs if we reach a certain project economic threshold that benefits both the client as well as ourselves, typically driven by an accelerated time to first oil. 
When we look at it, and that's the reason I made the comment I did, yes, 2019 was a very robust year. Some things, obviously, would have to continue to have a very strong year and would have to have some things go right in 2020 to be able to match that level of order inbound. We had some $1 billion-plus awards in 2018 and in '19. We may not see those $1 billion-plus awards in 2020, although we do have a portfolio of large opportunities that if they all came together, and the timing all happen by the 31st of December of 2020, we could be in that -- we could be in a very similar range as we are going forward from 2020 versus 2019."

So when it's a greenfield project, and we are providing the full iEPCI, including the life of field contract, which we call ILOF or integrated life of field contract, most of those come with a certain level of capital expenditure in order to support a 15-, 20-, 25-, even 30-year life of field Subsea contract.

We have a complete understanding of what's happening. And we took that into account and reflected that in our guidance. So hard to quantify the exact impact. But I guess, you can tell by the guidance level that we provide, it's not hugely -- it's not a huge number. And it's well under control which is why we were able to provide the guidance and the confidence that we have in the guidance for 2020 of at least 11%. 
In terms of the guidelines around utilization, again, we don't really see utilization improving much until the second half and really not until 2021, 2022, and that's when we'll see a meaningful impact in the overall improvement of the utilization of the fleet tied to those iEPCI awards."

We announced some asset sales during the last year, and we'll continue -- and we announced a very important partnership as well with Allseas, and we will continue to look at ways that we can work collaboratively with anyone, anyone at all, in order to ensure success for the industry going forward, and once again, make it a very attractive place for the investment community to put their money because of the type of margins that we'll be able to demonstrate on a through-cycle basis. 
If we keep looking at it individually as to the own size of our assets, regardless of what type of assets they are, we tend to end up in a situation where the industry is overcapitalized and we don't generate the type of returns that are required.

So the issue, as we know, is there's a phenomenon called stress corrosion cracking. It happens when a few conditions are met.

So the issue, as we know, is there's a phenomenon called stress corrosion cracking. It happens when a few conditions are met. Those conditions are very prevalent in the pre-salt reservoirs and the pre-salt composition of the hydrocarbons that are produced. And therefore, we see an accelerated rate of stress corrosion cracking in that environment. Why am I emphasizing that? This is a well-known physical phenomenon. It happens anywhere where they're steel in -- placed in a certain condition where this type of event can occur. By the way, a standing structure, a bridge, if you will, made out of steel is experiencing stress corrosion cracking. It's not -- it's absolutely well-known and understood. 
When the pre-salt was developed because of the high CO2 content and the fact that a flexible riser when the annulus is flooded, can accelerate that phenomenon. So it's a well-known phenomenon. It just becomes accelerated. So look, the industry had a -- this is an industry phenomenon. We are, obviously, the leader in the flexible pipe, both technology and certainly in the installed base and continue to be. 
So we've been working very actively, actually, with industry, but very much directly with Petrobras and making sure that we could clearly understand the phenomenon in this condition and then be able to model it so that we could predict the -- let's say, the impact of the effects of distressed corrosion cracking, whilst at the same time and in parallel, developing solutions that will be less -- will be more resistant or even stress corrosion crack -- SEC, if you will, stress corrosion cracking free. And that's exactly the process -- and that's what we're doing. So it's multidimensional as I'm pointing out. 
We are well advanced on the first element, which is now being able to model and predict and working very closely with Petrobras on that. So it's very -- it's a combined issue, and it's now a well-understood issue, and we're able to model it. 
At the same time, we're developing the solutions hand-in-hand with Petrobras. And we're very pleased. And they are -- more importantly, they are very pleased with the progress that we're making. We just had a review on the subject matter 2 weeks ago with the Petrobras leadership team, and we'll continue to work with them in an open and collaborative way to solve this industry -- to solve this industry phenomenon and ensure that we will have a product that they'll be able to use across their portfolio because it's important to understand what we're really talking about is a small application of flexible pipe. If you look at the total amount of flexible pipes sold, this is a very small portion of that total market that is impacted. It's not all of Brazil, it's not all of Petrobras, it's not all of pre-salt. It's in a very specific isolated situation. That being said, we're committed to solving it, as I pointed out and are making good progress in that situation. 
In regards to the rest of the business around our flexible product line, it continues unchanged, if you will, and continues to be quite robust."

We're even more thankful that in 2017, we completed the transaction and, obviously, most thankful for the recognition by our clients in the amount of over $7 billion of integrated awards that they've given us thus far, the vast majority of those being direct awarded to our company. So we're just very thankful for the situation we're in. 
In regards to technology leadership in Subsea, it's, obviously, an important -- it's one of the important elements. The commercial model has been hugely successful, but the ability to be able to merge that with a technology program that not only drives the Subsea -- expansion of the Subsea market in an example like 20K that you pointed out, which is very important, indeed. It also can be fundamentally change the way that we conduct our business or our operating model, both in terms of our physical footprint as well as in terms of our assets. 
So Subsea 2.0 has had a profound impact on our manufacturing footprint in a positive way, if you will, from a cost point of view or from a returns point of view, and I strongly believe that Subsea 3.0 and beyond will have the same type of impact on the installation capabilities going forward for ourselves and ultimately for the industry."

Thank you for participating in our fourth quarter earnings call. 2019 proved to be a year of significant growth for our company. We achieved an unprecedented level of inbound in the year equal",1506,"Thank you very much, Matt. Good morning, and good afternoon. Thank you for participating in our fourth quarter earnings call. 
2019 proved to be a year of significant growth for our company. We achieved an unprecedented level of inbound in the year equaling $22.7 billion, representing order growth of nearly 60% versus the prior year. Our success was driven by an acceleration in the market adoption of our new Subsea technologies; our integrated subsea model, iEPCI; and continued strength in both LNG and downstream project sanctioning. 
In Subsea, full year inbound of $8 billion grew more than 50% versus 2018. This was the highest annual growth rate for our company in over a decade and more than 2x the industry's growth. This growth was driven by iEPCI with our award value more than doubling prior year levels and accounting for more than 40% of total inbound orders. IEPCI is no longer just an alternative commercial model, it has become the model of choice for most of our customers. 
In Onshore/Offshore, inbound orders grew almost 80% versus 2018, driven by more than $8 billion in LNG awards. This included the Arctic LNG 2 contract from NovaTek, which builds upon the success of Yamal LNG. We were also part of the winning consortium on ExxonMobil's Rovuma LNG project, although we recorded limited inbound value ahead of the project FID expected this year. 
Total company backlog now stands at $24.3 billion, an increase of 67% from the same time last year. Backlog grew across all segments, with Onshore/Offshore increasing almost 90% versus 2018. Importantly, over half of our total backlog is scheduled for execution beyond 2020, providing us with unrivaled visibility. 
Total company revenue in 2019 exceeded $13 billion, benefiting from higher activity across all segments. Full year Subsea revenue increased 14% in the year led by a 15% growth in Subsea services and an increasing mix of integrated project activity. 
2019 also marked a trough for segment revenue in Onshore/Offshore. We have seen the revenue inflection and have now experienced 3 consecutive quarters of sequential revenue growth. And when excluding Yamal LNG, total segment revenue increased more than 25% versus 2018, demonstrating solid growth and diversity in the remaining businesses. 
And in Surface Technologies, we experienced growth of more than 15% outside North America. Our international business now accounts for more than half of segment revenue. This strong growth more than offset the decline in North America, with a total segment delivering a modest revenue increase. 
Now let me turn to our market outlook and segment guidance for the coming year. Starting with Subsea, we anticipate ongoing momentum in activity for small to midsized brownfield projects and a continued healthy outlook for greenfield projects. Activity continues to be driven in part by emerging markets such as Mozambique and Guyana and strengthening activity in important markets such as Brazil and Africa. 
We also anticipate that subsea services will again experience double-digit revenue growth, driven in part by digital monitoring services, well intervention and asset refurbishment activities. This strength in both project activity and subsea services provides the framework for 2020 Subsea orders to approach the level achieved in 2019. However, this remains dependent upon the timing of 1 or 2 major project awards.
Turning to Subsea guidance. We see revenue in a range of $6.2 billion to $6.5 billion and adjusted EBITDA margin of at least 11%. In the first quarter, we expect to see normal seasonal impact with margin improvement over the remainder of the year due to project timing and increased asset utilization. 
For Onshore/Offshore, we remain confident that additional LNG projects will be sanctioned in the near to intermediate term. The outlook for long-term demand requires this additional capacity. And just this morning, Sempra Energy announced the selection of TechnipFMC as the EPC contractor for their Energia Costa Azul LNG project. We are very proud to have been chosen for this strategic development. 
Beyond LNG, we continue to selectively pursue refining, petrochemical and biofuel project opportunities in Europe, the Middle East, Asia and North America, particularly where we can benefit from early engagement or leverage our process technology portfolio. 
For Onshore/Offshore guidance, we see revenue in a range of $7.5 billion to $7.8 billion and adjusted EBITDA margin of at least 10%, reflecting a lower contribution from Yamal LNG and an increasing contribution from projects in early stages. This guidance includes the impacts that we can estimate at this time for the coronavirus. 
In Surface Technologies, we anticipate double-digit revenue growth outside of North America, driven by market activity and supported by our high tier products and technologies. This growth serves as a strong foundation to our outlook as our international franchise makes up more than 50% of total segment revenue. We anticipate North America activity to decline 10% versus 2019, which assumes an improvement in drilling and completions activity in the second half of the year. 
For Surface Technologies guidance, we expect revenue in a range of $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion and adjusted EBITDA margin of at least 12%. 
Maryann will cover all other guidance related topics later in this call. In addition to this tremendous commercial success in 2019, we have been taking actions to better position ourselves for 2020 and beyond. The announced separation of our company is a bold visible step in this regard. But only represents one aspect of the transformation that is taking place in our company. 
In Subsea, we are further optimizing our organization. To maintain market leadership, you need a combination of innovative technologies, fit-for-purpose assets and global execution capabilities in order to deliver an integrated value chain. 
Part of our optimization efforts are focused on our assets, ensuring that we have the right assets with the right partners in the right geographies. And to achieve this, we will continue to rightsize and reallocate our assets to better align with the advantages of new technologies such as Subsea 2.0 and integrated project delivery. And we are also forming new strategic partnerships as demonstrated in our recent announcement with Allseas that can provide us with access to unique assets in a more capital-efficient manner. These actions will lower our operating and capital costs and increase asset utilization. And when coupled with the accelerating adoption of our next-generation Subsea products and technologies, they can help our customers reduce cost and cycle time for greater efficiency. 
In Surface Technologies, we will leverage the strength of our international franchise in order to capitalize on the growth we anticipate in the Middle East, Asia Pacific and the North Sea. In North America, we continue to transform our business by working with our customers to further drive well site operational efficiencies and lower greenhouse gas emissions. We are optimizing our services in operating geographies and when the economic returns don't make sense, we will look to exit rather than simply optimize to the status quo. 
And in Onshore/Offshore, which will very soon become Technip Energies, we are transitioning into a new growth cycle, one that is underpinned by the strength of more than $15 billion in project backlog. Our global teams have successfully executed complex projects in some of the most remote regions, and we will continue to leverage this experience and intense focus on the work that lies ahead. And we will remain selective in our project choices focusing on those prospects that offer the best opportunity for success for both our customers and TechnipFMC. 
As you can see, we are taking actions across all of our businesses. Importantly, these initiatives are supportive of our strategy focused on market leadership and business transformation. 2019 was another transformational year for TechnipFMC. In August, we announced we would further reshape our future through the separation of our company into 2 industry-leading, diversified pure-plays. The spinoff remains on track for completion in the second quarter. As we have also shared, our new company, Technip Energies, plans to host a Capital Markets Day in Paris ahead of the transaction close. 
In 2019, we reinforced our position as the only fully integrated technology and services company. In Subsea, we exceeded 100% growth in iEPCI inbound, driven by an acceleration in the market adoption of our integrated model. 
IEPCI, which served as the catalyst for the merger, accounted for more than 40% of the total Subsea inbound orders in 2019 and has become the model of choice for most of our customers. When combined with double-digit growth in subsea services, we delivered full year Subsea inbound of $8 billion, an increase of more than 50% versus 2018. And in Surface Technologies, we grew more than 15% outside of North America when compared to the prior year, with international revenues now accounting for more than half of the segment revenue. 
Our significant growth in backlog across all segments validates our strategy and provides us with confidence in our outlook. We continue to demonstrate our global leadership in Subsea, LNG and the international surface market. 
I will now turn the call over to Maryann to further discuss our financial results."

Total company revenue in the fourth quarter was $3.7 billion, with adjusted EBITDA of $404 million. Fourth quarter cash flow from operations was $559 million. Adjusted EPS was $0.03 in the quarter, when excluding after-tax charges and credit",1104,"Thanks, Doug. Total company revenue in the fourth quarter was $3.7 billion, with adjusted EBITDA of $404 million. Fourth quarter cash flow from operations was $559 million. Adjusted EPS was $0.03 in the quarter, when excluding after-tax charges and credits of $5.43 per diluted share. 
The total after-tax charges and credits largely reflect noncash goodwill and asset impairment charges of $2.3 billion, which we disclosed earlier this month and are detailed in our earnings release: a valuation allowance of $108 million impacting the tax provision, separation cost of $47 million and a net restructuring credit of $1 million, which included gain of $83 million in Subsea related to the consolidation of a PLSV joint venture. These charges reflect the specific actions we are taking to better position our company for 2020 and beyond, as Doug outlined in his remarks. 
Included in our adjusted earnings are items for which we do not provide guidance, including an expense resulted from increased liability to joint venture partners of $0.22 per diluted share and foreign exchange losses of $0.13 per diluted share. The FX impact, which is included in corporate expense, was almost entirely driven by the significant devaluation of the Angolan Kwanza in the period. These 2 items impacted our adjusted EPS by $0.35 in the period and excluded our adjusted EPS would have been $0.38 per diluted share. And lastly, with regard to internal control, we have fully remediated all previously disclosed material weaknesses. This will be reflected in our upcoming annual filings. 
Turning to the operational highlights in the quarter. Subsea delivered fourth quarter revenues of $1.5 billion, a 21% increase versus the prior year quarter. We experienced double-digit growth in both project and services activity in the period. IEPCI project activity continues to represent an increasing share of revenue, reflective of the well-established market trend towards integrated project development. 
The increase in services revenue was driven by higher installation, well intervention and asset refurbishment activities. Subsequently, subsea services' revenue was essentially unchanged despite the seasonal impact of weather. And adjusted EBITDA for Subsea was $185 million, with a margin of 12.4%. Adjusted EBITDA improved modestly from the prior year as cost reduction activities and project completions offset the impact of a more competitively priced backlog. 
Onshore/Offshore reported fourth quarter revenue of $1.8 billion, an increase of 10% from the prior year quarter primarily driven by higher activity. Adjusted EBITDA was $260 million with a margin of 14.2%. Operating results in the period benefited from the strength in execution across the portfolio. 
And finally, in Surface Technologies, revenue of $408 million was down 2% versus the prior year, while sequentially, we saw modest improvement as we benefited from the strength in international markets, offset by the lower North American activity. Sequentially, adjusted EBITDA margin of 13.7% increased 250 basis points and reflects the benefit of a higher international mix of business and cost reduction activities. 
Turning to cash. We have now generated positive operating cash flow for 6 consecutive quarters. In the fourth quarter, we recorded $459 million of cash flow from operations, some of which resulted from the timing differences between project milestones and vendor payments. 
Operating cash flow was $849 million for the full year. Beyond the operating line, capital expenditures were $86 million in the period. Our full year spend was $374 million when excluding the $80 million impact of the sale-leaseback transaction for the Dive Support Vessel we recorded earlier in the year. 
We paid $58 million in shareholder dividends in the quarter and for the full year, we made $233 million in total dividend payments. Additionally, we made a distribution of $119 million to the Yamal joint venture partners. We ended the year with $5.2 billion of cash on hand. 
Now I would like to provide additional details around our 2020 financial guidance. With regard to our revenue guidance, please note that the segments reflect the new business perimeters as reflected in our separation announcement. Businesses with approximately $120 million of revenue in 2019, most of which came from Surface Technologies, are now included in our Onshore/Offshore segment in 2020. 
Let me highlight the revenue coverage from backlog. In Subsea, at the midpoint of our guidance approximately 71% of our anticipated 2020 revenue is expected from backlog scheduled for execution in the current year. We anticipate the remaining revenue, approximately $1.8 billion, will be met by book and turn activity from both subsea services and projects. Subsea services' revenue is expected to exceed $1 billion in the year. Only a modest amount of this revenue potentially is in backlog today and most services orders quickly convert into revenues. In Onshore/Offshore, backlog supports approximately 86% of our expected revenue for 2020 at the midpoint. We anticipate approximately $400 million to $500 million in revenue from Yamal LNG. 
Turning to the remaining guidance items for 2020. We expect corporate expense net to be $180 million to $190 million for the full year, when excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. We expect net interest expense of $80 million to $90 million for the full year, when excluding the impact of revaluation of partners mandatorily redeemable financial liability. The increase from the prior year is largely the result of lower interest income associated with the company's cash balances. We forecast a full year tax rate in the range of 28% to 32%. Capital expenditures for 2020 should be no greater than $450 million, and we expect cash flow from operating activities to exceed $1 billion, with the back half of the year being a little stronger than the first half. 
In closing, Subsea revenue benefited from increasing activity in both projects and services, while order growth reflected the acceleration in market adoption of our new Subsea Technologies and integrated Subsea model. Onshore/Offshore revenue has clearly inflected from the 2018 trough as evidenced by the achievement of our third quarter of sequential revenue growth. While in Surface Technologies, we continue to leverage the strength of our international franchise. Lastly, we generated nearly $850 million in operating cash flow in 2018, with positive results in all 4 quarters. 
Looking ahead, we begin 2020 with more than $24 billion of secured backlog. We have strong revenue coverage for the year in both Subsea and Onshore/Offshore. We see revenue growth in all 3 segments at the midpoint of our revenue guidance range. As importantly, we are proactively taking actions across all our businesses in support of our focus on market leadership and continued business transformation. And in 2020, we expect operating cash flow to exceed $1 billion.

Obviously, a decent Q4, the guidance is pretty good, quite high restructuring charges. I just wondered if you could give us a little bit more detail there on what you're doing to drive improved performance as we head into next year? And what the ultimate size of the opportunity is? 
And secondly, around Subsea, I mean I think the guide for 2020 is maybe a little bit weaker than had been expected. I mean can you just clarify any reason for the deviation? And just actually an update on comments on the external environment, things like pricing, et cetera, and also just the gap between margins on integrated awards and normal awards and when we see that benefit really coming through your business in the results you deliver?"

I think I captured 4, if not 5, there. What I'm going to do is, I'm going to walk us a little bit through the Subsea margin guidance because I actually think that will, in some ways, address most of the other parts of your question, and quite frankly, maybe is the most prevalent and what is most new at this point. And if you don't mind, James, I'm going to take just a little bit of time on this, and I think it's important that we kind of walk through the progression of this cycle and would ended up resulting in our 2020 guidance. 
So as you know, for TechnipFMC, we had tremendous inbound order growth of more than 50% in 2019. And by the middle of the year, following the very robust orders of the first half, our integrated projects or iEPCI was representing more than 50% of the total Subsea orders. And at that time, I stated my confidence that 2019 would likely mark the margin trough at the time. However, I also noted that 2020 would be a transition year, with the main outstanding question for us being more about the progression of the margin improvement. 
If we go back to what we talked about a few times, as an iEPCI company and the only integrated company, we have the benefit of being involved in the whole life cycle, but that also means that the conversion of the inbound or the orders into revenue happens over a longer period of time. So again, we first have to design and build the equipment and this takes 18 to 24 months before we can install and commission, which can take up to another 18 months. Meaning that the orders from the first half of 2019 won't really drive margin improvement until late 2020 and beyond, as I had stated in earlier calls. 
I've also said the inception of the integrated business model that we will continue to prioritize our assets for these iEPCI projects and for our alliance partners. This was quite important as it has been a very competitive period when bidding only day rate contracts on vessels. And while I was clear that this strategy would result in lower utilization during this period we ultimately will benefit from a higher quality backlog, driven by direct awards from both our alliance partners and those that we convert from integrated feed to iEPCI projects. And we now have delivered on the first part of this strategy as evidenced by the strength of our 2019 inbound. 
Our Subsea guidance that was issued last night is also consistent with this message. And while it is still possible that 2019 was the absolute margin trough, the significant ramp in activity we are experiencing not only impacts our company directly, but also our suppliers in the supply chain in general. 
The elasticity of the supply base has not proven to be as robust as that of our own company. Therefore, we are experiencing incremental costs to strengthen our supply chain. These efforts are well underway. As these transitory costs come down and as we move further into the offshore campaigns, we remain confident in our ability to achieve or exceed our stated guidance, driven in part by the higher utilization of all of our assets. It's important to emphasize our strategy and outlook remain unchanged, and we are confident we will deliver double-digit revenue growth in 2020, and we will remain confident that we will deliver margin expansion over the coming years. 
With that, I'll pass it to Maryann to talk a little bit about the restructuring charges that we have announced today."

You heard Doug say we're taking a very focused approach in ensuring that we are exiting businesses and product lines where we are not meeting the profitability there. So that charge that we recorded in the quarter represents the exit of certain product lines and certain head count reductions. And as you can imagine, that is largely North America related, so that we see performance improvement deliver the margin improvement and the success that we are focused on for 2020. So that's what you're seeing being recorded in the third quarter, again, largely attributed to North America."

And all of that combined at the same time, has to be translated through this, has to trickle through the supply chain, if you will. We've been working with the supply chain. We've resolved most of the matters, we're very well advanced. I don't want to leave any doubt, and I appreciate the follow-up question that the matters are well under control. 
I'm just pointing to the fact of going back to 6 -- almost 9 months ago now and the comments about the 2019 being the trough in the margin and where we came out with the guidance, which was, I think, just a small rounding year below that, was really just to emphasize and put a little bit of color around what's actually happening. So to your question, yes, we see -- we'll have the normal seasonal activity, decrease in activity in the first quarter, there's no way around that that just has to do with certain geographies at which there's very little subsea activity because of the sea conditions in the first quarter, but we would expect to see a ramp in through the end of the year and an exit rate that would be more reflective of the type of margins that we will be able to generate from this much high-quality and high level of inbound that we had in the first half of 2019."

And I believe even the rest of the industry is now acknowledging that,",527,"Sure. In terms of the iEPCI, the way I look at it, Angie, is it is kind of -- it's just our way of doing business going forward. We -- so I think that we've somewhat established that. And I believe even the rest of the industry is now acknowledging that, which I guess is somewhat flattering. Where we go in 2020 versus 2019, I see no reason why the percentage of iEPCI would not be at a similar or a greater level than it was in 2019. Again, we have a very healthy portfolio of integrated FEED studies, it's important to remember that our ability -- when we convert those integrated FEED studies to integrated EPCI projects, these become direct awards to our company. We also have an expanding list of exclusive iEPCI alliances. We added 2 more in 2019 with 2 additional customers, meaning 100% of their integrated work is coming -- or 100% of their Subsea work is coming to us through our new integrated model. 
So with that, I would expect, over time, as we've clearly demonstrated in just 2 years from 0 to close to 50% of our business being integrated, a trend that is very likely to continue, not just for us, but eventually for the rest of the industry as well. 
So I think that continues to look quite strong. In terms of the absolute order level, always hard to tell -- hard to state at this point in the year, and we don't give absolute guidance on order intake. It's very difficult, given the size of our projects and the difficulty to time them within a particular 12-month period but what we do show is an opportunity set over the next 24 months, we publish that, we update that regularly. It remains robust. But I remind you that a large percentage of our awards don't show on that list. That is the projects that are, let's say, publicly available to us and to our competition or some of our competition that would qualify to do that work. We have that exclusive set of proprietary opportunities, again, from our alliance partners or from the iEPCI, integrated FEED studies, excuse me, that can turn into direct award iEPCIs if we reach a certain project economic threshold that benefits both the client as well as ourselves, typically driven by an accelerated time to first oil. 
When we look at it, and that's the reason I made the comment I did, yes, 2019 was a very robust year. Some things, obviously, would have to continue to have a very strong year and would have to have some things go right in 2020 to be able to match that level of order inbound.

So the issue, as we know, is there's a phenomenon called stress corrosion cracking. It happens when a few conditions are met. Those conditions are very prevalent in the pre-salt reservoirs and the pre-salt composition of the hydrocarbons that are produced. And therefore, we see an accelerated rate of stress corrosion cracking in that environment. Why am I emphasizing that? This is a well-known physical phenomenon. It happens anywhere where they're steel in -- placed in a certain condition where this type of event can occur. By the way, a standing structure, a bridge, if you will, made out of steel is experiencing stress corrosion cracking. It's not -- it's absolutely well-known and understood. 
When the pre-salt was developed because of the high CO2 content and the fact that a flexible riser when the annulus is flooded, can accelerate that phenomenon. So it's a well-known phenomenon. It just becomes accelerated. So look, the industry had a -- this is an industry phenomenon. We are, obviously, the leader in the flexible pipe, both technology and certainly in the installed base and continue to be. 
So we've been working very actively, actually, with industry, but very much directly with Petrobras and making sure that we could clearly understand the phenomenon in this condition and then be able to model it so that we could predict the -- let's say, the impact of the effects of distressed corrosion cracking, whilst at the same time and in parallel, developing solutions that will be less -- will be more resistant or even stress corrosion crack -- SEC, if you will, stress corrosion cracking free. And that's exactly the process -- and that's what we're doing. So it's multidimensional as I'm pointing out. 
We are well advanced on the first element, which is now being able to model and predict and working very closely with Petrobras on that. So it's very -- it's a combined issue, and it's now a well-understood issue, and we're able to model it. 
At the same time, we're developing the solutions hand-in-hand with Petrobras. And we're very pleased. And they are -- more importantly, they are very pleased with the progress that we're making. We just had a review on the subject matter 2 weeks ago with the Petrobras leadership team, and we'll continue to work with them in an open and collaborative way to solve this industry -- to solve this industry phenomenon and ensure that we will have a product that they'll be able to use across their portfolio because it's important to understand what we're really talking about is a small application of flexible pipe. If you look at the total amount of flexible pipes sold, this is a very small portion of that total market that is impacted. It's not all of Brazil, it's not all of Petrobras, it's not all of pre-salt. It's in a very specific isolated situation. That being said, we're committed to solving it, as I pointed out and are making good progress in that situation. 
In regards to the rest of the business around our flexible product line, it continues unchanged, if you will, and continues to be quite robust."

So Subsea 2.0 has had a profound impact on our manufacturing footprint in a positive way, if you will, from a cost point of view or from a returns point of view, and I strongly believe that Subsea 3.0 and beyond will have the same type of impact on the installation capabilities going forward for ourselves and ultimately for the industry."

Thank you for participating in our first quarter earnings call. With me today are Maryann Mannen, Chief Financial Officer; and Catherine MacGregor, President of Technip Energies.

With me today are Maryann Mannen, Chief Financial Officer; and Catherine MacGregor, President of Technip Energies. I also note that we have dialed in from different locations across the globe, another sign of the impact that COVID-19 continues to have on our daily lives. 
2 months ago, we provided our initial view of 2020. Over those 2 months, much about the world has changed, including the spread of COVID-19, the shift in OPEC policy and the sharp sell-off in equity markets. Most of these effects will normalize, while others will lead to real lasting change. Today, I want to share with you some of the specific actions we are taking in direct response to the market environment and how these actions will further reshape TechnipFMC as we transition to the new energy landscape. Over the short term, we are taking immediate actions to protect our people, reduce costs and preserve liquidity. First, amongst these, is the responsibility we all have to protect the health and safety of our employees, contractors and customers we serve. And we have taken a number of specific actions in this effort. These include on-site prevention measures such as social distancing, staggered shifts and health screening, ensure safe work requirement and [Audio Gap] may have been exposed to the virus that extend beyond recommended guidelines. [Audio Gap] poised with the appropriate equipment and services to work remotely when possible, establishing protocols that allow for remote inspection of manufacturing processes and leveraging our global footprint by transferring lessons learned. Collectively, these actions have allowed most of our vessels, manufacturing and service locations to operate throughout this period, providing us with the ability to advance many projects and meet customer requirements, albeit at a reduced productivity. Second, on April 1, we announced a series of cost-reduction initiatives that will result in an annualized savings of at least $130 million from our Surface Technologies segment and corporate. And we have now identified actions that will result in additional savings of more than $220 million that will extend across the entire company. The total annualized savings are now estimated to exceed $350 million, and we anticipate achieving the targeted run rate by the end of this year. Additionally, we have announced the revision to executive compensation, which includes a 30% reduction of my salary and a 20% trim through the end of the year. Our directors are also reducing their cash retainer by 30%. And the third measure we are taking is intended to further preserve our cash and liquidity. The company's Board of Directors announced earlier this week that it has chosen to lower the annual dividend by 75% to $0.13 per share, reducing the annual cash outflow by $175 million when compared to the previous year's distribution. Back in March, we also announced our decision to postpone the company's separation into 2 diversified pure plays. This was a very difficult decision, particularly given the late-stage of separation activities. Strategic rationale remains unchanged, and we are fully committed to completing the transaction over the medium term. And to further emphasize this point, we have renamed the Onshore/Offshore segment to Technip Energies and have completed nearly all of the work required to ensure that the 2 companies are ready for separation when the markets sufficiently recover. 
Looking longer term, it is clear that the energy industry must continue to evolve. The challenges we face will not resolve themselves. Things will be different and companies must no doubt. TechnipFMC has been an agent of change from the beginning. And in the current environment, we will look to accelerate our own agenda for change by protecting our core competencies, investing in new technologies and expanding our digital platforms, and we will continue to play a key role in the energy transition. Importantly, we will further strengthen our partner relationships and more closely aligned with those clients that demonstrate a willingness to embrace the new commercial models and new technologies that are critical to success. The change will be most profound for us in subsea. We are taking additional actions to further streamline our organization in support of our vision towards simplification, standardization and reduced cycle times. We are playing to our strengths. Our success is evident by the strong order growth in 2019 and the clear adoption of our integrated model, iEPCI. We anticipate as much as 43% of new equipment orders will come from Subsea 2.0 and with nearly half of our customers now focused on 2.0 as their system of choice. And our Subsea studio digital platform will host 70% of our front-end and system engineering studies, transforming conventional concept, feed and tender phases into ultrafast digital development. iEPCI, Subsea 2.0, Subsea Studio, these are not conventional solutions. Only those that adopt to stay ahead in the new energy landscape, meeting the needs of individual customers in a bespoke fashion requires too many resources, introduces too much cost and project risk and creates too much organizational complexity. Our recognition of the need for change resulted in the creation of TechnipFMC and our pioneering culture will ensure that we remain an industry leader. 
Looking ahead, we will accelerate change where possible and we will align with those clients and partners that see the shared benefits of our way forward. TechnipFMC is well positioned to manage the unprecedented uncertainty due to our strong foundation, one built on the strength of our backlog and balance sheet. $22 billion. That's the amount of total company backlog in hand today. We are not immune to the impacts of reduced capital spending. However, the effects have been largely limited to changes in project scheduling, not project cancellations. This has reduced our near-term revenue from backlog, but it also extends the backlog duration. We have over $8 billion in backlog scheduled for execution over the remainder of 2020. A with the remaining $14 billion scheduled for 2021 and beyond, the size and duration of our backlog, in addition to net liquidity of $5.6 billion, which Maryann will cover in more detail, provide us with the flexibility to take aggressive and bold actions that will better position our company for the future. 
Turning to the market outlook. For Technip Energies, LNG accounts for more than 50% of our current backlog and provides us with very good visibility that extends over several years. Today, we have 3 LNG projects that are contributing to our financial results. Yamal LNG, which is largely complete and is successfully progressing through the warranty phase; floating LNG, which is now more than 2 years into project delivery and over 60% complete; and Arctic LNG 2, our largest project currently under the way, whose revenue contribution will grow in 2020 and extend well beyond. While the near-term outlook for new LNG prospects to reach final investment decision has changed because of COVID-19 and the challenging macro backdrop, the long-term fundamentals for natural gas and LNG, in particular, remain strong, given its critical role as a transition fuel. We continue to be engaged in a range of additional LNG projects. These include Semprus Coastal Azul, which the customers indicated will be sanctioned in the near term. WEBOMR remains an important project for Technip Energies, and despite ExxonMobil's recent decision to delay the project's FID, we continue to engage with the customer to further optimize the project development, and we are continuing with our scope under limited notice to proceed. 
In addition to these projects, we are involved in the commercial process for a major LNG prospect in the Middle East, and we have recently secured FEED rules on several new prospects. Whether the ultimate project count stays at 3 or grows to 4, TechnipFMC remains a partner of choice with project selectivity foremost in our mind as we consider future opportunities. 
Turning to downstream. This sector typically proves to be more resilient through a downturn. Over the course of 2018 and 2019, we secured nearly $9 billion of refining and petrochemical inbound and we remain laser-focused on executing these projects. We see potential for additional prospects to be awarded to us during 2020, one of which could exceed $1 billion. And our strong foothold and energy transition markets beyond LNG continues to increase. In the first quarter, we announced an alliance with Neste to provide front-end loading services for future next BTL projects, which also covers our participation during the execution phase. We are proud to be Neste's partner of choice for renewable diesel projects. We have  also had notable recent success in the area of recycling, including an extension to our long-held alliance with BP to include the Infinia Technology that enables circularity for difficult-to-recycle plastic waste. 
Moving to Surface Technologies. In North America, the quick and significant cuts to industry capital expenditures have impacted the services across the board. Market expectations now called for the rig count for the second quarter to be down by approximately 50% from year-end. Outside North America, investment continues to move forward, but it has been constrained mainly due to logistics and [Audio Gap] additional deferrals are likely. We also expect to benefit from our differentiated capabilities, our high level of vertical integration provides us with more control over our manufacturing and product deliveries and less dependency on external supply chains. This differentiation has helped mitigate delivery disruptions and afforded us new opportunities where industry supply has been challenged. We, therefore, anticipate that international revenues in 2020 will prove to be far more resilient than North America. 
Moving to Subsea. We believe that deep water will become an even more prevalent piece of the energy mix as project economics remain attractive, particularly for brownfield developments. In the near term, we continue to assess the likely impacts of lower capital spending on major project FIDs. Many of our clients are still reviewing their plans and prioritizing their projects. Based on currently available information, we believe that approximately 50% of the nearly $15 billion of total project value reflected on our Subsea opportunities list is still likely to move forward over the next 24 months. All other projects remain active but potentially extending beyond this 24-month time frame. When we think about the next 12 months, we believe as much as 20% of the project value is likely to reach FID and we are well positioned for many of these opportunities. We will provide updates to the list as we gain greater clarity from our clients over the coming months. 
In addition, as we have demonstrated, TechnipFMC has access to a proprietary set of opportunities. These come from our alliance partners or from our unique integrated FEED capabilities, which often lead to direct iEPCI Project awards. And beyond project activity, we generated additional revenue from subsea services activity where we benefit from the industry's largest installed base of Subsea equipment and operation today. We anticipate resiliency in services equity as a result of the expected shift by some clients for greenfield developments to brownfield intervention. 
In our earnings release yesterday, we provided an updated view on guidance for 2020. Although market uncertainty remains and clarification around client capital expenditures is ongoing, I want to offer some additional thoughts in support of these updates at this time. All of the guidance items we have provided assume no further material degradation from the impacts of COVID-19 on our current ability to execute on our project portfolio. 
In Subsea, where we are benefiting from near record levels of inbound, a strong backlog and our resilient subsea services business, we have a solid foundation to navigate through the near term. We continue to engage with our alliance partners and customers in order to align on project scheduling and new capital expenditures. Given this dynamic situation in lieu of traditional guidings, we have provided our expectations for the major inputs that continue to influence our outlook for subsea revenue and margin. 
Turning to revenue first. Our current estimate for backlog to be converted into revenue for the remainder of the year is $3.1 billion. We are still in discussion with many of our customers over project scheduling and there remains risk that some of this backlog could still be rescheduled for execution in future periods. However, the strong inbound booked in 2019 provides us with much greater flexibility to manage our business through this challenging period. If we had not generated directed inbound last year, the planning scenario would look very different for us. It is also clear that the change in backlog scheduling will only defer revenues to future periods providing more revenue coverage in 2021 and beyond. In subsea services, we provide aftermarket services on over 50% of the subsea installed base, generating a resilient revenue stream of approximately $1 billion for the full year. This incorporates our expectation for some modest level of activity deferral, a decrease from our prior expectation for growth. And lastly, with respect to book and turn revenue, our current view is that inbound orders, which serve as the basis for this revenue source could be down as much as 50% versus full year 2019. And next factors impacting subsea margin include our revised expectation for less inbound and therefore, less book and turn revenue for 2020, which we will not be able to fully offset through cost reductions. Several of our manufacturing plants have been running at high utilization. COVID-19 presents real challenges to both the supply chain and our manufacturing workflows. Our prior margin expectation also assumed increased fleet utilization as we progress through the year. We have several installation campaigns that are increasingly at risk of deferment to 2021 due to the impact of travel restrictions, leaving us with the limited flexibility to mitigate costs for find replacement work for these fixed assets over the very near term. 
Looking at the second quarter, we do anticipate a sequential decline in adjusted EBITDA margin when compared to the first quarter, largely due to more significant impact from COVID-19. However, in order to navigate through these headwinds, we are advancing our restructuring plans in Subsea, and we will begin to recognize the benefit of these actions in the second half of the year. 
In summary, having greater clarity on the duration of COVID-19 and the ultimate scheduling of our backlog will provide us the ability to more fully assess our subsea outlook for the remainder of the year. 
Moving to guidance for Technip Energies. We are relatively insulated in the -- in the current period due to the long cycle nature of the business. The resilience and maturity of the projects in backlog and our diversified global footprint. To date, we have been able to mitigate a very significant portion of COVID-19 operational impacts, where the effects relate more to operational efficiencies and timing issues, but not the stoppage of projects. However, the revenue outlook for the has been impacted by first, the delay in a few key project FIDs and the impact of the slower inbound for execution in 2020, much of what we believe has simply shifted beyond the current year. And second, we revised schedules on some of our projects within backlog where certain scopes of work originally planned for 2020 have partly shifted into 2021. Due to these effects, we are revising our revenue guidance to a range of $6.3 billion to $6.8 billion, which remains at or above our 2019 results. Guidance for adjusted EBITDA margin is unchanged from our prior view of at least 10%. The resilience in margin, even with the reduction in revenue, is driven by the continued strength in project execution in this exceptional environment and some benefit from project mix. 
And finally, Surface Technologies, our shorter-cycle business has been most impacted by recent events. Outside of North America, our Surface business is much less impacted by the global spending reductions. International markets are typically more resilient in a downturn, and we expect to benefit from the flight to quality associated with our higher tier products as we have experienced during recent -- during previous cycles. We anticipate our business mix outside of North America will now represent as much as 60% of total segment revenue in 2020. In North America, the actions taken by our clients in response to the sharp decline in commodity prices are almost unprecedented. We are responding aggressively as evidenced by the prior announcement of our intent to deliver more than $100 million in annualized cost savings, most of this will occur in North America, where the industry spending reductions have been particularly severe. With these actions, we believe that we can be modestly profitable in North America for the full year, when excluding charges based on our current outlook. 
Moving beyond the operating segments, we have also provided updates to several other items that were included in our earnings press release and presentation deck. We will provide additional segment guidance and updates as we gain more clarity over the coming months. Without question, this is the most challenging business environment that our industry has ever faced. We are not simply responding to a health crisis or a commodity crisis or an economic basis, we are responding to all 3 on a global stage at the same time. In the face of such extreme uncertainty, we are focusing on what we can control. We are taking steps to ensure that all of our employees and contractors remain safe. We are spending more time with clients than ever before, working with them to better understand their priorities and working together to solve our collective issues, strengthening the relationships we have and building new ones for the road ahead. And we are focused on ensuring business continuity, working diligently and innovatively to solve problems and better anticipate new complexities that may arise from the unforeseen challenges of COVID-19. We are also taking swift and decisive actions in response to the near-term challenges. We are preserving our liquidity with the Board's decision to revise the dividend policy. We have significantly increased our annualized savings target to more than $350 million. This includes additional cost reductions from all of our business segments, our support functions and Executive and Director compensation. We are uniquely positioned with our strong balance sheet and backlog. This includes $5.6 billion in cash and liquidity and nearly $22 billion in total company backlog that extends out for several years. And we are doing all of these things with the support, dedication and commitment of the exceptional women and men of TechnipFMC. Through everything we have faced, they have shown a level of strength and resiliency that is nothing short of inspiring in these most difficult times. 
I will now turn the call over to Maryann to briefly discuss a few highlights of the first quarter and provide you with an update on our cash and liquidity position. Maryann?"

Total company revenue was $3.1 billion in the quarter, an increase of 8% versus the prior year, driven by solid growth in Technip Energies, as well as most growth -- modest growth in subsea. Adjusted EBITDA was $220 million. First quarter",567,"Thank you, Doug. Total company revenue was $3.1 billion in the quarter, an increase of 8% versus the prior year, driven by solid growth in Technip Energies, as well as most growth -- modest growth in subsea. Adjusted EBITDA was $220 million. First quarter cash flow from operations was $28 million. Adjusted loss per share was $0.11 in the quarter when excluding after-tax charges and credits of $7.17 per diluted share. The total after-tax charges and credits of $3.2 billion largely reflect noncash charges for goodwill impairments in the Subsea and Surface Technologies segments. These impairments were due to significant decline in the company's market capitalization since our last measurement period. We have also identified direct COVID-19 expenses totaling $9 million in the quarter. It is important to note that these expenses do not capture the disruption related to overhead absorption, utilization and other operational impacts, which are not specifically called out, but included in our adjusted results. Also included in our adjusted earnings are items for which we do not provide guidance, including an expense resulting from increased liability to the joint venture partners of $0.08 per diluted share and foreign exchange losses of $0.10 per diluted share. These 2 items impacted EPS by $0.18 in the period, and if excluded, our adjusted earnings would have been $0.07 per diluted share. We are responding to the current environment by taking a series of actions in an effort to further reduce costs and preserve liquidity. Doug spoke earlier to the significant increase in our cost reduction target, which now totals $350 million in annualized savings, and we expect this run rate by the end of the year. I also want to reiterate our previously announced reduction to capital expenditures, where we have reduced our prior guidance by $150 million to approximately $300 million for the full year. And this week, the Board -- our Board, revised the dividend policy to $0.13 per share on an annualized basis. The 75% reduction to our annual payout will preserve $175 million in liquidity when compared to the prior year. 
Turning to liquidity. We had $5.6 billion in cash and net liquidity at the end of the quarter. In a recent filing, we provided further transparency to our cash position, which we have updated with our first quarter results. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $5 billion as of March 31. We had just over $3 billion held in project joint ventures. This cash is readily available to us to execute the remaining liabilities on our JV projects. Of this total, approximately $1.8 billion was related to Yamal LNG. This cash is held in support of $1.2 billion in outstanding contract liabilities, from which just over 50% of any future profitability should remain with TechnipFMC. Operating cash and cash equivalents was approximately $1.8 billion, a significant portion of which is readily available for corporate use. We also have a $2.5 billion secured -- senior secured revolving credit facility. At the end of the quarter, our net borrowing capacity under the facility was approximately $600 million, reflecting $1.4 billion of commercial paper outstanding and $500 million of direct borrowing under the revolver. Taken together, this brings our net liquidity to $5.6 billion and provides us with sufficient funds to cover our net project liabilities, near-term debt maturities and any distributions to joint venture partners.

It's very helpful. And I certainly appreciate the uncertainty given COVID and the shifting plans on -- for your customers on their projects. Given the outlook, there's also an emphasis in the market on balance sheet strength and maximizing free cash -- minimizing cash burn. You reduced the dividend. You cut CapEx you're taking cost out, but there are also likely to be some cash drag in 2020 to affect that. Perhaps prepays are less than this year than you would have thought coming into it, particularly with the reduction in the energy's revenue guidance. So if I put all that together, how should investors be thinking about your cash balance and liquidity? Where those could be when we exit this year and head into 2021?"

It was one of the fundamental reasons for creating the company. We've done that very successfully in the execution phase. We're now able to execute projects with a 50% reduction in the normal -- in the time that it would take to do those projects and using a traditional approach. And we've done that on a consistent basis. Hence, the reason we have received repeat awards in almost all cases from the clients that we have served with our new iEPCI model. At the same time, we realized that we need to attack the front end, and we also need to reduce the cycle time associated with the front end. And there's actually 2 ways to do that, Sean. There's the digital platform, which we call Subsea Studio, which is very exciting and dramatically reduces that cycle time. And will begin to also include machine learning, which will allow us to even further improve the field design, the optimization and the cycle time. In addition to that, it is the importance of the ability to be able to deliver technology. And that new technology, coupled with the Subsea Studio digital platform, will dramatically decrease the cycle time of the front end. As we do that, we'll be able to further reduce the cycle time of Subsea projects and vastly improve the project returns, which will become even more critical as we move forward."

It needs to be clarified. It's obviously been a topic of discussion over the last 12 hours, and I think it's important that we clarify. When we provided the 2020 guidance, we specifically stated that Q1,",855,"Now, Michael, thank you very much for the question. It needs to be clarified. It's obviously been a topic of discussion over the last 12 hours, and I think it's important that we clarify. When we provided the 2020 guidance, we specifically stated that Q1, as always, would be the seasonal low point for our company, which was our view at the time. And that seasonal impact really has to do with the ability or the inability for our vessels to operate in certain geographies due to the weather conditions, which always leads to the first quarter being the softest quarter. The consensus number, I have to say, did not take that into account, even though that, that was clearly articulated. So that's point number one. Point number two is the COVID-19 impacts are real and they are meaningful. And I just want to share with you a little bit of what's happening and what we are -- how we're addressing it as a company. I spoke about in my prepared remarks that we're going in above and beyond recommended guidelines. What does that mean? Michael, what that means is that we will never put a price on employee health and well-being. So we are taking extraordinary efforts to ensure that especially in confined environments like operating on our vessels or operating offshore, we don't put other employees at risk or other or contractors and clients that we're working with. So we actually had a situation on a vessel where we identified symptoms, potential COVID-related symptoms with an individual. We didn't just remove that individual and continued business as normal. We went above and beyond. We took the extraordinary decision to shut down operations on that vessel for 14 days to test all employees on that vessel. As a result of that, we now know we prevented -- we could have had a much more significant impact on the health and well-being of our employees. We're now doing that across the entire fleet. We are testing all individuals prior to them going into service. When we're finding a number of positive cases and being able to prevent that. In addition, we had 2 vessels that were unable to operate for a period of time, simply due to crew availability due to travel restrictions that were in place and imparted in different parts of the world. If you take all of that into account, it almost had 100 basis point impact on the adjusted EBITDA margin for the business. So these are real, and these are meaningful. In addition to that, we continue to manage a very complex supply chain in terms of impact on delivery and our ability to achieve certain milestones of delivery of finished product or finished goods. But it's not just the supply chain, it's also the logistics. We work very hard to keep most of our manufacturing footprint open and to be able to continue to advance progress on projects. But often, it comes down to the inability to be able to ship or transport due the local regulatory constraints in terms of the closure of ports, airports, marine ports, et cetera. So these are all the type of things that we're dealing with. So I'm going to just recap by saying, Michael, the seasonal impact needed -- was there and needed to be taken into account and wasn't. On top of that, we had a significant impact on the utilization of our fleet, some of which was simply imposed by ourselves. We weren't going to just keep working in an environment that we thought to put the health and well-being of our people at risk. We won't do that. So instead, we took that additional impact to our operating margin, but I will always make that decision. And then finally, the ongoing challenges and constraints in the supply chain and logistics and shipping that we'll continue to face and will face additional constraints in the second quarter. So looking towards the second quarter, as stated in my prepared remarks, we won't just have the 30 to 40 days of the COVID impact, will obviously have even more. So as we've said, that we expect further margin degradation in the second quarter. That being said, we are taking very swift and decisive action, and we are busy. Let's not forget, Subsea has an incredible foundation built upon a proven winning strategy with our alliance partners, our technology and our differentiated offering of iEPCI, has clearly proven to be the winning combination. We have the strength of our backlog almost $8 billion of backlog, $3.1 million remaining to be delivered in the remaining quarters of 2020. We have not had any cancellations. Yes, we're in discussions about potential deferrals on backlog, and we'll continue to work closely with our clients to achieve what's best for our company and to achieve what's best for their company. And we have this on the foundation of a resilient subsea services business. We have reaffirmed we'll deliver over $1 billion in additional book and term backlog or revenue for our company in 2020. Thank you, Michael."

We would expect the recovery in the second half. Again, it's important to note TechnipFMC and our subsea business, we're very active. We are very busy. We had record inbound in 2019. We had $8 billion of inbound. We had a book-to-bill of 1.45, over almost 50% of that was enabled by creation of TechnipFMC and the iEPCI model. In Q1 alone, we booked this year $1.2 billion, almost a 1.0 book-to-bill and 2 new iEPCI awards this quarter. So we continue to have a lot of activity that we have to execute and a lot of milestones that we have to deliver upon. As the COVID-19 issues mitigate, which we all hope will occur in the second quarter, we would expect that to be the trough and a more resilient second half of the year.

It in no way reflects a normalized operating environment for our company and will not be indicative of what we may be able to deliver in 2021.

So I'll start with pass it over to Catherine to talk about Technip Energies. Look, Kurt, an important question. We've sized a couple of times in the script, and again, verbally here, and I won't just do it last time. We have not had cancelizations from our backlog. We are talking to our customers about deferrals, which is all work in sharing and trying to reach the same objective, which is preservation of cash and et cetera. But they're working with us again in an open and collaborative way, which is allowing us to mitigate some of the impact that it would have on our company. And in some cases, more than some, in several cases, where they're actually shifting work to us from others for reasons that I mentioned earlier when I was talking to Mick. So we consider ourselves to be privileged and humbled. And we'll continue to do everything we can to help and support our [Audio Gap] cost impacted the margin in the backlog, to your question, and that margin has been improving. We went through the period where the margin backlog was declining as we were working through some higher-margin backlog from the past. It was replaced with some less backlog, and it's now being more influenced by iEPCI, including almost 50% of the record inbound last year of $8 billion for subsea. We're almost $4 billion of that came from iEPCI, and that's good, high-quality gross margin. The gross margin and backlog is something that's very important to us. Now it comes down to execution. The challenge we'll have this quarter is the ability to execute. And I think that was the comment I was making to Angie. And I think it's really important. You can't look at the company and the lens up today and say, this is our ability to execute. We are extremely, extremely restrained and our ability to execute from the delivery of materials to the transportation of products to restrictions on our ability to be able to work in certain geographies, to the -- our -- what we think is aggressive and the highest standard of the managing of the health and well-being of our employees, including the examples I gave of the offshore vessel example that I gave earlier, where we're going to put the health and well-being of our people first and foremost, always have and always will, and we're demonstrating that today in these most challenging times. You have to set that aside then, Kurt, and you have to look forward, and you have to say this company until it's $22 billion of backlog, total, it still is $8 billion in Subsea. That backlog will still be executed. It was under good terms and conditions, and and our ability to execute, I think we've demonstrated, repeatedly the high-quality ability to be able to execute. So therefore, when you look past this COVID scenario. And it doesn't end when the COVID is addressed, and obviously, we'll have some lingering effects, but it doesn't -- it should not be a reflection or a rebaselining of our in 2020, we want to be. Thank you for the question. Catherine?"

So I think along was saying on the Technip Energies side, we see as a strong backlog. We are USD 13.8 billion. And if you look at what that means in terms of calendarization, that gives us a very nice perspective since 65% of that roughly will be delivered in '21 and beyond. Now if I look at the underlying margins of this backlog, it's very similar because it's the result of well advertised selective approach to prospects that we've adopted now for quite a while. The backlog is about 50% of LNG, and the rest is downstream. And in the downstream portfolio, we typically engage in prospects where we have either direct customer engagement, technology, earlier engagement, prior experience, incumbency and also, and it's a combination of all that, which helps us protect the margins and more importantly, the cadence under which we will deliver the project, which, as you know, in the EPC world, the at quite critical. So really, when I look at our backlog, I'm really comfortable. Obviously, you always have to normalize for the mild winding down, but I think the rest of the project is indeed very healthy. And this is underpinned by our ability to execute, which, again, is something we always put forward. Technip Energies, we like to mine the market that we have been able to execute projects and  [Audio Gap] margin, almost more importantly than the absolute number, is the consistency of these margins over time.

As stated earlier, our customers are still working through their plans. And final decisions have not been made with internally nor have they been shared with our company, but we have had a series of decisions or discussions. Those discussions that have led to the information that we provided was based upon those, I'd say, real-time discussions that we're having. Clearly, if you look at the opportunity outlook map that we share with you, the large greenfield projects, all but maybe 1 or 2 are likely to be shifted maybe even outside of the 24-month time frame. There are a few midsized greenfield projects that we expect to continue to move forward. Again, they may have a deferral from the original time frame, which we anticipated in 2020 to 2021. But for a variety of different reasons, which are are obviously, first and foremost, economic, but there's also other things that our clients consider in terms of lease rights in terms of other stakeholders, including local governments, et cetera. And in some cases, and we're seeing more of it, not less of it, incentives to actually move projects forward. So when we look at South America, when we look at the North Sea, when we look at brownfield opportunities globally is what allows us to be able to give you the confidence that we have. At this time, again, based on the information that's available to us, which is not complete. I'm sharing with you as openly and transparently as possible at this time versus just saying we're pulling guidance or no guidance. We're going a bit above and beyond, and I understand the risk associated with that, James. But that's the spirit of how we've always operated, and we will continue to operate. So that's our view at this time. That's kind of where we see the activity in both in terms of geographically as well as in terms of the type of projects. Bearing in mind, when you put together the combination of now Subsea Studio with the integrated execution model, iEPCI with Subsea 2.0 technology, you can achieve some pretty significant project economics both in terms of the acceleration of time and reduction in capital, whilst at the same time, the portion of the Subsea development that we don't directly influence, i.e., the drilling, those costs are likely to be even reduced even further than where they are today, making the Subsea project economics even more attractive."

Thank you for participating in our first quarter earnings call. With me today are Maryann Mannen, Chief Financial Officer; and Catherine MacGregor, President of Technip Energies.

With me today are Maryann Mannen, Chief Financial Officer; and Catherine MacGregor, President of Technip Energies. I also note that we have dialed in from different locations across the globe, another sign of the impact that COVID-19 continues to have on our daily lives, 2 months ago, we provided our initial view of 2020. Over those 2 months, much about the world has changed, including the spread of COVID-19, the shift in OPEC policy and the sharp sell-off in equity markets. Most of these effects will normalize, while others will lead to real lasting change. Today, I want to share with you some of the specific actions we are taking in direct response to the market environment and how these actions will further reshape TechnipFMC as we transition to the new energy landscape. Over the short term, we are taking immediate actions to protect our people, reduce costs and preserve liquidity. First, amongst these, is the responsibility we all have to protect the health and safety of our employees, contractors and customers we serve. And we are taking a number of specific actions in this effort. These include on-site prevention measures such as social distancing, staggered shifts and health screening to ensure safe work requirement and strict self-isolation procedures for employees who may have been exposed to the virus that extend beyond recommended guidelines. We are also maintaining business continuity by providing our employees with the appropriate equipment and services to work remotely when possible, establishing protocols that allow for remote inspection of manufacturing processes and leveraging our global footprint by transferring lessons learned. Collectively, these actions have allowed most of our vessels, manufacturing and service locations to operate throughout this period, providing us with the ability to advance many projects and meet customer requirements, albeit at a reduced productivity. Second, on April 1, we announced a series of cost-reduction initiatives that will result in an annualized savings of at least $130 million from our Surface Technologies segment and corporate. And we have now identified actions that will result in additional savings of more than $220 million that will extend across the entire company. The total annualized savings are now estimated to exceed $350 million, and we anticipate achieving the targeted run rate by the end of this year. Additionally, we have announced the revision to executive compensation, which includes a 30% reduction to my salary and a 20% reduction to the executive leadership team through the end of the year. Our directors are also reducing their cash retainer by 30%. And the third measure we are taking is intended to further preserve our cash and liquidity. The company's Board of Directors announced earlier this week that it has chosen to lower the annual dividend by 75% to $0.13 per share, reducing the annual cash outflow by $175 million when compared to the previous year's distribution. Back in March, we also announced our decision to postpone the company's separation into 2 diversified pure plays. This was a very difficult decision, particularly given the late-stage of separation activities, however, the strategic rationale remains unchanged, and we are fully committed to completing the transaction over the medium term. And to further emphasize this point, we have renamed the Onshore/Offshore segment to Technip Energies and have completed nearly all of the work required to ensure that the 2 companies are ready for separation when the markets sufficiently recover. Looking longer term, it is clear that the energy industry must continue to evolve. The challenges we face will not resolve themselves. Things will be different and companies must adapt. TechnipFMC has been an agent of change from the beginning. And in the current environment, we will look to accelerate our own agenda for change by protecting our core competencies, investing in new technologies and expanding our digital platforms, and we will continue to play a key role in the energy transition. Importantly, we will further strengthen our partner relationships and more closely aligned with those clients that demonstrate a willingness to embrace the new commercial models and new technologies that are critical to success. The change will be most profound for us in subsea. We are taking additional actions to further streamline our organization in support of our vision towards simplification, standardization and reduced cycle times. We are playing to our strengths. Our success is evident by the strong order growth in 2019 and the clear adoption of our integrated model, iEPCI. We anticipate as much as 40% of new equipment orders will come from Subsea 2.0 and with nearly half of our customers now focused on 2.0 as their system of choice. And our Subsea studio digital platform will host 70% of our front-end and system-engineering studies, transforming conventional concept, FEED and tender phases into ultrafast digital development. iEPCI, Subsea 2.0, Subsea Studio, these are not conventional solutions. Only those that adopt to stay ahead in the new energy landscape, meeting the needs of individual customers in a bespoke fashion requires too many resources, introduces too much cost and project risk and creates too much organizational complexity. Our recognition of the need for change resulted in the creation of TechnipFMC and our pioneering culture will ensure that we remain an industry leader. Looking ahead, we will accelerate change where possible and we will align with those clients and partners that see the shared benefits of our way forward. TechnipFMC is well positioned to manage the unprecedented uncertainty due to our strong foundation, one built on the strength of our backlog and balance sheet, $22 billion, that's the amount of total company backlog in hand today. We are not immune to the impacts of reduced capital spending. However, the effects have been largely limited to changes in project scheduling, not project cancellations. This has reduced our near-term revenue from backlog, but it also extends the backlog duration. We have over $8 billion in backlog scheduled for execution over the remainder of 2020. With the remaining $14 billion scheduled for 2021 and beyond, the size and duration of our backlog, in addition to net liquidity of $5.6 billion, which Maryann will cover in more detail, provide us with the flexibility to take aggressive and bold actions that will better position our company for the future. Turning to the market outlook. For Technip Energies, LNG accounts for more than 50% of our current backlog and provides us with very good visibility that extends over several years. Today, we have 3 LNG projects that are contributing to our financial results. Yamal LNG, which is largely complete and is successfully progressing through the warranty phase; Coral floating LNG, which is now more than 2 years into project delivery and over 60% complete; and Arctic LNG 2, our largest project currently under the way, whose revenue contribution will grow in 2020 and extend well beyond. While the near-term outlook for new LNG prospects to reach final investment decision has changed because of COVID-19 and the challenging macro backdrop, the long-term fundamentals for natural gas and LNG, in particular, remain strong, given its critical role as a transition fuel. We continue to be engaged in a range of additional LNG projects. These include Sempra's Coastal Azul, which the customers indicated will be sanctioned in the near term. Rovuma remains an important project for Technip Energies, and despite ExxonMobil's recent decision to delay the project's FID, we continue to engage with the customer to further optimize the project development, and we are continuing with our scope under limited notice to proceed. In addition to these projects, we are involved in the commercial process for a major LNG prospect in the Middle East, and we have recently secured FEED rules on several new prospects. Whether the ultimate project count stays at 3 or grows to 4, TechnipFMC remains a partner of choice with project selectivity foremost in our mind as we consider future opportunities. Turning to downstream. This sector typically proves to be more resilient through a downturn. Over the course of 2018 and 2019, we secured nearly $9 billion of refining and petrochemical inbound and we remain laser-focused on executing these projects. We see potential for additional prospects to be awarded to us during 2020, one of which could exceed $1 billion. And our strong foothold in energy transition markets beyond LNG continues to increase. In the first quarter, we announced an alliance with Neste to provide front-end loading services for future NEXBTL projects, which also covers our participation during the execution phase. We are proud to be Neste's partner of choice for renewable diesel projects. We have also had notable recent success in the area of recycling, including an extension to our long-held alliance with BP to include the Infinia Technology that enables circularity for difficult-to-recycle plastic waste.
Moving to Surface Technologies. In North America, the quick and significant cuts to industry capital expenditures have impacted the services across the board. Market expectations now call for the rig count for the second quarter to be down by approximately 50% from year-end. Outside North America, investment continues to move forward, but it has been constrained mainly due to logistics, in light of recent events additional deferrals are likely. We also expect to benefit from our differentiated capabilities, our high level of vertical integration provides us with more control over our manufacturing and product deliveries and less dependency on external supply chains. This differentiation has helped mitigate delivery disruptions and afforded us new opportunities where industry supply has been challenged. We, therefore, anticipate that international revenues in 2020 will prove to be far more resilient than North America.
Moving to subsea. We believe that deep water will become an even more prevalent piece of the energy mix as project economics remain attractive, particularly for brownfield developments. In the near term, we continue to assess the likely impacts of lower capital spending on major project FIDs. Many of our clients are still reviewing their plans and prioritizing their projects. Based on currently available information, we believe that approximately 50% of the nearly $15 billion of total project value reflected on our subsea opportunities list is still likely to move forward over the next 24 months. All other projects remain active but potentially extending beyond this 24-month time frame. When we think about the next 12 months, we believe as much as 20% of the project value is likely to reach FID and we are well positioned for many of these opportunities. We will provide updates to the list as we gain greater clarity from our clients over the coming months. In addition, as we have demonstrated, TechnipFMC has access to a proprietary set of opportunities. These come from our alliance partners or from our unique integrated FEED capabilities, which often lead to direct iEPCI Project awards. And beyond project activity, we generated additional revenue from subsea services activity where we benefit from the industry's largest installed base of Subsea equipment in operation today. We anticipate resiliency in services equity as a result of the expected shift by some clients from greenfield developments to brownfield intervention.  
In our earnings release yesterday, we provided an updated view on guidance for 2020. Although market uncertainty remains and clarification around client capital expenditures is ongoing, I want to offer some additional thoughts in support of these updates at this time. All of the guidance items we have provided assume no further material degradation from the impacts of COVID-19 on our current ability to execute on our project portfolio. In Subsea, where we are benefiting from near record levels of inbound, a strong backlog and our resilient subsea services business, we have a solid foundation to navigate through the near term. We continue to engage with our alliance partners and customers in order to align on project scheduling and new capital expenditures. Given this dynamic situation in lieu of traditional guiding's, we have provided our expectations for the major inputs that continue to influence our outlook for subsea revenue and margin.
Turning to revenue first. Our current estimate for backlog to be converted into revenue for the remainder of the year is $3.1 billion. We are still in discussion with many of our customers over project scheduling and there remains risk that some of this backlog could still be rescheduled for execution in future periods. However, the strong inbound booked in 2019 provides us with much greater flexibility to manage our business through this challenging period. If we had not generated directed inbound last year, the planning scenario would look very different for us. It is also clear that the change in backlog scheduling will only defer revenues to future periods providing more revenue coverage in 2021 and beyond.
In Subsea services, we provide aftermarket services on over 50% of the subsea-installed base, generating a resilient revenue stream of approximately $1 billion for the full year. This incorporates our expectation for some modest level of activity deferral, a decrease from our prior expectation for growth. And lastly, with respect to book and turn revenue, our current view is that inbound orders, which serve as the basis for this revenue source could be down as much as 50% versus full year 2019.
Next the factors impacting subsea margin include our revised expectation for less inbound and therefore less book and turn revenue for 2020, which we will not be able to fully offset through cost reductions. Several of our manufacturing plants have been running at high utilization. COVID-19 presents real challenges to both the supply chain and our manufacturing workflows. Our prior margin expectation also assumed increased fleet utilization as we progress through the year. We have several installation campaigns that are increasingly at risk of deferment to 2021 due to the impact of travel restrictions, leaving us with limited flexibility to mitigate costs or find replacement work for these fixed assets over the very near term. Looking at the second quarter, we do anticipate a sequential decline in adjusted EBITDA margin when compared to the first quarter, largely due to more significant impact from COVID-19. However, in order to navigate through these headwinds, we are advancing our restructuring plans in Subsea, and we will begin to recognize the benefit of these actions in the second half of the year.
In summary, having greater clarity on the duration of COVID-19 and the ultimate scheduling of our backlog will provide us the ability to more fully assess our subsea outlook for the remainder of the year.
Moving to guidance for Technip Energies. We are relatively insulated in the -- in the current period due to the long cycle nature of the business. The resilience and maturity of the projects in backlog and our diversified global footprint. To date, we have been able to mitigate a very significant portion of COVID-19 operational impacts, where the effects relate more to operational efficiencies and timing issues, but not the stoppage of projects. However, the revenue outlook for the year has been impacted by first, the delay in a few key project FIDs and the impact of the slower inbound for execution in 2020, much of which we believe has simply shifted beyond the current year. And second, revised schedules on some of our projects within backlog where certain scopes of work originally planned for 2020 have partly shifted into 2021. Due to these effects, we are revising our revenue guidance to a range of $6.3 billion to $6.8 billion, which still remains at or above our 2019 results. Guidance for adjusted EBITDA margin is unchanged from our prior view of at least 10%. The resilience in margin, even with the reduction in revenue is driven by the continued strength in project execution in this exceptional environment and some benefit from project mix. And finally, Surface Technologies, our shortest-cycle business has been most impacted by recent events. Outside of North America, our Surface business is much less impacted by the global spending reductions. International markets are typically more resilient in a downturn, and we expect to benefit from the flight to quality associated with our higher tier products as we have experienced during recent -- during previous cycles. We anticipate our business mix outside of North America will now represent as much as 60% of total segment revenue in 2020. In North America, the actions taken by our clients in response to the sharp decline in commodity prices are almost unprecedented. We are responding aggressively as evidenced by the prior announcement of our intent to deliver more than $100 million in annualized cost savings most of this will occur in North America, where the industry spending reductions have been particularly severe. With these actions, we believe that we can be modestly profitable in North America for the full year, when excluding charges based on our current outlook. Moving beyond the operating segments, we have also provided updates to several other items that were included in our earnings press release and presentation deck. We will provide additional segment guidance and updates as we gain more clarity over the coming months. Without question, this is the most challenging business environment that our industry has ever faced. We are not simply responding to a health crisis or a commodity crisis or an economic crisis, we are responding to all 3 on a global stage at the same time. In the face of such extreme uncertainty, we are focusing on what we can control. We are taking steps to ensure that all of our employees and contractors remain safe. We are spending more time with clients than ever before, working with them to better understand their priorities and working together to solve our collective issues, strengthening the relationships we have and building new ones for the road ahead. And we are focused on ensuring business continuity, working diligently and innovatively to solve problems and better anticipate new complexities that may arise from the unforeseen challenges of COVID-19. We are also taking swift and decisive actions in response to the near-term challenges. We are preserving our liquidity with the Board's decision to revise the dividend policy. We have significantly increased our annualized savings target to more than $350 million. This includes additional cost reductions from all of our business segments, our support functions and Executive and Director compensation. We are uniquely positioned with our strong balance sheet and backlog. This includes $5.6 billion in cash and liquidity and nearly $22 billion in total company backlog that extends out for several years. And we are doing all of these things with the support, dedication and commitment of the exceptional women and men of TechnipFMC.

I will now turn the call over to Maryann to briefly discuss a few highlights of the first quarter and provide you with an update on our cash and liquidity position. Maryann?"
1342651,659010132,1958935,"TechnipFMC plc, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",2020-04-23,"Earnings Calls","TechnipFMC plc","Executives","Thank you, Doug. Total company revenue was $3.1 billion in the quarter, an increase of 8% versus the prior year, driven by solid growth in Technip Energies as well as most growth -- modest growth in subsea. Adjusted EBITDA was $220 million. First quarter",567,"Thank you, Doug. Total company revenue was $3.1 billion in the quarter, an increase of 8% versus the prior year, driven by solid growth in Technip Energies as well as most growth -- modest growth in subsea. Adjusted EBITDA was $220 million. First quarter cash flow from operations was $28 million. Adjusted loss per share was $0.11 in the quarter when excluding after-tax charges and credits of $7.17 per diluted share. The total after-tax charges and credits of $3.2 billion largely reflect noncash charges for goodwill impairments in the Subsea and Surface Technologies segments. These impairments were due to significant decline in the company's market capitalization since our last measurement period. We have also identified direct COVID-19 expenses totaling $9 million in the quarter. It is important to note that these expenses do not capture the disruption related to overhead absorption, utilization and other operational impacts, which are not specifically called out, but included in our adjusted results. Also included in our adjusted earnings are items for which we do not provide guidance, including an expense resulting from increased liability to the joint venture partners of $0.08 per diluted share and foreign exchange losses of $0.10 per diluted share. These 2 items impacted EPS by $0.18 in the period, and if excluded, our adjusted earnings would have been $0.07 per diluted share. We are responding to the current environment by taking a series of actions in an effort to further reduce costs and preserve liquidity. Doug spoke earlier to the significant increase in our cost reduction target, which now totals $350 million in annualized savings, and we expect this run rate by the end of the year. I also want to reiterate our previously announced reduction to capital expenditures, where we have reduced our prior guidance by $150 million to approximately $300 million for the full year. And this week, the Board -- our Board, revised the dividend policy to $0.13 per share on an annualized basis. The 75% reduction to our annual payout will preserve $175 million in liquidity when compared to the prior year. 
Turning to liquidity. We had $5.6 billion in cash and net liquidity at the end of the quarter. In a recent filing, we provided further transparency to our cash position, which we have updated with our first quarter results. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $5 billion as of March 31. We had just over $3 billion held in project joint ventures. This cash is readily available to us to execute the remaining liabilities on our JV projects. Of this total, approximately $1.8 billion was related to Yamal LNG. This cash is held in support of $1.2 billion in outstanding contract liabilities, from what's just over 50% of any future profitability should remain with TechnipFMC. Operating cash and cash equivalents was approximately $1.8 billion, a significant portion of which is readily available for corporate use. We also have a $2.5 billion secured -- senior secured revolving credit facility. At the end of the quarter, our net borrowing capacity under the facility was approximately $600 million, reflecting $1.4 billion of commercial paper outstanding and $500 million of direct borrowing under the revolver. Taken together, this brings our net liquidity to $5.6 billion and provides us with sufficient funds to cover our net project liabilities, near-term debt maturities and any distributions to joint venture partners.

It's very helpful. And I certainly appreciate the uncertainty given COVID and the shifting plans on -- for your customers on their projects. Given the outlook, there's also an emphasis in the market on balance sheet strength and maximizing free cash, minimizing cash burn. You reduced the dividend. You cut CapEx, you're taking cost out, but there are also likely to be some cash drag in 2020 to affect that. Perhaps prepays are less than this year than you would have thought coming into it, particularly with the reduction in the energy's revenue guidance. So if I put all that together, how should investors be thinking about your cash balance and liquidity? Where those could be when we exit this year and head into 2021?"

Our guidance assumed then that certain inbound projects, along with their corresponding milestones, as you've outlined, and payments we would receive in 2020. And as we shared, we are seeing some deferrals of those project awards and therefore, obviously, some cash flow impact of those deferrals. A good example is one that Doug talked about, that's the ExxonMobil's Rovuma project being delayed into 2021. But as we further develop the segment views and have greater clarity on the range of outcomes, we'll update our cash flow projection. But again, we continue to expect cash flow from operations to be positive this year, but it will be below the $1 billion previously guided."

It was one of the fundamental reasons for creating the company. We've done that very successfully in the execution phase. We're now able to execute projects with a 50% reduction in the normal -- in the time that it would take to do those projects and using a traditional approach. And we've done that on a consistent basis. Hence, the reason we have received repeat awards in almost all cases from the clients that we have served with our new iEPCI model. At the same time, we realized that we need to attack the front end, and we also need to reduce the cycle time associated with the front end. And there's actually 2 ways to do that, Sean. There's the digital platform, which we call Subsea Studio, which is very exciting and dramatically reduces that cycle time. And will begin to also include machine learning, which will allow us to even further improve the field design, the optimization and the cycle time. In addition to that, it is the importance of the ability to be able to deliver technology. And that new technology, coupled with the Subsea Studio digital platform, will dramatically decrease the cycle time of the front end. As we do that, we'll be able to further reduce the cycle time of Subsea projects and vastly improve the project returns, which will become even more critical as we move forward."

It needs to be clarified. It's obviously been a topic of discussion over the last 12 hours, and I think it's important that we clarify. When we provided the 2020 guidance, we specifically stated that Q1,",856,"Now, Michael, thank you very much for the question. It needs to be clarified. It's obviously been a topic of discussion over the last 12 hours, and I think it's important that we clarify. When we provided the 2020 guidance, we specifically stated that Q1, as always, would be the seasonal low point for our company, which was our view at the time. And that seasonal impact really has to do with the ability or the inability for our vessels to operate in certain geographies due to the weather conditions, which always leads to the first quarter being the softest quarter. The consensus number, I have to say, did not take that into account, even though that, that was clearly articulated. So that's point number one. Point number two is the COVID-19 impacts are real and they are meaningful. And I just want to share with you a little bit of what's happening and what we are -- how we're addressing it as a company. I spoke about in my prepared remarks that we're going in above and beyond recommended guidelines. What does that mean? Michael, what that means is that we will never put a price on employee health and well-being. So we are taking extraordinary efforts to ensure that especially in confined environments like operating on our vessels or operating offshore, we don't put other employees at risk or other -- or contractors and clients that we're working with. So we actually had a situation on a vessel where we identified symptoms, potential COVID-related symptoms with an individual. We didn't just remove that individual and continued business as normal. We went above and beyond. We took the extraordinary decision to shut down operations on that vessel for 14 days to test all employees on that vessel. As a result of that, we now know we prevented -- we could have had a much more significant impact on the health and well-being of our employees. We're now doing that across the entire fleet. We are testing all individuals prior to them going into service and we're finding a number of positive cases and being able to prevent that. In addition, we had 2 vessels that were unable to operate for a period of time, simply due to crew availability due to travel restrictions that were in place and imparted in different parts of the world. If you take all of that into account, it almost had 100 basis point impact on the adjusted EBITDA margin for the business. So these are real, and these are meaningful. In addition to that, we continue to manage a very complex supply chain in terms of impact on delivery and our ability to achieve certain milestones of delivery of finished product or finished goods. But it's not just the supply chain, it's also the logistics. We work very hard to keep most of our manufacturing footprint open and to be able to continue to advance progress on projects. But often, it comes down to the inability to be able to ship or transport due to local regulatory constraints in terms of the closure of ports, airports, marine ports, et cetera. So these are all the type of things that we're dealing with. So I'm going to just recap by saying, Michael, the seasonal impact needed was there and needed to be taken into account and wasn't. On top of that, we had a significant impact on the utilization of our fleet, some of which was simply imposed by ourselves. We weren't going to just keep working in an environment that we thought can put the health and well-being of our people at risk. We won't do that. So instead, we took that additional impact to our operating margin, but I will always make that decision. And then finally, the ongoing challenges and constraints in the supply chain and logistics and shipping that we'll continue to face and will face additional constraints in the second quarter. So looking towards the second quarter, as stated in my prepared remarks, we won't just have the 30 to 40 days of the COVID impact, we will obviously have even more. So as we've said, that we expect further margin degradation in the second quarter. That being said, we are taking very swift and decisive action, and we are busy. Let's not forget, Subsea has an incredible foundation built upon a proven winning strategy with our alliance partners, our technology and our differentiated offering of iEPCI, has clearly proven to be the winning combination. We have the strength of our backlog, almost $8 billion of backlog, $3.1 billion remaining to be delivered in the remaining quarters of 2020. We have not had any cancellations. Yes, we're in discussions about potential deferrals on backlog, and we'll continue to work closely with our clients to achieve what's best for our company and to achieve what's best for their company. And we have this on the foundation of a resilient subsea services business. We have reaffirmed we'll deliver over $1 billion in additional book and term backlog or revenue for our company in 2020. Thank you, Michael."

We have reduced CapEx, and that will certainly be contributing, as you heard, $175 million in further benefit coming from the dividend reduction.

We would expect the recovery in the second half. Again, it's important to note TechnipFMC and our subsea business, we're very active. We are very busy. We had record inbound in 2019. We had $8 billion of inbound. We had a book-to-bill of 1.45, over almost 50% of that was enabled by the creation of TechnipFMC and the iEPCI model. In Q1 alone, we booked this year $1.2 billion, almost a 1.0 book-to-bill and 2 new iEPCI awards this quarter. So we continue to have a lot of activity that we have to execute and a lot of milestones that we have to deliver upon. As the COVID-19 issues mitigate, which we all hope will occur in the second quarter, we would expect that to be the trough and a more resilient second half of the year. And keep in mind, whatever the ultimate results for 2020 may be, they will include the clear challenges and disruptions of vivid and a very slick shift in the market demand. It in no way reflects a normalized operating environment for our company and will not be indicative of what we may be able to deliver in 2021.

And it is impacts on local governments and other key stakeholders. So I'll just speak at a very high level, and I have to be a bit opaque here. The good news is we're having those conversations across our company. That's the benefit of having these deep intimate client relationships that we have built up over many many years. We're in a very unique position. They are telling us they are speaking to us. They are not talking to others. They consider us to be a trusted partner. They are trying to work with us to mitigate the impact on our company. There will be an impact on our company, but to mitigate the impact on our company versus some others. Our customers are becoming very aware that not everyone will make it through this cycle, Mick. So they are reaching out and trying to ensure that they are shifting their spend and shoring up, if you will, who they believe will be the winners. I don't want to say survivors, it's more than surviving, who will be the winners when we get through this period. There could be up to a 50% reduction in available capacity in the market place both in terms of people and assets -- in terms of companies and assets, excuse me, when this is all said and done. I would say that's biggest realization in this cycle. It's not just about squeezing and hammering and trying to enforce changes of commercial terms, there's a real serious discussion, at least going on with our company. I can only speak for our company, and I believe, at least from what our clients are saying, it is somewhat unique to the discussions they're having with us versus others, it's really about ensuring that we're going to be there and we're going to be strong for them when this is all said and done."

So I'll start with subsea and then I'll pass it over to Catherine to talk about Technip Energies. Look, Kurt, an important question. We've emphasized a couple of times in the script, and again, verbally here, and I want to just do it one last time. We have not had cancelizations from our backlog. We are talking to our customers about deferrals, which is us all work and sharing and trying to reach the same objective, which is preservation of cash and et cetera. But they're working with us again in an open and collaborative way, which is allowing us to mitigate some of the impact that it would have on our company. And in some cases, more than some, in several cases, where they're actually shifting work to us from others for reasons that I mentioned earlier when I was talking to Mick. So we consider ourselves to be privileged and humbled. And we'll continue to do everything we can to help and support our customers, so it hasn't affected the margin in the backlog, if you will, which is to getting to your question, and that margin has been improving. We went through the period where the margin in the backlog was declining as we were working through some higher-margin backlog from the past. It was replaced with some less favorable backlog, and it's now being more influenced by iEPCI, including almost 50% of the record inbound last year of $8 billion for subsea where almost $4 billion of that came from iEPCI, and that's good, high-quality gross margin. So yes, the gross margin and backlog is something that's very important to us. Now it comes down to execution. The challenge we'll have this quarter is the ability to execute. And I think that was the comment I was making to Angie. And I think it's really important. You can't look at the company in the lens of today and say, this is their ability to execute. We are extremely, extremely restrained in our ability to execute from the delivery of materials to the transportation of finished products, to restrictions on our ability to be able to work in certain geographies, to the -- our -- what we think is aggressive and the highest standard of the managing of the health and well-being of our employees, including the examples I gave, the offshore vessel example that I gave earlier where we're going to put the health and well-being of our people first and foremost, always have and always will, and we're demonstrating that today in these most challenging times. You have to set that aside then, Kurt, and you have to look forward, and you have to say this company still is $22 billion of backlog, total, it still is $8 billion in Subsea. That backlog will still be executed. It was under good terms and conditions, and our ability to execute, I think we've demonstrated repeatedly the high-quality ability to be able to execute. So therefore, when you look past this COVID scenario, and it doesn't end when the COVID virus is addressed, it obviously will have some lingering effects, but it doesn't -- it should not be a reflection or a rebaselining of our ability and what we will be able to deliver in 2021 and beyond and I thank you for the question. Catherine?"

So I think very much along the lines of what Doug was saying on the Technip Energies side, we have first very very strong backlog. We have USD 13.8 billion. And if you look at what that means in terms of calendarization, that gives us a very nice perspective since 65% of that roughly will be delivered in '21 and beyond. Now if I look at the underlying margins of this backlog, it's very similar because it's the result of a well-advertised selective approach to prospects that we've adopted now for quite a while. The backlog is about 50% of LNG, and the rest is downstream. And in the downstream portfolio, we typically engage in prospects where we have either direct customer engagement, technology, earlier engagement, prior experience, incumbency and also, and it's a combination of all that, which helps us protect the margins and more importantly, the T&C's under which we will deliver the project, which, as you know, in the EPC world, the T&C's are quite critical. So really, when I look at our backlog, I'm really comfortable. Obviously, you will always have to normalize for the mild winding down, but I think the rest of the project is indeed very healthy. And this is underpinned by our ability to execute, which, again, is something we always put forward. Technip Energies, we like to remind the market that we have been able to execute projects and it is the conditions needed to protect margins, and almost more importantly than the absolute number, is the consistency of these margins over time, and at this stage I am very very comfortable on where we stand, and I hand it back to you."

As stated earlier, our customers are still working through their plans. And final decisions have not been made with internally nor have they been shared with our company, but we have had a series of decisions or discussions. Those discussions that have led to the information that we provided was based upon those, I'd say, real-time discussions that we're having. Clearly, if you look at the opportunity outlook map that we shared with you, the large greenfield projects, all but maybe 1 or 2 are likely to be shifted maybe even outside of the 24-month time frame. There are a few midsized greenfield projects that we expect to continue to move forward. Again, they may have a deferral from the original time frame, which we anticipated in 2020 to 2021. But for a variety of different reasons, which are obviously, first and foremost, economic, but there's also other things that our clients consider in terms of lease rights, in terms of other stakeholders, including local governments, et cetera. And in some cases, and we're seeing more of it, not less of it, incentives to actually move projects forward. So when we look at South America, when we look at the North Sea, when we look at brownfield opportunities globally is what allows us to be able to give you the confidence that we have. At this time, again, based on the information that's available to us, which is not complete. I'm sharing with you as openly and transparently as possible at this time versus just saying we're pulling guidance or no guidance. We're going a bit above and beyond, and I understand the risk associated with that, James. But that's the spirit of how we've always operated, and we will continue to operate. So that's our view at this time. That's kind of where we see the activity in both in terms of geographically as well as in terms of the type of projects. Bearing in mind, when you put together the combination of now Subsea Studio with the integrated execution model, iEPCI with Subsea 2.0 technology, you can achieve some pretty significant project economics both in terms of the acceleration of time and reduction in capital, whilst at the same time, the portion of the Subsea development that we don't directly influence, i.e., the drilling, those costs are likely to be even reduced even further than where they are today, making the Subsea project economics even more attractive."

Thank you for participating in our first quarter earnings call. With me today are Maryann Mannen, Chief Financial Officer; and Catherine MacGregor, President of Technip Energies.

With me today are Maryann Mannen, Chief Financial Officer; and Catherine MacGregor, President of Technip Energies. I also note that we have dialed in from different locations across the globe, another sign of the impact that COVID-19 continues to have on our daily lives. Two months ago, we provided our initial view of 2020. Over those 2 months, much about the world has changed, including the spread of COVID-19, the shift in OPEC policy and the sharp sell-off in equity markets. Most of these effects will normalize, while others will lead to real lasting change.
Today, I want to share with you some of the specific actions we are taking in direct response to the market environment and how these actions will further reshape TechnipFMC as we transition to the new energy landscape. Over the short term, we are taking immediate actions to protect our people, reduce costs and preserve liquidity. First, amongst these, is the responsibility we all have to protect the health and safety of our employees, contractors and customers we serve. And we are taking a number of specific actions in this effort. These include on-site prevention measures such as social distancing, staggered shifts and health screening to ensure safe work environment and strict self-isolation procedures for employees who may have been exposed to the virus that extend beyond recommended guidelines.
We are also maintaining business continuity by providing our employees with the appropriate equipment and services to work remotely when possible, establishing protocols that allow for remote inspection of manufacturing processes and leveraging our global footprint by transferring lessons learned. Collectively, these actions have allowed most of our vessels, manufacturing and service locations to operate throughout this period, providing us with the ability to advance many projects and meet customer requirements, albeit at a reduced productivity.
Second, on April 1, we announced a series of cost-reduction initiatives that will result in an annualized savings of at least $130 million from our Surface Technologies segment and corporate. And we have now identified actions that will result in additional savings of more than $220 million that will extend across the entire company. The total annualized savings are now estimated to exceed $350 million, and we anticipate achieving the targeted run rate by the end of this year. Additionally, we have announced the revision to executive compensation, which includes a 30% reduction to my salary and a 20% reduction to the executive leadership team through the end of the year. Our directors are also reducing their cash retainer by 30%.
And the third measure we are taking is intended to further preserve our cash and liquidity. The company's Board of Directors announced earlier this week that it has chosen to lower the annual dividend by 75% to $0.13 per share, reducing the annual cash outflow by $175 million when compared to the previous year's distribution. Back in March, we also announced our decision to postpone the company's separation into 2 diversified pure plays. This was a very difficult decision, particularly given the late stage of separation activities, however, the strategic rationale remains unchanged, and we are fully committed to completing the transaction over the medium term. And to further emphasize this point, we have renamed the Onshore/Offshore segment to Technip Energies and have completed nearly all of the work required to ensure that the 2 companies are ready for separation when the markets sufficiently recover.
Looking longer term, it is clear that the energy industry must continue to evolve. The challenges we face will not resolve themselves. Things will be different and companies must adapt. TechnipFMC has been an agent of change from the beginning. And in the current environment, we will look to accelerate our own agenda for change by protecting our core competencies, investing in new technologies and expanding our digital platforms, and we will continue to play a key role in the energy transition. Importantly, we will further strengthen our partner relationships and more closely align with those clients that demonstrate a willingness to embrace the new commercial models and new technologies that are critical to success.
The change will be most profound for us in Subsea. We are taking additional actions to further streamline our organization in support of our vision towards simplification, standardization and reduced cycle times. We are playing to our strengths. Our success is evident by the strong order growth in 2019 and the clear adoption of our integrated model, iEPCI. We anticipate as much as 40% of new equipment orders will come from Subsea 2.0 with nearly half of our customers now focused on 2.0 as their system of choice. And our Subsea studio digital platform will host 70% of our front-end and system-engineering studies, transforming conventional concept, FEED and tender phases into ultrafast digital development.
iEPCI, Subsea 2.0, Subsea Studio, these are not conventional solutions. Only those that adapt will stay ahead in the new energy landscape. Meeting the needs of individual customers in a bespoke fashion requires too many resources, introduces too much cost and project risk and creates too much organizational complexity. Our recognition of the need for change resulted in the creation of TechnipFMC and our pioneering culture will ensure that we remain an industry leader. Looking ahead, we will accelerate change where possible and we will align with those clients and partners that see the shared benefits of our way forward.
TechnipFMC is well positioned to manage the unprecedented uncertainty due to our strong foundation, one built on the strength of our backlog and balance sheet, $22 billion, that's the amount of total company backlog in hand today. We are not immune to the impacts of reduced capital spending. However, the effects have been largely limited to changes in project scheduling, not project cancellations. This has reduced our near-term revenue from backlog, but it also extends the backlog duration. We have over $8 billion in backlog scheduled for execution over the remainder of 2020, with the remaining $14 billion scheduled for 2021 and beyond. The size and duration of our backlog, in addition to net liquidity of $5.6 billion, which Maryann will cover in more detail, provide us with the flexibility to take aggressive and bold actions that will better position our company for the future.
Turning to the market outlook. For Technip Energies, LNG accounts for more than 50% of our current backlog and provides us with very good visibility that extends over several years. Today, we have 3 LNG projects that are contributing to our financial results. Yamal LNG, which is largely complete and is successfully progressing through the warranty phase; Coral floating LNG, which is now more than 2 years into project delivery and over 60% complete; and Arctic LNG 2, our largest project currently underway, whose revenue contribution will grow in 2020 and extend well beyond. While the near-term outlook for new LNG prospects to reach final investment decision has changed because of COVID-19 and the challenging macro backdrop, the long-term fundamentals for natural gas and LNG, in particular, remain strong, given its critical role as a transition fuel.
We continue to be engaged in a range of additional LNG projects. These include Sempra's Costa Azul, which the customers indicated will be sanctioned in the near term. Rovuma remains an important project for Technip Energies, and despite ExxonMobil's recent decision to delay the project's FID, we continue to engage with the customer to further optimize the project development, and we are continuing with our scope under limited notice to proceed. In addition to these projects, we are involved in the commercial process for a major LNG prospect in the Middle East, and we have recently secured FEED roles on several new prospects. Whether the ultimate project count stays at 3 or grows to 4, TechnipFMC remains a partner of choice with project selectivity foremost in our mind as we consider future opportunities.
Turning to downstream. This sector typically proves to be more resilient through a downturn. Over the course of 2018 and 2019, we secured nearly $9 billion of refining and petrochemical inbound and we remain laser-focused on executing these projects. We see potential for additional prospects to be awarded to us during 2020, one of which could exceed $1 billion. And our strong foothold in energy transition markets beyond LNG continues to increase. In the first quarter, we announced an alliance with Neste to provide front-end loading services for future NEXBTL projects, which also covers our participation during the execution phase. We are proud to be Neste's partner of choice for renewable diesel projects. We have also had notable recent success in the area of recycling, including an extension to our long-held alliance with BP to include the Infinia Technology that enables circularity for difficult-to-recycle plastic waste.
Moving to Surface Technologies. In North America, the quick and significant cuts to industry capital expenditures have impacted the services across the board. Market expectations now called for the rig count for the second quarter to be down by approximately 50% from year-end. Outside North America, investment continues to move forward, but it has been constrained mainly due to logistics, in light of recent events additional deferrals are likely. We also expect to benefit from our differentiated capabilities. Our high level of vertical integration provides us with more control over our manufacturing and product deliveries and less dependency on external supply chains. This differentiation has helped mitigate delivery disruptions and afforded us new opportunities where industry supply has been challenged. We, therefore, anticipate that international revenues in 2020 will prove to be far more resilient than North America.
Moving to Subsea. We believe that deep water will become an even more prevalent piece of the energy mix as project economics remain attractive, particularly for brownfield developments. In the near term, we continue to assess the likely impacts of lower capital spending on major project FIDs. Many of our clients are still reviewing their plans and prioritizing their projects. Based on currently available information, we believe that approximately 50% of the nearly $15 billion of total project value reflected on our Subsea opportunities list is still likely to move forward over the next 24 months. All other projects remain active but potentially extending beyond this 24-month time frame. When we think about the next 12 months, we believe as much as 20% of the project value is likely to reach FID and we are well positioned for many of these opportunities.
We will provide updates to the list as we gain greater clarity from our clients over the coming months. In addition, as we have demonstrated, TechnipFMC has access to a proprietary set of opportunities. These come from our alliance partners or from our unique integrated FEED capabilities, which often lead to direct iEPCI Project awards. And beyond project activity, we generated additional revenue from Subsea services activity where we benefit from the industry's largest installed base of Subsea equipment in operation today. We anticipate resiliency in services activity as a result of the expected shift by some clients from greenfield developments to brownfield intervention.  
In our earnings release yesterday, we provided an updated view on guidance for 2020. Although market uncertainty remains and clarification around client capital expenditures is ongoing, I want to offer some additional thoughts in support of these updates at this time. All of the guidance items we have provided assume no further material degradation from the impacts of COVID-19 on our current ability to execute on our project portfolio.
In Subsea, where we are benefiting from near-record levels of inbound, a strong backlog and our resilient Subsea services business, we have a solid foundation to navigate through the near term. We continue to engage with our alliance partners and customers in order to align on project scheduling and new capital expenditures. Given this dynamic situation in lieu of traditional guidance, we have provided our expectations for the major inputs that continue to influence our outlook for Subsea revenue and margin.
Turning to revenue first. Our current estimate for backlog to be converted into revenue for the remainder of the year is $3.1 billion. We are still in discussion with many of our customers over project scheduling and there remains risk that some of this backlog could still be rescheduled for execution in future periods. However, the strong inbound booked in 2019 provides us with much greater flexibility to manage our business through this challenging period. If we had not generated directed inbound last year, the planning scenario would look very different for us. It is also clear that the change in backlog scheduling will only defer revenues to future periods providing more revenue coverage in 2021 and beyond.
In Subsea services, we provide aftermarket services on over 50% of the Subsea installed base, generating a resilient revenue stream of approximately $1 billion for the full year. This incorporates our expectation for some modest level of activity deferral, a decrease from our prior expectation for growth. And lastly, with respect to Book & Turn revenue, our current view is that inbound orders, which serve as the basis for this revenue source, could be down as much as 50% versus full year 2019.
Next the factors impacting Subsea margin include our revised expectation for less inbound and therefore less Book & Turn revenue for 2020, which we will not be able to fully offset through cost reductions. Several of our manufacturing plants have been running at high utilization. COVID-19 presents real challenges to both the supply chain and our manufacturing workflows. Our prior margin expectation also assumed increased fleet utilization as we progresses through the year. We have several installation campaigns that are increasingly at risk of deferment to 2021 due to the impact of travel restrictions, leaving us with limited flexibility to mitigate cost or find replacement work for these fixed assets over the very near term.
Looking at the second quarter, we do anticipate a sequential decline in adjusted EBITDA margin when compared to the first quarter, largely due to more significant impact from COVID-19. However, in order to navigate through these headwinds, we are advancing our restructuring plans in Subsea, and we will begin to recognize the benefit of these actions in the second half of the year.
In summary, having greater clarity on the duration of COVID-19 and the ultimate scheduling of our backlog will provide us the ability to more fully assess our subsea outlook for the remainder of the year.
Moving to guidance for Technip Energies. We are relatively insulated in the -- in the current period due to the long cycle nature of the business, the resilience and maturity of the projects and backlog and our diversified global footprint. To date, we have been able to mitigate a very significant portion of COVID-19 operational impacts, where the effects relate more to operational efficiencies and timing issues, but not the stoppage of projects. However, the revenue outlook for the year has been impacted by, first, the delay in a few key project FIDs and the impact of the slower inbound for execution in 2020, much of which we believe has simply shifted beyond the current year. And second, revised schedules on some of our projects within backlog where certain scopes of work originally planned for 2020 have partly shifted into 2021. Due to these effects, we are revising our revenue guidance to a range of $6.3 billion to $6.8 billion, which still remains at or above our 2019 results.
Guidance for adjusted EBITDA margin is unchanged from our prior view of at least 10%. The resilience in margin, even with the reduction in revenue, is driven by the continued strength in project execution in this exceptional environment and some benefit from project mix.
And finally, Surface Technologies, our shortest-cycle business, has been most impacted by recent events. Outside of North America, our Surface business is much less impacted by the global spending reductions. International markets are typically more resilient in a downturn, and we expect to benefit from the flight to quality associated with our higher tier products as we have experienced during recent -- during previous cycles. We anticipate our business mix outside of North America will now represent as much as 60% of total segment revenue in 2020. In North America, the actions taken by our clients in response to the sharp decline in commodity prices are almost unprecedented. We are responding aggressively as evidenced by the prior announcement of our intent to deliver more than $100 million in annualized cost savings, most of this will occur in North America, where the industry spending reductions have been particularly severe.
With these actions, we believe that we can be modestly profitable in North America for the full year, when excluding charges based on our current outlook. Moving beyond the operating segments, we have also provided updates to several other items that were included in our earnings press release and presentation deck. We will provide additional segment guidance and updates as we gain more clarity over the coming months.
Without question, this is the most challenging business environment that our industry has ever faced. We are not simply responding to a health crisis or a commodity crisis or an economic crisis, we are responding to all 3 on a global stage at the same time. In the face of such extreme uncertainty, we are focusing on what we can control. We are taking steps to ensure that all of our employees and contractors remain safe. We are spending more time with clients than ever before, working with them to better understand their priorities and working together to solve our collective issues, strengthening the relationships we have and building new ones for the road ahead. And we are focused on ensuring business continuity, working diligently and innovatively to solve problems and better anticipate new complexities that may arise from the unforeseen challenges of COVID-19. We are also taking swift and decisive actions in response to the near-term challenges. We are preserving our liquidity with the Board's decision to revise the dividend policy. We have significantly increased our annualized savings target to more than $350 million. This includes additional cost reductions from all of our business segments, our support functions and executive and director compensation.
We are uniquely positioned with our strong balance sheet and backlog. This includes $5.6 billion in cash and liquidity and nearly $22 billion in total company backlog that extends out for several years. And we are doing all of these things with the support, dedication and commitment of the exceptional women and men of TechnipFMC. Through everything we have faced, they have shown a level of strength and resiliency that is nothing short of inspiring in these most difficult times. 
I will now turn the call over to Maryann to briefly discuss a few highlights of the first quarter and provide you with an update on our cash and liquidity position. Maryann?"

Total company revenue was $3.1 billion in the quarter, an increase of 8% versus the prior year, driven by solid growth in Technip Energies as well as most growth -- modest growth in Subsea. Adjusted EBITDA was $220 million. First quarter",566,"Thank you, Doug. Total company revenue was $3.1 billion in the quarter, an increase of 8% versus the prior year, driven by solid growth in Technip Energies as well as most growth -- modest growth in Subsea. Adjusted EBITDA was $220 million. First quarter cash flow from operations was $28 million. Adjusted loss per share was $0.11 in the quarter when excluding after-tax charges and credits of $7.17 per diluted share. The total after-tax charges and credits of $3.2 billion largely reflect noncash charges for goodwill impairments in the Subsea and Surface Technologies segments. These impairments were due to significant decline in the company's market capitalization since our last measurement period.
We have also identified direct COVID-19 expenses totaling $9 million in the quarter. It is important to note that these expenses do not capture the disruption related to overhead absorption, utilization and other operational impacts, which are not specifically called out, but included in our adjusted results. Also included in our adjusted earnings are items for which we do not provide guidance, including an expense resulting from increased liability to the joint venture partners of $0.08 per diluted share and foreign exchange losses of $0.10 per diluted share. These 2 items impacted EPS by $0.18 in the period, and if excluded, our adjusted earnings would have been $0.07 per diluted share. We are responding to the current environment by taking a series of actions in an effort to further reduce costs and preserve liquidity. Doug spoke earlier to the significant increase in our cost-reduction target, which now totals $350 million in annualized savings, and we expect this run rate by the end of the year. I also want to reiterate our previously announced reduction to capital expenditures, where we have reduced our prior guidance by $150 million to approximately $300 million for the full year. And this week, the Board -- our Board, revised the dividend policy to $0.13 per share on an annualized basis. The 75% reduction to our annual payout will preserve $175 million in liquidity when compared to the prior year. 
Turning to liquidity. We had $5.6 billion in cash and net liquidity at the end of the quarter. In a recent filing, we provided further transparency to our cash position, which we have updated with our first quarter results. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $5 billion as of March 31. We had just over $3 billion held in project joint ventures. This cash is readily available to us to execute the remaining liabilities on our JV projects. Of this total, approximately $1.8 billion was related to Yamal LNG. This cash is held in support of $1.2 billion in outstanding contract liabilities, from which just over 50% of any future profitability should remain with TechnipFMC.
Operating cash and cash equivalents was approximately $1.8 billion, a significant portion of which is readily available for corporate use. We also have a $2.5 billion secured -- senior secured revolving credit facility. At the end of the quarter, our net borrowing capacity under the facility was approximately $600 million, reflecting $1.4 billion of commercial paper outstanding and $500 million of direct borrowing under the revolver. Taken together, this brings our net liquidity to $5.6 billion and provides us with sufficient funds to cover our net project liabilities, near-term debt maturities and any distributions to joint venture partners.

It's very helpful. And I certainly appreciate the uncertainty given COVID and the shifting plans on -- for your customers on their projects. Given the outlook, there's also an emphasis in the market on balance sheet strength and maximizing free cash, minimizing cash burn. You reduced the dividend. You cut CapEx, you're taking cost out, but there are also likely to be some cash drag in 2020 to affect that. Perhaps prepays are less than this year than you would have thought coming into it, particularly with the reduction in the energy's revenue guidance. So if I put all that together, how should investors be thinking about your cash balance and liquidity? Where those could be when we exit this year and head into 2021?"

And as we shared, we are seeing some deferrals of those project awards and therefore, obviously, some cash flow impact of those deferrals. A good example is one that Doug talked about, that's the ExxonMobil's Rovuma project being delayed into 2021. But as we further develop the segment views and have greater clarity on the range of outcomes, we'll update our cash flow projection. But again, we continue to expect cash flow from operations to be positive this year, but it will be below the $1 billion previously guided."

It was one of the fundamental reasons for creating the company. We've done that very successfully in the execution phase. We're now able to execute projects with a 50% reduction in the normal -- in the time that it would take to do those projects and using a traditional approach. And we've done that on a consistent basis. Hence, the reason we have received repeat awards in almost all cases from the clients that we have served with our new iEPCI model. At the same time, we realized that we need to attack the front end, and we also need to reduce the cycle time associated with the front end. And there's actually 2 ways to do that, Sean. There's the digital platform, which we call Subsea Studio, which is very exciting and dramatically reduces that cycle time, and will begin to also include machine learning, which will allow us to even further improve the field design, the optimization and the cycle time.
In addition to that, it is the importance of the ability to be able to deliver technology. And that new technology, coupled with the Subsea Studio digital platform, will dramatically decrease the cycle time of the front end. As we do that, we'll be able to further reduce the cycle time of Subsea projects and vastly improve the project returns, which will become even more critical as we move forward."

1342651,659010132,1960294,"TechnipFMC plc, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",2020-04-23,"Earnings Calls","TechnipFMC plc","Executives","No, Michael, thank you very much for the question. It needs to be clarified. It's obviously been a topic of discussion over the last 12 hours, and I think it's important that we clarify. When we provided the 2020 guidance, we specifically stated that Q1,",862,"No, Michael, thank you very much for the question. It needs to be clarified. It's obviously been a topic of discussion over the last 12 hours, and I think it's important that we clarify. When we provided the 2020 guidance, we specifically stated that Q1, as always, would be the seasonal low point for our company, which was our view at the time. And that seasonal impact really has to do with the ability or the inability for our vessels to operate in certain geographies due to the weather conditions, which always leads to the first quarter being the softest quarter. The consensus number, I have to say, did not take that into account, even though that, that was clearly articulated. So that's point number one.
Point number two is the COVID-19 impacts are real and they are meaningful. And I just want to share with you a little bit of what's happening and what we are -- how we're addressing it as a company. I spoke about in my prepared remarks that we're going in above and beyond recommended guidelines. What does that mean? Michael, what that means is that we will never put a price on employee health and well-being. So we are taking extraordinary efforts to ensure that especially in confined environments like operating on our vessels or operating offshore, we don't put other employees at risk or other -- or contractors and clients that we're working with. So we actually had a situation on a vessel where we identified symptoms of a -- potential COVID-related symptoms with an individual. We didn't just removed that individual and continued business as normal, we went above and beyond. We took the extraordinary decision to shut down operations on that vessel for 14 days to test all employees on that vessel. As a result of that, we now know we prevented -- we could have had a much more significant impact on the health and well-being of our employees. We're now doing that across the entire fleet. We are testing all individuals prior to them going into service, and we're finding a number of positive cases and being able to prevent that.
In addition, we had 2 vessels that were unable to operate for a period of time, simply due to crew availability due to travel restrictions that were in place and imparted in different parts of the world. If you take all of that into account, it almost had 100 basis point impact on the adjusted EBITDA margin for the business. So these are real, and these are meaningful.
In addition to that, we continue to manage a very complex supply chain in terms of impact on delivery and our ability to achieve certain milestones of delivery of finished product or finished goods. But it's not just the supply chain, it's also the logistics. We work very hard to keep most of our manufacturing footprint open and to be able to continue to advance progress on projects. But often, it comes down to the inability to be able to ship or transport due to local regulatory constraints in terms of the closure of ports, airports, marine ports, et cetera.
So these are all the type of things that we're dealing with. So I'm going to just recap by saying, Michael, the seasonal impact needed was there and needed to be taken into account and wasn't. On top of that, we had a significant impact on the utilization of our fleet, some of which was simply imposed by ourselves. We weren't going to just keep working in an environment that we thought can put the health and well-being of our people at risk. We won't do that. So instead, we took that additional impact to our operating margin, but I will always make that decision.
And then finally, the ongoing challenges and constraints in the supply chain and logistics and shipping that we'll continue to face and will face additional constraints in the second quarter. So looking towards the second quarter, as stated in my prepared remarks, we won't just have the 30 to 40 days of the COVID impact, we will obviously have even more. So as we've said, that we expect further margin degradation in the second quarter. That being said, we are taking very swift and decisive action, and we are busy. Let's not forget, Subsea has an incredible foundation built upon a proven winning strategy with our alliance partners, our technology, and our differentiated offering of iEPCI has clearly proven to be the winning combination. We have the strength of our backlog, almost $8 billion of backlog, $3.1 billion remaining to be delivered in the remaining quarters of 2020. We have not had any cancellations. Yes, we're in discussions about potential deferrals on backlog, and we'll continue to work closely with our clients to achieve what's best for our company and to achieve what's best for their company. And we have this on the foundation of a resilient Subsea services business. And we have reaffirmed we'll deliver over $1 billion in additional back -- Book & Turn backlog or revenue for our company in 2020. Thank you, Michael."

We would expect the recovery in the second half. Again, it's important to note TechnipFMC and our Subsea business, we're very active. We are very busy. We had record inbound in 2019. We had $8 billion of inbound. We had a book-to-bill of 1.45, over almost 50% of that was enabled by the creation of TechnipFMC and the iEPCI model. In Q1 alone, we booked this year $1.2 billion, almost a 1.0 book-to-bill and 2 new iEPCI awards this quarter.
So we continue to have a lot of activity that we have to execute and a lot of milestones that we have to deliver upon. As the COVID-19 issues mitigate, which we all hope will occur in the second quarter, we would expect that to be the trough and a more resilient second half of the year. And keep in mind, whatever the ultimate results for 2020 may be, they will include the clear challenges and disruptions of vivid and a very slick shift in the market demand. It in no way reflects a normalized operating environment for our company and will not be indicative of what we may be able to deliver in 2021.

We're working very closely with them in a very collaborative way. And they are only -- they are now working on and reworking their project schedules. And in some cases, we don't expect to have that final deliverable from our clients, which is, if you will, the input for our plans until the middle of this upcoming month, if not the end of May, is the schedule that they are on and the decisions that are being made by our clients. That being said, from what we can see at this point, and we have a fair amount of visibility in terms of the vessel requirements. We're confident, Mick, that we'll be able to deliver upon those needs. Although, yes, it will create a bit of a stacking effect, but we think it's manageable at this time."

And it has impacts on local governments and other key stakeholders. So I'll just speak at a very high level, and I have to be a bit opaque here. The good news is we're having those conversations across our company. That's the benefit of having these deep intimate client relationships that we have built up over many, many years. We're in a very unique position. They are telling us they are speaking to us. They are not talking to others. They consider us to be a trusted partner. They are trying to work with us to mitigate the impact on our company. There will be an impact on our company, but to mitigate the impact on our company versus some others. Our customers are becoming very aware that not everyone will make it through this cycle, Mick. So they are reaching out and trying to ensure that they are shifting their spend and shoring up, if you will, who they believe will be the winners. I don't want to say survivors, it's more than surviving, who will be the winners when we get through this period. There could be up to a 50% reduction in available capacity in the marketplace both in terms of people and assets -- in terms of companies and assets, excuse me, when this is all said and done. I would say that's biggest realization in this cycle. It's not just about squeezing and hammering and trying to enforce changes of commercial terms, there's a real serious discussion, at least going on with our company. I can only speak for our company, and I believe, at least from what our clients are saying, it is somewhat unique to the discussions they're having with us versus others, it's really about ensuring that we're going to be there and we're going to be strong for them when this is all said and done."

So I'll start with Subsea and then I'm going to pass it over to Catherine to talk about Technip Energies. Look, Kurt, an important question. We've emphasized a couple of times in the script, and again, verbally here, and I want to just do it one last time. We have not had cancelizations from our backlog. We are talking to our customers about deferrals, which is us all working and sharing and trying to reach the same objective, which is preservation of cash and et cetera. But they're working with us again in an open and collaborative way, which is allowing us to mitigate some of the impact that it would have on our company. And in some cases, more than some, in several cases, where they're actually shifting work to us from others for reasons that I mentioned earlier when I was talking to Mick. So we consider ourselves to be privileged and humbled. And we'll continue to do everything we can to help and support our customers. So it hasn't affected the margin and the backlog, if you will, which is to getting to your question, and that margin has been improving. We went through the period where the margin and backlog was declining as we were working through some higher-margin backlog from the past. It was replaced with some less favorable backlog, and it's now being more influenced by iEPCI, including almost 50% of the record inbound last year of $8 billion for Subsea where almost $4 billion of that came from iEPCI, and that's good, high-quality gross margin.
So yes, the gross margin and backlog is something that's very important to us. Now it comes down to execution. The challenge we'll have this quarter is the ability to execute. And I think that was the comment I was making to Angie. And I think it's really important. You can't look at the company in the lens of today and say, this is their ability to execute. We are extremely, extremely restrained in our ability to execute from the delivery of materials to the transportation of finished products, to restrictions on our ability to be able to work in certain geographies, to the -- our -- what we think is aggressive and the highest standard of the managing of the health and well-being of our employees, including the examples I gave, the offshore vessel example that I gave earlier where we're going to put the health and well-being of our people first and foremost, always have and always will, and we're demonstrating that today in these most challenging times. But you have to set that aside then, Kurt, and you have to look forward, and you have to say this company still has $22 billion of backlog, total, it still has $8 billion in Subsea. That backlog will still be executed. It was under good terms and conditions, and our ability to execute, I think we've demonstrated repeatedly the high-quality ability to be able to execute. So therefore, when you look past this COVID scenario, and it doesn't end when the COVID virus is addressed, it obviously will have some lingering effects, but it doesn't -- it should not be a reflection or a rebaselining of our ability and what we'll be able to deliver in 2021 and beyond. And I thank you for the question. Catherine?"

So I think very much along the lines of what Doug was saying on the Technip Energies side, we have first very, very strong backlog. We have USD 13.8 billion. And if you look at what that means i",295,"Yes. Thank you. Thanks for the question, Kurt and everybody. So I think very much along the lines of what Doug was saying on the Technip Energies side, we have first very, very strong backlog. We have USD 13.8 billion. And if you look at what that means in terms of calendarization, that gives us a very nice perspective since 65% of that roughly will be delivered in '21 and beyond. Now if I look at the underlying margins of this backlog, it's very similar because it's the result of a well-advertised selective approach to prospects that we've adopted now for quite a while. The backlog is about 50% of LNG, and the rest is downstream. And in the downstream portfolio, we typically engage in prospects where we have either direct customer engagement, technology, earlier engagement, prior experience, incumbency and also, and it's a combination of all that, which helps us protect the margins and more importantly, the T&C's under which we will deliver the project, which, as you know, in the EPC world, the T&C's are quite critical. So really, when I look at our backlog, I'm really comfortable. Obviously, you will always have to normalize for the Yamal winding down, but I think the rest of the project is indeed very healthy. And this is underpinned by our ability to execute, which, again, is something we always put forward. Technip Energies, we like to remind the market that we have been able to execute projects and it is the conditions [ taken on ] to protect margins, and almost more importantly than the absolute number is the consistency of these margins over time. And at this stage, I am very, very comfortable on where we stand, and I'll  hand it back to you."

As stated earlier, our customers are still working through their plans. And final decisions have not been made with internally nor have they been shared with our company, but we have had a series of decisions or discussions. Those discussions that have led to the information that we provided was based upon those, I'd say, real-time discussions that we're having. Clearly, if you look at the opportunity outlook map that we shared with you, the large greenfield projects, all but maybe 1 or 2 are likely to be shifted maybe even outside of the 24-month time frame. There are a few midsized greenfield projects that we expect to continue to move forward. Again, they may have a deferral from the original time frame, which we anticipated in 2020 to 2021. But for a variety of different reasons, which are obviously, first and foremost, economic, but there's also other things that our clients consider in terms of lease rights, in terms of other stakeholders, including local governments, et cetera. And in some cases, and we're seeing more of it, not less of it, incentives to actually move projects forward. So when we look at South America, when we look at the North Sea, when we look at brownfield opportunities globally is what allows us to be able to give you the confidence that we have. At this time, again, based on the information that's available to us, which is not complete. I'm sharing with you as openly and transparently as possible at this time versus just saying we're pulling guidance or no guidance. We're going a bit above and beyond, and I understand the risk associated with that, James. But that's the spirit of how we've always operated, and we will continue to operate. So that's our view at this time. That's kind of where we see the activity in both in terms of geographically as well as in terms of the type of projects. Bearing in mind, when you put together the combination of now Subsea Studio with the integrated execution model, iEPCI with Subsea 2.0 technology, you can achieve some pretty significant project economics both in terms of the acceleration of time and reduction in capital, whilst at the same time, the portion of the Subsea development that we don't directly influence, i.e., the drilling, those costs are likely to be even -- reduced even further than where they are today, making the Subsea project economics even more attractive."

With me today are Maryann Mannen, Chief Financial Officer; and Catherine MacGregor, President of Technip Energies. I also note that we have dialed in from different locations across the globe, another sign of the impact that COVID-19 continues to have on our daily lives. Two months ago, we provided our initial view of 2020. Over those 2 months, much about the world has changed, including the spread of COVID-19, the shift in OPEC policy and the sharp sell-off in equity markets. Most of these effects will normalize, while others will lead to real lasting change.
Today, I want to share with you some of the specific actions we are taking in direct response to the market environment and how these actions will further reshape TechnipFMC as we transition to the new energy landscape. Over the short term, we are taking immediate actions to protect our people, reduce costs and preserve liquidity. First, amongst these, is the responsibility we all have to protect the health and safety of our employees, contractors and customers we serve. And we are taking a number of specific actions in this effort. These include on-site prevention measures such as social distancing, staggered shifts and health screening to ensure safe work environment and strict self-isolation procedures for employees who may have been exposed to the virus that extend beyond recommended guidelines.
We are also maintaining business continuity by providing our employees with the appropriate equipment and services to work remotely when possible, establishing protocols that allow for remote inspection of manufacturing processes and leveraging our global footprint by transferring lessons learned. Collectively, these actions have allowed most of our vessels, manufacturing and service locations to operate throughout this period, providing us with the ability to advance many projects and meet customer requirements, albeit at a reduced productivity.
Second, on April 1, we announced a series of cost-reduction initiatives that will result in an annualized savings of at least $130 million from our Surface Technologies segment and corporate. And we have now identified actions that will result in additional savings of more than $220 million that will extend across the entire company. The total annualized savings are now estimated to exceed $350 million, and we anticipate achieving the targeted run rate by the end of this year. Additionally, we have announced the revision to executive compensation, which includes a 30% reduction to my salary and a 20% reduction to the executive leadership team through the end of the year. Our directors are also reducing their cash retainer by 30%.
And the third measure we are taking is intended to further preserve our cash and liquidity. The company's Board of Directors announced earlier this week that it has chosen to lower the annual dividend by 75% to $0.13 per share, reducing the annual cash outflow by $175 million when compared to the previous year's distribution. Back in March, we also announced our decision to postpone the company's separation into 2 diversified pure plays. This was a very difficult decision, particularly given the late stage of separation activities, however, the strategic rationale remains unchanged, and we are fully committed to completing the transaction over the medium term. And to further emphasize this point, we have renamed the Onshore/Offshore segment to Technip Energies and have completed nearly all of the work required to ensure that the 2 companies are ready for separation when the markets sufficiently recover.
Looking longer term, it is clear that the energy industry must continue to evolve. The challenges we face will not resolve themselves. Things will be different and companies must adapt. TechnipFMC has been an agent of change from the beginning. And in the current environment, we will look to accelerate our own agenda for change by protecting our core competencies, investing in new technologies and expanding our digital platforms, and we will continue to play a key role in the energy transition. Importantly, we will further strengthen our partner relationships and more closely align with those clients that demonstrate a willingness to embrace the new commercial models and new technologies that are critical to success.
The change will be most profound for us in Subsea. We are taking additional actions to further streamline our organization in support of our vision towards simplification, standardization and reduced cycle times. We are playing to our strengths. Our success is evident by the strong order growth in 2019 and the clear adoption of our integrated model, iEPCI. We anticipate as much as 40% of new equipment orders will come from Subsea 2.0 with nearly half of our customers now focused on 2.0 as their system of choice. And our Subsea studio digital platform will host 70% of our front-end and system-engineering studies, transforming conventional concept, FEED and tender phases into ultrafast digital development.
iEPCI, Subsea 2.0, Subsea Studio, these are not conventional solutions. Only those that adapt will stay ahead in the new energy landscape. Meeting the needs of individual customers in a bespoke fashion requires too many resources, introduces too much cost and project risk and creates too much organizational complexity. Our recognition of the need for change resulted in the creation of TechnipFMC and our pioneering culture will ensure that we remain an industry leader. Looking ahead, we will accelerate change where possible and we will align with those clients and partners that see the shared benefits of our way forward.
TechnipFMC is well positioned to manage the unprecedented uncertainty due to our strong foundation, one built on the strength of our backlog and balance sheet, $22 billion, that's the amount of total company backlog in hand today. We are not immune to the impacts of reduced capital spending. However, the effects have been largely limited to changes in project scheduling, not project cancellations. This has reduced our near-term revenue from backlog, but it also extends the backlog duration. We have over $8 billion in backlog scheduled for execution over the remainder of 2020, with the remaining $14 billion scheduled for 2021 and beyond. The size and duration of our backlog, in addition to net liquidity of $5.6 billion, which Maryann will cover in more detail, provide us with the flexibility to take aggressive and bold actions that will better position our company for the future.
Turning to the market outlook. For Technip Energies, LNG accounts for more than 50% of our current backlog and provides us with very good visibility that extends over several years. Today, we have 3 LNG projects that are contributing to our financial results. Yamal LNG, which is largely complete and is successfully progressing through the warranty phase; Coral floating LNG, which is now more than 2 years into project delivery and over 60% complete; and Arctic LNG 2, our largest project currently underway, whose revenue contribution will grow in 2020 and extend well beyond. While the near-term outlook for new LNG prospects to reach final investment decision has changed because of COVID-19 and the challenging macro backdrop, the long-term fundamentals for natural gas and LNG, in particular, remain strong, given its critical role as a transition fuel.
We continue to be engaged in a range of additional LNG projects. These include Sempra's Costa Azul, which the customers indicated will be sanctioned in the near term. Rovuma remains an important project for Technip Energies, and despite ExxonMobil's recent decision to delay the project's FID, we continue to engage with the customer to further optimize the project development, and we are continuing with our scope under limited notice to proceed. In addition to these projects, we are involved in the commercial process for a major LNG prospect in the Middle East, and we have recently secured FEED roles on several new prospects. Whether the ultimate project count stays at 3 or grows to 4, TechnipFMC remains a partner of choice with project selectivity foremost in our mind as we consider future opportunities.
Turning to downstream. This sector typically proves to be more resilient through a downturn. Over the course of 2018 and 2019, we secured nearly $9 billion of refining and petrochemical inbound and we remain laser-focused on executing these projects. We see potential for additional prospects to be awarded to us during 2020, one of which could exceed $1 billion. And our strong foothold in energy transition markets beyond LNG continues to increase. In the first quarter, we announced an alliance with Neste to provide front-end loading services for future NEXBTL projects, which also covers our participation during the execution phase. We are proud to be Neste's partner of choice for renewable diesel projects. We have also had notable recent success in the area of recycling, including an extension to our long-held alliance with BP to include the Infinia Technology that enables circularity for difficult-to-recycle plastic waste.
Moving to Surface Technologies. In North America, the quick and significant cuts to industry capital expenditures have impacted the services across the board. Market expectations now called for the rig count for the second quarter to be down by approximately 50% from year-end. Outside North America, investment continues to move forward, but it has been constrained mainly due to logistics, in light of recent events additional deferrals are likely. We also expect to benefit from our differentiated capabilities. Our high level of vertical integration provides us with more control over our manufacturing and product deliveries and less dependency on external supply chains. This differentiation has helped mitigate delivery disruptions and afforded us new opportunities where industry supply has been challenged. We, therefore, anticipate that international revenues in 2020 will prove to be far more resilient than North America.
Moving to Subsea. We believe that deep water will become an even more prevalent piece of the energy mix as project economics remain attractive, particularly for brownfield developments. In the near term, we continue to assess the likely impacts of lower capital spending on major project FIDs. Many of our clients are still reviewing their plans and prioritizing their projects. Based on currently available information, we believe that approximately 50% of the nearly $15 billion of total project value reflected on our Subsea opportunities list is still likely to move forward over the next 24 months. All other projects remain active but potentially extending beyond this 24-month time frame. When we think about the next 12 months, we believe as much as 20% of the project value is likely to reach FID and we are well positioned for many of these opportunities.
We will provide updates to the list as we gain greater clarity from our clients over the coming months. In addition, as we have demonstrated, TechnipFMC has access to a proprietary set of opportunities. These come from our alliance partners or from our unique integrated FEED capabilities, which often lead to direct iEPCI Project awards. And beyond project activity, we generated additional revenue from Subsea services activity where we benefit from the industry's largest installed base of Subsea equipment in operation today. We anticipate resiliency in services activity as a result of the expected shift by some clients from greenfield developments to brownfield intervention.  
In our earnings release yesterday, we provided an updated view on guidance for 2020. Although market uncertainty remains and clarification around client capital expenditures is ongoing, I want to offer some additional thoughts in support of these updates at this time. All of the guidance items we have provided assume no further material degradation from the impacts of COVID-19 on our current ability to execute on our project portfolio.
In Subsea, where we are benefiting from near-record levels of inbound, a strong backlog and our resilient Subsea services business, we have a solid foundation to navigate through the near term. We continue to engage with our alliance partners and customers in order to align on project scheduling and new capital expenditures. Given this dynamic situation in lieu of traditional guidance, we have provided our expectations for the major inputs that continue to influence our outlook for Subsea revenue and margin.
Turning to revenue first. Our current estimate for backlog to be converted into revenue for the remainder of the year is $3.1 billion. We are still in discussion with many of our customers over project scheduling and there remains risk that some of this backlog could still be rescheduled for execution in future periods. However, the strong inbound booked in 2019 provides us with much greater flexibility to manage our business through this challenging period. If we had not generated directed inbound last year, the planning scenario would look very different for us. It is also clear that the change in backlog scheduling will only defer revenues to future periods providing more revenue coverage in 2021 and beyond.
In Subsea services, we provide aftermarket services on over 50% of the Subsea installed base, generating a resilient revenue stream of approximately $1 billion for the full year. This incorporates our expectation for some modest level of activity deferral, a decrease from our prior expectation for growth. And lastly, with respect to Book & Turn revenue, our current view is that inbound orders, which serve as the basis for this revenue source, could be down as much as 50% versus full year 2019.
Next the factors impacting Subsea margin include our revised expectation for less inbound and therefore less Book & Turn revenue for 2020, which we will not be able to fully offset through cost reductions. Several of our manufacturing plants have been running at high utilization. COVID-19 presents real challenges to both the supply chain and our manufacturing workflows. Our prior margin expectation also assumed increased fleet utilization as we progresses through the year. We have several installation campaigns that are increasingly at risk of deferment to 2021 due to the impact of travel restrictions, leaving us with limited flexibility to mitigate cost or find replacement work for these fixed assets over the very near term.
Looking at the second quarter, we do anticipate a sequential decline in adjusted EBITDA margin when compared to the first quarter, largely due to more significant impact from COVID-19. However, in order to navigate through these headwinds, we are advancing our restructuring plans in Subsea, and we will begin to recognize the benefit of these actions in the second half of the year.
In summary, having greater clarity on the duration of COVID-19 and the ultimate scheduling of our backlog will provide us the ability to more fully assess our subsea outlook for the remainder of the year.
Moving to guidance for Technip Energies. We are relatively insulated in the -- in the current period due to the long cycle nature of the business, the resilience and maturity of the projects and backlog and our diversified global footprint. To date, we have been able to mitigate a very significant portion of COVID-19 operational impacts, where the effects relate more to operational efficiencies and timing issues, but not the stoppage of projects. However, the revenue outlook for the year has been impacted by, first, the delay in a few key project FIDs and the impact of the slower inbound for execution in 2020, much of which we believe has simply shifted beyond the current year. And second, revised schedules on some of our projects within backlog where certain scopes of work originally planned for 2020 have partly shifted into 2021. Due to these effects, we are revising our revenue guidance to a range of $6.3 billion to $6.8 billion, which still remains at or above our 2019 results.
Guidance for adjusted EBITDA margin is unchanged from our prior view of at least 10%. The resilience in margin, even with the reduction in revenue, is driven by the continued strength in project execution in this exceptional environment and some benefit from project mix.
And finally, Surface Technologies, our shortest-cycle business, has been most impacted by recent events. Outside of North America, our Surface business is much less impacted by the global spending reductions. International markets are typically more resilient in a downturn, and we expect to benefit from the flight to quality associated with our higher tier products as we have experienced during recent -- during previous cycles. We anticipate our business mix outside of North America will now represent as much as 60% of total segment revenue in 2020. In North America, the actions taken by our clients in response to the sharp decline in commodity prices are almost unprecedented. We are responding aggressively as evidenced by the prior announcement of our intent to deliver more than $100 million in annualized cost savings, most of this will occur in North America, where the industry spending reductions have been particularly severe.
With these actions, we believe that we can be modestly profitable in North America for the full year, when excluding charges based on our current outlook. Moving beyond the operating segments, we have also provided updates to several other items that were included in our earnings press release and presentation deck. We will provide additional segment guidance and updates as we gain more clarity over the coming months.
Without question, this is the most challenging business environment that our industry has ever faced. We are not simply responding to a health crisis or a commodity crisis or an economic crisis, we are responding to all 3 on a global stage at the same time. In the face of such extreme uncertainty, we are focusing on what we can control. We are taking steps to ensure that all of our employees and contractors remain safe. We are spending more time with clients than ever before, working with them to better understand their priorities and working together to solve our collective issues, strengthening the relationships we have and building new ones for the road ahead. And we are focused on ensuring business continuity, working diligently and innovatively to solve problems and better anticipate new complexities that may arise from the unforeseen challenges of COVID-19. We are also taking swift and decisive actions in response to the near-term challenges. We are preserving our liquidity with the Board's decision to revise the dividend policy. We have significantly increased our annualized savings target to more than $350 million. This includes additional cost reductions from all of our business segments, our support functions and executive and director compensation.
We are uniquely positioned with our strong balance sheet and backlog. This includes $5.6 billion in cash and liquidity and nearly $22 billion in total company backlog that extends out for several years. And we are doing all of these things with the support, dedication and commitment of the exceptional women and men of TechnipFMC. Through everything we have faced, they have shown a level of strength and resiliency that is nothing short of inspiring in these most difficult times. 
I will now turn the call over to Maryann to briefly discuss a few highlights of the first quarter and provide you with an update on our cash and liquidity position. Maryann?"

Total company revenue was $3.1 billion in the quarter, an increase of 8% versus the prior year, driven by solid growth in Technip Energies as well as most growth -- modest growth in Subsea. Adjusted EBITDA was $220 million. First quarter",566,"Thank you, Doug. Total company revenue was $3.1 billion in the quarter, an increase of 8% versus the prior year, driven by solid growth in Technip Energies as well as most growth -- modest growth in Subsea. Adjusted EBITDA was $220 million. First quarter cash flow from operations was $28 million. Adjusted loss per share was $0.11 in the quarter when excluding after-tax charges and credits of $7.17 per diluted share. The total after-tax charges and credits of $3.2 billion largely reflect noncash charges for goodwill impairments in the Subsea and Surface Technologies segments. These impairments were due to significant decline in the company's market capitalization since our last measurement period.
We have also identified direct COVID-19 expenses totaling $9 million in the quarter. It is important to note that these expenses do not capture the disruption related to overhead absorption, utilization and other operational impacts, which are not specifically called out, but included in our adjusted results. Also included in our adjusted earnings are items for which we do not provide guidance, including an expense resulting from increased liability to the joint venture partners of $0.08 per diluted share and foreign exchange losses of $0.10 per diluted share. These 2 items impacted EPS by $0.18 in the period, and if excluded, our adjusted earnings would have been $0.07 per diluted share. We are responding to the current environment by taking a series of actions in an effort to further reduce costs and preserve liquidity. Doug spoke earlier to the significant increase in our cost-reduction target, which now totals $350 million in annualized savings, and we expect this run rate by the end of the year. I also want to reiterate our previously announced reduction to capital expenditures, where we have reduced our prior guidance by $150 million to approximately $300 million for the full year. And this week, the Board -- our Board, revised the dividend policy to $0.13 per share on an annualized basis. The 75% reduction to our annual payout will preserve $175 million in liquidity when compared to the prior year. 
Turning to liquidity. We had $5.6 billion in cash and net liquidity at the end of the quarter. In a recent filing, we provided further transparency to our cash position, which we have updated with our first quarter results. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $5 billion as of March 31. We had just over $3 billion held in project joint ventures. This cash is readily available to us to execute the remaining liabilities on our JV projects. Of this total, approximately $1.8 billion was related to Yamal LNG. This cash is held in support of $1.2 billion in outstanding contract liabilities, from which just over 50% of any future profitability should remain with TechnipFMC.
Operating cash and cash equivalents was approximately $1.8 billion, a significant portion of which is readily available for corporate use. We also have a $2.5 billion secured -- senior secured revolving credit facility. At the end of the quarter, our net borrowing capacity under the facility was approximately $600 million, reflecting $1.4 billion of commercial paper outstanding and $500 million of direct borrowing under the revolver. Taken together, this brings our net liquidity to $5.6 billion and provides us with sufficient funds to cover our net project liabilities, near-term debt maturities and any distributions to joint venture partners.

Given the outlook, there's also an emphasis in the market on balance sheet strength and maximizing free cash, minimizing cash burn. You reduced the dividend. You cut CapEx, you're taking cost out, but there are also likely to be some cash drag in 2020 to affect that. Perhaps prepays are less than this year than you would have thought coming into it, particularly with the reduction in the energy's revenue guidance. So if I put all that together, how should investors be thinking about your cash balance and liquidity? Where those could be when we exit this year and head into 2021?"

And as we shared, we are seeing some deferrals of those project awards and therefore, obviously, some cash flow impact of those deferrals. A good example is one that Doug talked about, that's the ExxonMobil's Rovuma project being delayed into 2021. But as we further develop the segment views and have greater clarity on the range of outcomes, we'll update our cash flow projection.

And we've done that on a consistent basis. Hence, the reason we have received repeat awards in almost all cases from the clients that we have served with our new iEPCI model. At the same time, we realized that we need to attack the front end, and we also need to reduce the cycle time associated with the front end. And there's actually 2 ways to do that, Sean. There's the digital platform, which we call Subsea Studio, which is very exciting and dramatically reduces that cycle time, and will begin to also include machine learning, which will allow us to even further improve the field design, the optimization and the cycle time.
In addition to that, it is the importance of the ability to be able to deliver technology. And that new technology, coupled with the Subsea Studio digital platform, will dramatically decrease the cycle time of the front end. As we do that, we'll be able to further reduce the cycle time of Subsea projects and vastly improve the project returns, which will become even more critical as we move forward."

It needs to be clarified. It's obviously been a topic of discussion over the last 12 hours, and I think it's important that we clarify. When we provided the 2020 guidance, we specifically stated that Q1,",862,"No, Michael, thank you very much for the question. It needs to be clarified. It's obviously been a topic of discussion over the last 12 hours, and I think it's important that we clarify. When we provided the 2020 guidance, we specifically stated that Q1, as always, would be the seasonal low point for our company, which was our view at the time. And that seasonal impact really has to do with the ability or the inability for our vessels to operate in certain geographies due to the weather conditions, which always leads to the first quarter being the softest quarter. The consensus number, I have to say, did not take that into account, even though that, that was clearly articulated. So that's point number one.
Point number two is the COVID-19 impacts are real and they are meaningful. And I just want to share with you a little bit of what's happening and what we are -- how we're addressing it as a company. I spoke about in my prepared remarks that we're going in above and beyond recommended guidelines. What does that mean? Michael, what that means is that we will never put a price on employee health and well-being. So we are taking extraordinary efforts to ensure that especially in confined environments like operating on our vessels or operating offshore, we don't put other employees at risk or other -- or contractors and clients that we're working with. So we actually had a situation on a vessel where we identified symptoms of a -- potential COVID-related symptoms with an individual. We didn't just removed that individual and continued business as normal, we went above and beyond. We took the extraordinary decision to shut down operations on that vessel for 14 days to test all employees on that vessel. As a result of that, we now know we prevented -- we could have had a much more significant impact on the health and well-being of our employees. We're now doing that across the entire fleet. We are testing all individuals prior to them going into service, and we're finding a number of positive cases and being able to prevent that.
In addition, we had 2 vessels that were unable to operate for a period of time, simply due to crew availability due to travel restrictions that were in place and imparted in different parts of the world. If you take all of that into account, it almost had 100 basis point impact on the adjusted EBITDA margin for the business. So these are real, and these are meaningful.
In addition to that, we continue to manage a very complex supply chain in terms of impact on delivery and our ability to achieve certain milestones of delivery of finished product or finished goods. But it's not just the supply chain, it's also the logistics. We work very hard to keep most of our manufacturing footprint open and to be able to continue to advance progress on projects. But often, it comes down to the inability to be able to ship or transport due to local regulatory constraints in terms of the closure of ports, airports, marine ports, et cetera.
So these are all the type of things that we're dealing with. So I'm going to just recap by saying, Michael, the seasonal impact needed was there and needed to be taken into account and wasn't. On top of that, we had a significant impact on the utilization of our fleet, some of which was simply imposed by ourselves. We weren't going to just keep working in an environment that we thought can put the health and well-being of our people at risk. We won't do that. So instead, we took that additional impact to our operating margin, but I will always make that decision.
And then finally, the ongoing challenges and constraints in the supply chain and logistics and shipping that we'll continue to face and will face additional constraints in the second quarter. So looking towards the second quarter, as stated in my prepared remarks, we won't just have the 30 to 40 days of the COVID impact, we will obviously have even more. So as we've said, that we expect further margin degradation in the second quarter. That being said, we are taking very swift and decisive action, and we are busy. Let's not forget, Subsea has an incredible foundation built upon a proven winning strategy with our alliance partners, our technology, and our differentiated offering of iEPCI has clearly proven to be the winning combination. We have the strength of our backlog, almost $8 billion of backlog, $3.1 billion remaining to be delivered in the remaining quarters of 2020. We have not had any cancellations. Yes, we're in discussions about potential deferrals on backlog, and we'll continue to work closely with our clients to achieve what's best for our company and to achieve what's best for their company. And we have this on the foundation of a resilient Subsea services business. And we have reaffirmed we'll deliver over $1 billion in additional back -- Book & Turn backlog or revenue for our company in 2020. Thank you, Michael."

At this time, and again, none of us fully understand the duration or the ultimate impact of COVID-19. But from what we know at this time about the virus, what we know at this time about the business, et cetera, looking forward, indeed, we would expect Q2 to be the trough. We would expect the recovery in the second half. Again, it's important to note TechnipFMC and our Subsea business, we're very active. We are very busy. We had record inbound in 2019. We had $8 billion of inbound. We had a book-to-bill of 1.45, over almost 50% of that was enabled by the creation of TechnipFMC and the iEPCI model. In Q1 alone, we booked this year $1.2 billion, almost a 1.0 book-to-bill and 2 new iEPCI awards this quarter.
So we continue to have a lot of activity that we have to execute and a lot of milestones that we have to deliver upon. As the COVID-19 issues mitigate, which we all hope will occur in the second quarter, we would expect that to be the trough and a more resilient second half of the year. And keep in mind, whatever the ultimate results for 2020 may be, they will include the clear challenges and disruptions of vivid and a very slick shift in the market demand. It in no way reflects a normalized operating environment for our company and will not be indicative of what we may be able to deliver in 2021. So again, I think it has to be looked in the context of this very unique environment, not as an indication or a rebaselining of what we're able to deliver as a company."

That being said, from what we can see at this point, and we have a fair amount of visibility in terms of the vessel requirements.

And it has impacts on local governments and other key stakeholders. So I'll just speak at a very high level, and I have to be a bit opaque here. The good news is we're having those conversations across our company. That's the benefit of having these deep intimate client relationships that we have built up over many, many years. We're in a very unique position. They are telling us they are speaking to us. They are not talking to others. They consider us to be a trusted partner. They are trying to work with us to mitigate the impact on our company. There will be an impact on our company, but to mitigate the impact on our company versus some others. Our customers are becoming very aware that not everyone will make it through this cycle, Mick. So they are reaching out and trying to ensure that they are shifting their spend and shoring up, if you will, who they believe will be the winners. I don't want to say survivors, it's more than surviving, who will be the winners when we get through this period. There could be up to a 50% reduction in available capacity in the marketplace both in terms of people and assets -- in terms of companies and assets, excuse me, when this is all said and done. I would say that's biggest realization in this cycle. It's not just about squeezing and hammering and trying to enforce changes of commercial terms, there's a real serious discussion, at least going on with our company. I can only speak for our company, and I believe, at least from what our clients are saying, it is somewhat unique to the discussions they're having with us versus others, it's really about ensuring that we're going to be there and we're going to be strong for them when this is all said and done."

We've emphasized a couple of times in the script, and again, verbally here, and I want to just do it one last time. We have not had cancelizations from our backlog. We are talking to our customers about deferrals, which is us all working and sharing and trying to reach the same objective, which is preservation of cash and et cetera. But they're working with us again in an open and collaborative way, which is allowing us to mitigate some of the impact that it would have on our company. And in some cases, more than some, in several cases, where they're actually shifting work to us from others for reasons that I mentioned earlier when I was talking to Mick. So we consider ourselves to be privileged and humbled. And we'll continue to do everything we can to help and support our customers. So it hasn't affected the margin and the backlog, if you will, which is to getting to your question, and that margin has been improving. We went through the period where the margin and backlog was declining as we were working through some higher-margin backlog from the past. It was replaced with some less favorable backlog, and it's now being more influenced by iEPCI, including almost 50% of the record inbound last year of $8 billion for Subsea where almost $4 billion of that came from iEPCI, and that's good, high-quality gross margin.
So yes, the gross margin and backlog is something that's very important to us. Now it comes down to execution. The challenge we'll have this quarter is the ability to execute. And I think that was the comment I was making to Angie. And I think it's really important. You can't look at the company in the lens of today and say, this is their ability to execute. We are extremely, extremely restrained in our ability to execute from the delivery of materials to the transportation of finished products, to restrictions on our ability to be able to work in certain geographies, to the -- our -- what we think is aggressive and the highest standard of the managing of the health and well-being of our employees, including the examples I gave, the offshore vessel example that I gave earlier where we're going to put the health and well-being of our people first and foremost, always have and always will, and we're demonstrating that today in these most challenging times. But you have to set that aside then, Kurt, and you have to look forward, and you have to say this company still has $22 billion of backlog, total, it still has $8 billion in Subsea. That backlog will still be executed. It was under good terms and conditions, and our ability to execute, I think we've demonstrated repeatedly the high-quality ability to be able to execute. So therefore, when you look past this COVID scenario, and it doesn't end when the COVID virus is addressed, it obviously will have some lingering effects, but it doesn't -- it should not be a reflection or a rebaselining of our ability and what we'll be able to deliver in 2021 and beyond. And I thank you for the question. Catherine?"

So I think very much along the lines of what Doug was saying on the Technip Energies side, we have first very, very strong backlog. We have USD 13.8 billion. And if you look at what that means i",295,"Yes. Thank you. Thanks for the question, Kurt and everybody. So I think very much along the lines of what Doug was saying on the Technip Energies side, we have first very, very strong backlog. We have USD 13.8 billion. And if you look at what that means in terms of calendarization, that gives us a very nice perspective since 65% of that roughly will be delivered in '21 and beyond. Now if I look at the underlying margins of this backlog, it's very similar because it's the result of a well-advertised selective approach to prospects that we've adopted now for quite a while. The backlog is about 50% of LNG, and the rest is downstream. And in the downstream portfolio, we typically engage in prospects where we have either direct customer engagement, technology, earlier engagement, prior experience, incumbency and also, and it's a combination of all that, which helps us protect the margins and more importantly, the T&C's under which we will deliver the project, which, as you know, in the EPC world, the T&C's are quite critical. So really, when I look at our backlog, I'm really comfortable. Obviously, you will always have to normalize for the Yamal winding down, but I think the rest of the project is indeed very healthy. And this is underpinned by our ability to execute, which, again, is something we always put forward. Technip Energies, we like to remind the market that we have been able to execute projects and it is the conditions [ taken on ] to protect margins, and almost more importantly than the absolute number is the consistency of these margins over time. And at this stage, I am very, very comfortable on where we stand, and I'll  hand it back to you."

As stated earlier, our customers are still working through their plans. And final decisions have not been made with internally nor have they been shared with our company, but we have had a series of decisions or discussions. Those discussions that have led to the information that we provided was based upon those, I'd say, real-time discussions that we're having. Clearly, if you look at the opportunity outlook map that we shared with you, the large greenfield projects, all but maybe 1 or 2 are likely to be shifted maybe even outside of the 24-month time frame. There are a few midsized greenfield projects that we expect to continue to move forward. Again, they may have a deferral from the original time frame, which we anticipated in 2020 to 2021. But for a variety of different reasons, which are obviously, first and foremost, economic, but there's also other things that our clients consider in terms of lease rights, in terms of other stakeholders, including local governments, et cetera. And in some cases, and we're seeing more of it, not less of it, incentives to actually move projects forward. So when we look at South America, when we look at the North Sea, when we look at brownfield opportunities globally is what allows us to be able to give you the confidence that we have. At this time, again, based on the information that's available to us, which is not complete. I'm sharing with you as openly and transparently as possible at this time versus just saying we're pulling guidance or no guidance. We're going a bit above and beyond, and I understand the risk associated with that, James. But that's the spirit of how we've always operated, and we will continue to operate. So that's our view at this time. That's kind of where we see the activity in both in terms of geographically as well as in terms of the type of projects. Bearing in mind, when you put together the combination of now Subsea Studio with the integrated execution model, iEPCI with Subsea 2.0 technology, you can achieve some pretty significant project economics both in terms of the acceleration of time and reduction in capital, whilst at the same time, the portion of the Subsea development that we don't directly influence, i.e., the drilling, those costs are likely to be even -- reduced even further than where they are today, making the Subsea project economics even more attractive."

With me today are Maryann Mannen, Chief Financial Officer; and Catherine MacGregor, President of Technip Energies. I also note that we have dialed in from different locations across the globe, another sign of the impact that COVID-19 continues to have on our daily lives. Two months ago, we provided our initial view of 2020. Over those 2 months, much about the world has changed, including the spread of COVID-19, the shift in OPEC policy and the sharp sell-off in equity markets. Most of these effects will normalize, while others will lead to real lasting change.
Today, I want to share with you some of the specific actions we are taking in direct response to the market environment and how these actions will further reshape TechnipFMC as we transition to the new energy landscape. Over the short term, we are taking immediate actions to protect our people, reduce costs and preserve liquidity. First, amongst these, is the responsibility we all have to protect the health and safety of our employees, contractors and customers we serve. And we are taking a number of specific actions in this effort. These include on-site prevention measures such as social distancing, staggered shifts and health screening to ensure safe work environment and strict self-isolation procedures for employees who may have been exposed to the virus that extend beyond recommended guidelines.
We are also maintaining business continuity by providing our employees with the appropriate equipment and services to work remotely when possible, establishing protocols that allow for remote inspection of manufacturing processes and leveraging our global footprint by transferring lessons learned. Collectively, these actions have allowed most of our vessels, manufacturing and service locations to operate throughout this period, providing us with the ability to advance many projects and meet customer requirements, albeit at a reduced productivity.
Second, on April 1, we announced a series of cost-reduction initiatives that will result in an annualized savings of at least $130 million from our Surface Technologies segment and corporate. And we have now identified actions that will result in additional savings of more than $220 million that will extend across the entire company. The total annualized savings are now estimated to exceed $350 million, and we anticipate achieving the targeted run rate by the end of this year. Additionally, we have announced the revision to executive compensation, which includes a 30% reduction to my salary and a 20% reduction to the executive leadership team through the end of the year. Our directors are also reducing their cash retainer by 30%.
And the third measure we are taking is intended to further preserve our cash and liquidity. The company's Board of Directors announced earlier this week that it has chosen to lower the annual dividend by 75% to $0.13 per share, reducing the annual cash outflow by $175 million when compared to the previous year's distribution. Back in March, we also announced our decision to postpone the company's separation into 2 diversified pure plays. This was a very difficult decision, particularly given the late stage of separation activities, however, the strategic rationale remains unchanged, and we are fully committed to completing the transaction over the medium term. And to further emphasize this point, we have renamed the Onshore/Offshore segment to Technip Energies and have completed nearly all of the work required to ensure that the 2 companies are ready for separation when the markets sufficiently recover.
Looking longer term, it is clear that the energy industry must continue to evolve. The challenges we face will not resolve themselves. Things will be different and companies must adapt. TechnipFMC has been an agent of change from the beginning. And in the current environment, we will look to accelerate our own agenda for change by protecting our core competencies, investing in new technologies and expanding our digital platforms, and we will continue to play a key role in the energy transition. Importantly, we will further strengthen our partner relationships and more closely align with those clients that demonstrate a willingness to embrace the new commercial models and new technologies that are critical to success.
The change will be most profound for us in Subsea. We are taking additional actions to further streamline our organization in support of our vision towards simplification, standardization and reduced cycle times. We are playing to our strengths. Our success is evident by the strong order growth in 2019 and the clear adoption of our integrated model, iEPCI. We anticipate as much as 40% of new equipment orders will come from Subsea 2.0 with nearly half of our customers now focused on 2.0 as their system of choice. And our Subsea studio digital platform will host 70% of our front-end and system-engineering studies, transforming conventional concept, FEED and tender phases into ultrafast digital development.
iEPCI, Subsea 2.0, Subsea Studio, these are not conventional solutions. Only those that adapt will stay ahead in the new energy landscape. Meeting the needs of individual customers in a bespoke fashion requires too many resources, introduces too much cost and project risk and creates too much organizational complexity. Our recognition of the need for change resulted in the creation of TechnipFMC and our pioneering culture will ensure that we remain an industry leader. Looking ahead, we will accelerate change where possible and we will align with those clients and partners that see the shared benefits of our way forward.
TechnipFMC is well positioned to manage the unprecedented uncertainty due to our strong foundation, one built on the strength of our backlog and balance sheet, $22 billion, that's the amount of total company backlog in hand today. We are not immune to the impacts of reduced capital spending. However, the effects have been largely limited to changes in project scheduling, not project cancellations. This has reduced our near-term revenue from backlog, but it also extends the backlog duration. We have over $8 billion in backlog scheduled for execution over the remainder of 2020, with the remaining $14 billion scheduled for 2021 and beyond. The size and duration of our backlog, in addition to net liquidity of $5.6 billion, which Maryann will cover in more detail, provide us with the flexibility to take aggressive and bold actions that will better position our company for the future.
Turning to the market outlook. For Technip Energies, LNG accounts for more than 50% of our current backlog and provides us with very good visibility that extends over several years. Today, we have 3 LNG projects that are contributing to our financial results. Yamal LNG, which is largely complete and is successfully progressing through the warranty phase; Coral floating LNG, which is now more than 2 years into project delivery and over 60% complete; and Arctic LNG 2, our largest project currently underway, whose revenue contribution will grow in 2020 and extend well beyond. While the near-term outlook for new LNG prospects to reach final investment decision has changed because of COVID-19 and the challenging macro backdrop, the long-term fundamentals for natural gas and LNG, in particular, remain strong, given its critical role as a transition fuel.
We continue to be engaged in a range of additional LNG projects. These include Sempra's Costa Azul, which the customers indicated will be sanctioned in the near term. Rovuma remains an important project for Technip Energies, and despite ExxonMobil's recent decision to delay the project's FID, we continue to engage with the customer to further optimize the project development, and we are continuing with our scope under limited notice to proceed. In addition to these projects, we are involved in the commercial process for a major LNG prospect in the Middle East, and we have recently secured FEED roles on several new prospects. Whether the ultimate project count stays at 3 or grows to 4, TechnipFMC remains a partner of choice with project selectivity foremost in our mind as we consider future opportunities.
Turning to downstream. This sector typically proves to be more resilient through a downturn. Over the course of 2018 and 2019, we secured nearly $9 billion of refining and petrochemical inbound and we remain laser-focused on executing these projects. We see potential for additional prospects to be awarded to us during 2020, one of which could exceed $1 billion. And our strong foothold in energy transition markets beyond LNG continues to increase. In the first quarter, we announced an alliance with Neste to provide front-end loading services for future NEXBTL projects, which also covers our participation during the execution phase. We are proud to be Neste's partner of choice for renewable diesel projects. We have also had notable recent success in the area of recycling, including an extension to our long-held alliance with BP to include the Infinia Technology that enables circularity for difficult-to-recycle plastic waste.
Moving to Surface Technologies. In North America, the quick and significant cuts to industry capital expenditures have impacted the services across the board. Market expectations now called for the rig count for the second quarter to be down by approximately 50% from year-end. Outside North America, investment continues to move forward, but it has been constrained mainly due to logistics, in light of recent events additional deferrals are likely. We also expect to benefit from our differentiated capabilities. Our high level of vertical integration provides us with more control over our manufacturing and product deliveries and less dependency on external supply chains. This differentiation has helped mitigate delivery disruptions and afforded us new opportunities where industry supply has been challenged. We, therefore, anticipate that international revenues in 2020 will prove to be far more resilient than North America.
Moving to Subsea. We believe that deep water will become an even more prevalent piece of the energy mix as project economics remain attractive, particularly for brownfield developments. In the near term, we continue to assess the likely impacts of lower capital spending on major project FIDs. Many of our clients are still reviewing their plans and prioritizing their projects. Based on currently available information, we believe that approximately 50% of the nearly $15 billion of total project value reflected on our Subsea opportunities list is still likely to move forward over the next 24 months. All other projects remain active but potentially extending beyond this 24-month time frame. When we think about the next 12 months, we believe as much as 20% of the project value is likely to reach FID and we are well positioned for many of these opportunities.
We will provide updates to the list as we gain greater clarity from our clients over the coming months. In addition, as we have demonstrated, TechnipFMC has access to a proprietary set of opportunities. These come from our alliance partners or from our unique integrated FEED capabilities, which often lead to direct iEPCI Project awards. And beyond project activity, we generated additional revenue from Subsea services activity where we benefit from the industry's largest installed base of Subsea equipment in operation today. We anticipate resiliency in services activity as a result of the expected shift by some clients from greenfield developments to brownfield intervention.  
In our earnings release yesterday, we provided an updated view on guidance for 2020. Although market uncertainty remains and clarification around client capital expenditures is ongoing, I want to offer some additional thoughts in support of these updates at this time. All of the guidance items we have provided assume no further material degradation from the impacts of COVID-19 on our current ability to execute on our project portfolio.
In Subsea, where we are benefiting from near-record levels of inbound, a strong backlog and our resilient Subsea services business, we have a solid foundation to navigate through the near term. We continue to engage with our alliance partners and customers in order to align on project scheduling and new capital expenditures. Given this dynamic situation in lieu of traditional guidance, we have provided our expectations for the major inputs that continue to influence our outlook for Subsea revenue and margin.
Turning to revenue first. Our current estimate for backlog to be converted into revenue for the remainder of the year is $3.1 billion. We are still in discussion with many of our customers over project scheduling and there remains risk that some of this backlog could still be rescheduled for execution in future periods. However, the strong inbound booked in 2019 provides us with much greater flexibility to manage our business through this challenging period. If we had not generated directed inbound last year, the planning scenario would look very different for us. It is also clear that the change in backlog scheduling will only defer revenues to future periods providing more revenue coverage in 2021 and beyond.
In Subsea services, we provide aftermarket services on over 50% of the Subsea installed base, generating a resilient revenue stream of approximately $1 billion for the full year. This incorporates our expectation for some modest level of activity deferral, a decrease from our prior expectation for growth. And lastly, with respect to Book & Turn revenue, our current view is that inbound orders, which serve as the basis for this revenue source, could be down as much as 50% versus full year 2019.
Next the factors impacting Subsea margin include our revised expectation for less inbound and therefore less Book & Turn revenue for 2020, which we will not be able to fully offset through cost reductions. Several of our manufacturing plants have been running at high utilization. COVID-19 presents real challenges to both the supply chain and our manufacturing workflows. Our prior margin expectation also assumed increased fleet utilization as we progresses through the year. We have several installation campaigns that are increasingly at risk of deferment to 2021 due to the impact of travel restrictions, leaving us with limited flexibility to mitigate cost or find replacement work for these fixed assets over the very near term.
Looking at the second quarter, we do anticipate a sequential decline in adjusted EBITDA margin when compared to the first quarter, largely due to more significant impact from COVID-19. However, in order to navigate through these headwinds, we are advancing our restructuring plans in Subsea, and we will begin to recognize the benefit of these actions in the second half of the year.
In summary, having greater clarity on the duration of COVID-19 and the ultimate scheduling of our backlog will provide us the ability to more fully assess our subsea outlook for the remainder of the year.
Moving to guidance for Technip Energies. We are relatively insulated in the -- in the current period due to the long cycle nature of the business, the resilience and maturity of the projects and backlog and our diversified global footprint. To date, we have been able to mitigate a very significant portion of COVID-19 operational impacts, where the effects relate more to operational efficiencies and timing issues, but not the stoppage of projects. However, the revenue outlook for the year has been impacted by, first, the delay in a few key project FIDs and the impact of the slower inbound for execution in 2020, much of which we believe has simply shifted beyond the current year. And second, revised schedules on some of our projects within backlog where certain scopes of work originally planned for 2020 have partly shifted into 2021. Due to these effects, we are revising our revenue guidance to a range of $6.3 billion to $6.8 billion, which still remains at or above our 2019 results.
Guidance for adjusted EBITDA margin is unchanged from our prior view of at least 10%. The resilience in margin, even with the reduction in revenue, is driven by the continued strength in project execution in this exceptional environment and some benefit from project mix.
And finally, Surface Technologies, our shortest-cycle business, has been most impacted by recent events. Outside of North America, our Surface business is much less impacted by the global spending reductions. International markets are typically more resilient in a downturn, and we expect to benefit from the flight to quality associated with our higher tier products as we have experienced during recent -- during previous cycles. We anticipate our business mix outside of North America will now represent as much as 60% of total segment revenue in 2020. In North America, the actions taken by our clients in response to the sharp decline in commodity prices are almost unprecedented. We are responding aggressively as evidenced by the prior announcement of our intent to deliver more than $100 million in annualized cost savings, most of this will occur in North America, where the industry spending reductions have been particularly severe.
With these actions, we believe that we can be modestly profitable in North America for the full year, when excluding charges based on our current outlook. Moving beyond the operating segments, we have also provided updates to several other items that were included in our earnings press release and presentation deck. We will provide additional segment guidance and updates as we gain more clarity over the coming months.
Without question, this is the most challenging business environment that our industry has ever faced. We are not simply responding to a health crisis or a commodity crisis or an economic crisis, we are responding to all 3 on a global stage at the same time. In the face of such extreme uncertainty, we are focusing on what we can control. We are taking steps to ensure that all of our employees and contractors remain safe. We are spending more time with clients than ever before, working with them to better understand their priorities and working together to solve our collective issues, strengthening the relationships we have and building new ones for the road ahead. And we are focused on ensuring business continuity, working diligently and innovatively to solve problems and better anticipate new complexities that may arise from the unforeseen challenges of COVID-19. We are also taking swift and decisive actions in response to the near-term challenges. We are preserving our liquidity with the Board's decision to revise the dividend policy. We have significantly increased our annualized savings target to more than $350 million. This includes additional cost reductions from all of our business segments, our support functions and executive and director compensation.
We are uniquely positioned with our strong balance sheet and backlog. This includes $5.6 billion in cash and liquidity and nearly $22 billion in total company backlog that extends out for several years. And we are doing all of these things with the support, dedication and commitment of the exceptional women and men of TechnipFMC. Through everything we have faced, they have shown a level of strength and resiliency that is nothing short of inspiring in these most difficult times. 
I will now turn the call over to Maryann to briefly discuss a few highlights of the first quarter and provide you with an update on our cash and liquidity position. Maryann?"

Total company revenue was $3.1 billion in the quarter, an increase of 8% versus the prior year, driven by solid growth in Technip Energies as well as most growth -- modest growth in Subsea. Adjusted EBITDA was $220 million. First quarter",566,"Thank you, Doug. Total company revenue was $3.1 billion in the quarter, an increase of 8% versus the prior year, driven by solid growth in Technip Energies as well as most growth -- modest growth in Subsea. Adjusted EBITDA was $220 million. First quarter cash flow from operations was $28 million. Adjusted loss per share was $0.11 in the quarter when excluding after-tax charges and credits of $7.17 per diluted share. The total after-tax charges and credits of $3.2 billion largely reflect noncash charges for goodwill impairments in the Subsea and Surface Technologies segments. These impairments were due to significant decline in the company's market capitalization since our last measurement period.
We have also identified direct COVID-19 expenses totaling $9 million in the quarter. It is important to note that these expenses do not capture the disruption related to overhead absorption, utilization and other operational impacts, which are not specifically called out, but included in our adjusted results. Also included in our adjusted earnings are items for which we do not provide guidance, including an expense resulting from increased liability to the joint venture partners of $0.08 per diluted share and foreign exchange losses of $0.10 per diluted share. These 2 items impacted EPS by $0.18 in the period, and if excluded, our adjusted earnings would have been $0.07 per diluted share. We are responding to the current environment by taking a series of actions in an effort to further reduce costs and preserve liquidity. Doug spoke earlier to the significant increase in our cost-reduction target, which now totals $350 million in annualized savings, and we expect this run rate by the end of the year. I also want to reiterate our previously announced reduction to capital expenditures, where we have reduced our prior guidance by $150 million to approximately $300 million for the full year. And this week, the Board -- our Board, revised the dividend policy to $0.13 per share on an annualized basis. The 75% reduction to our annual payout will preserve $175 million in liquidity when compared to the prior year. 
Turning to liquidity. We had $5.6 billion in cash and net liquidity at the end of the quarter. In a recent filing, we provided further transparency to our cash position, which we have updated with our first quarter results. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $5 billion as of March 31. We had just over $3 billion held in project joint ventures. This cash is readily available to us to execute the remaining liabilities on our JV projects. Of this total, approximately $1.8 billion was related to Yamal LNG. This cash is held in support of $1.2 billion in outstanding contract liabilities, from which just over 50% of any future profitability should remain with TechnipFMC.
Operating cash and cash equivalents was approximately $1.8 billion, a significant portion of which is readily available for corporate use. We also have a $2.5 billion secured -- senior secured revolving credit facility. At the end of the quarter, our net borrowing capacity under the facility was approximately $600 million, reflecting $1.4 billion of commercial paper outstanding and $500 million of direct borrowing under the revolver. Taken together, this brings our net liquidity to $5.6 billion and provides us with sufficient funds to cover our net project liabilities, near-term debt maturities and any distributions to joint venture partners.

Given the outlook, there's also an emphasis in the market on balance sheet strength and maximizing free cash, minimizing cash burn. You reduced the dividend. You cut CapEx, you're taking cost out, but there are also likely to be some cash drag in 2020 to affect that. Perhaps prepays are less than this year than you would have thought coming into it, particularly with the reduction in the energy's revenue guidance. So if I put all that together, how should investors be thinking about your cash balance and liquidity? Where those could be when we exit this year and head into 2021?"

A good example is one that Doug talked about, that's the ExxonMobil's Rovuma project being delayed into 2021. But as we further develop the segment views and have greater clarity on the range of outcomes, we'll update our cash flow projection.

And we've done that on a consistent basis. Hence, the reason we have received repeat awards in almost all cases from the clients that we have served with our new iEPCI model. At the same time, we realized that we need to attack the front end, and we also need to reduce the cycle time associated with the front end. And there's actually 2 ways to do that, Sean. There's the digital platform, which we call Subsea Studio, which is very exciting and dramatically reduces that cycle time, and will begin to also include machine learning, which will allow us to even further improve the field design, the optimization and the cycle time.
In addition to that, it is the importance of the ability to be able to deliver technology. And that new technology, coupled with the Subsea Studio digital platform, will dramatically decrease the cycle time of the front end. As we do that, we'll be able to further reduce the cycle time of Subsea projects and vastly improve the project returns, which will become even more critical as we move forward."

1342651,659010132,2014300,"TechnipFMC plc, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",2020-04-23,"Earnings Calls","TechnipFMC plc","Executives","No, Michael, thank you very much for the question. It needs to be clarified. It's obviously been a topic of discussion over the last 12 hours, and I think it's important that we clarify. When we provided the 2020 guidance, we specifically stated that Q1,",862,"No, Michael, thank you very much for the question. It needs to be clarified. It's obviously been a topic of discussion over the last 12 hours, and I think it's important that we clarify. When we provided the 2020 guidance, we specifically stated that Q1, as always, would be the seasonal low point for our company, which was our view at the time. And that seasonal impact really has to do with the ability or the inability for our vessels to operate in certain geographies due to the weather conditions, which always leads to the first quarter being the softest quarter. The consensus number, I have to say, did not take that into account, even though that, that was clearly articulated. So that's point number one.
Point number two is the COVID-19 impacts are real and they are meaningful. And I just want to share with you a little bit of what's happening and what we are -- how we're addressing it as a company. I spoke about in my prepared remarks that we're going in above and beyond recommended guidelines. What does that mean? Michael, what that means is that we will never put a price on employee health and well-being. So we are taking extraordinary efforts to ensure that especially in confined environments like operating on our vessels or operating offshore, we don't put other employees at risk or other -- or contractors and clients that we're working with. So we actually had a situation on a vessel where we identified symptoms of a -- potential COVID-related symptoms with an individual. We didn't just removed that individual and continued business as normal, we went above and beyond. We took the extraordinary decision to shut down operations on that vessel for 14 days to test all employees on that vessel. As a result of that, we now know we prevented -- we could have had a much more significant impact on the health and well-being of our employees. We're now doing that across the entire fleet. We are testing all individuals prior to them going into service, and we're finding a number of positive cases and being able to prevent that.
In addition, we had 2 vessels that were unable to operate for a period of time, simply due to crew availability due to travel restrictions that were in place and imparted in different parts of the world. If you take all of that into account, it almost had 100 basis point impact on the adjusted EBITDA margin for the business. So these are real, and these are meaningful.
In addition to that, we continue to manage a very complex supply chain in terms of impact on delivery and our ability to achieve certain milestones of delivery of finished product or finished goods. But it's not just the supply chain, it's also the logistics. We work very hard to keep most of our manufacturing footprint open and to be able to continue to advance progress on projects. But often, it comes down to the inability to be able to ship or transport due to local regulatory constraints in terms of the closure of ports, airports, marine ports, et cetera.
So these are all the type of things that we're dealing with. So I'm going to just recap by saying, Michael, the seasonal impact needed was there and needed to be taken into account and wasn't. On top of that, we had a significant impact on the utilization of our fleet, some of which was simply imposed by ourselves. We weren't going to just keep working in an environment that we thought can put the health and well-being of our people at risk. We won't do that. So instead, we took that additional impact to our operating margin, but I will always make that decision.
And then finally, the ongoing challenges and constraints in the supply chain and logistics and shipping that we'll continue to face and will face additional constraints in the second quarter. So looking towards the second quarter, as stated in my prepared remarks, we won't just have the 30 to 40 days of the COVID impact, we will obviously have even more. So as we've said, that we expect further margin degradation in the second quarter. That being said, we are taking very swift and decisive action, and we are busy. Let's not forget, Subsea has an incredible foundation built upon a proven winning strategy with our alliance partners, our technology, and our differentiated offering of iEPCI has clearly proven to be the winning combination. We have the strength of our backlog, almost $8 billion of backlog, $3.1 billion remaining to be delivered in the remaining quarters of 2020. We have not had any cancellations. Yes, we're in discussions about potential deferrals on backlog, and we'll continue to work closely with our clients to achieve what's best for our company and to achieve what's best for their company. And we have this on the foundation of a resilient Subsea services business. And we have reaffirmed we'll deliver over $1 billion in additional back -- Book & Turn backlog or revenue for our company in 2020. Thank you, Michael."

And we do believe that it is a way to create shareholder value. Our intent is to continue to track and complete the transaction in a time frame that would be conducive. There's a variety of different factors that we are considering. But clearly, the current market environment and the dynamics in the market would not be an appropriate time. So it's unlikely to be in the near term. But in the medium term, we would intend to move forward.
I appreciate you asking the question specifically about potential ADR listings for Technip Energies as we would move forward as a separate company. That is very much a consideration and very much part of the workflow and the processes that we have ongoing that we would be communicating further as we move forward to advance our decisions. I want to make it very clear so that there's not a sense of, let's say, uncertainty in the -- how the transaction would move forward when the market conditions would prevail. We will be able to move very swiftly. We believe that we will be able to complete from announcement to the completion of the transaction in a 90-day window. That's really important because we don't want to create this period of information vacuum. So we'll -- we now have advanced all of the critical steps both internally and with the regulators to be able to, from announcement very quickly, provide things like prospectus Capital Markets Day, ADR listing requirements, things like that in a very swift manner, removing that uncertainty that was created through the process initially. So I appreciate you asking me that question so I could clarify that."

At this time, and again, none of us fully understand the duration or the ultimate impact of COVID-19. But from what we know at this time about the virus, what we know at this time about the business, et cetera, looking forward, indeed, we would expect Q2 to be the trough. We would expect the recovery in the second half. Again, it's important to note TechnipFMC and our Subsea business, we're very active. We are very busy. We had record inbound in 2019. We had $8 billion of inbound. We had a book-to-bill of 1.45, over almost 50% of that was enabled by the creation of TechnipFMC and the iEPCI model. In Q1 alone, we booked this year $1.2 billion, almost a 1.0 book-to-bill and 2 new iEPCI awards this quarter.
So we continue to have a lot of activity that we have to execute and a lot of milestones that we have to deliver upon. As the COVID-19 issues mitigate, which we all hope will occur in the second quarter, we would expect that to be the trough and a more resilient second half of the year. And keep in mind, whatever the ultimate results for 2020 may be, they will include the clear challenges and disruptions of vivid and a very slick shift in the market demand. It in no way reflects a normalized operating environment for our company and will not be indicative of what we may be able to deliver in 2021. So again, I think it has to be looked in the context of this very unique environment, not as an indication or a rebaselining of what we're able to deliver as a company."

We're in a very unique position. They are telling us they are speaking to us. They are not talking to others. They consider us to be a trusted partner. They are trying to work with us to mitigate the impact on our company. There will be an impact on our company, but to mitigate the impact on our company versus some others. Our customers are becoming very aware that not everyone will make it through this cycle, Mick. So they are reaching out and trying to ensure that they are shifting their spend and shoring up, if you will, who they believe will be the winners. I don't want to say survivors, it's more than surviving, who will be the winners when we get through this period. There could be up to a 50% reduction in available capacity in the marketplace both in terms of people and assets -- in terms of companies and assets, excuse me, when this is all said and done. I would say that's biggest realization in this cycle. It's not just about squeezing and hammering and trying to enforce changes of commercial terms, there's a real serious discussion, at least going on with our company. I can only speak for our company, and I believe, at least from what our clients are saying, it is somewhat unique to the discussions they're having with us versus others, it's really about ensuring that we're going to be there and we're going to be strong for them when this is all said and done."

We've emphasized a couple of times in the script, and again, verbally here, and I want to just do it one last time. We have not had cancelizations from our backlog. We are talking to our customers about deferrals, which is us all working and sharing and trying to reach the same objective, which is preservation of cash and et cetera. But they're working with us again in an open and collaborative way, which is allowing us to mitigate some of the impact that it would have on our company. And in some cases, more than some, in several cases, where they're actually shifting work to us from others for reasons that I mentioned earlier when I was talking to Mick. So we consider ourselves to be privileged and humbled. And we'll continue to do everything we can to help and support our customers. So it hasn't affected the margin and the backlog, if you will, which is to getting to your question, and that margin has been improving. We went through the period where the margin and backlog was declining as we were working through some higher-margin backlog from the past. It was replaced with some less favorable backlog, and it's now being more influenced by iEPCI, including almost 50% of the record inbound last year of $8 billion for Subsea where almost $4 billion of that came from iEPCI, and that's good, high-quality gross margin.
So yes, the gross margin and backlog is something that's very important to us. Now it comes down to execution. The challenge we'll have this quarter is the ability to execute. And I think that was the comment I was making to Angie. And I think it's really important. You can't look at the company in the lens of today and say, this is their ability to execute. We are extremely, extremely restrained in our ability to execute from the delivery of materials to the transportation of finished products, to restrictions on our ability to be able to work in certain geographies, to the -- our -- what we think is aggressive and the highest standard of the managing of the health and well-being of our employees, including the examples I gave, the offshore vessel example that I gave earlier where we're going to put the health and well-being of our people first and foremost, always have and always will, and we're demonstrating that today in these most challenging times. But you have to set that aside then, Kurt, and you have to look forward, and you have to say this company still has $22 billion of backlog, total, it still has $8 billion in Subsea. That backlog will still be executed. It was under good terms and conditions, and our ability to execute, I think we've demonstrated repeatedly the high-quality ability to be able to execute. So therefore, when you look past this COVID scenario, and it doesn't end when the COVID virus is addressed, it obviously will have some lingering effects, but it doesn't -- it should not be a reflection or a rebaselining of our ability and what we'll be able to deliver in 2021 and beyond. And I thank you for the question. Catherine?"

So I think very much along the lines of what Doug was saying on the Technip Energies side, we have first very, very strong backlog. We have USD 13.8 billion. And if you look at what that means i",295,"Yes. Thank you. Thanks for the question, Kurt and everybody. So I think very much along the lines of what Doug was saying on the Technip Energies side, we have first very, very strong backlog. We have USD 13.8 billion. And if you look at what that means in terms of calendarization, that gives us a very nice perspective since 65% of that roughly will be delivered in '21 and beyond. Now if I look at the underlying margins of this backlog, it's very similar because it's the result of a well-advertised selective approach to prospects that we've adopted now for quite a while. The backlog is about 50% of LNG, and the rest is downstream. And in the downstream portfolio, we typically engage in prospects where we have either direct customer engagement, technology, earlier engagement, prior experience, incumbency and also, and it's a combination of all that, which helps us protect the margins and more importantly, the T&C's under which we will deliver the project, which, as you know, in the EPC world, the T&C's are quite critical. So really, when I look at our backlog, I'm really comfortable. Obviously, you will always have to normalize for the Yamal winding down, but I think the rest of the project is indeed very healthy. And this is underpinned by our ability to execute, which, again, is something we always put forward. Technip Energies, we like to remind the market that we have been able to execute projects and it is the conditions [ taken on ] to protect margins, and almost more importantly than the absolute number is the consistency of these margins over time. And at this stage, I am very, very comfortable on where we stand, and I'll  hand it back to you."

As stated earlier, our customers are still working through their plans. And final decisions have not been made with internally nor have they been shared with our company, but we have had a series of decisions or discussions. Those discussions that have led to the information that we provided was based upon those, I'd say, real-time discussions that we're having. Clearly, if you look at the opportunity outlook map that we shared with you, the large greenfield projects, all but maybe 1 or 2 are likely to be shifted maybe even outside of the 24-month time frame. There are a few midsized greenfield projects that we expect to continue to move forward. Again, they may have a deferral from the original time frame, which we anticipated in 2020 to 2021. But for a variety of different reasons, which are obviously, first and foremost, economic, but there's also other things that our clients consider in terms of lease rights, in terms of other stakeholders, including local governments, et cetera. And in some cases, and we're seeing more of it, not less of it, incentives to actually move projects forward. So when we look at South America, when we look at the North Sea, when we look at brownfield opportunities globally is what allows us to be able to give you the confidence that we have. At this time, again, based on the information that's available to us, which is not complete. I'm sharing with you as openly and transparently as possible at this time versus just saying we're pulling guidance or no guidance. We're going a bit above and beyond, and I understand the risk associated with that, James. But that's the spirit of how we've always operated, and we will continue to operate. So that's our view at this time. That's kind of where we see the activity in both in terms of geographically as well as in terms of the type of projects. Bearing in mind, when you put together the combination of now Subsea Studio with the integrated execution model, iEPCI with Subsea 2.0 technology, you can achieve some pretty significant project economics both in terms of the acceleration of time and reduction in capital, whilst at the same time, the portion of the Subsea development that we don't directly influence, i.e., the drilling, those costs are likely to be even -- reduced even further than where they are today, making the Subsea project economics even more attractive."

Before commenting",2084,"Thank you, Matt. Good morning, and good afternoon. Thank you for participating in our second quarter earnings call. On the call today are Maryann Mannen, Chief Financial Officer; and Catherine MacGregor, President of Technip Energies. 
Before commenting on our operational and financial results, I would like to begin by recognizing the resilience of our global workforce. While the health and well-being of our employees, partners and customers is our top priority, these dedicated teams worked tirelessly to maintain business continuity in a safe and responsible manner. And throughout this very challenging period, they continue to advance projects and meet customer requirements, which was evident in our second quarter results. We also made solid progress in 3 core areas: strengthening our balance sheet, progressing our backlog scheduling, and accelerating our business transformation, all to ensure the success of TechnipFMC, both through the current cycle and over the longer term. 
With regard to the balance sheet, we took a series of proactive steps in the quarter. We increased our liquidity by $1.2 billion, bringing total cash and liquidity to nearly $7 billion. And we secured a permanent modification to our primary debt covenant, which favorably impacts the company's total capitalization ratio. Together, these actions were taken to ensure that we have more than sufficient liquidity and can maintain full access to this liquidity in these challenging times. 
Turning to backlog. We experienced no cancellations, highlighting the resilience of the nearly $21 billion of backlog we have today. This significant backlog provides us with good visibility that extends over the next several years. Since the start of the COVID-19 outbreak, we have had constructive conversations with our customers. The dialogue has been very different than what we experienced in prior cycles. This has resulted in a more collaborative approach, creating new opportunities for us, enabled by our proven innovative solutions and demonstrated excellence in execution, and supported by the financial strength we possess to weather the market cycle. These unique attributes also allow us to more deeply engage in the way we partner and work with our customers. 
Looking at the second half of the year, we continue to add new projects to our backlog. TechnipFMC  has been selected for the Maril II Surf EPCI project located in the Santos Basin. We will soon announce a new iEPCI project in Asia Pacific, that will be using our latest 2.0 technology, and we have secured several projects that will be inbound upon final sanctioning, including Subsea installation contracts recently announced by Equinor and the EPC contract for the acute hydrocracking complex we announced earlier this month. 
Our strong balance sheet and liquidity position and our extensive backlog have also provided us with the flexibility to accelerate our business transformation with global actions underway to generate annualized cost savings in excess of $350 million by year-end. We first highlighted the business transformation during our fourth quarter earnings call. These initiatives are driven by changes in opportunity created from the successful introduction of new business models, innovative technologies and digital solutions across our business. 
First, going forward, we will need fewer assets to deliver more comprehensive solutions. We will have fewer operating bases, service facilities and manufacturing sites. We are optimizing our operations across geographies. And if economic returns don't make sense, we will look to exit. 
We will have a smaller fleet. We continue to rightsize our assets to better align with our differentiated offering, and the advantages of new technologies, such as Subsea 2.0 and integrated project delivery. And we continue to partner with others, providing us access to unique assets in a more capital-efficient manner. Second, we are taking targeted actions across the portfolio, particularly in Surface Technologies. In North America, we continue to transform our operations by working with our customers to further drive well site operational efficiencies and lower greenhouse gas emissions. And we are leveraging the strength of our international franchise to capitalize on the longer-term growth anticipated in the Middle East, Asia Pacific and the North Sea. 
And finally, we continue to leverage digital technologies across our organization. Looking at 1 of our most recent innovations, we are accelerating the development and implementation of our Subsea Studio digital platform. Subsea Studio allows us to significantly reduce the time required for front-end engineering by as much as 50%, utilizing machine learning and AI to rapidly evaluate field development scenarios leveraging the industry's largest database of prior projects and best practices. All of these actions are fully aligned with our strategy of market leadership and business transformation. 
These actions will drive the most value when we align with those clients and partners that demonstrate a willingness to embrace new commercial models and new technologies. We are further streamlining all of our businesses towards simplification, standardization and reduce cycle times. 
In 2019, the vast success of our Subsea integrated model was driven by the strength of our partner relationships and resulted in the company's highest annual growth rate in order inbound in over a decade. And we expect to enter into another exclusive iEPCI Alliance that will be announced in conjunction with the client's first integrated project award. 
As I've said before, those that adopt innovative solutions are more likely to succeed in the new energy landscape. And we are even more convinced of this today, given the dramatic change in the external environment and its impact on our customers. And lastly, the third pillar of our business transformation is focused on the strategic initiatives across our portfolio that will deliver new, sustainable solutions to our clients. These initiatives will allow us to leverage our core competencies in engineering, manufacturing and project management, skills that are transferable and can be applied beyond traditional market segments. In Subsea, we have created fundamental change in the way we design, manage and execute projects, incorporating our Subsea 2.0 platform, and greatly simplified the Subsea infrastructure, while reducing greenhouse gas emissions by nearly 50%. And when combined with iEPCI, it also simplifies vessel installation campaigns, providing an even greater environmental and economic benefits. 
Our vision for Subsea includes an all-electric Subsea system powered by renewable energy. This will further simplify the Subsea infrastructure and reduce, if not eliminate, environmental emissions. 
In Technip Energies, we have significant expertise and prospects in the area of sustainable chemistry. Notably in biofuels, as Neste's partner of choice for renewable diesel projects. And we have further expanded our footprint in the circular economy through our collaboration with carbon to demonstrate their recycling technologies. 
We have recently extended our Genesis offering to provide a portfolio of advisory services across all of our markets with a particular focus on energy transition. And we see a very exciting future for hydrogen, where we already have proven technology and references for blue hydrogen and are well positioned for the emerging market for green hydrogen. 
In Surface Technologies, we offer high-efficiency solutions that enable our clients to reach hydrocarbons faster with fully optimized and environmentally compact systems. Today, we have a project utilizing our integrated production system, high production, allowing the client to capture over 50% of the greenhouse gases that are typically released into the atmosphere. During the production phase of an unconventional development. 
In summary, we have the expertise across all segments of the business to deliver the innovative, sustainable solutions that will enable our clients to meet their carbon reduction ambitions. 
Let me turn to the Subsea outlook. On our first quarter call, we noted that up to 50% of the estimated $15 billion in project value captured on our Subsea opportunity list could be extended beyond the 24-month window. The updated list now reflects real evidence of this trend. Based on public disclosures made by operators, we have identified 8 specific projects that have been extended beyond mid-2022. And importantly, none of these projects have been canceled, and they remain longer-term opportunities for future awards. There have also been new projects added across 4 different basins that we believe will be awarded within the next 2 years, suggesting that previously identified reduction in value for these opportunities, once thought to be as high as 50%, is actually closer to 30%. And remember, the Subsea opportunity list is not a complete list of opportunities available to TechnipFMC. Beyond this large project activity, our orders have been driven by Subsea services, direct iEPCI awards and small project activity, much of which is exclusive to our company. 
This opportunity set has generated over $3 billion of inbound in each of the last 3 years and is enabled by our market-leading installed base, growing list of alliance partners and unique integrated feed capabilities. Our front-end engineering teams remain very active and more than 60% of all integrated feed work is leveraging the benefits of subsea studio. We believe this will generate additional proprietary opportunities, some of which will come from our exclusive alliance partners over the next 12 to 18 months. 
For 2020, we continue to believe inbound orders will approximate $4 billion. In the first half of the year, we had $1.7 billion of Subsea inbound. And with 5 months remaining in the year, we already see a similar level of inbound for the second half of the year coming from Subsea services, small project activity and large project awards pending public announcement. In the interim, we will continue to work closely with our customers as they adjust to the current environment. And we are excited to serve the new entrants that will likely step in to operate potentially stranded opportunities. 
That said, long-term success in Subsea is driven by economics, innovation and relationships, all key attributes of TechnipFMC. This makes us uniquely qualified to remain the Subsea partner of choice now more than ever. 
Turning to LNG. We are currently in the delivery phase of 2 major projects, Coral floating LNG and Arctic LNG 2, and we continue to advance through the warranty phase of Yamal LNG. Yamal been the industry's most successful project ever, and the strength in our execution certainly played a role in [ NovaTek ] made Consortium's decision to direct award Arctic LNG 2 to TechnipFMC. 
Despite the challenges of COVID-19, we are making good progress on all of these projects. On Arctic LNG 2, we continue to expect the activity to ramp as scheduled over the remainder of 2020. And on the Coral FLNG, we continue to achieve key milestones relating to integration and instrumentation. Successful execution of these technically and logistically complex projects create strong references, leaving us well positioned to be a key player in the development of the industry's most strategic LNG projects. Market dynamics have shifted in recent months. And this will alter the broader LNG landscape in the near term. The number of economically viable projects is likely to decline, but the same can be said of the list of qualified EPC contractors, which will be challenged in this period of subdued project sanctioning. This is not the case for Technip Energies. We have demonstrated remarkable resilience through past cycles, and we don't see this as the start of an extended downturn for us. We have already been awarded 2 additional projects, the first being Rovuma in Mozambique; and the second, Energia Costa Azul in Mexico. Both remain subject to final investment decision, and either of these projects are included in our backlog. 
While Rovuma has been delayed until 2021, and the operator for Costa Azul continues to indicate that FID will take place this year. 
In addition, we are actively tendering a major project in the Middle East and performing front-end engineering work on other LNG prospects. Some of which are likely to move forward, due in part to their strategic importance to their host country. This [indiscernible] portfolio of LNG projects will provide us with well-timed project overlap and operational continuity. 
And the portfolio beyond LNG remains diverse. We have built a solid track record of successful execution, delivering strategic references in areas such as downstream and petrochemicals that leave us well positioned for future project awards. We entered this period with a solid foundation built upon the strength of our balance sheet, backlog and execution. While client conversations remain ongoing, the increased visibility we have today gives us confidence in our full year guidance for all business segments. This is further supported by the acceleration of our business transformation initiatives to maintain, if not expand, our market leadership. 
I will now turn the call over to Maryann to discuss our financial results in more detail."
1342651,673458799,2051110,"TechnipFMC plc, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2020",2020-07-30,"Earnings Calls","TechnipFMC plc","Executives","Thank you, Doug. Looking at our headline numbers for the quarter, revenue totaled $3.2 billion, driven by solid performance in both Subsea and Technip Energies, while Surface Technologies revenue was impacted by a severe decline in activity in North Ameri",1386,"Thank you, Doug. Looking at our headline numbers for the quarter, revenue totaled $3.2 billion, driven by solid performance in both Subsea and Technip Energies, while Surface Technologies revenue was impacted by a severe decline in activity in North America. Year-over-year revenue decreased as a result of reduced activity, operational headwinds from COVID-19 and foreign exchange impacts. Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was $241 million. We accelerated our cost reduction program and are on track to deliver cost savings of more than $350 million by year-end. And we expect a greater benefit from these savings in the second half of the year with the full impact realized in 2021. We estimate total cash cost to achieve our planned cost savings target to be approximately $75 million. Underlying corporate expense have improved over the last 3 consecutive quarters, giving us confidence to lower our full year guidance, which I'll come back to in a moment. 
Beginning with the second quarter, foreign exchange impacts are now reported separately from corporate expense to provide greater clarity in our financial statements. Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.09 when excluding after-tax charges and credits. Included in our adjusted earnings, our expenses resulting from increased liability payable to joint venture partners included in interest expense and foreign exchange losses. Together, these 2 items impacted EPS by $0.12 per share in the period. And if excluded, our adjusted earnings per share would have been $0.22 per diluted share. The company ended the period with cash of $4.8 billion. Net cash was $303 million. We have increased visibility on our cash uses and inflows for the remainder of the year and have provided guidance around our free cash flow outlook. 
Turning to the segment highlights. Direct COVID-19 expenses for the company totaled $57 million in the second quarter. Year-on-year Subsea revenue declined by 9%, but would have been unchanged when excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange translation of $129 million due to the strengthening U.S. dollar. 
While year-over-year comparisons are usually more relevant for this segment, the 10% sequential improvement in Subsea revenue demonstrated our ability to mitigate COVID-19-related disruptions in the quarter. Subsea adjusted EBITDA margin was down 510 basis points versus the prior year quarter, primarily due to the negative operational impacts related to COVID-19 and more competitively priced backlog, mitigated in part by cost reduction initiatives. Sequentially, the margin only declined 120 basis points as strong execution partially offset an entire quarter of COVID-19-related disruptions. 
Looking at Technip Energies, execution remains solid across the portfolio. Revenue increased versus the prior year quarter, driven by higher activity across LNG, downstream and our process technology business. The continued ramp-up on Arctic LNG 2 more than offset the decline in revenue from Yamal LNG. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 10.6% remains strong even as we return to more normalized levels, given a reduced year-on-year contribution from Yamal and lower margin realization on early stage projects. 
Although no project awards were announced during the quarter -- second quarter, inbound orders of $836 million demonstrated good activity in services, process technology and loading systems as well as expanded scopes on existing contracts. 
And in Surface Technologies, revenue was significantly affected by the dramatic decline in operator activity in North America. Revenue outside North America proved to be resilient with only a modest sequential decline, supported by solid activity in the Middle East. Sequentially, adjusted EBITDA margin declined 400 basis points to 3.4%. The decrease was driven by the significant decline in rig count and completions-related activity in North America. We are aggressively addressing our cost base. 
In North America, where the majority of our restructuring for the segment has occurred, we have significantly lowered the breakeven point. Which supports our expectation for positive adjusted EBITDA in North America for the full year. As Doug mentioned in his remarks, we have taken actions to reduce the impact of the current economic environment on our financial and liquidity position. We added 2 additional liquidity sources in the quarter, a EUR 500 million revolving credit facility. This facility is undrawn. And a GBP 600 million bank of England COVID-19 commercial paper facility. This facility carries lower interest rates than most of our other sources. We took the opportunity to secure this for the incremental liquidity, if needed, but it has the benefit of lowering interest expense in these challenged credit markets. 
Given the assets to lower cost funding, we repaid the $500 million outstanding balance on our existing revolving credit facility. When considering all actions taken in the quarter and including cash of $5.6 billion, net liquidity stood at $6.8 billion at the end of the quarter, up $1.2 billion when compared to the end of March. In the quarter, we also secured a permanent amendment to the debt to capitalization covenant of our revolver, allowing for the add-back of $3.2 billion of previously impaired goodwill. 
This significantly increases the equity value used in the calculation, providing us with strong support liquidity available to us today. 
The ratio for the second quarter is 38%. 
In the quarter, we all took steps to extend our debt maturity profiles. First, with the private placement that came due this month. We are currently working to address the short-term maturities coming due in 2021. 
Turning to guidance. We are now providing 2020 guidance for all 3 operating segments as well as free cash flow. In Subsea, we are guiding full year revenue to be in the range of $5.3 billion to $5.6 billion, supported by the backlog scheduled in the second half. In addition to backlog, we continue to expect full year revenue for Subsea services to be approximately $1 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA margin of at least 8.5%, implying a second half recovery. 
For Technip Energies, guidance is unchanged from the first quarter. With revenue in a range of $6.3 to $6.8 billion and an adjusted EBITDA margin of at least 10%. The implied step-up in second half revenue is in line with the continued ramp in major projects as supported by our backlog scheduling. 
And in Surface Technologies, we expect revenue in the range of $950 million to $1.15 billion, with revenue outside of North America, representing around 60% of the total segment revenue for the year. We expect adjusted EBITDA margin of at least 5.5%, broadly in line with the first half, but demonstrating recovery from the second quarter low. 
Turning to other guidance items. When excluding charges and credits, we now expect corporate expense of $130 million to $150 million. This is an improvement of more than 30% at the midpoint of the range versus prior year. The expense reduction reflects earlier than expected achievement of the cost reductions that we discussed last quarter and lower spending in the first half of the year due to COVID-19 constraints. This guidance also assumes a more normalized operating environment in the second half of the year. We expect our reported tax provision for the full year to be between $80 million and $90 million, excluding discrete items. While adjusted net income is forecast to be higher in the back half of the year, the tax provision should be slightly lower due to a change in jurisdictional mix. Free cash flow, which we define the cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, is expected to be between cash flow neutral and $150 million. All other guidance remains unchanged from the first quarter. 
Beyond free cash flow, we expect to make an additional cash dividend payment to the Yamal joint venture partners of approximately $100 million in the second half of the year. 
In summary, in an extremely turbulent time for the sector, our execution has remained strong, and we are well on track to our exceed our targeted cost savings. We continue to take steps to improve free cash flow and remain focused on our cost structure. Our strength in cash and liquidity and robust backlog have enabled us to accelerate our business transformation. And with the support of our cost reduction initiatives, our demonstrated ability to execute against a multitude of external headwinds and our improved visibility into the backlog we have provided guidance across all segments, given the greater confidence we have in our full year outlook.

We also provided you guidance now for the outlook for the remainder of the year, which actually has an increased delivery in the second half of the year relative to the first half of the year and an expectation of margins for at least 8.5%. 
Clearly, in the second quarter, we were challenged operationally by direct COVID expenses that were called out, but also indirectly, obviously, the overall business and the flow of the business was impacted. Happy to report that through the quarter, and certainly, since we spoke in this forum, most recently, back at the end of the first quarter, conditions have certainly improved. At that point, we had a significant number of our total operations that were either temporarily suspended or for -- or extended or suspended for an extended period of time. We're now back to having all of our facilities operating. 
That being said, we're not back to 100% operating efficiency. Although, again, the resiliency of the workforce and their dedication has really delivered some phenomenal results. So we expect that to continue to improve. Obviously, with the caveat that we don't know exactly what will be the future impacts of -- if there were to be future impacts related to the pandemic. But very proud of the work that the team has done, the progress that they've made, the ability to now have the confidence to give you the full year outlook for 2020.

And as Doug explained, we are beginning to see some return to normal. So assuming that trajectory continues, and we all know we can't necessarily project that, we would expect to see less in the third quarter. These are costs that we would expect to be eliminated from our operating structure given their nature. As we stand today, again, challenging to project what would happen with COVID, but we would expect them to be less in the back half.

And the first is we made our second payment against a previously settled litigation, and that outflow happened in the second quarter. Obviously, that's not repeating in the back half of the year. And you also may have seen the discussion of a settlement of about $130 million in the Technip Energies segment. While we were successful and good news in settling that this quarter, we will not see the cash flow attributed to that settlement until the beginning of next year. The second part of your question is whether or not you can consider the back half of the year as a more normal conversion. And I would say we're beginning to get there. As you well know, as Yamal continues to be a smaller contribution to our EBIT and frankly, less impact on working capital. We have less working capital impact in the back half of the year, and you can begin to see greater conversion. 
We are obviously assuming a series of projects milestones, you know how we stay, obviously, try to stay cash flow positive across those. You see the EBIT in the back half of the year based on our guidance, it would be improving. So you can begin to look at the back half of the year as a better representation of the conversion that you should expect in a more normalized environment."

So in Subsea, I talked about the project in Brazil, I talked about a project in Asia Pacific, which, by the way, is an iEPCI project utilizing Subsea 2.0 technology and I talked about a portfolio of projects in the North Sea recently announced by Equinor. 
In addition for Technip Energies, we announced the [indiscernible] project, which is over $1 billion in total value. So it's been a strong period for us in terms of awards. We have not been able to inbound all of those yet. Conditions haven't been met, but will be met. It's not a question of if the projects will be sanctioned, it's just a slight timing issue. And unfortunately, a few of those fell outside of Q2, but they certainly will be in the that's what provides us the confidence. 
So in my prepared remarks, to be very clear, I said that we have $1.7 billion in the first half of the year and we already have a clear line of sight on another $1.7 billion. So I think you have to look past the Q2 order rate, just because a lot of things fell into early Q3 or were awarded in Q2 but will be FID-ed in Q3. So if you add those together, we have 5 months to fill in the last 10% to approximate the $4 billion of the guidance that we had previously provided and therefore, I still have confidence, Amy, that we will achieve that. 
In terms of the conversations and the pricing, the clients are very much focused around ensuring they can achieve the very best project economics. Therefore, the majority of the conversations that we have and a very large portion of the total awards that we receive are direct awarded to our company, most of which don't actually come from that Subsea opportunity list that we publish, which is the list for the public domain that others also have access to. We have a list that -- and I indicated in my script, as much as $3 billion a year on a reoccurring basis that is exclusive to our company. This is what makes us so unique and which allows us to not only be the market leader, but extend our market leadership with our new technology offerings and our new commercial models. 
So those conversations really aren't around pricing, Amy. They are on the project economics. And we work together with a client in a very collaborative way to achieve those most favorable project economics. That's the difference between our company and the others in this space."

So directionally, that's constructive. It's early, but investors are going to start looking for 2021. So maybe too early for guidance, but maybe not too early to think about some of the building blocks. This year, you guided to at least $4 billion of awards. That's below 2020 revenue, so maybe growing revenue next year is a bit more challenged, that's where we end up. But I think your award commentary sounds pretty constructive [ here for ] some potential upside, maybe that's back half '20 or first half '21. Services opportunities could be better if COVID disruptions recede. Book and turn, still obviously very important. How would you frame those building blocks in terms of what drives margin progress back towards a more normalized level next year?"

And I think you highlighted the building blocks very well. If you look at the the order inbound projection for 2020, as we just discussed, you can start to project that in 2021 and we already have a lot of the potential revenue covered. We have a strong backlog. We've obviously just got done talking about additional awards and the additional awards in the second half of this year. So as far as the revenue line, and you're right, it's early to give 2021 guidance, let's remember, we just -- today are giving H2 2020 guidance, given the disruption that the world experienced last quarter. But it's fair to talk about. And as you said, we're seeing a nice progression of the margins in the second half of the year based upon the guidance that we provided. And as we look into 2021, we expect to continue to improve in terms of getting back to more normalized operating efficiency. We have a strong backlog we'll be adding new orders, as we just discussed. So when you look at it, again, it gives us confidence that we're going to continue to be able to go back to more normalized level of margins. 
Now 1 headwind, we have several, but the 1 headwind that I would point out that didn't come up in the -- in your question, is the fact that as some of this backlog rescheduling has occurred, it's naturally pushed out the latter stages of the iEPCI projects or any Subsea project. When we -- certainly, for us, it's the benefit of having the iEPCI projects, it's pushed out that installation campaign, in some cases, pushed it out of 2021 and into 2022. So that's the 1 headwind will be basically the fleet and the fleet utilization and the economic -- the low utilization, the economic impact that, that would have. That would have largely dissipated in 2021 based upon the strong orders we had in 2019 and again, what we were originally expecting for 2020. So it's kind of a balance. But I think when you look forward, you -- there's -- the backlog's strong. The backlog's resilient. We're getting new orders and certainly have a very large portion of the total market. We continue to add new alliance partners. It may not have come across in the script, so I'll repeat it. We are about to announce a new iEPCI exclusive alliance partner, a serious player in the Subsea space. So things are moving in the right direction. We obviously have to allow the COVID impact to dissipate, get back to a more normalized environment. We don't know what the future will bring in regards to the pandemic. So we have to be cautious. And we also have to consider that there's a bit of a headwind. But all that means is we're going to continue to move forward in the accretive and constructive direction in terms of the subsea margins. But realizing that the real benefit of the recovery of the fleet to the installation will now be more likely in the latter part of 2021 and 2022 versus -- which would have been more in 2020."

Maybe we could just have a similar discussion around Technip Energies, just thinking about building blocks into next year. So in this case, Yamal roll off is likely a headwind year-on-year for margins. Some big new projects still starting up. That's likely another headwind, at least for 2021. But maybe coverage for revenue looks more secure than subsea. So that probably helps to some degree. Just curious how confident you are in terms of being able to stay in that sweet spot but perhaps lower margins than when Yamal was a bigger part of the mix, but still staying above that underlying downstream level, so perhaps somewhere in the high single-digit type of range."

In terms of mix, you've described it well, we're expecting a step down in Yamal revenue, which will obviously affect the aggregate EBITDA of our results next year. 
On the other hand, the remaining of the portfolio has been accumulated in our backlog from a very selective approach. As you know, we're very far in the way and we make sure we choose and we're very selective in the prospect in the project we are involving. So that is reducing in a very sound gross margin side backlog ex-Yamal. And that you will see that next year in our portfolio. So very much linked with the execution that we've demonstrated that we are demonstrating. You can expect consistent delivering EBITDA. We'll have to normalize for sure, for Yamal. We'll have to take into account that Artic LNG 2 is progressing well. It's going to continue to ramp up. It will continue to be in the early phase, which obviously is associated with a prudent margin recognition. But overall, I would say, very strong, consistent margin profile that we expect from next year with that change in mix that you're understanding very well."

And although we are participants across the renewable space, we really want to focus on where we can provide differentiation and we can have returns that are very attractive versus, if you will, some of the more commoditized parts of the renewable space. So you touched on the 2 key ones. And it's very much how we see it, which is the electrification of the offshore, which is a a big opportunity. I would say there is a tremendous amount of enthusiasm and momentum on the subject. And we are very, very uniquely positioned here. Because there's a lot of attributes and technologies that are required to be able to do this. It's not simply providing the electricity, but it's the infrastructure and the equipment and the design and the interfaces with the Subsea completions that are really, really unique. We've been working on this for a period of time. We're partnering well with others in this space, and we believe this will be a very attractive opportunity for our clients as they have stated environmental ambitions that we can become a key partner for them and help them reach those ambitions. And this is an example of how we could do that. We're looking beyond just the electrification, and we're actually looking at the electrification through renewable energy. This is where our experience experience of being involved in the very first offshore floating wind farm gives us a lot of credibility in this space and a lot of experience and knowledge in this space. 
And as an example, not necessarily from offshore floating wind, but that could be a very unique solution and 1 that we're very well positioned to be able to provide to our clients. Another potential energy source could be hydrogen, as you point out, and we're very excited about that. 
I'm going to pass the microphone to Catherine, let her talk a bit about our vast experience in the area of hydrogen."

Obviously, we are extremely excited by the momentum around hydrogen these days. We do believe that hydrogen is going to play a pivotal role in the future energy mix being such a clean energy carrier, many, many different applications. The nice thing for us is that we've been in hydrogen for pretty much 60 years. We've installed 270 plants around the world. And obviously, this was called -- this is what we call gray hydrogen. But we've also -- and people might not know that. We've actually built 50 blue hydrogen units also across the world. So we have a very differentiated offering with a proprietary steam reformer unit. We have capabilities with some special equipment that help reduce CO2 emissions. So we have a lot of technology references and experience. 
In addition, we have a technology partnership on carbon capture. So when you combine all that, you understand why we are so excited about the prospects in blue hydrogen. And of course, when you look at the projection of hydrogen demand and hydrogen projection, there will be the need. And the most exciting proposition, if you like, comes from the clean hydrogen, which is pure clean hydrogen. However, the economics and the commercial equation does leave a lot of room for the blue hydrogen, which is the gray hydrogen with carbon capture, 
which is something that we commercially can today -- can provide today. So that's a very exciting, strong position for us today. If you look at the green hydrogen, obviously, it's a little bit more emerging, we also are excited about the capability and the potential of integrating green hydrogen units at industrial scale. So for large industry, which will benefit from green hydrogen, we think that our role as an integrator project management skill integration will be very useful in helping making the economics of this project work. So no matter what you look where you look in hydrogen, we think Technip Energies indeed has a big role to play. So that's very exciting, and it's starting now, by the way. So back to you, Doug."

And obviously, an exciting subject to follow up on. I'll be brief because I know we're running out of time. Actually, the electrification offshore, I would say, is as exciting about is hydrogen and could be very, very impactful. We're talking about going to zero-emission production that is quite significant. When you look at hydrogen gas of the renewables and of the differentiation that we have in this space, for us, it is the most exciting. And we believe or we can create the most differentiation and get very constructive returns, again, as opposed to a lot of the renewable space, which is the award numbers are large, but the returns are poor. And that's not the type of projects that we want to focus on. So we're going to keep driving and doing our part. We just joined the Hydrogen Council, and we want to be an active voice and an active advocate and really help to push the development in those areas. 
In terms of a percentage of the total contribution, we probably don't have enough time to get into all the dynamics of it. The question is, do you look at LNG as a very critical energy transition fuel, we certainly do. It certainly has a significant impact and the ability to be able to make it a fungible commodity through LNG. If you include LNG, it's a large percentage. If you exclude all hydrocarbon and just look at the pure renewables, it's a smaller portion of the company today, but we're pivoting strongly in this direction and securing to secure our future as well."

Thank you for participating in our second quarter earnings call. On the call today are Maryann Mannen, Chief Financial Officer; and Catherine MacGregor, President of Technip Energies.  Before commenti",2080,"Thank you, Matt. Good morning, and good afternoon. Thank you for participating in our second quarter earnings call. 
On the call today are Maryann Mannen, Chief Financial Officer; and Catherine MacGregor, President of Technip Energies.  
Before commenting on our operational and financial results, I would like to begin by recognizing the resilience of our global workforce. While the health and well-being of our employees, partners and customers is our top priority, these dedicated teams worked tirelessly to maintain business continuity in a safe and responsible manner. And throughout this very challenging period, they continue to advance projects and meet customer requirements, which was evident in our second quarter results. We also made solid progress in 3 core areas: strengthening our balance sheet, progressing our backlog scheduling and accelerating our business transformation, all to ensure the success of TechnipFMC, both through the current cycle and over the longer term.  
With regard to the balance sheet, we took a series of proactive steps in the quarter. We increased our liquidity by $1.2 billion, bringing total cash and liquidity to nearly $7 billion. And we secured a permanent modification to our primary debt covenant, which favorably impacts the company's total capitalization ratio. Together, these actions were taken to ensure that we have more than sufficient liquidity and can maintain full access to this liquidity in these challenging times. 
Turning to backlog. We experienced no cancellations, highlighting the resilience of the nearly $21 billion of backlog we have today. This significant backlog provides us with good visibility that extends over the next several years. 
Since the start of the COVID-19 outbreak, we have had constructive conversations with our customers. The dialogue has been very different than what we experienced in prior cycles. This has resulted in a more collaborative approach, creating new opportunities for us, enabled by our proven innovative solutions and demonstrated excellence in execution, and supported by the financial strength we possess to weather the market cycle. These unique attributes also allow us to more deeply engage in the way we partner and work with our customers. 
Looking at the second half of the year, we continue to add new projects to our backlog. TechnipFMC has been selected for the Mero 2 SURF EPCI project located in the Santos Basin. We will soon announce a new iEPCI project in Asia Pacific, that will be using our latest 2.0 technology, and we have secured several projects that will be inbound upon final sanctioning, including Subsea installation contracts recently announced by Equinor and the EPC contract for the Assiut Hydrocracking Complex, we announced earlier this month.  
Our strong balance sheet and liquidity position and our extensive backlog have also provided us with the flexibility to accelerate our business transformation, with global actions underway to generate annualized cost savings in excess of $350 million by year-end. We first highlighted the business transformation during our fourth quarter earnings call. These initiatives are driven by changes in opportunity created from the successful introduction of new business models, innovative technologies and digital solutions across our business.  
First, going forward, we will need fewer assets to deliver more comprehensive solutions. We will have fewer operating bases, service facilities and manufacturing sites. We are optimizing our operations across geographies. And if economic returns don't make sense, we will look to exit.  
We will have a smaller fleet. We continue to right size our assets to better align with our differentiated offering and the advantages of new technologies, such as Subsea 2.0 and integrated project delivery. And we continue to partner with others, providing us access to unique assets in a more capital-efficient manner. 
Second, we are taking targeted actions across the portfolio, particularly in Surface Technologies. In North America, we continue to transform our operations by working with our customers to further drive well-site operational efficiencies and lower greenhouse gas emissions. And we are leveraging the strength of our international franchise to capitalize on the longer-term growth anticipated in the Middle East, Asia Pacific and the North Sea. 
And finally, we continue to leverage digital technologies across our organization. Looking at one of our most recent innovations, we are accelerating the development and implementation of our Subsea Studio digital platform. Subsea Studio allows us to significantly reduce the time required for front-end engineering by as much as 50%, utilizing machine learning and AI to rapidly evaluate field development scenarios, leveraging the industry's largest database of prior projects and best practices. All of these actions are fully aligned with our strategy of market leadership and business transformation. These actions will drive the most value when we align with those clients and partners that demonstrate a willingness to embrace new commercial models and new technologies. We are further streamlining all of our businesses towards simplification, standardization and reduce cycle times.  
In 2019, the vast success of our Subsea integrated model was driven by the strength of our partner relationships and resulted in the company's highest annual growth rate in order inbound in over a decade. And we expect to enter into another exclusive iEPCI alliance that will be announced in conjunction with the client's first integrated project award. As I've said before, those that adopt innovative solutions are more likely to succeed in the new energy landscape. And we are even more convinced of this today, given the dramatic change in the external environment and its impact on our customers. 
And lastly, the third pillar of our business transformation is focused on the strategic initiatives across our portfolio that will deliver new, sustainable solutions to our clients. These initiatives will allow us to leverage our core competencies in engineering, manufacturing and project management, skills that are transferable and can be applied beyond traditional market segments. In Subsea, we have created fundamental change in the way we design, manage and execute projects, incorporating our Subsea 2.0 platform and greatly simplified the Subsea infrastructure, while reducing greenhouse gas emissions by nearly 50%. And when combined with iEPCI, it also simplifies vessel installation campaigns, providing an even greater environmental and economic benefits. 
Our vision for Subsea includes an all-electric Subsea system, powered by renewable energy. This will further simplify the Subsea infrastructure and reduce, if not eliminate, environmental emissions. 
In Technip Energies, we have significant expertise and prospects in the area of sustainable chemistry. Notably in biofuels, as Neste's partner of choice for renewable diesel projects. And we have further expanded our footprint in the circular economy through our collaboration with Carbios to demonstrate their recycling technologies. 
We have recently extended our Genesis offering to provide a portfolio of advisory services across all of our markets with a particular focus on energy transition. And we see a very exciting future for hydrogen, where we already have proven technology and references for blue hydrogen and are well positioned for the emerging market for green hydrogen. 
In Surface Technologies, we offer high-efficiency solutions that enable our clients to reach hydrocarbons faster with fully optimized and environmentally compact systems. Today, we have a project utilizing our integrated production system, high production, allowing the client to capture over 50% of the greenhouse gases that are typically released into the atmosphere during the production phase of an unconventional development. In summary, we have the expertise across all segments of the business to deliver the innovative, sustainable solutions that will enable our clients to meet their carbon reduction ambitions.
Let me turn to the Subsea outlook. On our first quarter call, we noted that up to 50% of the estimated $15 billion in project value captured on our Subsea opportunity list could be extended beyond the 24-month window. The updated list now reflects real evidence of this trend. Based on public disclosures made by operators, we have identified 8 specific projects that have been extended beyond mid-2022. Importantly, none of these projects have been canceled, and they remain longer-term opportunities for future awards. There have also been new projects added across 4 different basins that we believe will be awarded within the next 2 years, suggesting that previously identified reduction in value for these opportunities, once thought to be as high as 50%, is actually closer to 30%. Remember, the Subsea opportunity list is not a complete list of opportunities available to TechnipFMC. Beyond this large project activity, our orders have been driven by subsea services, direct iEPCI awards and small project activity, much of which is exclusive to our company. 
This opportunity set has generated over $3 billion of inbound in each of the last 3 years and is enabled by our market-leading installed base, growing list of alliance partners and unique integrated feed capabilities. Our front-end engineering teams remain very active, and more than 60% of all integrated feed work is leveraging the benefits of Subsea Studio. We believe this will generate additional proprietary opportunities, some of which will come from our exclusive alliance partners over the next 12 to 18 months. 
For 2020, we continue to believe inbound orders will approximate $4 billion. In the first half of the year, we had $1.7 billion of subsea inbound. And with 5 months remaining in the year, we already see a similar level of inbound for the second half of the year coming from subsea services, small project activity and large project awards pending public announcement. In the interim, we will continue to work closely with our customers as they adjust to the current environment. And we are excited to serve the new entrants that will likely step in to operate potentially stranded opportunities. 
That said, long-term success in Subsea is driven by economics, innovation and relationships, all key attributes of TechnipFMC. This makes us uniquely qualified to remain the Subsea partner of choice now more than ever. 
Turning to LNG. We are currently in the delivery phase of 2 major projects, Coral floating LNG and Arctic LNG 2, and we continue to advance through the warranty phase of Yamal LNG. Yamal been the industry's most successful project ever, and the strength in our execution certainly played a role in NovaTek made consortium's decision to direct award Arctic LNG 2 to TechnipFMC. 
Despite the challenges of COVID-19, we are making good progress on all of these projects. On Arctic LNG 2, we continue to expect the activity to ramp as scheduled over the remainder of 2020. And on the Coral FLNG, we continue to achieve key milestones relating to module integration and instrumentation. Successful execution of these technically and logistically complex projects create strong references, leaving us well positioned to be a key player in the development of the industry's most strategic LNG projects. 
Market dynamics have shifted in recent months. And this will alter the broader LNG landscape in the near term. The number of economically viable projects is likely to decline, but the same can be said of the list of qualified EPC contractors, which will be challenged in this period of subdued project sanctioning. This is not the case for Technip Energies. We have demonstrated remarkable resilience through past cycles, and we don't see this as the start of an extended downturn for us. We have already been awarded 2 additional projects, the first being Rovuma in Mozambique; and the second, Energia Costa Azul in Mexico. Both remain subject to final investment decision, and either of these projects are included in our backlog. While Rovuma has been delayed until 2021, the operator for Costa Azul continues to indicate that FID will take place this year.  
In addition, we are actively tendering a major project in the Middle East and performing front-end engineering work on other LNG prospects. Some of which are likely to move forward due, in part, to their strategic importance to their host country. This potential portfolio of LNG projects will provide us with well-timed project overlap and operational continuity. And the portfolio beyond LNG remains diverse. We have built a solid track record of successful execution, delivering strategic references in areas such as downstream and petrochemicals that leave us well positioned for future project awards. 
We entered this period with a solid foundation built upon the strength of our balance sheet, backlog and execution. While client conversations remain ongoing, the increased visibility we have today gives us confidence in our full year guidance for all business segments. This is further supported by the acceleration of our business transformation initiatives to maintain, if not expand, our market leadership.
I will now turn the call over to Maryann to discuss our financial results in more detail."
1342651,673458799,2051433,"TechnipFMC plc, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2020",2020-07-30,"Earnings Calls","TechnipFMC plc","Executives","Thank you, Doug. Looking at our headline numbers for the quarter, revenue totaled $3.2 billion driven by solid performance in both, Subsea and Technip Energies, while Surface Technologies revenue was impacted by a severe decline in activity in North Ameri",1382,"Thank you, Doug. Looking at our headline numbers for the quarter, revenue totaled $3.2 billion driven by solid performance in both, Subsea and Technip Energies, while Surface Technologies revenue was impacted by a severe decline in activity in North America. Year-over-year revenue decreased as a result of reduced activity, operational headwinds from COVID-19 and foreign exchange impacts. 
Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was $241 million. We accelerated our cost reduction program and are on track to deliver cost savings of more than $350 million by year-end. And we expect a greater benefit from these savings in the second half of the year with the full impact realized in 2021. We estimate total cash cost to achieve our planned cost savings target to be approximately $75 million. 
Underlying corporate expense have improved over the last 3 consecutive quarters, giving us confidence to lower our full year guidance, which I'll come back to in a moment. 
Beginning with the second quarter, foreign exchange impacts are now reported separately from corporate expense to provide greater clarity in our financial statements. Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.09 when excluding after-tax charges and credits. Included in our adjusted earnings, our expenses, resulting from increased liability payable to joint venture partners, included in interest expense and foreign exchange losses. Together, these 2 items impacted EPS by $0.12 per share in the period. And if excluded, our adjusted earnings per share would have been $0.22 per diluted share. 
The company ended the period with cash of $4.8 billion. Net cash was $303 million. We have increased visibility on our cash uses and inflows for the remainder of the year and have provided guidance around our free cash flow outlook. 
Turning to the segment highlights. Direct COVID-19 expenses for the company totaled $57 million in the second quarter. Year-on-year Subsea revenue declined by 9%, but would have been unchanged when excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange translation of $129 million due to the strengthening U.S. dollar. While year-over-year comparisons are usually more relevant for this segment, the 10% sequential improvement in Subsea revenue demonstrated our ability to mitigate COVID-19-related disruptions in the quarter. 
Subsea adjusted EBITDA margin was down 510 basis points versus the prior year quarter, primarily due to the negative operational impacts related to COVID-19 and more competitively priced backlog, mitigated, in part, by cost reduction initiatives. Sequentially, the margin only declined 120 basis points, as strong execution partially offset an entire quarter of COVID-19-related disruptions. 
Looking at Technip Energies, execution remains solid across the portfolio. Revenue increased versus the prior year quarter, driven by higher activity across LNG, downstream and our process technology business. The continued ramp-up on Arctic LNG 2 more than offset the decline in revenue from Yamal LNG. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 10.6% remains strong even as we return to more normalized levels, given a reduced year-on-year contribution from Yamal and lower margin realization on early stage projects. Although no project awards were announced during the quarter -- second quarter, inbound orders of $836 million demonstrated good activity in services, process technology and loading systems as well as expanded scopes on existing contracts. 
And in Surface Technologies, revenue was significantly affected by the dramatic decline in operator activity in North America. Revenue outside North America proved to be resilient with only a modest sequential decline, supported by solid activity in the Middle East. Sequentially, adjusted EBITDA margin declined 400 basis points to 3.4%. The decrease was driven by the significant decline in rig count and completions-related activity in North America. We are aggressively addressing our cost base.  
In North America, where the majority of our restructuring for the segment has occurred, we have significantly lowered the breakeven point, which supports our expectation for positive adjusted EBITDA in North America for the full year. 
As Doug mentioned in his remarks, we have taken actions to reduce the impact of the current economic environment on our financial and liquidity position. We added 2 additional liquidity sources in the quarter, a EUR 500 million revolving credit facility. This facility is undrawn. And a GBP 600 million Bank of England COVID-19 commercial paper facility. This facility carries lower interest rates than most of our other sources. We took the opportunity to secure this for the incremental liquidity, if needed, but it has the benefit of lowering interest expense in these challenged credit markets. 
Given the assets to lower cost funding, we repaid the $500 million outstanding balance on our existing revolving credit facility. When considering all actions taken in the quarter and including cash of $5.6 billion, net liquidity stood at $6.8 billion at the end of the quarter, up $1.2 billion when compared to the end of March. In the quarter, we also secured a permanent amendment to the debt-to-capitalization covenant of our revolver, allowing for the add-back of $3.2 billion of previously impaired goodwill. This significantly increases the equity value used in the calculation, providing us with strong support liquidity available to us today. The ratio for the second quarter is 38%.  
In the quarter, we all took steps to extend our debt maturity profiles. First, with the private placement that came due this month, we are currently working to address the short-term maturities coming due in 2021. 
Turning to guidance. We are now providing 2020 guidance for all 3 operating segments as well as free cash flow. In Subsea, we are guiding full year revenue to be in the range of $5.3 billion to $5.6 billion, supported by the backlog scheduled in the second half. In addition to backlog, we continue to expect full year revenue for subsea services to be approximately $1 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA margin of at least 8.5%, implying a second half recovery.  
For Technip Energies, guidance is unchanged from the first quarter, with revenue in a range of $6.3 billion to $6.8 billion and an adjusted EBITDA margin of at least 10%. The implied step-up in second half revenue is in line with the continued ramp in major projects as supported by our backlog scheduling.  
And in Surface Technologies, we expect revenue in the range of $950 million to $1.15 billion, with revenue outside of North America, representing around 60% of the total segment revenue for the year. We expect adjusted EBITDA margin of at least 5.5%, broadly in line with the first half, but demonstrating recovery from the second quarter low. 
Turning to other guidance items. When excluding charges and credits, we now expect corporate expense of $130 million to $150 million. This is an improvement of more than 30% at the midpoint of the range versus prior year. The expense reduction reflects earlier-than-expected achievement of the cost reductions that we discussed last quarter and lower spending in the first half of the year due to COVID-19 constraints. This guidance also assumes a more normalized operating environment in the second half of the year. We expect our reported tax provision for the full year to be between $80 million and $90 million, excluding discrete items. While adjusted net income is forecast to be higher in the back half of the year, the tax provision should be slightly lower due to a change in jurisdictional mix. Free cash flow, which we define as cash flow from operations, less capital expenditures, is expected to be between cash flow neutral and $150 million. All other guidance remains unchanged from the first quarter. 
Beyond free cash flow, we expect to make an additional cash dividend payment to the Yamal joint venture partners of approximately $100 million in the second half of the year. 
In summary, in an extremely turbulent time for the sector, our execution has remained strong, and we are well on track to exceed our targeted cost savings. We continue to take steps to improve free cash flow and remain focused on our cost structure. Our strength in cash and liquidity and robust backlog have enabled us to accelerate our business transformation. And with the support of our cost reduction initiatives, our demonstrated ability to execute against a multitude of external headwinds and our improved visibility into the backlog, we have provided guidance across all segments, given the greater confidence we have in our full year outlook.

We -- not only did we deliver on the Q2 results, we also provided you guidance now for the outlook for the remainder of the year which actually has an increased delivery in the second half of the year relative to the first half of the year and an expectation of margins for at least 8.5%. Clearly, in the second quarter, we were challenged operationally by direct COVID expenses that were called out. But also indirectly, obviously, the overall business and the flow of the business was impacted. Happy to report that through the quarter, and certainly, since we spoke in this forum, most recently back at the end of the first quarter, conditions have certainly improved. At that point, we had a significant number of our total operations that were either temporarily suspended for extended period of time. We're now back to having all of our facilities operating.  
That being said, we're not back to 100% operating efficiency. Although, again, the resiliency of the workforce and their dedication has really delivered some phenomenal results. So we expect that to continue to improve. Obviously, with the caveat that we don't know exactly what will be the future impacts of -- if there were to be future impacts related to the pandemic.

These are not costs of inefficiencies in our plant, as Doug mentioned, meaning lower utilization, lower operating rates, the impact of delayed supply chains. Those stay within our margins. And as Doug explained, we are beginning to see some return to normal. So assuming that trajectory continues, and we all know we can't necessarily project that, we would expect to see less in the third quarter. These are costs that we would expect to be eliminated from our operating structure, given their nature. As we stand today, again, challenging to project what would happen with COVID, but we would expect them to be less in the back half.

One thing to keep in mind is as you look at the year-to-date performance, in particular, in the quarter, we had 2 items that happened in the quarter that I would say are certainly not necessarily operational and not repeating. And the first is we made our second payment against a previously settled litigation. And that outflow happened in the second quarter. Obviously, that's not repeating in the back half of the year. And you also may have seen the discussion of a settlement of about $130 million in the Technip Energies segment. While we were successful and good news in settling that this quarter, we will not see the cash flow attributed to that settlement until the beginning of next year. 
The second part of your question is whether or not you can consider the back half of the year as a more normal conversion. And I would say we're beginning to get there. As you well know, as Yamal continues to be a smaller contribution to our EBIT and, frankly, less impact on working capital, we have less working capital impact in the back half of the year, and you can begin to see greater conversion. We are obviously assuming a series of projects milestones. We stay -- obviously, try to stay cash flow positive across those. You see the EBIT in the back half of the year based on our guidance, would be improving. 
So you can begin to look at the back half of the year as a better representation of the conversion that you should expect in a more normalized environment."

In my prepared remarks, I tried to highlight the fact that we have received several awards, which have not yet been announced or not yet been met all the requirements for us to include in our backlog, both in Subsea as well as in Technip Energi",479,"Sure, Amy. In my prepared remarks, I tried to highlight the fact that we have received several awards, which have not yet been announced or not yet been met all the requirements for us to include in our backlog, both in Subsea as well as in Technip Energies. So in Subsea, I talked about the project in Brazil. I talked about a project in Asia Pacific, which, by the way, is an iEPCI project utilizing Subsea 2.0 technology. And I talked about a portfolio of projects in the North Sea recently announced by Equinor. 
In addition for Technip Energies, we announced the Assiut project, which is over $1 billion in total value. So it's been a strong period for us in terms of awards. We have not been able to inbound all of those yet. Conditions haven't been met, but will be met. It's not a question of if the projects will be sanctioned, it's just a slight timing issue. And unfortunately, a few of those fell outside of Q2, but they certainly will be in Q3. That's what provides us the confidence.  
So in my prepared remarks, to be very clear, I said that we have $1.7 billion in the first half of the year. And we already have a clear line of sight on another $1.7 billion. So I think you have to look past the Q2 order rate just because a lot of things fell into early Q3 or were awarded in Q2 but will be FID-ed in Q3. So if you add those together, we have 5 months to fill in the last 10% to approximate the $4 billion of the guidance that we had previously provided and, therefore, I still have confidence, Amy, that we will achieve that.  
In terms of the conversations and the pricing, the clients are very much focused around ensuring they can achieve the very best project economics. Therefore, the majority of the conversations that we have and a very large portion of the total awards that we receive are direct award into our company, most of which don't actually come from that Subsea opportunity list that we publish, which is the list for the public domain that others also have access to. We have a list that -- and I indicated in my script, as much as $3 billion a year on a reoccurring basis that is exclusive to our company. This is what makes us so unique and which allows us to not only be the market leader, but extend our market leadership with our new technology offerings and our new commercial models. 
So those conversations really aren't around pricing, Amy. They are on the project economics. And we work together with a client in a very collaborative way to achieve those most favorable project economics. That's the difference between our company and the others in this space."

The guidance for fiscal '20 implies a 9% plus type number for the back half. So directionally, that's constructive. It's early, but investors are going to start looking for 2021. So maybe too early for guidance, but maybe not too early to think about some of the building blocks. This year, you guided to at least $4 billion of awards. That's below 2020 revenue, so maybe growing revenue next year is a bit more challenged, that's where we end up. But I think your award commentary sounds pretty constructive here for some potential upside, maybe that's back half '20 or first half '21. Services opportunities could be better if COVID disruptions recede. Book and turn, still obviously very important. How would you frame those building blocks in terms of what drives margin progress back towards a more normalized level next year?"

If you look at the the order inbound projection for 2020, as we just discussed, you can start to project that in 2021. We already have a lot of the potential revenue covered. We have a strong backlog. We've obviously just got done talking about additional awards and the additional awards in the second half of this year. 
So as far as the revenue line, and you're right, it's early to give 2021 guidance, let's remember, we just, today, are giving H2 2020 guidance, given the disruption that the world experienced last quarter. But it's fair to talk about. And as you said, we're seeing a nice progression of the margins in the second half of the year based upon the guidance that we provided. And as we look into 2021, we expect to continue to improve in terms of getting back to more normalized operating efficiency. We have a strong backlog. We'll be adding new orders, as we just discussed. So when you look at it, again, it gives us confidence that we're going to continue to be able to go back to more normalized level of margins.  
Now one headwind -- we have several, but the one headwind that I would point out that didn't come up in the -- in your question, is the fact that as some of this backlog rescheduling has occurred, it's naturally pushed out the latter stages of the iEPCI projects or any Subsea project. When we -- certainly, for us, it's the benefit of having the iEPCI projects. It's pushed out that installation campaign, in some cases, pushed it out of 2021 and into 2022. So that's the one headwind will be basically the fleet and the fleet utilization and the economic -- the low utilization, the economic impact that, that would have. That would have largely dissipated in 2021 based upon the strong orders we had in 2019 and, again, what we were originally expecting for 2020. 
So it's kind of a balance. But I think when you look forward, you -- there's -- the backlog's strong. The backlog's resilient. We're getting new orders and certainly have a very large portion of the total market. We continue to add new alliance partners. It may not have come across in the script, so I'll repeat it. We are about to announce a new iEPCI exclusive alliance partner, a serious player in the Subsea space. 
So things are moving in the right direction. We obviously have to allow the COVID impact to dissipate, get back to a more normalized environment. We don't know what the future will bring in regards to the pandemic. So we have to be cautious. And we also have to consider that there's a bit of a headwind. But all that means is we're going to continue to move forward in the accretive and constructive direction in terms of the Subsea margins. But realizing that the real benefit of the recovery of the fleet to the installation will now be more likely in the latter part of 2021 and 2022 versus -- which would have been more in 2020. I hope that helps you, Sean."

In terms of mix, you've described it well, we're expecting a step down in Yamal revenue, which will obviously affect the aggregate EBITDA of our results next year.  
On the other hand, the remaining of the portfolio has been accumulated in our backlog from a very selective approach. As you know, we're very far in the way, and we make sure we choose, and we're very selective in the prospect in the project we are involving. So that is reducing in a very sound gross margin side backlog ex Yamal. And that you will see that next year in our portfolio. 
So very much linked with the execution that we've demonstrated that we are demonstrating. You can expect consistent delivering EBITDA. We'll have to normalize, for sure, for Yamal. We'll have to take into account that Artic LNG 2 is progressing well. It's going to continue to ramp up. It will continue to be in the early phase, which obviously is associated with a prudent margin recognition.

So you touched on the 2 key ones. And it's very much how we see it, which is the electrification of the offshore, which is a big opportunity. I would say there is a tremendous amount of enthusiasm and momentum on the subject. And we are very, very uniquely positioned here because there's a lot of attributes and technologies that are required to be able to do this. It's not simply providing the electricity, but it's the infrastructure and the equipment and the design and the interfaces with the Subsea completions that are really, really unique. We've been working on this for a period of time. We're partnering well with others in this space, and we believe this will be a very attractive opportunity for our clients as they have stated environmental ambitions that we can become a key partner for them and help them reach those ambitions. And this is an example of how we could do that. 
We're looking beyond just the electrification, and we're actually looking at the electrification through renewable energy. This is where our experience of being involved in the very first offshore floating wind farm gives us a lot of credibility in this space and a lot of experience and knowledge in this space. And as an example, not necessarily from offshore floating wind, but that could be a very unique solution and one that we're very well positioned to be able to provide to our clients. Another potential energy source could be hydrogen, as you point out, and we're very excited about that.

Obviously, we are extremely excited by the momentum around hydrogen these days. We do believe that hydrogen is going to play a pivotal role in the future energy mix being such a clean energy carrier, many, many different applications. The nice thing for us is that we've been in hydrogen for pretty much 60 years. We've installed 270 plants around the world. And obviously, this was called -- this is what we call gray hydrogen. But we've also -- and people might not know that. We've actually built 50 blue hydrogen units also across the world. So we have a very differentiated offering with a proprietary steam reformer unit. We have capabilities with some special equipment that help reduce CO2 emissions. So we have a lot of technology references and experience.  
In addition, we have a technology partnership on carbon capture. So when you combine all that, you understand why we are so excited about the prospects in blue hydrogen. And of course, when you look at the projection of hydrogen demand and hydrogen projection, there will be the need. And the most exciting proposition, if you like, comes from the green hydrogen, which is pure clean hydrogen. However, the economics and the commercial equation does leave a lot of room for the blue hydrogen, which is the gray hydrogen with carbon capture, which is something that we commercially can today -- can provide today. So that's a very exciting, strong position for us today. 
If you look at the green hydrogen, obviously, it's a little bit more emerging. We also are excited about the capability and the potential of integrating green hydrogen units at industrial scale. So for large industry, which will benefit from green hydrogen, we think that our role as an integrator, project management skill integration will be very useful in helping making the economics of this project work. So no matter what you look, where you look in hydrogen, we think Technip Energies, indeed, has a big role to play. So that's very exciting, and it's starting now, by the way. So back to you, Doug."

We're talking about going to zero-emission production that is quite significant. When you look at hydrogen, yes, of the renewables and of the differentiation that we have in this space, for us, it is the most exciting. And we believe or we can create the most differentiation and get very constructive returns, again, as opposed to a lot of the renewable space, which is the award numbers are large, but the returns are poor. And that's not the type of projects that we want to focus on. So we're going to keep driving and doing our part. We just joined the Hydrogen Council, and we want to be an active voice and an active advocate and really help to push the development in those areas. 
In terms of a percentage of the total contribution, we probably don't have enough time to get into all the dynamics of it. The question is, do you look at LNG as a very critical energy transition fuel, we certainly do. It certainly has a significant impact and the ability to be able to make it a fungible commodity through LNG. If you include LNG, it's a large percentage. If you exclude all hydrocarbon and just look at the pure renewables, it's a smaller portion of the company today, but we're pivoting strongly in this direction and securing to secure our future as well."

Before commenti",2080,"Thank you, Matt. Good morning, and good afternoon. Thank you for participating in our second quarter earnings call. 
On the call today are Maryann Mannen, Chief Financial Officer; and Catherine MacGregor, President of Technip Energies.  
Before commenting on our operational and financial results, I would like to begin by recognizing the resilience of our global workforce. While the health and well-being of our employees, partners and customers is our top priority, these dedicated teams worked tirelessly to maintain business continuity in a safe and responsible manner. And throughout this very challenging period, they continue to advance projects and meet customer requirements, which was evident in our second quarter results. We also made solid progress in 3 core areas: strengthening our balance sheet, progressing our backlog scheduling and accelerating our business transformation, all to ensure the success of TechnipFMC, both through the current cycle and over the longer term.  
With regard to the balance sheet, we took a series of proactive steps in the quarter. We increased our liquidity by $1.2 billion, bringing total cash and liquidity to nearly $7 billion. And we secured a permanent modification to our primary debt covenant, which favorably impacts the company's total capitalization ratio. Together, these actions were taken to ensure that we have more than sufficient liquidity and can maintain full access to this liquidity in these challenging times. 
Turning to backlog. We experienced no cancellations, highlighting the resilience of the nearly $21 billion of backlog we have today. This significant backlog provides us with good visibility that extends over the next several years. 
Since the start of the COVID-19 outbreak, we have had constructive conversations with our customers. The dialogue has been very different than what we experienced in prior cycles. This has resulted in a more collaborative approach, creating new opportunities for us, enabled by our proven innovative solutions and demonstrated excellence in execution, and supported by the financial strength we possess to weather the market cycle. These unique attributes also allow us to more deeply engage in the way we partner and work with our customers. 
Looking at the second half of the year, we continue to add new projects to our backlog. TechnipFMC has been selected for the Mero 2 SURF EPCI project located in the Santos Basin. We will soon announce a new iEPCI project in Asia Pacific, that will be using our latest 2.0 technology, and we have secured several projects that will be inbound upon final sanctioning, including Subsea installation contracts recently announced by Equinor and the EPC contract for the Assiut Hydrocracking Complex, we announced earlier this month.  
Our strong balance sheet and liquidity position and our extensive backlog have also provided us with the flexibility to accelerate our business transformation, with global actions underway to generate annualized cost savings in excess of $350 million by year-end. We first highlighted the business transformation during our fourth quarter earnings call. These initiatives are driven by changes in opportunity created from the successful introduction of new business models, innovative technologies and digital solutions across our business.  
First, going forward, we will need fewer assets to deliver more comprehensive solutions. We will have fewer operating bases, service facilities and manufacturing sites. We are optimizing our operations across geographies. And if economic returns don't make sense, we will look to exit.  
We will have a smaller fleet. We continue to right size our assets to better align with our differentiated offering and the advantages of new technologies, such as Subsea 2.0 and integrated project delivery. And we continue to partner with others, providing us access to unique assets in a more capital-efficient manner. 
Second, we are taking targeted actions across the portfolio, particularly in Surface Technologies. In North America, we continue to transform our operations by working with our customers to further drive well-site operational efficiencies and lower greenhouse gas emissions. And we are leveraging the strength of our international franchise to capitalize on the longer-term growth anticipated in the Middle East, Asia Pacific and the North Sea. 
And finally, we continue to leverage digital technologies across our organization. Looking at one of our most recent innovations, we are accelerating the development and implementation of our Subsea Studio digital platform. Subsea Studio allows us to significantly reduce the time required for front-end engineering by as much as 50%, utilizing machine learning and AI to rapidly evaluate field development scenarios, leveraging the industry's largest database of prior projects and best practices. All of these actions are fully aligned with our strategy of market leadership and business transformation. These actions will drive the most value when we align with those clients and partners that demonstrate a willingness to embrace new commercial models and new technologies. We are further streamlining all of our businesses towards simplification, standardization and reduce cycle times.  
In 2019, the vast success of our Subsea integrated model was driven by the strength of our partner relationships and resulted in the company's highest annual growth rate in order inbound in over a decade. And we expect to enter into another exclusive iEPCI alliance that will be announced in conjunction with the client's first integrated project award. As I've said before, those that adopt innovative solutions are more likely to succeed in the new energy landscape. And we are even more convinced of this today, given the dramatic change in the external environment and its impact on our customers. 
And lastly, the third pillar of our business transformation is focused on the strategic initiatives across our portfolio that will deliver new, sustainable solutions to our clients. These initiatives will allow us to leverage our core competencies in engineering, manufacturing and project management, skills that are transferable and can be applied beyond traditional market segments. In Subsea, we have created fundamental change in the way we design, manage and execute projects, incorporating our Subsea 2.0 platform and greatly simplified the Subsea infrastructure, while reducing greenhouse gas emissions by nearly 50%. And when combined with iEPCI, it also simplifies vessel installation campaigns, providing an even greater environmental and economic benefits. 
Our vision for Subsea includes an all-electric Subsea system, powered by renewable energy. This will further simplify the Subsea infrastructure and reduce, if not eliminate, environmental emissions. 
In Technip Energies, we have significant expertise and prospects in the area of sustainable chemistry. Notably in biofuels, as Neste's partner of choice for renewable diesel projects. And we have further expanded our footprint in the circular economy through our collaboration with Carbios to demonstrate their recycling technologies. 
We have recently extended our Genesis offering to provide a portfolio of advisory services across all of our markets with a particular focus on energy transition. And we see a very exciting future for hydrogen, where we already have proven technology and references for blue hydrogen and are well positioned for the emerging market for green hydrogen. 
In Surface Technologies, we offer high-efficiency solutions that enable our clients to reach hydrocarbons faster with fully optimized and environmentally compact systems. Today, we have a project utilizing our integrated production system, high production, allowing the client to capture over 50% of the greenhouse gases that are typically released into the atmosphere during the production phase of an unconventional development. In summary, we have the expertise across all segments of the business to deliver the innovative, sustainable solutions that will enable our clients to meet their carbon reduction ambitions.
Let me turn to the Subsea outlook. On our first quarter call, we noted that up to 50% of the estimated $15 billion in project value captured on our Subsea opportunity list could be extended beyond the 24-month window. The updated list now reflects real evidence of this trend. Based on public disclosures made by operators, we have identified 8 specific projects that have been extended beyond mid-2022. Importantly, none of these projects have been canceled, and they remain longer-term opportunities for future awards. There have also been new projects added across 4 different basins that we believe will be awarded within the next 2 years, suggesting that previously identified reduction in value for these opportunities, once thought to be as high as 50%, is actually closer to 30%. Remember, the Subsea opportunity list is not a complete list of opportunities available to TechnipFMC. Beyond this large project activity, our orders have been driven by subsea services, direct iEPCI awards and small project activity, much of which is exclusive to our company. 
This opportunity set has generated over $3 billion of inbound in each of the last 3 years and is enabled by our market-leading installed base, growing list of alliance partners and unique integrated feed capabilities. Our front-end engineering teams remain very active, and more than 60% of all integrated feed work is leveraging the benefits of Subsea Studio. We believe this will generate additional proprietary opportunities, some of which will come from our exclusive alliance partners over the next 12 to 18 months. 
For 2020, we continue to believe inbound orders will approximate $4 billion. In the first half of the year, we had $1.7 billion of subsea inbound. And with 5 months remaining in the year, we already see a similar level of inbound for the second half of the year coming from subsea services, small project activity and large project awards pending public announcement. In the interim, we will continue to work closely with our customers as they adjust to the current environment. And we are excited to serve the new entrants that will likely step in to operate potentially stranded opportunities. 
That said, long-term success in Subsea is driven by economics, innovation and relationships, all key attributes of TechnipFMC. This makes us uniquely qualified to remain the Subsea partner of choice now more than ever. 
Turning to LNG. We are currently in the delivery phase of 2 major projects, Coral floating LNG and Arctic LNG 2, and we continue to advance through the warranty phase of Yamal LNG. Yamal been the industry's most successful project ever, and the strength in our execution certainly played a role in NovaTek made consortium's decision to direct award Arctic LNG 2 to TechnipFMC. 
Despite the challenges of COVID-19, we are making good progress on all of these projects. On Arctic LNG 2, we continue to expect the activity to ramp as scheduled over the remainder of 2020. And on the Coral FLNG, we continue to achieve key milestones relating to module integration and instrumentation. Successful execution of these technically and logistically complex projects create strong references, leaving us well positioned to be a key player in the development of the industry's most strategic LNG projects. 
Market dynamics have shifted in recent months. And this will alter the broader LNG landscape in the near term. The number of economically viable projects is likely to decline, but the same can be said of the list of qualified EPC contractors, which will be challenged in this period of subdued project sanctioning. This is not the case for Technip Energies. We have demonstrated remarkable resilience through past cycles, and we don't see this as the start of an extended downturn for us. We have already been awarded 2 additional projects, the first being Rovuma in Mozambique; and the second, Energia Costa Azul in Mexico. Both remain subject to final investment decision, and either of these projects are included in our backlog. While Rovuma has been delayed until 2021, the operator for Costa Azul continues to indicate that FID will take place this year.  
In addition, we are actively tendering a major project in the Middle East and performing front-end engineering work on other LNG prospects. Some of which are likely to move forward due, in part, to their strategic importance to their host country. This potential portfolio of LNG projects will provide us with well-timed project overlap and operational continuity. And the portfolio beyond LNG remains diverse. We have built a solid track record of successful execution, delivering strategic references in areas such as downstream and petrochemicals that leave us well positioned for future project awards. 
We entered this period with a solid foundation built upon the strength of our balance sheet, backlog and execution. While client conversations remain ongoing, the increased visibility we have today gives us confidence in our full year guidance for all business segments. This is further supported by the acceleration of our business transformation initiatives to maintain, if not expand, our market leadership.
I will now turn the call over to Maryann to discuss our financial results in more detail."

Looking at our headline numbers for the quarter, revenue totaled $3.2 billion driven by solid performance in both, Subsea and Technip Energies, while Surface Technologies revenue was impacted by a severe decline in activity in North Ameri",1382,"Thank you, Doug. Looking at our headline numbers for the quarter, revenue totaled $3.2 billion driven by solid performance in both, Subsea and Technip Energies, while Surface Technologies revenue was impacted by a severe decline in activity in North America. Year-over-year revenue decreased as a result of reduced activity, operational headwinds from COVID-19 and foreign exchange impacts. 
Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was $241 million. We accelerated our cost reduction program and are on track to deliver cost savings of more than $350 million by year-end. And we expect a greater benefit from these savings in the second half of the year with the full impact realized in 2021. We estimate total cash cost to achieve our planned cost savings target to be approximately $75 million. 
Underlying corporate expense have improved over the last 3 consecutive quarters, giving us confidence to lower our full year guidance, which I'll come back to in a moment. 
Beginning with the second quarter, foreign exchange impacts are now reported separately from corporate expense to provide greater clarity in our financial statements. Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.09 when excluding after-tax charges and credits. Included in our adjusted earnings, our expenses, resulting from increased liability payable to joint venture partners, included in interest expense and foreign exchange losses. Together, these 2 items impacted EPS by $0.12 per share in the period. And if excluded, our adjusted earnings per share would have been $0.22 per diluted share. 
The company ended the period with cash of $4.8 billion. Net cash was $303 million. We have increased visibility on our cash uses and inflows for the remainder of the year and have provided guidance around our free cash flow outlook. 
Turning to the segment highlights. Direct COVID-19 expenses for the company totaled $57 million in the second quarter. Year-on-year Subsea revenue declined by 9%, but would have been unchanged when excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange translation of $129 million due to the strengthening U.S. dollar. While year-over-year comparisons are usually more relevant for this segment, the 10% sequential improvement in Subsea revenue demonstrated our ability to mitigate COVID-19-related disruptions in the quarter. 
Subsea adjusted EBITDA margin was down 510 basis points versus the prior year quarter, primarily due to the negative operational impacts related to COVID-19 and more competitively priced backlog, mitigated, in part, by cost reduction initiatives. Sequentially, the margin only declined 120 basis points, as strong execution partially offset an entire quarter of COVID-19-related disruptions. 
Looking at Technip Energies, execution remains solid across the portfolio. Revenue increased versus the prior year quarter, driven by higher activity across LNG, downstream and our process technology business. The continued ramp-up on Arctic LNG 2 more than offset the decline in revenue from Yamal LNG. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 10.6% remains strong even as we return to more normalized levels, given a reduced year-on-year contribution from Yamal and lower margin realization on early stage projects. Although no project awards were announced during the quarter -- second quarter, inbound orders of $836 million demonstrated good activity in services, process technology and loading systems as well as expanded scopes on existing contracts. 
And in Surface Technologies, revenue was significantly affected by the dramatic decline in operator activity in North America. Revenue outside North America proved to be resilient with only a modest sequential decline, supported by solid activity in the Middle East. Sequentially, adjusted EBITDA margin declined 400 basis points to 3.4%. The decrease was driven by the significant decline in rig count and completions-related activity in North America. We are aggressively addressing our cost base.  
In North America, where the majority of our restructuring for the segment has occurred, we have significantly lowered the breakeven point, which supports our expectation for positive adjusted EBITDA in North America for the full year. 
As Doug mentioned in his remarks, we have taken actions to reduce the impact of the current economic environment on our financial and liquidity position. We added 2 additional liquidity sources in the quarter, a EUR 500 million revolving credit facility. This facility is undrawn. And a GBP 600 million Bank of England COVID-19 commercial paper facility. This facility carries lower interest rates than most of our other sources. We took the opportunity to secure this for the incremental liquidity, if needed, but it has the benefit of lowering interest expense in these challenged credit markets. 
Given the assets to lower cost funding, we repaid the $500 million outstanding balance on our existing revolving credit facility. When considering all actions taken in the quarter and including cash of $5.6 billion, net liquidity stood at $6.8 billion at the end of the quarter, up $1.2 billion when compared to the end of March. In the quarter, we also secured a permanent amendment to the debt-to-capitalization covenant of our revolver, allowing for the add-back of $3.2 billion of previously impaired goodwill. This significantly increases the equity value used in the calculation, providing us with strong support liquidity available to us today. The ratio for the second quarter is 38%.  
In the quarter, we all took steps to extend our debt maturity profiles. First, with the private placement that came due this month, we are currently working to address the short-term maturities coming due in 2021. 
Turning to guidance. We are now providing 2020 guidance for all 3 operating segments as well as free cash flow. In Subsea, we are guiding full year revenue to be in the range of $5.3 billion to $5.6 billion, supported by the backlog scheduled in the second half. In addition to backlog, we continue to expect full year revenue for subsea services to be approximately $1 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA margin of at least 8.5%, implying a second half recovery.  
For Technip Energies, guidance is unchanged from the first quarter, with revenue in a range of $6.3 billion to $6.8 billion and an adjusted EBITDA margin of at least 10%. The implied step-up in second half revenue is in line with the continued ramp in major projects as supported by our backlog scheduling.  
And in Surface Technologies, we expect revenue in the range of $950 million to $1.15 billion, with revenue outside of North America, representing around 60% of the total segment revenue for the year. We expect adjusted EBITDA margin of at least 5.5%, broadly in line with the first half, but demonstrating recovery from the second quarter low. 
Turning to other guidance items. When excluding charges and credits, we now expect corporate expense of $130 million to $150 million. This is an improvement of more than 30% at the midpoint of the range versus prior year. The expense reduction reflects earlier-than-expected achievement of the cost reductions that we discussed last quarter and lower spending in the first half of the year due to COVID-19 constraints. This guidance also assumes a more normalized operating environment in the second half of the year. We expect our reported tax provision for the full year to be between $80 million and $90 million, excluding discrete items. While adjusted net income is forecast to be higher in the back half of the year, the tax provision should be slightly lower due to a change in jurisdictional mix. Free cash flow, which we define as cash flow from operations, less capital expenditures, is expected to be between cash flow neutral and $150 million. All other guidance remains unchanged from the first quarter. 
Beyond free cash flow, we expect to make an additional cash dividend payment to the Yamal joint venture partners of approximately $100 million in the second half of the year. 
In summary, in an extremely turbulent time for the sector, our execution has remained strong, and we are well on track to exceed our targeted cost savings. We continue to take steps to improve free cash flow and remain focused on our cost structure. Our strength in cash and liquidity and robust backlog have enabled us to accelerate our business transformation. And with the support of our cost reduction initiatives, our demonstrated ability to execute against a multitude of external headwinds and our improved visibility into the backlog, we have provided guidance across all segments, given the greater confidence we have in our full year outlook.

Clearly, in the second quarter, we were challenged operationally by direct COVID expenses that were called out. But also indirectly, obviously, the overall business and the flow of the business was impacted. Happy to report that through the quarter, and certainly, since we spoke in this forum, most recently back at the end of the first quarter, conditions have certainly improved. At that point, we had a significant number of our total operations that were either temporarily suspended for extended period of time. We're now back to having all of our facilities operating.  
That being said, we're not back to 100% operating efficiency. Although, again, the resiliency of the workforce and their dedication has really delivered some phenomenal results.

Obviously, the challenge remains will there be additional implications that we are not aware of yet today that could occur in the second half. And I'll ask Maryann to provide a bit more color."

So as we think about these COVID-19 costs that we call out directly, maybe a bit about what they are, these are extraordinary expenses. They are unplanned. We do not expect them to be recovered. These would be, as Doug mentioned, when we have a facility that is closed, as an example. These are not costs of inefficiencies in our plant, as Doug mentioned, meaning lower utilization, lower operating rates, the impact of delayed supply chains. Those stay within our margins. And as Doug explained, we are beginning to see some return to normal. So assuming that trajectory continues, and we all know we can't necessarily project that, we would expect to see less in the third quarter. These are costs that we would expect to be eliminated from our operating structure, given their nature. As we stand today, again, challenging to project what would happen with COVID, but we would expect them to be less in the back half. And then as we continue to return to a more normal environment, we certainly wouldn't be calling them out anymore. The rest of those costs would remain as they do in our margins."

One thing to keep in mind is as you look at the year-to-date performance, in particular, in the quarter, we had 2 items that happened in the quarter that I would say are certainly not necessarily operational and not repeating. And the first is we made our second payment against a previously settled litigation. And that outflow happened in the second quarter. Obviously, that's not repeating in the back half of the year. And you also may have seen the discussion of a settlement of about $130 million in the Technip Energies segment. While we were successful and good news in settling that this quarter, we will not see the cash flow attributed to that settlement until the beginning of next year. 
The second part of your question is whether or not you can consider the back half of the year as a more normal conversion. And I would say we're beginning to get there. As you well know, as Yamal continues to be a smaller contribution to our EBIT and, frankly, less impact on working capital, we have less working capital impact in the back half of the year, and you can begin to see greater conversion. We are obviously assuming a series of projects milestones. We stay -- obviously, try to stay cash flow positive across those. You see the EBIT in the back half of the year based on our guidance, would be improving. 
So you can begin to look at the back half of the year as a better representation of the conversion that you should expect in a more normalized environment."

In my prepared remarks, I tried to highlight the fact that we have received several awards, which have not yet been announced or not yet been met all the requirements for us to include in our backlog, both in Subsea as well as in Technip Energi",479,"Sure, Amy. In my prepared remarks, I tried to highlight the fact that we have received several awards, which have not yet been announced or not yet been met all the requirements for us to include in our backlog, both in Subsea as well as in Technip Energies. So in Subsea, I talked about the project in Brazil. I talked about a project in Asia Pacific, which, by the way, is an iEPCI project utilizing Subsea 2.0 technology. And I talked about a portfolio of projects in the North Sea recently announced by Equinor. 
In addition for Technip Energies, we announced the Assiut project, which is over $1 billion in total value. So it's been a strong period for us in terms of awards. We have not been able to inbound all of those yet. Conditions haven't been met, but will be met. It's not a question of if the projects will be sanctioned, it's just a slight timing issue. And unfortunately, a few of those fell outside of Q2, but they certainly will be in Q3. That's what provides us the confidence.  
So in my prepared remarks, to be very clear, I said that we have $1.7 billion in the first half of the year. And we already have a clear line of sight on another $1.7 billion. So I think you have to look past the Q2 order rate just because a lot of things fell into early Q3 or were awarded in Q2 but will be FID-ed in Q3. So if you add those together, we have 5 months to fill in the last 10% to approximate the $4 billion of the guidance that we had previously provided and, therefore, I still have confidence, Amy, that we will achieve that.  
In terms of the conversations and the pricing, the clients are very much focused around ensuring they can achieve the very best project economics. Therefore, the majority of the conversations that we have and a very large portion of the total awards that we receive are direct award into our company, most of which don't actually come from that Subsea opportunity list that we publish, which is the list for the public domain that others also have access to. We have a list that -- and I indicated in my script, as much as $3 billion a year on a reoccurring basis that is exclusive to our company. This is what makes us so unique and which allows us to not only be the market leader, but extend our market leadership with our new technology offerings and our new commercial models. 
So those conversations really aren't around pricing, Amy. They are on the project economics. And we work together with a client in a very collaborative way to achieve those most favorable project economics. That's the difference between our company and the others in this space."

The guidance for fiscal '20 implies a 9% plus type number for the back half. So directionally, that's constructive. It's early, but investors are going to start looking for 2021. So maybe too early for guidance, but maybe not too early to think about some of the building blocks. This year, you guided to at least $4 billion of awards. That's below 2020 revenue, so maybe growing revenue next year is a bit more challenged, that's where we end up. But I think your award commentary sounds pretty constructive here for some potential upside, maybe that's back half '20 or first half '21. Services opportunities could be better if COVID disruptions recede. Book and turn, still obviously very important. How would you frame those building blocks in terms of what drives margin progress back towards a more normalized level next year?"

If you look at the the order inbound projection for 2020, as we just discussed, you can start to project that in 2021. We already have a lot of the potential revenue covered. We have a strong backlog. We've obviously just got done talking about additional awards and the additional awards in the second half of this year. 
So as far as the revenue line, and you're right, it's early to give 2021 guidance, let's remember, we just, today, are giving H2 2020 guidance, given the disruption that the world experienced last quarter. But it's fair to talk about. And as you said, we're seeing a nice progression of the margins in the second half of the year based upon the guidance that we provided. And as we look into 2021, we expect to continue to improve in terms of getting back to more normalized operating efficiency. We have a strong backlog. We'll be adding new orders, as we just discussed. So when you look at it, again, it gives us confidence that we're going to continue to be able to go back to more normalized level of margins.  
Now one headwind -- we have several, but the one headwind that I would point out that didn't come up in the -- in your question, is the fact that as some of this backlog rescheduling has occurred, it's naturally pushed out the latter stages of the iEPCI projects or any Subsea project. When we -- certainly, for us, it's the benefit of having the iEPCI projects. It's pushed out that installation campaign, in some cases, pushed it out of 2021 and into 2022. So that's the one headwind will be basically the fleet and the fleet utilization and the economic -- the low utilization, the economic impact that, that would have. That would have largely dissipated in 2021 based upon the strong orders we had in 2019 and, again, what we were originally expecting for 2020. 
So it's kind of a balance. But I think when you look forward, you -- there's -- the backlog's strong. The backlog's resilient. We're getting new orders and certainly have a very large portion of the total market. We continue to add new alliance partners. It may not have come across in the script, so I'll repeat it. We are about to announce a new iEPCI exclusive alliance partner, a serious player in the Subsea space. 
So things are moving in the right direction. We obviously have to allow the COVID impact to dissipate, get back to a more normalized environment. We don't know what the future will bring in regards to the pandemic. So we have to be cautious. And we also have to consider that there's a bit of a headwind. But all that means is we're going to continue to move forward in the accretive and constructive direction in terms of the Subsea margins. But realizing that the real benefit of the recovery of the fleet to the installation will now be more likely in the latter part of 2021 and 2022 versus -- which would have been more in 2020. I hope that helps you, Sean."

In terms of mix, you've described it well, we're expecting a step down in Yamal revenue, which will obviously affect the aggregate EBITDA of our results next year.  
On the other hand, the remaining of the portfolio has been accumulated in our backlog from a very selective approach. As you know, we're very far in the way, and we make sure we choose, and we're very selective in the prospect in the project we are involving. So that is reducing in a very sound gross margin side backlog ex Yamal. And that you will see that next year in our portfolio. 
So very much linked with the execution that we've demonstrated that we are demonstrating. You can expect consistent delivering EBITDA. We'll have to normalize, for sure, for Yamal. We'll have to take into account that Artic LNG 2 is progressing well. It's going to continue to ramp up. It will continue to be in the early phase, which obviously is associated with a prudent margin recognition.

So you touched on the 2 key ones. And it's very much how we see it, which is the electrification of the offshore, which is a big opportunity. I would say there is a tremendous amount of enthusiasm and momentum on the subject. And we are very, very uniquely positioned here because there's a lot of attributes and technologies that are required to be able to do this. It's not simply providing the electricity, but it's the infrastructure and the equipment and the design and the interfaces with the Subsea completions that are really, really unique. We've been working on this for a period of time. We're partnering well with others in this space, and we believe this will be a very attractive opportunity for our clients as they have stated environmental ambitions that we can become a key partner for them and help them reach those ambitions. And this is an example of how we could do that. 
We're looking beyond just the electrification, and we're actually looking at the electrification through renewable energy. This is where our experience of being involved in the very first offshore floating wind farm gives us a lot of credibility in this space and a lot of experience and knowledge in this space. And as an example, not necessarily from offshore floating wind, but that could be a very unique solution and one that we're very well positioned to be able to provide to our clients.

Obviously, we are extremely excited by the momentum around hydrogen these days. We do believe that hydrogen is going to play a pivotal role in the future energy mix being such a clean energy carrier, many, many different applications. The nice thing for us is that we've been in hydrogen for pretty much 60 years. We've installed 270 plants around the world. And obviously, this was called -- this is what we call gray hydrogen. But we've also -- and people might not know that. We've actually built 50 blue hydrogen units also across the world. So we have a very differentiated offering with a proprietary steam reformer unit. We have capabilities with some special equipment that help reduce CO2 emissions. So we have a lot of technology references and experience.  
In addition, we have a technology partnership on carbon capture. So when you combine all that, you understand why we are so excited about the prospects in blue hydrogen. And of course, when you look at the projection of hydrogen demand and hydrogen projection, there will be the need. And the most exciting proposition, if you like, comes from the green hydrogen, which is pure clean hydrogen. However, the economics and the commercial equation does leave a lot of room for the blue hydrogen, which is the gray hydrogen with carbon capture, which is something that we commercially can today -- can provide today. So that's a very exciting, strong position for us today. 
If you look at the green hydrogen, obviously, it's a little bit more emerging. We also are excited about the capability and the potential of integrating green hydrogen units at industrial scale. So for large industry, which will benefit from green hydrogen, we think that our role as an integrator, project management skill integration will be very useful in helping making the economics of this project work. So no matter what you look, where you look in hydrogen, we think Technip Energies, indeed, has a big role to play. So that's very exciting, and it's starting now, by the way. So back to you, Doug."

We're talking about going to zero-emission production that is quite significant. When you look at hydrogen, yes, of the renewables and of the differentiation that we have in this space, for us, it is the most exciting. And we believe or we can create the most differentiation and get very constructive returns, again, as opposed to a lot of the renewable space, which is the award numbers are large, but the returns are poor.

It certainly has a significant impact and the ability to be able to make it a fungible commodity through LNG. If you include LNG, it's a large percentage. If you exclude all hydrocarbon and just look at the pure renewables, it's a smaller portion of the company today, but we're pivoting strongly in this direction and securing to secure our future as well."

So there's a lot more to come on the subject. We'll be continuing to communicate that to you and others as we go forward. 
In the area of Surface Technologies, we're moving to a fully digitized system for well completions.

Before commenti",2080,"Thank you, Matt. Good morning, and good afternoon. Thank you for participating in our second quarter earnings call. 
On the call today are Maryann Mannen, Chief Financial Officer; and Catherine MacGregor, President of Technip Energies.  
Before commenting on our operational and financial results, I would like to begin by recognizing the resilience of our global workforce. While the health and well-being of our employees, partners and customers is our top priority, these dedicated teams worked tirelessly to maintain business continuity in a safe and responsible manner. And throughout this very challenging period, they continue to advance projects and meet customer requirements, which was evident in our second quarter results. We also made solid progress in 3 core areas: strengthening our balance sheet, progressing our backlog scheduling and accelerating our business transformation, all to ensure the success of TechnipFMC, both through the current cycle and over the longer term.  
With regard to the balance sheet, we took a series of proactive steps in the quarter. We increased our liquidity by $1.2 billion, bringing total cash and liquidity to nearly $7 billion. And we secured a permanent modification to our primary debt covenant, which favorably impacts the company's total capitalization ratio. Together, these actions were taken to ensure that we have more than sufficient liquidity and can maintain full access to this liquidity in these challenging times. 
Turning to backlog. We experienced no cancellations, highlighting the resilience of the nearly $21 billion of backlog we have today. This significant backlog provides us with good visibility that extends over the next several years. 
Since the start of the COVID-19 outbreak, we have had constructive conversations with our customers. The dialogue has been very different than what we experienced in prior cycles. This has resulted in a more collaborative approach, creating new opportunities for us, enabled by our proven innovative solutions and demonstrated excellence in execution, and supported by the financial strength we possess to weather the market cycle. These unique attributes also allow us to more deeply engage in the way we partner and work with our customers. 
Looking at the second half of the year, we continue to add new projects to our backlog. TechnipFMC has been selected for the Mero 2 SURF EPCI project located in the Santos Basin. We will soon announce a new iEPCI project in Asia Pacific, that will be using our latest 2.0 technology, and we have secured several projects that will be inbound upon final sanctioning, including Subsea installation contracts recently announced by Equinor and the EPC contract for the Assiut Hydrocracking Complex, we announced earlier this month.  
Our strong balance sheet and liquidity position and our extensive backlog have also provided us with the flexibility to accelerate our business transformation, with global actions underway to generate annualized cost savings in excess of $350 million by year-end. We first highlighted the business transformation during our fourth quarter earnings call. These initiatives are driven by changes in opportunity created from the successful introduction of new business models, innovative technologies and digital solutions across our business.  
First, going forward, we will need fewer assets to deliver more comprehensive solutions. We will have fewer operating bases, service facilities and manufacturing sites. We are optimizing our operations across geographies. And if economic returns don't make sense, we will look to exit.  
We will have a smaller fleet. We continue to right size our assets to better align with our differentiated offering and the advantages of new technologies, such as Subsea 2.0 and integrated project delivery. And we continue to partner with others, providing us access to unique assets in a more capital-efficient manner. 
Second, we are taking targeted actions across the portfolio, particularly in Surface Technologies. In North America, we continue to transform our operations by working with our customers to further drive well-site operational efficiencies and lower greenhouse gas emissions. And we are leveraging the strength of our international franchise to capitalize on the longer-term growth anticipated in the Middle East, Asia Pacific and the North Sea. 
And finally, we continue to leverage digital technologies across our organization. Looking at one of our most recent innovations, we are accelerating the development and implementation of our Subsea Studio digital platform. Subsea Studio allows us to significantly reduce the time required for front-end engineering by as much as 50%, utilizing machine learning and AI to rapidly evaluate field development scenarios, leveraging the industry's largest database of prior projects and best practices. All of these actions are fully aligned with our strategy of market leadership and business transformation. These actions will drive the most value when we align with those clients and partners that demonstrate a willingness to embrace new commercial models and new technologies. We are further streamlining all of our businesses towards simplification, standardization and reduce cycle times.  
In 2019, the vast success of our Subsea integrated model was driven by the strength of our partner relationships and resulted in the company's highest annual growth rate in order inbound in over a decade. And we expect to enter into another exclusive iEPCI alliance that will be announced in conjunction with the client's first integrated project award. As I've said before, those that adopt innovative solutions are more likely to succeed in the new energy landscape. And we are even more convinced of this today, given the dramatic change in the external environment and its impact on our customers. 
And lastly, the third pillar of our business transformation is focused on the strategic initiatives across our portfolio that will deliver new, sustainable solutions to our clients. These initiatives will allow us to leverage our core competencies in engineering, manufacturing and project management, skills that are transferable and can be applied beyond traditional market segments. In Subsea, we have created fundamental change in the way we design, manage and execute projects, incorporating our Subsea 2.0 platform and greatly simplified the Subsea infrastructure, while reducing greenhouse gas emissions by nearly 50%. And when combined with iEPCI, it also simplifies vessel installation campaigns, providing an even greater environmental and economic benefits. 
Our vision for Subsea includes an all-electric Subsea system, powered by renewable energy. This will further simplify the Subsea infrastructure and reduce, if not eliminate, environmental emissions. 
In Technip Energies, we have significant expertise and prospects in the area of sustainable chemistry. Notably in biofuels, as Neste's partner of choice for renewable diesel projects. And we have further expanded our footprint in the circular economy through our collaboration with Carbios to demonstrate their recycling technologies. 
We have recently extended our Genesis offering to provide a portfolio of advisory services across all of our markets with a particular focus on energy transition. And we see a very exciting future for hydrogen, where we already have proven technology and references for blue hydrogen and are well positioned for the emerging market for green hydrogen. 
In Surface Technologies, we offer high-efficiency solutions that enable our clients to reach hydrocarbons faster with fully optimized and environmentally compact systems. Today, we have a project utilizing our integrated production system, high production, allowing the client to capture over 50% of the greenhouse gases that are typically released into the atmosphere during the production phase of an unconventional development. In summary, we have the expertise across all segments of the business to deliver the innovative, sustainable solutions that will enable our clients to meet their carbon reduction ambitions.
Let me turn to the Subsea outlook. On our first quarter call, we noted that up to 50% of the estimated $15 billion in project value captured on our Subsea opportunity list could be extended beyond the 24-month window. The updated list now reflects real evidence of this trend. Based on public disclosures made by operators, we have identified 8 specific projects that have been extended beyond mid-2022. Importantly, none of these projects have been canceled, and they remain longer-term opportunities for future awards. There have also been new projects added across 4 different basins that we believe will be awarded within the next 2 years, suggesting that previously identified reduction in value for these opportunities, once thought to be as high as 50%, is actually closer to 30%. Remember, the Subsea opportunity list is not a complete list of opportunities available to TechnipFMC. Beyond this large project activity, our orders have been driven by subsea services, direct iEPCI awards and small project activity, much of which is exclusive to our company. 
This opportunity set has generated over $3 billion of inbound in each of the last 3 years and is enabled by our market-leading installed base, growing list of alliance partners and unique integrated feed capabilities. Our front-end engineering teams remain very active, and more than 60% of all integrated feed work is leveraging the benefits of Subsea Studio. We believe this will generate additional proprietary opportunities, some of which will come from our exclusive alliance partners over the next 12 to 18 months. 
For 2020, we continue to believe inbound orders will approximate $4 billion. In the first half of the year, we had $1.7 billion of subsea inbound. And with 5 months remaining in the year, we already see a similar level of inbound for the second half of the year coming from subsea services, small project activity and large project awards pending public announcement. In the interim, we will continue to work closely with our customers as they adjust to the current environment. And we are excited to serve the new entrants that will likely step in to operate potentially stranded opportunities. 
That said, long-term success in Subsea is driven by economics, innovation and relationships, all key attributes of TechnipFMC. This makes us uniquely qualified to remain the Subsea partner of choice now more than ever. 
Turning to LNG. We are currently in the delivery phase of 2 major projects, Coral floating LNG and Arctic LNG 2, and we continue to advance through the warranty phase of Yamal LNG. Yamal been the industry's most successful project ever, and the strength in our execution certainly played a role in NovaTek made consortium's decision to direct award Arctic LNG 2 to TechnipFMC. 
Despite the challenges of COVID-19, we are making good progress on all of these projects. On Arctic LNG 2, we continue to expect the activity to ramp as scheduled over the remainder of 2020. And on the Coral FLNG, we continue to achieve key milestones relating to module integration and instrumentation. Successful execution of these technically and logistically complex projects create strong references, leaving us well positioned to be a key player in the development of the industry's most strategic LNG projects. 
Market dynamics have shifted in recent months. And this will alter the broader LNG landscape in the near term. The number of economically viable projects is likely to decline, but the same can be said of the list of qualified EPC contractors, which will be challenged in this period of subdued project sanctioning. This is not the case for Technip Energies. We have demonstrated remarkable resilience through past cycles, and we don't see this as the start of an extended downturn for us. We have already been awarded 2 additional projects, the first being Rovuma in Mozambique; and the second, Energia Costa Azul in Mexico. Both remain subject to final investment decision, and either of these projects are included in our backlog. While Rovuma has been delayed until 2021, the operator for Costa Azul continues to indicate that FID will take place this year.  
In addition, we are actively tendering a major project in the Middle East and performing front-end engineering work on other LNG prospects. Some of which are likely to move forward due, in part, to their strategic importance to their host country. This potential portfolio of LNG projects will provide us with well-timed project overlap and operational continuity. And the portfolio beyond LNG remains diverse. We have built a solid track record of successful execution, delivering strategic references in areas such as downstream and petrochemicals that leave us well positioned for future project awards. 
We entered this period with a solid foundation built upon the strength of our balance sheet, backlog and execution. While client conversations remain ongoing, the increased visibility we have today gives us confidence in our full year guidance for all business segments. This is further supported by the acceleration of our business transformation initiatives to maintain, if not expand, our market leadership.
I will now turn the call over to Maryann to discuss our financial results in more detail."

Looking at our headline numbers for the quarter, revenue totaled $3.2 billion driven by solid performance in both, Subsea and Technip Energies, while Surface Technologies revenue was impacted by a severe decline in activity in North Ameri",1382,"Thank you, Doug. Looking at our headline numbers for the quarter, revenue totaled $3.2 billion driven by solid performance in both, Subsea and Technip Energies, while Surface Technologies revenue was impacted by a severe decline in activity in North America. Year-over-year revenue decreased as a result of reduced activity, operational headwinds from COVID-19 and foreign exchange impacts. 
Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was $241 million. We accelerated our cost reduction program and are on track to deliver cost savings of more than $350 million by year-end. And we expect a greater benefit from these savings in the second half of the year with the full impact realized in 2021. We estimate total cash cost to achieve our planned cost savings target to be approximately $75 million. 
Underlying corporate expense have improved over the last 3 consecutive quarters, giving us confidence to lower our full year guidance, which I'll come back to in a moment. 
Beginning with the second quarter, foreign exchange impacts are now reported separately from corporate expense to provide greater clarity in our financial statements. Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.09 when excluding after-tax charges and credits. Included in our adjusted earnings, our expenses, resulting from increased liability payable to joint venture partners, included in interest expense and foreign exchange losses. Together, these 2 items impacted EPS by $0.12 per share in the period. And if excluded, our adjusted earnings per share would have been $0.22 per diluted share. 
The company ended the period with cash of $4.8 billion. Net cash was $303 million. We have increased visibility on our cash uses and inflows for the remainder of the year and have provided guidance around our free cash flow outlook. 
Turning to the segment highlights. Direct COVID-19 expenses for the company totaled $57 million in the second quarter. Year-on-year Subsea revenue declined by 9%, but would have been unchanged when excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange translation of $129 million due to the strengthening U.S. dollar. While year-over-year comparisons are usually more relevant for this segment, the 10% sequential improvement in Subsea revenue demonstrated our ability to mitigate COVID-19-related disruptions in the quarter. 
Subsea adjusted EBITDA margin was down 510 basis points versus the prior year quarter, primarily due to the negative operational impacts related to COVID-19 and more competitively priced backlog, mitigated, in part, by cost reduction initiatives. Sequentially, the margin only declined 120 basis points, as strong execution partially offset an entire quarter of COVID-19-related disruptions. 
Looking at Technip Energies, execution remains solid across the portfolio. Revenue increased versus the prior year quarter, driven by higher activity across LNG, downstream and our process technology business. The continued ramp-up on Arctic LNG 2 more than offset the decline in revenue from Yamal LNG. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 10.6% remains strong even as we return to more normalized levels, given a reduced year-on-year contribution from Yamal and lower margin realization on early stage projects. Although no project awards were announced during the quarter -- second quarter, inbound orders of $836 million demonstrated good activity in services, process technology and loading systems as well as expanded scopes on existing contracts. 
And in Surface Technologies, revenue was significantly affected by the dramatic decline in operator activity in North America. Revenue outside North America proved to be resilient with only a modest sequential decline, supported by solid activity in the Middle East. Sequentially, adjusted EBITDA margin declined 400 basis points to 3.4%. The decrease was driven by the significant decline in rig count and completions-related activity in North America. We are aggressively addressing our cost base.  
In North America, where the majority of our restructuring for the segment has occurred, we have significantly lowered the breakeven point, which supports our expectation for positive adjusted EBITDA in North America for the full year. 
As Doug mentioned in his remarks, we have taken actions to reduce the impact of the current economic environment on our financial and liquidity position. We added 2 additional liquidity sources in the quarter, a EUR 500 million revolving credit facility. This facility is undrawn. And a GBP 600 million Bank of England COVID-19 commercial paper facility. This facility carries lower interest rates than most of our other sources. We took the opportunity to secure this for the incremental liquidity, if needed, but it has the benefit of lowering interest expense in these challenged credit markets. 
Given the assets to lower cost funding, we repaid the $500 million outstanding balance on our existing revolving credit facility. When considering all actions taken in the quarter and including cash of $5.6 billion, net liquidity stood at $6.8 billion at the end of the quarter, up $1.2 billion when compared to the end of March. In the quarter, we also secured a permanent amendment to the debt-to-capitalization covenant of our revolver, allowing for the add-back of $3.2 billion of previously impaired goodwill. This significantly increases the equity value used in the calculation, providing us with strong support liquidity available to us today. The ratio for the second quarter is 38%.  
In the quarter, we all took steps to extend our debt maturity profiles. First, with the private placement that came due this month, we are currently working to address the short-term maturities coming due in 2021. 
Turning to guidance. We are now providing 2020 guidance for all 3 operating segments as well as free cash flow. In Subsea, we are guiding full year revenue to be in the range of $5.3 billion to $5.6 billion, supported by the backlog scheduled in the second half. In addition to backlog, we continue to expect full year revenue for subsea services to be approximately $1 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA margin of at least 8.5%, implying a second half recovery.  
For Technip Energies, guidance is unchanged from the first quarter, with revenue in a range of $6.3 billion to $6.8 billion and an adjusted EBITDA margin of at least 10%. The implied step-up in second half revenue is in line with the continued ramp in major projects as supported by our backlog scheduling.  
And in Surface Technologies, we expect revenue in the range of $950 million to $1.15 billion, with revenue outside of North America, representing around 60% of the total segment revenue for the year. We expect adjusted EBITDA margin of at least 5.5%, broadly in line with the first half, but demonstrating recovery from the second quarter low. 
Turning to other guidance items. When excluding charges and credits, we now expect corporate expense of $130 million to $150 million. This is an improvement of more than 30% at the midpoint of the range versus prior year. The expense reduction reflects earlier-than-expected achievement of the cost reductions that we discussed last quarter and lower spending in the first half of the year due to COVID-19 constraints. This guidance also assumes a more normalized operating environment in the second half of the year. We expect our reported tax provision for the full year to be between $80 million and $90 million, excluding discrete items. While adjusted net income is forecast to be higher in the back half of the year, the tax provision should be slightly lower due to a change in jurisdictional mix. Free cash flow, which we define as cash flow from operations, less capital expenditures, is expected to be between cash flow neutral and $150 million. All other guidance remains unchanged from the first quarter. 
Beyond free cash flow, we expect to make an additional cash dividend payment to the Yamal joint venture partners of approximately $100 million in the second half of the year. 
In summary, in an extremely turbulent time for the sector, our execution has remained strong, and we are well on track to exceed our targeted cost savings. We continue to take steps to improve free cash flow and remain focused on our cost structure. Our strength in cash and liquidity and robust backlog have enabled us to accelerate our business transformation. And with the support of our cost reduction initiatives, our demonstrated ability to execute against a multitude of external headwinds and our improved visibility into the backlog, we have provided guidance across all segments, given the greater confidence we have in our full year outlook.

But also indirectly, obviously, the overall business and the flow of the business was impacted. Happy to report that through the quarter, and certainly, since we spoke in this forum, most recently back at the end of the first quarter, conditions have certainly improved. At that point, we had a significant number of our total operations that were either temporarily suspended for extended period of time. We're now back to having all of our facilities operating.  
That being said, we're not back to 100% operating efficiency. Although, again, the resiliency of the workforce and their dedication has really delivered some phenomenal results.

So this is a country, an environment, customer that we know very well as well as the technology. So we're absolutely delighted to be involved in the feed and preparing for this tender. 
As far as the timing of the sanction and the FID of the project, obviously, all the indications tend to confirm that this project is, indeed, a strategic importance for QP. The signs and the communication that we are receiving from our customers make us look forward to this project to be sanctioned in the near future. Now whether it will be this year or next year, frankly, it's very difficult for us to say. I could not answer precisely to this question. But the key for us is that this project is indeed very important, interesting and indeed likely to be sanctioned in the near term. Thank you."

These would be, as Doug mentioned, when we have a facility that is closed, as an example. These are not costs of inefficiencies in our plant, as Doug mentioned, meaning lower utilization, lower operating rates, the impact of delayed supply chains. Those stay within our margins. And as Doug explained, we are beginning to see some return to normal. So assuming that trajectory continues, and we all know we can't necessarily project that, we would expect to see less in the third quarter. These are costs that we would expect to be eliminated from our operating structure, given their nature. As we stand today, again, challenging to project what would happen with COVID, but we would expect them to be less in the back half. And then as we continue to return to a more normal environment, we certainly wouldn't be calling them out anymore. The rest of those costs would remain as they do in our margins."

One thing to keep in mind is as you look at the year-to-date performance, in particular, in the quarter, we had 2 items that happened in the quarter that I would say are certainly not necessarily operational and not repeating. And the first is we made our second payment against a previously settled litigation. And that outflow happened in the second quarter. Obviously, that's not repeating in the back half of the year. And you also may have seen the discussion of a settlement of about $130 million in the Technip Energies segment. While we were successful and good news in settling that this quarter, we will not see the cash flow attributed to that settlement until the beginning of next year. 
The second part of your question is whether or not you can consider the back half of the year as a more normal conversion. And I would say we're beginning to get there. As you well know, as Yamal continues to be a smaller contribution to our EBIT and, frankly, less impact on working capital, we have less working capital impact in the back half of the year, and you can begin to see greater conversion. We are obviously assuming a series of projects milestones. We stay -- obviously, try to stay cash flow positive across those. You see the EBIT in the back half of the year based on our guidance, would be improving. 
So you can begin to look at the back half of the year as a better representation of the conversion that you should expect in a more normalized environment."

In my prepared remarks, I tried to highlight the fact that we have received several awards, which have not yet been announced or not yet been met all the requirements for us to include in our backlog, both in Subsea as well as in Technip Energi",479,"Sure, Amy. In my prepared remarks, I tried to highlight the fact that we have received several awards, which have not yet been announced or not yet been met all the requirements for us to include in our backlog, both in Subsea as well as in Technip Energies. So in Subsea, I talked about the project in Brazil. I talked about a project in Asia Pacific, which, by the way, is an iEPCI project utilizing Subsea 2.0 technology. And I talked about a portfolio of projects in the North Sea recently announced by Equinor. 
In addition for Technip Energies, we announced the Assiut project, which is over $1 billion in total value. So it's been a strong period for us in terms of awards. We have not been able to inbound all of those yet. Conditions haven't been met, but will be met. It's not a question of if the projects will be sanctioned, it's just a slight timing issue. And unfortunately, a few of those fell outside of Q2, but they certainly will be in Q3. That's what provides us the confidence.  
So in my prepared remarks, to be very clear, I said that we have $1.7 billion in the first half of the year. And we already have a clear line of sight on another $1.7 billion. So I think you have to look past the Q2 order rate just because a lot of things fell into early Q3 or were awarded in Q2 but will be FID-ed in Q3. So if you add those together, we have 5 months to fill in the last 10% to approximate the $4 billion of the guidance that we had previously provided and, therefore, I still have confidence, Amy, that we will achieve that.  
In terms of the conversations and the pricing, the clients are very much focused around ensuring they can achieve the very best project economics. Therefore, the majority of the conversations that we have and a very large portion of the total awards that we receive are direct award into our company, most of which don't actually come from that Subsea opportunity list that we publish, which is the list for the public domain that others also have access to. We have a list that -- and I indicated in my script, as much as $3 billion a year on a reoccurring basis that is exclusive to our company. This is what makes us so unique and which allows us to not only be the market leader, but extend our market leadership with our new technology offerings and our new commercial models. 
So those conversations really aren't around pricing, Amy. They are on the project economics. And we work together with a client in a very collaborative way to achieve those most favorable project economics. That's the difference between our company and the others in this space."

The guidance for fiscal '20 implies a 9% plus type number for the back half. So directionally, that's constructive. It's early, but investors are going to start looking for 2021. So maybe too early for guidance, but maybe not too early to think about some of the building blocks. This year, you guided to at least $4 billion of awards. That's below 2020 revenue, so maybe growing revenue next year is a bit more challenged, that's where we end up. But I think your award commentary sounds pretty constructive here for some potential upside, maybe that's back half '20 or first half '21.

If you look at the order inbound projection for 2020, as we just discussed, you can start to project that in 2021. We already have a lot of the potential revenue covered. We have a strong backlog. We've obviously just got done talking about additional awards and the additional awards in the second half of this year. 
So as far as the revenue line, and you're right, it's early to give 2021 guidance, let's remember, we just, today, are giving H2 2020 guidance, given the disruption that the world experienced last quarter. But it's fair to talk about. And as you said, we're seeing a nice progression of the margins in the second half of the year based upon the guidance that we provided. And as we look into 2021, we expect to continue to improve in terms of getting back to more normalized operating efficiency. We have a strong backlog. We'll be adding new orders, as we just discussed. So when you look at it, again, it gives us confidence that we're going to continue to be able to go back to more normalized level of margins.  
Now one headwind -- we have several, but the one headwind that I would point out that didn't come up in the -- in your question, is the fact that as some of this backlog rescheduling has occurred, it's naturally pushed out the latter stages of the iEPCI projects or any Subsea project. When we -- certainly, for us, it's the benefit of having the iEPCI projects. It's pushed out that installation campaign, in some cases, pushed it out of 2021 and into 2022. So that's the one headwind will be basically the fleet and the fleet utilization and the economic -- the low utilization, the economic impact that, that would have. That would have largely dissipated in 2021 based upon the strong orders we had in 2019 and, again, what we were originally expecting for 2020. 
So it's kind of a balance. But I think when you look forward, you -- there's -- the backlog's strong. The backlog's resilient. We're getting new orders and certainly have a very large portion of the total market. We continue to add new alliance partners. It may not have come across in the script, so I'll repeat it. We are about to announce a new iEPCI exclusive alliance partner, a serious player in the Subsea space. 
So things are moving in the right direction. We obviously have to allow the COVID impact to dissipate, get back to a more normalized environment. We don't know what the future will bring in regards to the pandemic. So we have to be cautious. And we also have to consider that there's a bit of a headwind. But all that means is we're going to continue to move forward in the accretive and constructive direction in terms of the Subsea margins. But realizing that the real benefit of the recovery of the fleet to the installation will now be more likely in the latter part of 2021 and 2022 versus -- which would have been more in 2020. I hope that helps you, Sean."

So in this case, Yamal roll off is likely a headwind year-on-year for margins. Some big new projects still starting up. That's likely another headwind, at least for 2021. But maybe coverage for revenue looks more secure than Subsea. So that probably helps to some degree. Just curious how confident you are in terms of being able to stay in that sweet spot but perhaps lower margins than when Yamal was a bigger part of the mix, but still staying above that underlying downstream level.

In terms of mix, you've described it well. We're expecting a step down in Yamal revenue, which will obviously affect the aggregate EBITDA of our results next year.  
On the other hand, the remaining of the portfolio has been accumulated in our backlog from a very selective approach. As you know, we're very far in the way, and we make sure we choose, and we're very selective in the prospect in the project we are involving. So that is reducing in a very sound gross margin side backlog ex Yamal. And that you will see that next year in our portfolio. 
So very much linked with the execution that we've demonstrated that we are demonstrating. You can expect consistent delivering EBITDA. We'll have to normalize, for sure, for Yamal. We'll have to take into account that Artic LNG 2 is progressing well. It's going to continue to ramp up. It will continue to be in the early phase, which obviously is associated with a prudent margin recognition.

So you touched on the 2 key ones. And it's very much how we see it, which is the electrification of the offshore, which is a big opportunity. I would say there is a tremendous amount of enthusiasm and momentum on the subject. And we are very, very uniquely positioned here because there's a lot of attributes and technologies that are required to be able to do this. It's not simply providing the electricity, but it's the infrastructure and the equipment and the design and the interfaces with the Subsea completions that are really, really unique. We've been working on this for a period of time. We're partnering well with others in this space, and we believe this will be a very attractive opportunity for our clients as they have stated environmental ambitions that we can become a key partner for them and help them reach those ambitions. And this is an example of how we could do that. 
We're looking beyond just the electrification, and we're actually looking at the electrification through renewable energy.

But we've also -- and people might not know that. We've actually built 50 blue hydrogen units also across the world. So we have a very differentiated offering with a proprietary steam reformer unit. We have capabilities with some special equipment that help reduce CO2 emissions. So we have a lot of technology references and experience.

However, the economics and the commercial equation does leave a lot of room for the blue hydrogen, which is the gray hydrogen with carbon capture, which is something that we commercially can today -- can provide today. So that's a very exciting, strong position for us today. 
If you look at the green hydrogen, obviously, it's a little bit more emerging. We also are excited about the capability and the potential of integrating green hydrogen units at industrial scale. So for large industry, which will benefit from green hydrogen, we think that our role as an integrator, project management skill integration will be very useful in helping making the economics of this project work. So no matter what you look, where you look in hydrogen, we think Technip Energies, indeed, has a big role to play. So that's very exciting, and it's starting now, by the way. So back to you, Doug."

And obviously, an exciting subject to follow up on. I'll be brief because I know we're running out of time. Actually, the electrification offshore, I would say, is as exciting about is hydrogen and could be very, very impactful. We're talking about going to zero-emission production that is quite significant. When you look at hydrogen, yes, of the renewables and of the differentiation that we have in this space, for us, it is the most exciting. And we believe or we can create the most differentiation and get very constructive returns, again, as opposed to a lot of the renewable space, which is the award numbers are large, but the returns are poor. And that's not the type of projects that we want to focus on. So we're going to keep driving and doing our part. We just joined the Hydrogen Council, and we want to be an active voice and an active advocate and really help to push the development in those areas. 
In terms of a percentage of the total contribution, we probably don't have enough time to get into all the dynamics of it. The question is, do you look at LNG as a very critical energy transition fuel, we certainly do. It certainly has a significant impact and the ability to be able to make it a fungible commodity through LNG. If you include LNG, it's a large percentage. If you exclude all hydrocarbon and just look at the pure renewables, it's a smaller portion of the company today, but we're pivoting strongly in this direction and securing to secure our future as well."

On the call with me today are Maryann Mannen, Chief Financial Officer; and Arnaud Pieton, President and CEO elect of Technip Energies. 
We delivered solid operational results in the third quarter, just months after the start of 1 of the most challenging periods the global community has ever faced. I want to once again thank our entire workforce for the resilience and dedication that they have shown throughout these unprecedented times. 
Our success is evident in our ability to continue winning, to continue executing and to continue accelerating our business transformation while remaining steadfast and our focus on health and safety. 
In the quarter, inbound orders exceeded $2.2 billion, largely driven by Subsea. This was our strongest quarter thus far in 2020, and represented a sequential increase of 45%. Our strong results stem from the success of working collaboratively with our clients, where our innovative solutions, demonstrated excellence in execution and financial health, provide our customers with confidence to move forward projects during such challenging times. 
Total company adjusted EBITDA was $321 million with a margin of 9.6%. Importantly, all 3 segments showed sequential margin improvement as the execution momentum continued across the portfolio. 
And looking at our business transformation, we continue to accelerate our cost reduction efforts and have already achieved the full targeted run rate savings of more than $350 million. As we leverage our new business models, innovative technologies and digital solutions, we will continue to drive further cost reduction and efficiency gains across the organization. 
Taken together, our inbound orders, our operational results and our cost reduction initiatives provide us the confidence to reaffirm our full year guidance for 2020. 
As our clients continue to reprioritize their portfolio of investments, we have seen an improvement in our award activity. Having announced 6 projects globally since July, totaling $2.8 billion in aggregate contract value. While most of these projects are already in our backlog, the EPC contract for the Assiut Hydrocracking Complex a Technip Energies award that exceeds $1 billion is anticipated to be inbound in the fourth quarter. 
We also announced an award from Shell for the revamp of their Moerdijk plant where we will provide proprietary equipment and related services for 8 ethylene furnaces. This award further demonstrates our leadership in ethylene technology and helps drive a reduction in CO2 emissions. 
In addition, our LNG opportunity set remains strong as we have been awarded 2 major projects which will inbound upon FID by the client. For 1 of these projects, Sempra's Energy at Costa Azul, the client has indicated a likely FID by year-end. And we are actively tendering a major project in Qatar. 
Our prospect with good momentum is evidenced by recent award announcements for several project work scopes. While we believe TechnipFMC is well positioned for this opportunity, the EPC contract is being competitively tendered. 
In Surface Technologies, we continue to leverage the strength and resilience of our leading international franchise with 2 important growth opportunities captured in the quarter, both in the Middle East. 
In Kuwait, we received an award for high-pressure gas equipment and in-country services. And in Oman, we secured a 5-year frame agreement with PetroGas, an operator that has significant drilling plants in the country. 
We believe these awards provide us the opportunity to further expand our market share across the region. 
And in Subsea, we were awarded our latest iEPCI  project with Shell in Malaysia. It incorporates our Subsea 2.0 technology as well as a diverse set of other projects in some of the most active basins in the world. 
In Brazil, the Petrobras Merrell II project in Norway, the Bridle Blick project for Equinor and the ExxonMobil Payara project in Guyana. 50% of these projects were the result of a direct award to our company due to our unique capabilities, our competitiveness and our technology leadership. These awards clearly demonstrate the resilience of strategic offshore basins, where through-cycle economics are highly competitive within our clients' investment portfolios. 
We remain on track to secure approximately $4 billion of Subsea inbound for the full year. 
Looking ahead, we see a healthy set of Subsea opportunities. And we continue to grow our proprietary market opportunities by focusing on long-term strategic relationships with our partners to optimize project economics and returns utilizing our unique and proven iFEED, iEPCI and iLOF capabilities. Therefore, I am pleased to announce another exclusive alliance with an operator in the U.K. North Sea, leveraging our integrated subsea business model, iEPCI, to support and optimize future development opportunities from the early concept phase through production and life of field services. 
Additionally, our front-end engineering teams remain very active. In fact, we have seen an acceleration in study awards in recent months. With double-digit growth now expected above our prior expectation. And half of our study today are integrated, which leverage the benefits of our digital Subsea Studio offering, and positions us well for future iEPCI  awards. 
Digital is another key enabler of our business transformation, and our digital strategy is focused on 3 pillars: becoming a data-centric company, developing intelligent products and assets and driving towards autonomous operations. 
Subsea Studio and our recently introduced iComplete offering are 2 solutions that exemplify these pillars and further expand our leadership position. 
Let me start with Subsea Studio. This solution is transforming the conventional concept feed and tendering phases of Subsea projects. Working with our clients, we are now able to develop ultrafast digital field architectures that bring together decades of engineering knowledge with artificial intelligence and machine learning to optimize product configurations, accelerate execution and maximize value. 
Subsea Studio has an open architecture that allows integration with other engineering and manufacturing systems, eliminating the need for multiple handoffs and resulting in as much as a 50% reduction in the time required for front end engineering. 
And we are extending the platform beyond Subsea system design to incorporate the execution and field management phases of a project. Once fully implemented, we'll have a complete digital thread from concept design all the way through to the life of the field. 
And we are taking our learnings in Subsea and applying those on land.
iComplete is a revolutionary approach to shale completions. And we're the only company to focus on making a completions pad that is truly integrated, efficient and simplified with digital automation and control. iComplete has 50% fewer components and reduces operating expenditures by 30%. 
The integrated system also removes 80% of connections across the well site improving efficiency while reducing risk. Digital integration is a key element of the iComplete package. All of the data gathered at the site is available in real time. It is actionable information that enables operators to make evidence-based decisions at every step of the process. 
And when combined with the automation features, it reduces personnel required on site, by up to 2/3. iComplete is experiencing broad market acceptance with awards secured from operators in all major U.S. basins, leading to increased market share. 
Earlier this month, we announced that will assume the role of President and CEO elect of Technip Energies, and I would like to welcome him to the call with us today. 
Arnault has been with the company for over 15 years and a valued member of our executive leadership team since the formation of TechnipFMC. He has extensive project-related experience, he most recently led our Subsea business, taking it to new levels of commercial and technological success. 
Simply put, he is a seasoned professional and an integral part of the foundation of the company we know today. While will undoubtedly bring new energy and new ideas to his new role, he and I are fully aligned on business strategy and committed to realizing a successful future for Technip Energies. 
And what an exciting start to his new role, just last week, we announced a strategic partnership and investment in the green hydrogen arena with McPhy, a leading manufacturer of equipment used in the production and distribution of green hydrogen. 
We are already a leader in hydrogen today. And with McPhy, we will leverage our established brand and customer relationships as well as our core competencies in engineering, technology integration and project execution, to develop large-scale and competitive green hydrogen solutions from production all the way to liquefication, storage and distribution. 
We are also joined by Chart Industries whose expertise and equipment development is complementary to our process technology and project capabilities. We firmly believe that both innovative technologies and partner collaboration will be needed for the world to achieve net 0 carbon targets, and this collaboration between the McPhy, Chart Industries and ourselves stands as a real example of the many ways in which TechnipFMC will play a material role in the energy transition. 
I will now turn the call over to Maryann to discuss our financial results in more detail."

Total company revenue was $3.3 billion in the quarter, with adjusted EBITDA of $321 million. Backlog at the end of the period was $19.6 billion, with $12.2 billion scheduled for execution through the end of 2021. 
The size and duration of our backlog have remained resilient throughout the current downturn and provide us with strong visibility over the next several years. 
I will focus my comments today on our sequential performance. In this environment, it is important for us to more clearly demonstrate the underlying improvements in the quarter. 
Total company revenue increased 6% sequentially, driven by higher activity in Subsea. Adjusted EBITDA improved more than 30% versus the second quarter, driven by strong project execution, higher asset utilization and increased benefit from our cost reduction activities. 
As Doug discussed earlier, we completed our targeted run rate cost savings of more than $350 million, ahead of schedule. We see the benefits of this in our indirect cost, including corporate functions. 
Cash flow from operations was $168 million in the quarter. Capital expenditures were $73 million, resulting in free cash flow of $95 million. 
Net cash improved sequentially to $384 million and benefited from significant debt reduction activities during the period. Net liquidity stood at $6.6 billion. 
Adjusted earnings per share was $0.16 in the quarter when excluding after-tax charges and credits of $0.17 per diluted share. 
In the period, we identified direct COVID-19 expenses totaling $36 million, down 35% sequentially. Over the course of this year, we have adapted quickly to mitigate the incremental cost impact of the business. Included in our reported results were foreign again gains of $6 million or $0.02 per diluted share and the expense resulting from increased liability to joint venture partners of $62 million or $0.14 per diluted share. 
These 2 items impacted earnings per share by $0.12 in the period and if excluded, our adjusted earnings would have been $0.28 per diluted share. 
Let me turn to the segment highlights. The information in the accompanying slide on segment results provides operating highlights when comparing to the third quarter of 2019. But here again, I will focus my comments on our sequential performance. 
Third quarter Subsea revenue increased 9% sequentially to $1.5 billion due to continued improvement in operational performance. 
We experienced increased project activity in the U.S., Asia and Africa as well as increased activity in Subsea services. Sequentially, Subsea adjusted EBITDA margin of 9.7% increased 250 basis points, driven by project completions, improved asset utilization and increased efficiency. 
In Technip Energies, revenue of $1.6 billion increased 5%, primarily driven by the improvement in operational efficiency within our supply chain and construction sites. 
Importantly, our projects are progressing well. These same factors as well as the continued strength in execution across our portfolio of projects also benefited adjusted EBITDA, which increased 7% sequentially to $175 million with a margin of 10.9%. 
In Surface Technologies, revenue of $226 million declined sequentially due to lower market activity in North America. However, revenue outside North America was largely unchanged and accounted for nearly 70% of our total segment revenue. 
Despite the decline in segment revenue, adjusted EBITDA margin of 7.7% increased 430 basis points sequentially. The significant improvement was primarily due to a favorable product mix, the benefit of our accelerated cost reduction initiatives and improved manufacturing execution in our international business. 
Adjusted corporate expense in the period was $24 million, driven by the acceleration of our cost reduction initiatives. Year-to-date corporate expense stands at $89 million. 
We revised our corporate expense guidance last quarter, to a range of $130 million to $150 million for the full year. Given the actions we have taken, we continue to trend towards the low end of this range. 
Our financial guidance is unchanged from our second quarter update. We remain confident in achieving our full year outlook in each of our business segments, assuming no further material degradation from COVID-19 related impacts. 
Turning to cash flow. Capital expenditures were $73 million and now totaled $250 million in the first 9 months of this year. We remain committed to disciplined capital investment, and are confident in our full year capital spend of approximately $300 million. 
The improved operational momentum experienced throughout the quarter supports our confidence in achieving our free cash flow guidance of neutral to $150 million for the full year. 
In the quarter, we reduced debt by $647 million with net reductions in both commercial paper and fixed maturity debt. These actions have reduced our absolute funding cost while lowering our blended interest rate. 
We ended the period with cash and cash equivalents of $4.2 billion. Net cash improved $81 million sequentially to $384 million. 
In summary, we delivered solid operational results with all segments showing sequential improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin. We continued winning new awards despite the very challenging market backdrop with a sequential increase in Subsea backlog. 
And we have achieved our targeted run rate savings of more than $350 million ahead of schedule. Beyond the operating line, we significantly reduced debt in the period, and we remain intently focused on managing the balance sheet. 
Sequentially, our net cash position increased, and we expect further improvement in the fourth quarter, as implied by our full year cash flow commitment. All of these successes give us confidence that we will deliver on our financial guidance for 2020.

I think as we discussed maybe last quarter, we've identified a range of outcomes that would potentially deliver the neutral to our $150 million, and we still see a clear path given the opportunity for performance in the back -- or sorry, in the fourth quarter. 
I think your second question was around the payment for the Yamal redeemable liability and we continue to expect in the fourth quarter that will have approximately $100 million payable. As you know, that's below the working capital line and below that free cash flow from operations. 
So we do expect, as we head into 2021, that obviously will see that free cash flow improvement. And net cash, as I mentioned in my comments, we will see improvement as well."

I remain steadfast in my conviction to the creation of Technip Energies as an independent company. The strategic rationale remains unchanged. And I would say, if anything, it has become clearer in the importance of moving forward with such a transaction. 
I think it's important, though, when we think about your question around what could be triggers, et cetera, is to reflect back on what led to the decision, a difficult decision at the time to defer the transaction. 
And to me, there was really 3 factors that weighed into that decision. One was complete panic in the financial markets driven by both the pandemic as well as the commodity price. 
There was a lot of -- secondly, there was a lot of uncertainty in our clients' plans at the time. And then finally, it really came down to ensuring that we had an environment that was conducive to say, us leaning in versus us leaning out in terms of our position within the industry. 
So when we fast forward to today, certainly, there's still anxiety and uncertainty in the market, and there always will be but I think we've come past that point of just a complete fear and panic and a concern about where the bottom could actually be. 
In terms of the industry, I think it's been quite remarkable. And as evidenced in our Q3 results here and the inbound numbers that we just shared with you for Subsea, if anyone's done them, had an opportunity to look at the math, it's a 1.1 book-to-bill for the third quarter for Subsea, which was quite a substantial win. 
And winning very important and strategic projects and 50% of those being direct awarded to our company. We're in a really unique position. 
And that really takes us to the third part, which is we're leaning in. We're winning. So when you kind of put those 3 together, I would say, we feel we're in a very different environment than we were in at the time that we suspended, where we didn't know what our customers' plans were going to be. 
For instance, we weren't sure what impact it was going to have on our backlog. I can reaffirm today, there have been no cancellations in our backlog. We didn't know what impact it was going to have on our supply chain and our ability to be able to execute and deliver some of the world's most complex and strategic projects. 
And as our financial results indicated across all 3 of our business segments, we continue to execute very well. So we're in a different situation now, Sean. We'll continue to look at what is the right timing and what is the right scenario and structure to move this transaction forward, but it would be our intent to continue to move in that direction."

And I further understand, it's not overnight, but there's going to be the kind of oil projects from 2025 and gas projects from 2035. 
So just wondering, like how that might impact TechnipFMC in terms of maybe your clients that may rely on French export credit? Or furthermore, maybe when you guys try to help clients arrange export credit facilities, how that could impact your ability to win some of these projects?"

And I think you really used the keyword there, which was help or assist. We don't do project financing.

And I think you really used the keyword there, which was help or assist. We don't do project financing. But it is true that from time to time, we are in a position that we can try to, if you will, link the 2 parties together. 
But that we do nothing more than that, and that's the only role that we play in project financing. 
It is true. We're reading the same things that you're reading, and we're not privy to any additional facts or time line than you are. But I think it's also realistic to assume if the project has good returns for the client. The project will source funding and in any single project, there tends to be multiple sources of funding. 
It doesn't rely on any particular single source of funding. So my assumption Amy, and we don't have -- none of us can predict the future on this. But I feel quite certain, as we've seen over time that the funding has evolved on these major projects from different sources that a project with good economics would be able -- would source funding in whichever way it deemed most appropriate. 
So we'll wait and we'll see how things play out, and we'll continue to play our role, which is nothing more than to help or assist, which we normally don't do. But when asked, we certainly do what we can to support or assist. 
But again, we're not in the project financing game."

Just a follow-up, and it's still along the lines of understanding your order intake, potential order intake pipeline.

But to what degree some of those projects kind of were initiated from or converted from projects that were you were already in discussions pre the COVID pandemic.

Or is it becoming more difficult in a pandemic environment?

We got there on the second question. So thank you. Or no, thank you, maybe. No. Look, Amy, we'll give you as much -- I'll give you some kind of qualitative thoughts, obviously, quantitative thought",760,"Sure, Amy. I knew we were going to get to 2021 quickly. We got there on the second question. So thank you. Or no, thank you, maybe. 
No. Look, Amy, we'll give you as much -- I'll give you some kind of qualitative thoughts, obviously, quantitative thoughts at this time would be premature. Our customers are still developing their budgets, their plans for 2021. 
So to do anything quantitative, I think, would be a would be a bit premature. But in the spirit of your question, I'll be willing to give you some qualitative outlook. 
I'm going to cover Subsea and Surface International, and then I'm going to ask Arnaud to make some comments on his thoughts on the subject regarding Technip Energies. 
So let's start with Surface International. Look, we are continuing to see very strong momentum in our order outlook for Surface International. And I keep emphasizing International only because in North America, as you know, it's a Book & Turn business. 
So the inbound that we expect to come from the service international will continue to pick up. I know that's a little bit contrarian to some of the other comments that may have been made about the international market, but I think it's important to understand our position in Surface International. It's actually quite unique. 
The level in the specifications and technology required for that equipment far exceeds that that's used in -- for instance, the North America market. 
There's really us and maybe 1 other supplier of that high-spec equipment. It's totally -- it's vertically integrated. We do it all in-house. It's not outsourced to China or anywhere else as it is in the North American market, and it requires very, very sophisticated machine tooling and materials to be able to provide that equipment very similar to Subsea. 
Hence, the reason we're so successful. 
So we see that continuing to expand I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we've always had a strong position in the Middle East, North Africa. We just extended our leadership position in the Middle East. I announced a couple of new awards. And we continue to work very, very closely with all of the key players in the region and expect continued success and growing success in 2021. 
In terms of Subsea orders. What I would say at this point, Amy, is it seems ever, but it was just a few months ago, a few quarters ago, I mentioned that I felt we could achieve $4 billion of order inbound for Subsea in 2020. 
I think for the largest part, it was discounted and there's a lot of skepticism around that. Obviously, we've come a long way to achieving that already, and we have 1 quarter left to complete, and we remain committed to that. 
And I think as I, at this point, look towards 2021, I could see kind of a similar -- I could see 2021 to resemble 2020. Again, it's a bit early. There's some moving pieces still we're trying to lock down with our customers to really understand the timing and as always, Amy, 1 large project shifting from Q4 of 2021 to Q1 of 2022 could change things. 
And that's why I'm saying, we just don't have that level of granularity yet from our clients. But when I look at the success of our execution, when I look at our growing activity in our feed, which I mentioned in my prepared remarks, it's now -- it's grown double digit. The majority of that being I feeds the majority of our I feeds are direct awarded to our company. This is that proprietary opportunity set that the rest of the market does not have access to. 
Again, why we were able to do $4 billion this year, which is the majority of the subsea market. We expect that to continue on next year, again, with probably more iEPCI projects and more direct awards. 
And then finally, it's important not to forget the strength and resilience of our Subsea services business. That continues to be a strong foundation that we continue to build from. 
So when you put all that together, again, we have to really understand what projects are going to move forward and the timing of those projects. But I expect that to -- I expect 2021 to resemble 2020. 
And just maybe 1 last thought. You may have picked up in my prepared remarks, but if you didn't, we signed another exclusive alliance for Subsea. So we're really proud of the progress we're making. Arnaud?"

Thank you, Doug, and thank you, Amy. So for Technip Energies, I would add that, as expressed by Doug in his our previous by Doug in his prepared remarks, there is a potential to inbound for Technip Energies to projects or prospects, exceeding $1 billion each before the end of the quarter, before the end of the year. 
So it's I think this alone is giving you a good idea of what the year can and will look like for Technip Energies inbound full year. 
And also maybe something that I'd like to share is that for Technip Energies, the LNG wave isn't over yet for us. And there is a very solid pipeline of opportunities into next year as well. And all building blocks are in place, I would say, for Technip Energies to have another solid year in terms of inbound next year. 
And 1 part of your question was also about how we are having new conversations or new types of conversations? And -- or are we just relying on the past conversations pre-Covid and converting the opportunities. 
But in actual fact, yes, we are having new types of conversations and new conversations about new prospects and opportunities. And very interestingly, including in the traditional markets or what I'm going to call traditional markets in a position to know Blue wider and green hydrogen. 
But there is an energy transition perspective in every of the conversation we are having with our customers, including in the more traditional markets with quite a huge emphasis on being placed on decarbonization by our customers. 
So there's a real opportunity set here for us in green as well as brownfield activity set for Technip Energies. So a nice mix of conversation, if I may say, for Technip Energies going forward."

The opportunities are most definitely apply across the portfolio. And we're going to show, Kurt, and it's just our style. I'm not suggesting it's the best, but it's what we do. 
We tend to really build our credit -- build up and have some real credible examples. We say making it real. Versus just kind of going out, let's say, with pure ambition and belief. 
And you've heard us do more and more of that. You've heard me talk about iProduction a reducing future of greenhouse gas emissions by 50%. You've heard me talk about Subsea 2.0, reducing greenhouse gases by 47%, and you saw us make our strategic investment in green hydrogen with the recent investment we made to McPhy, which I'm going to ask or to tell you a bit more about the hydrogen market. 
But Kurt, I apologize to you, but I promise the it's a very compelling message. I'd like to deliver that message in the proper setting. And the work has been done. We -- actually we'll talk about what we have done where we've been investing because in some of these areas we've been investing for over 5 years. This isn't anything new. 
We're going to talk about the fact that we're doing it because we believe it's the right thing to do, not because it's because of popular demand, you have to believe in what you're doing. And we're going to show real examples of the impact that we're having. 
We're going to set forth the ambition, but we're all going to also set forth a 3-year measurable plan in a scorecard that our progress can be judged against. 
And we're going to focus on those markets where we can actually generate good returns. So we're going to be selective. And you've heard me say that before. There's some very popular offshore markets right now that people are pursuing. But when you really look at it, and it doesn't take long to analyze it, there's just not enough left for the installation company to make a decent return. So these packages are being split upwards of 8 contractors, which would typically be done between 1 or 2 contractors. 
So if you're the eighth on the list, if you don't have the technology, if you're not bringing together the integration, if you're not the -- if you're just doing the installation, that we don't believe we can generate the type of returns that our shareholders expect from us. 
So we're looking at other things. And you're going to hear me talk about some things in a couple of weeks that I think will really be surprising, but they'll be backed up by facts, they'll be backed up by real examples of what we're doing, and it will be an ambition that is -- will be very, very compelling. 
I'd like to let talk a bit about the hydrogen market. This is a market we've been in for quite a while. And we were very excited about our recent investment in green hydrogen, Arnaud."

So blue is going to mature. Green is not totally mature but will mature as well. And this investment in McPhy  is basically a way for us to position Technip Energies to be or to continue to be a leader on large-scale hydrogen market, including the green. 
So of course, this is the beginning with McPhy, and there might be other opportunities going forward.

And it will be -- I'm going to maybe use an analogy, it might not be a great analogy, but I think it helps visualize. One hasn't been on one of these multi-stage 24/7 kind of operating environments that is happening in most of the U.S. shell today.",546,"Sure. And it will be -- I'm going to maybe use an analogy, it might not be a great analogy, but I think it helps visualize. One hasn't been on one of these multi-stage 24/7 kind of operating environments that is happening in most of the U.S. shell today. It's kind of hard to appreciate. So I'll try to visualize it for you. 
There's just a scurry of activity. And then there's the actual execution or, if you will, the pumping of the stage. At which point everybody goes back and it's highly automated, and it's really managed quite efficiently. But it's -- what happens between those stages that is at best orchestrated and at worst chaotic. 
I describe it as a bunch of ants just scurrying around a bunch of simultaneous operations. You're dealing with high-pressure regions, you're dealing with very trip hazards. 
It's just -- it's very complicated, but it's the way that the industry has been doing it forever. I say forever since I've been around. 
But what is -- we looked at it, and we consider ourselves to be an integrated architect. And it's a -- it's what we do in the Subsea. Everything in Subsea uses automation and control. You don't have people running around in between operations because, obviously, they're unable to because it's at the bottom of the ocean. 
So we said, well, why can't we do that on surface? And of course, initially, people say, ""Oh, it's not possible, it's not applicable, et cetera. But when you put really smart people on it, and we have a tremendous amount of really smart people and talented people and give them the challenge, it's amazing what they're able to do. 
And what they were able to do was to look at it and take that part of the activity that nobody owns, it's owned by many different contractors. And say, why doesn't somebody kind of take charge here and really find a way to make most of this activity automated, removing that interface, removing all of those activities and at the same time, accelerating and improving the overall efficiency and most importantly, the safe environment in which to rate. 
And it's really quite amazing. And I don't know if I'm giving it justice the way that I'm describing it to you but we went from a best orchestrated a worst chaos to now something that's remotely operated. The client controls everything from an iPad. 
All of those activities that have to happen in between now we're now fully automated, and it's quite meaningful. And the market acceptance, it was barely introduced. 
I know it's the first time we're talking about iComplete on an earnings call, it's really because it's relatively new. We've been working on it for a while, but it's just amazing how quickly it's spread because, again, it's just 1 of these things. 
If you come up with the right solution that makes sense that the customer can get real upfront benefit from that we get tremendous benefit from in terms of our operating efficiency. And in this case, our market share these things tend to be very successful. So don't make them overly complex, focus on the things that matter and deliver real results. That's our company."

There's quite a few lessons that have been learned over the last 6 months. 
If I just try -- if I just try to pick 2, the first 1 is do what is right, do what is right. It's got to feel right in the mind, and it's got to feel right in the heart. 
So what do I mean by that? Be it the way that we reacted to the pandemic by putting 100% of focus on the health and well-being of our employees, our partners and our contractors, trusting them, giving them the tools that they need, helping them through this very difficult period and then allowing them to perform. 
And it's just amazing to me what was done during this period of time when many other companies failed when many other companies struggled because the complexity of adapting to the number of changes that were being thrown at us on a weekly, daily and in some cases, hourly basis and our project directors and project teams and our manufacturing staff and our crews that were out on the vessels. 
I just -- I can't say enough. So there's a lesson learned there, take care of them, keep them healthy, give them the tools they need to do the job and have faith and trust and confidence, and it's amazing. 
It's amazing what people will do. 
The second 1 is really around the change of behaviors. Becoming too internally focused, not staying close to your customer, I think, has really hurt a lot of companies. We remain very close to our customers. We weren't mustering them. They obviously had to work through their own challenges that were coming at them, but letting them know that we were there. We would support them in whatever way that we could, and we did in some very unique ways in terms of helping them mobilize people in terms of helping them with some early COVID testing kits, whatever was required, just billed so much loyalty and so much trust. 
And they also are now extending to us even greater, let's say, latitude to operate. So I see in the future where we've always wanted to get. But when it comes to remote inspections versus on-site inspections, when it comes to more integration versus less integration. Look, I think this is the new reality. It is proven. It is creating value, and I think that this very terrible crisis that we went through, in some cases, probably probably accelerated some of this adoption and adoption by the industry, I would argue by maybe as much as 5 years. 
And I think -- I do think it's here to stay. I don't think it will revert we are talking to clients very seriously now about how they're going to operate their major projects going forward, both in Technip Energies as well as in Subsea. And I think you'll find our company playing a much more prominent role than we have historically."

On the call with me today are Maryann Mannen, Chief Financial Officer; and Arnaud Pieton, President and CEO elect of Technip Energies.  
We delivered solid operational results in the third quarter, just months after the start of one of the most challenging periods the global community has ever faced. I want to once again thank our entire workforce for the resilience and dedication that they have shown throughout these unprecedented times. 
Our success is evident in our ability to continue winning, to continue executing and to continue accelerating our business transformation, while remaining steadfast and our focus on health and safety.  
In the quarter, inbound orders exceeded $2.2 billion, largely driven by Subsea. This was our strongest quarter thus far in 2020 and represented a sequential increase of 45%. Our strong results stem from the success of working collaboratively with our clients, where our innovative solutions, demonstrated excellence in execution and financial health, provide our customers with confidence to move forward projects during such challenging times.  
Total company adjusted EBITDA was $321 million with a margin of 9.6%. Importantly, all 3 segments showed sequential margin improvement as the execution momentum continued across the portfolio.  
And looking at our business transformation, we continue to accelerate our cost reduction efforts and have already achieved the full targeted run rate savings of more than $350 million. As we leverage our new business models, innovative technologies and digital solutions, we will continue to drive further cost reduction and efficiency gains across the organization.  
Taken together, our inbound orders, our operational results and our cost reduction initiatives provide us the confidence to reaffirm our full year guidance for 2020.  
As our clients continue to reprioritize their portfolio of investments, we have seen an improvement in our award activity. Having announced 6 projects globally since July, totaling $2.8 billion in aggregate contract value. While most of these projects are already in our backlog, the EPC contract for the Assiut Hydrocracking Complex, a Technip Energies award that exceeds $1 billion, is anticipated to be inbound in the fourth quarter.  
We also announced an award from Shell for the revamp of their Moerdijk plant, where we will provide proprietary equipment and related services for 8 ethylene furnaces. This award further demonstrates our leadership in ethylene technology and helps drive a reduction in CO2 emissions.  
In addition, our LNG opportunity set remains strong, as we have been awarded 2 major projects which will inbound upon FID by the client. For one of these projects, Sempra's Energy at Costa Azul, the client has indicated a likely FID by year-end. And we are actively tendering a major project in Qatar.  
Our prospect with good momentum is evidenced by recent award announcements for several project work scopes. While we believe TechnipFMC is well positioned for this opportunity, the EPC contract is being competitively tendered.  
In Surface Technologies, we continue to leverage the strength and resilience of our leading international franchise with 2 important growth opportunities captured in the quarter, both in the Middle East.  
In Kuwait, we received an award for high-pressure gas equipment and in-country services. And in Oman, we secured a 5-year frame agreement with Petrogas, an operator that has significant drilling plants in the country.  
We believe these awards provide us the opportunity to further expand our market share across the region.  
And in Subsea, we were awarded our latest iEPCI  project with Shell in Malaysia. It incorporates our Subsea 2.0 technology as well as a diverse set of other projects in some of the most active basins in the world.  
In Brazil, the Petrobras Mero 2 project; in Norway, the Breidablikk project for Equinor; and the ExxonMobil Payara project in Guyana. 50% of these projects were the result of a direct award to our company due to our unique capabilities, our competitiveness and our technology leadership. These awards clearly demonstrate the resilience of strategic offshore basins, where through-cycle economics are highly competitive within our clients' investment portfolios.  
We remain on track to secure approximately $4 billion of Subsea inbound for the full year.  
Looking ahead, we see a healthy set of Subsea opportunities. And we continue to grow our proprietary market opportunities by focusing on long-term strategic relationships with our partners to optimize project economics and returns, utilizing our unique and proven iFEED, iEPCI and iLoF capabilities. Therefore, I am pleased to announce another exclusive alliance with an operator in the U.K. North Sea, leveraging our integrated subsea business model, iEPCI, to support and optimize future development opportunities from the early concept phase through production and Life of Field services.  
Additionally, our front-end engineering teams remain very active. In fact, we have seen an acceleration in study awards in recent months, with double-digit growth now expected above our prior expectation. And half of our study today are integrated, which leverage the benefits of our digital Subsea Studio offering and positions us well for future iEPCI  awards.  
Digital is another key enabler of our business transformation, and our digital strategy is focused on 3 pillars: becoming a data-centric company, developing intelligent products and assets and driving towards autonomous operations. Subsea Studio and our recently introduced iComplete offering are 2 solutions that exemplify these pillars and further expand our leadership position.  
Let me start with Subsea Studio. This solution is transforming the conventional concept, FEED and tendering phases of Subsea projects. Working with our clients, we are now able to develop ultra-fast digital field architectures, that bring together decades of engineering knowledge with artificial intelligence and machine learning to optimize product configurations, accelerate execution and maximize value. Subsea Studio has an open architecture that allows integration with other engineering and manufacturing systems, eliminating the need for multiple handoffs and resulting in as much as a 50% reduction in the time required for front-end engineering. And we are extending the platform beyond Subsea system design to incorporate the execution and field management phases of a project. Once fully implemented, we'll have a complete digital thread from concept design all the way through to the life of the field.  And we are taking our learnings in Subsea and applying those on land. 
IComplete is a revolutionary approach to shale completions. And we're the only company to focus on making a completions pad that is truly integrated, efficient and simplified with digital automation and control. iComplete has 50% fewer components and reduces operating expenditures by 30%.  The integrated system also removes 80% of connections across the well site, improving efficiency while reducing risk. Digital integration is a key element of the iComplete package. All of the data gathered at the site is available in real time. It is actionable information that enables operators to make evidence-based decisions at every step of the process. And when combined with the automation features, it reduces personnel required on site, by up to 2/3. iComplete is experiencing broad market acceptance with awards secured from operators in all major U.S. basins, leading to increased market share.  
Earlier this month, we announced that Arnaud Pieton will assume the role of President and CEO elect of Technip Energies, and I would like to welcome him to the call with us today. 
Arnaud has been with the company for over 15 years and a valued member of our executive leadership team since the formation of TechnipFMC. He has extensive project-related experience. He most recently led our Subsea business, taking it to new levels of commercial and technological success. Simply put, he is a seasoned professional and an integral part of the foundation of the company we know today. While Arnaud will undoubtedly bring new energy and new ideas to his new role, he and I are fully aligned on business strategy and committed to realizing a successful future for Technip Energies.  
And what an exciting start to his new role, just last week, we announced a strategic partnership and investment in the green hydrogen arena with McPhy, a leading manufacturer of equipment used in the production and distribution of green hydrogen. We are already a leader in hydrogen today. And with McPhy, we will leverage our established brand and customer relationships as well as our core competencies in engineering, technology integration and project execution, to develop large-scale and competitive green hydrogen solutions from production all the way to liquefication, storage and distribution.  
We are also joined by Chart Industries whose expertise and equipment development is complementary to our process technology and project capabilities. We firmly believe that both innovative technologies and partner collaboration will be needed for the world to achieve net zero carbon targets. And this collaboration between the McPhy, Chart Industries and ourselves stands as a real example of the many ways in which TechnipFMC will play a material role in the energy transition.  
I will now turn the call over to Maryann to discuss our financial results in more detail."

I will focus my comments today on our sequential performance. In this environment, it is important for us to more clearly demonstrate the underlying improvements in the quarter. Total company revenue increased 6% sequentially, driven by higher activity in Subsea. Adjusted EBITDA improved more than 30% versus the second quarter, driven by strong project execution, higher asset utilization and increased benefit from our cost reduction activities.  
As Doug discussed earlier, we completed our targeted run-rate cost savings of more than $350 million, ahead of schedule. We see the benefits of this in our indirect cost, including corporate functions.  
Cash flow from operations was $168 million in the quarter. Capital expenditures were $73 million, resulting in free cash flow of $95 million.  
Net cash improved sequentially to $384 million and benefited from significant debt reduction activities during the period. Net liquidity stood at $6.6 billion.  
Adjusted earnings per share was $0.16 in the quarter, when excluding after-tax charges and credits of $0.17 per diluted share.  
In the period, we identified direct COVID-19 expenses totaling $36 million, down 35% sequentially. Over the course of this year, we have adapted quickly to mitigate the incremental cost impacts of the virus on our business. Included in our reported results were foreign exchange gains of $6 million, or $0.02 per diluted share. And the expense resulting from increased liability to joint venture partners of $62 million, or $0.14 per diluted share. These 2 items impacted earnings per share by $0.12 in the period, and if excluded, our adjusted earnings would have been $0.28 per diluted share.  
Let me turn to the segment highlights. The information in the accompanying slide on segment results provides operating highlights when comparing to the third quarter of 2019. But here again, I will focus my comments on our sequential performance.  
Third quarter Subsea revenue increased 9% sequentially to $1.5 billion due to continued improvement in operational performance. We experienced increased project activity in the U.S., Asia and Africa as well as increased activity in Subsea services. Sequentially, Subsea adjusted EBITDA margin of 9.7% increased 250 basis points, driven by project completions, improved asset utilization and increased efficiency.  
In Technip Energies, revenue of $1.6 billion increased 5%, primarily driven by the improvement in operational efficiency within our supply chain and construction sites. Importantly, our projects are progressing well. These same factors as well as the continued strength in execution across our portfolio of projects also benefited adjusted EBITDA, which increased 7% sequentially to $175 million with a margin of 10.9%.  
In Surface Technologies, revenue of $226 million declined sequentially due to lower market activity in North America. However, revenue outside North America was largely unchanged and accounted for nearly 70% of our total segment revenue.  
Despite the decline in segment revenue, adjusted EBITDA margin of 7.7% increased 430 basis points sequentially. The significant improvement was primarily due to a favorable product mix, the benefit of our accelerated cost reduction initiatives and improved manufacturing execution in our international business.  
Adjusted corporate expense in the period was $24 million, driven by the acceleration of our cost reduction initiatives. Year-to-date corporate expense stands at $89 million. We revised our corporate expense guidance last quarter, to a range of $130 million to $150 million for the full year. Given the actions we have taken, we continue to trend towards the low end of this range.  
Our financial guidance is unchanged from our second quarter update. We remain confident in achieving our full year outlook in each of our business segments, assuming no further material degradation from COVID-19-related impacts.  
Turning to cash flow. Capital expenditures were $73 million and now totaled $250 million in the first 9 months of this year. We remain committed to disciplined capital investment, and are confident in our full year capital spend of approximately $300 million.  
The improved operational momentum experienced throughout the quarter supports our confidence in achieving our free cash flow guidance of neutral to $150 million for the full year.  
In the quarter, we reduced debt by $647 million with net reductions in both commercial paper and fixed maturity debt. These actions have reduced our absolute funding cost, while lowering our blended interest rate.  
We ended the period with cash and cash equivalents of $4.2 billion. Net cash improved $81 million sequentially to $384 million.  
In summary, we delivered solid operational results, with all segments showing sequential improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin. We continued winning new awards despite the very challenging market backdrop with a sequential increase in Subsea backlog. And we have achieved our targeted run rate savings of more than $350 million, ahead of schedule. Beyond the operating line, we significantly reduced debt in the period, and we remain intently focused on managing the balance sheet. Sequentially, our net cash position increased, and we expect further improvement in the fourth quarter, as implied by our full year cash flow commitment. All of these successes give us confidence that we will deliver on our financial guidance for 2020.

I think as we discussed maybe last quarter, we've identified a range of outcomes that would potentially deliver the neutral to our $150 million, and we still see a clear path given the opportunity for performance in the back -- or sorry, in the fourth quarter. 
I think your second question was around the payment for the Yamal redeemable liability and we continue to expect in the fourth quarter, that will have approximately $100 million payable. As you know, that's below the working capital line and below that free cash flow from operations. 
So we do expect, as we head into 2021, that obviously we will see that free cash flow improvement. And net cash, as I mentioned in my comments, we will see improvement as well."

I remain steadfast in my conviction to the creation of Technip Energies as an independent company. The strategic rationale remains unchanged. And I would say, if anything, it has become clearer in the importance of moving forward with such a transaction. 
I think it's important, though, when we think about your question around what could be triggers, et cetera, is to reflect back on what led to the decision, a difficult decision at the time to defer the transaction. 
And to me, there was really 3 factors that weighed into that decision. One was complete panic in the financial markets, driven by both the pandemic as well as the commodity price. There was a lot of -- secondly, there was a lot of uncertainty in our clients' plans at the time. And then finally, it really came down to ensuring that we had an environment that was conducive to, what I'd like to say, us leaning in versus us leaning out in terms of our position within the industry. 
So when we fast forward to today, certainly, there's still anxiety and uncertainty in the market, and there always will be, but I think we've come past that point of just a complete fear and panic and a concern about where the bottom could actually be. 
In terms of the industry, I think it's been quite remarkable. And as evidenced in our Q3 results here and the inbound numbers that we just shared with you for Subsea, if anyone's done them, had an opportunity to look at the math, it's a 1.1 book-to-bill for the third quarter for Subsea, which was quite a substantial win. And winning very important and strategic projects and 50% of those being direct awarded to our company, we're in a really unique position. 
And that really takes us to the third part, which is we're leaning in. We're winning. So when you kind of put those 3 together, I would say, we feel we're in a very different environment than we were in at the time that we suspended, where we didn't know what our customers' plans were going to be. 
For instance, we weren't sure what impact it was going to have on our backlog. I can reaffirm today, there have been no cancellations in our backlog. We didn't know what impact it was going to have on our supply chain and our ability to be able to execute and deliver some of the world's most complex and strategic projects. 
And as our financial results indicated across all 3 of our business segments, we continue to execute very well. So we're in a different situation now, Sean. We'll continue to look at what is the right timing and what is the right scenario and structure to move this transaction forward, but it would be our intent to continue to move in that direction."

But it is true that from time to time, we are in a position that we can try to, if you will, link the 2 parties together. But that -- we do nothing more than that, and that's the only role that we play in project financing. 
It is true. We're reading the same things that you're reading, and we're not privy to any additional facts or time line than you are. But I think it's also realistic to assume if the project has good returns for the client, the project will source funding. And in any single project, there tends to be multiple sources of funding. It doesn't rely on any particular single source of funding. So my assumption, Amy, and we don't have -- none of us can predict the future on this, but I feel quite certain, as we've seen over time that the funding has evolved on these major projects from different sources that a project with good economics would be able -- would source funding in whichever way it deemed most appropriate. 
So we'll wait and we'll see how things play out, and we'll continue to play our role, which is nothing more than to help or assist, which we normally don't do. But when asked, we certainly do what we can to support or assist. But again, we're not in the project financing game."

We got there on the second question. So thank you. Or no, thank you, maybe. 
No. Look, Amy, we'll give you as much -- I'll give you some, kind of, qualitative thoughts, obviously quantitative thoughts at this time would be premature. Our customers are still developing their budgets, their plans for 2021. So to do anything quantitative, I think, would be a bit premature. But in the spirit of your question, I'll be willing to give you some qualitative outlook. 
I'm going to cover Subsea and Surface international, and then I'm going to ask Arnaud to make some comments on his thoughts on the subject regarding Technip Energies. 
So let's start with Surface international. Look, we are continuing to see very strong momentum in our order outlook for Surface International. And I keep emphasizing International only because in North America, as you know, it's a Book & Turn business. So the inbound that we expect to come from the Surface international will continue to pick up. I know that's a little bit contrarian to some of the other comments that may have been made about the international market, but I think it's important to understand our position in Surface International. It's actually quite unique. 
The level and the specifications and technology required for that equipment far exceeds that that's used in, for instance, the North America market. There's really us and maybe one other supplier of that high-spec equipment. It's totally -- it's vertically integrated. We do it all in-house. It's not outsourced to China or anywhere else, as it is in the North American market. And it requires very, very sophisticated machine tooling and materials to be able to provide that equipment, very similar to Subsea. Hence, the reason we're so successful. 
So we see that continuing to expand. I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we've always had a strong position in the Middle East, North Africa. We just extended our leadership position in the Middle East. I announced a couple of new awards. And we continue to work very, very closely with all of the key players in the region and expect continued success and in growing success in 2021. 
In terms of Subsea orders, what I would say at this point, Amy, is it seems like forever, but it was just a few months ago, a few quarters ago, I mentioned that I felt we could achieve $4 billion of order inbound for Subsea in 2020. I think for the largest part, it was discounted and there's a lot of skepticism around that. Obviously, we've come a long way to achieving that already, and we have 1 quarter left to complete, and we remain committed to that. 
And I think as I, at this point, look towards 2021, I could see kind of a similar -- I could see 2021 resemble 2020. Again, it's a bit early. There's some moving pieces still we're trying to lock down with our customers to really understand the timing and as always, Amy, one large project shifting from Q4 of 2021 to Q1 of 2022 could change things. And that's why I'm saying, we just don't have that level of granularity yet from our clients. But when I look at the success of our execution, when I look at our growing activity in our FEED, which I mentioned in my prepared remarks, it's now -- it's grown double digit. The majority of that being iFEEDs, the majority of our iFEEDs are direct awarded to our company, this is that proprietary opportunity set that the rest of the market does not have access to. Again, why we were able to do $4 billion this year, which is the majority of the Subsea market. We expect that to continue on next year, again, with probably more iEPCI projects and more direct awards. 
And then finally, it's important not to forget the strength and resilience of our Subsea Services business. That continues to be a strong foundation that we continue to build from. 
So when you put all that together, again, we have to really understand what projects are going to move forward and the timing of those projects. But I expect that to -- I expect 2021 to resemble 2020. 
And just maybe one last thought. You may have picked up in my prepared remarks, but if you didn't, we signed another exclusive alliance for Subsea. So we're really proud of the progress we're making. Arnaud?"

So it's -- I think this alone is giving you a good idea of what the year can and will look like for Technip Energies inbound full year. 
And also maybe something that I'd like to share is that for Technip Energies, the LNG wave isn't over yet for us. And there is a very solid pipeline of opportunities into next year as well. And all building blocks are in place, I would say, for Technip Energies to have another solid year in terms of inbound next year. 
And one part of your question was also about how we are having new conversations or new types of conversations? And/or are we just relying on the past conversations pre-COVID and converting the opportunities?
But in actual fact, yes, we are having new types of conversations and new conversations about new prospects and opportunities. And very interestingly, including in the traditional markets, or what I'm going to call traditional markets in a position to, I don't know, blue hydrogen and green hydrogen, but there is an energy transition perspective in every of the conversation we are having with our customers, including in the more traditional markets with quite a huge emphasis on being placed on decarbonization by our customers. 
So there's a real opportunity set here for us in a green as well as brownfield activity set for Technip Energies. So a nice mix of conversation, if I may say, for Technip Energies going forward."

We have the answer, but I have a keynote presentation in, I think, 2 weeks' time, a little less than 2 weeks' time. And I really don't want to steal my thunder or the thunder for the company. 
But Kurt, I think what we're going to have to say will be very, very compelling. The opportunities are most definitely applied across the portfolio. And what we're going to show, Kurt, and it's just our style, I'm not suggesting it's the best, but it's what we do. We tend to really build our -- build up and have some real credible examples, we say, making it real versus just kind of going out, let's say, with pure ambition and belief. And you've heard us do more and more of that. You've heard me talk about iProduction, reducing future to greenhouse gas emissions by 50%. You've heard me talk about Subsea 2.0, reducing greenhouse gases by 47%, and you saw us make our strategic investment in green hydrogen with the recent investment we made to McPhy, which I'm going to ask Arnaud to tell you a bit more about the hydrogen market. 
But Kurt, I apologize to you, but I promise the -- it's a very compelling message. I'd like to deliver that message in the proper setting. And the work has been done. We actually -- we'll talk about what we have done, where we've been investing because in some of these areas we've been investing for over 5 years. This isn't anything new. We're going to talk about the fact that we're doing it because we believe it's the right thing to do, not because it's because of popular demand, you have to believe in what you're doing. And we're going to show real examples of the impact that we're having. We're going to set forth the ambition, but we're all -- going to also set forth a 3-year measurable plan and a scorecard that our progress can be judged against. 
And we're going to focus on those markets where we can actually generate good returns. So we're going to be selective. And you've heard me say that before. There's some very popular offshore markets right now that people are pursuing. But when you really look at it, and it doesn't take long to analyze it, there's just not enough left for the installation company to make a decent return. So these packages are being split upwards of 8 contractors, which would typically be done between 1 or 2 contractors. So if you're the 8th on the list, if you don't have the technology, if you're not bringing together the integration, if you're not the -- if you're just doing the installation, that we don't believe we can generate the type of returns that our shareholders expect from us. 
So we're looking at other things. And you're going to hear me talk about some things in a couple of weeks that I think will really be surprising, but they'll be backed up by facts, they'll be backed up by real examples of what we're doing, and it will be an ambition that is -- will be very, very compelling. 
I'd like to let Arnaud talk a bit about the hydrogen market. This is a market we've been in for quite a while. And we were very excited about our recent investment in green hydrogen. Arnaud?"

So as Doug stated, we do have -- as TechnipFMC and Technip Energy has a very rich history in hydrogen, we -- basically we have an installed base that is 270 plants utilizing our proprietary technology. And when you combine that with our leading CO2 management capabilities, one can say that we have pretty much everything we need to be a very credible player in the blue hydrogen industry space as it evolves. So blue is going to mature. Green is not totally mature, but will mature as well. 
And this investment in McPhy is basically a way for us to position Technip Energies to be or to continue to be a leader on large-scale hydrogen market, including the green. So of course, this is the beginning with McPhy, and there might be other opportunities going forward. But partnering with McPhy is partnering with a Tier 1 electrolyzer supplier, and we will help with the IP development, help to scale and accelerate the technology. And we are super excited about it because it's a way to be forward-looking and continue on that hydrogen journey that we started many decades ago and where we do have a leadership position.

And it will be -- I'm going to maybe use an analogy, it might not be a great analogy, but I think it helps visualize.

And it will be -- I'm going to maybe use an analogy, it might not be a great analogy, but I think it helps visualize. If one hasn't been on one of these multi-stage 24/7, kind of, operating environments that is happening in most of the U.S. shale today, it's kind of hard to appreciate. So I'll try to visualize it for you. 
There's just a scurry of activity. And then there's the actual execution or, if you will, the pumping of the stage, at which point everybody goes back and it's highly automated, and it's really managed quite efficiently. But it's -- what happens between those stages, that is at best orchestrated and at worst chaotic, I describe it as a bunch of ants just scurrying around a bunch of simultaneous operations. You're dealing with high-pressure regions, you're dealing with very trip hazards. It's just -- it's very complicated, but it's the way that the industry has been doing it forever, right. I say forever since I've been around. 
But what is -- we looked at it, and we consider ourselves to be an integrated architect. And it's what we do in the Subsea. Everything in Subsea uses automation and control. You don't have people running around in between operations because, obviously, they're unable to because it's at the bottom of the ocean. 
So we said, well, why can't we do that on surface? And of course, initially, people say, ""Oh, it's not possible, it's not applicable, et cetera. But when you put really smart people on it, and we have a tremendous amount of really smart people and talented people and give them the challenge, it's amazing what they're able to do. 
And what they were able to do was to look at it and take that part of the activity that nobody owns, it's owned by many different contractors. And say, why doesn't somebody kind of take charge here and really find a way to make most of this activity automated, removing that interface, removing all of those activities and at the same time, accelerating and improving the overall efficiency and most importantly, the safe environment in which to operate. 
And it's really quite amazing. And I don't know if I'm giving it justice the way that I'm describing it to you, but we went from a best orchestrated worst chaos to now something that's remotely operated. The client controls everything from an iPad. All of those activities that have to happen in between are now fully automated, and it's quite meaningful. And the market acceptance, it was barely introduced. 
I know it's the first time we're talking about iComplete on an earnings call, it's really because it's relatively new. We've been working on it for a while, but it's just amazing how quickly it's spread because, again, it's just one of these things. If you come up with the right solution that makes sense that the customer can get real upfront benefit from that, we get tremendous benefit from in terms of our operating efficiency. And in this case our market share, these things tend to be very successful. So don't make them overly complex, focus on the things that matter and deliver real results. That's our company."

There's quite a few lessons that have been learned over the last 6 months. 
If I just try -- if I just try to pick 2, the first one is do what is right, do what is right. It's got to feel right in the mind, and it's got to feel right in the heart. So what do I mean by that? Be it the way that we reacted to the pandemic, by putting 100% of focus on the health and well-being of our employees, our partners and our contractors, trusting them, giving them the tools that they need, helping them through this very difficult period and then allowing them to perform. 
And it's just amazing to me what was done during this period of time when many, many other companies failed, when many other companies struggled because the complexity of adapting to the number of changes that were being thrown at us on a weekly, daily and in some cases, hourly basis and our project directors and project teams and our manufacturing staff and our crews that were out on the vessels, I just -- I can't say enough. So if there's a lesson learned there, take care of them, keep them healthy, give them the tools they need to do the job and have faith and trust and confidence, and it's amazing. It's amazing what people will do. 
The second one is really around the change of behaviors. Becoming too internally focused, not staying close to your customer, I think, has really hurt a lot of companies. We remain very close to our customers. We weren't pestering them. They obviously had to work through their own challenges that were coming at them, but letting them know that we were there. We would support them in whatever way that we could, and we did in some very unique ways, in terms of helping them mobilize people, in terms of helping them with some early COVID testing kits, whatever that -- whatever was required, just built so much loyalty and so much trust. And they also are now extending to us even greater, let's say, latitude to operate. 
So I see in the future where we've always wanted to get. But when it comes to remote inspections versus on-site inspections, when it comes to more integration versus less integration, look I think this is the new reality. It is proven. It is creating value. And I think that this very terrible crisis that we went through, in some cases, probably accelerated some of this adaption (sic) adaptation and adoption by the industry, I would argue by, maybe, as much as 5 years. 
And I think -- I do think it's here to stay. I don't think it will revert. We are talking to clients very seriously now about how they're going to operate their major projects going forward, both in Technip Energies as well as in Subsea. And I think you'll find our company playing a much more prominent role than we have historically."
