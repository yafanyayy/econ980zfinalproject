In 2019, Live Nation delivered its ninth consecutive year of growth, with revenue up 7% and AOI up 14%. Starting with the core of our business, our concert fan count was up 5 million to 98 million globally, driving AOI growth in all of our divisions, concerts, sponsorship and ticketing, demonstrating the effectiveness of our flywheel business model. In our concert segment, fans continue to find the live experience, from club shows to arenas to festivals, a top entertainment choice, and the best way to celebrate their favorite artists and share the experience with other fans. In the U.S., over the past 5 years, consumer spend on live entertainment has grown 7% annually, providing strong structural tailwinds to drive increased demand for concerts globally. With these demand dynamics in 2019, we delivered growth in concerts revenue of 8% and AOI of 7%. This growth was broad-based across our portfolio, with international fan count up 11%, while in North America, arenas, festivals, theaters and clubs contributed to our growth. Globally, festivals, theaters and club attendance were up double digits, highlighting the strength of our global footprint and the value of a diversified portfolio of markets, genres and building types that have enabled our consistent growth over the past several years. And across all of the artists we work with, we invested well over $6 billion to promote 40,000 shows in 42 countries, with Live Nation, by far, the largest financial supporter of artists in music. 
Average ticket prices for our amphitheater and arena shows are up double digits since 2017, while sales of dynamically priced platinum tickets are up 66% for the year across 3,000 shows. As artists want more of the best seats in the house sold at face value at the on sale. Even with these increases, concerts remain a great deal for fans relative to other live experiences. Our average ticket price for concerts at any 1 of our ampitheaters was $46 in 2019 relative to a $75 NBA game, over $100 for an NFL game. Once at the show, average per fan spending grew as well. At our amphitheaters, spending grew by $2.50 and to over $29 per head as we improved our product offering, reduce friction with shorter lines and improved VIP hospitality offerings. The hospitality focus also grew on-site spending at our festivals, theaters and clubs, the result of a better experience for our fans across our operated venues. We added 38 new venues in 2019, including 6 new festivals and 18 new theaters and clubs. As we have gotten better at on-site hospitality over the past several years. This opens up more opportunity for us to operate more buildings where we make more money for fan, which accelerates the on-site monetization part of our flywheel. The strength of our business is continuing with concert tickets sold through mid-February for 2020 shows, up 10% to $38 million in a pipeline of 4,700 confirmed arena stadium and amphitheater shows, up 30% from the same time last year. All venue types have strong show count growth led by North America stadium and arena concerts. 
In our high-margin sponsorship business, we grew revenue by 17% and AOI by 16% in 2019. [indiscernible] was key driver in the year, up double digits globally, with broad growth across amplifiers, festivals, theaters and clubs. Festivals had a particularly strong year with the addition of Rock and Rio to our portfolio of marquee festivals, sponsorship in this segment was up over 50%. Our top strategic sponsors have also been a key driver of our sponsorship segment, with 88 sponsors collectively spending approximately $400 million to reach our fans, and revenue from this group, up 19% in the year. In 2019, we broadened our brand partnership base by leveraging our Power of Live research, with particular success in the lifestyle space, working with brands, including Revlon, Bonds and Clinique, as we demonstrated the importance of their products to concertgoers. All this reinforces the power of our platform of 98 million fans and the priority of brands to reach fans during the live experience. With over 70% of budgeted sponsorship net revenue for the year committed, and despite 2020 being an off year for Rock in Rio in Brazil, we are confident we will deliver continued growth in our sponsorship segment this year. 
Ticketmaster further built its leadership position in ticketing in 2019, growing AOI by 11%. Most of our growth came through reduced customer acquisition costs across both primary and secondary ticketing, and from secondary ticketing volume, notably the NFL and other sporting events. Our international ticketing business drove our growth in fee-bearing tickets and GTB, led by our strong international concert ticket sales. We now provide services in 31 countries, and in 2019, delivered 115 million tickets internationally, with tremendous opportunity for continued growth on a global basis, particularly in the 15 markets where we promote concerts and don't yet have a substantial ticketing operation. Ticketmaster's recent entry into both Taiwan and Singapore markets highlights its international expansion opportunity, leveraging our leading concert positions in these markets and now growing our ticketing presence to 7 countries in Asia as we continue to build our flywheel across more of these markets. In North America, our top priority in 2019 was deploying Presence, our secured ticketing digital product, which we see as key in differentiating Ticketmaster, and providing venues, teams and artists with the information and tools to maximize the fan relationships. Presence was deployed in over 700 venues by the end of 2019, including over 90% of major sports and Live Nation buildings, operating 50,000 events for over 120 million fans, more than half of whom use digital ticketings for entry. We see our deployment in 2020 further accelerating, and we are planning to have presence in over 1,300 venues by the end of the year, with over 200 million fans attending events at these buildings. At that point, we will cover 100% of major sports and live nation buildings, and 90% of all fans in North American Ticketmaster venues, making Ticketmaster by far the global leader in digital ticketing. 
Artist-driven initiatives, such as ticketing Pearl Jam's entire tour with safety enabled their strategy of getting tickets into the hands of the greatest fans is one demonstration of how digital ticketing is serving content more effectively. At the same time, we continue to scale our global ticketing marketplace, with the fourth quarter being our second highest fee-bearing GTV quarter ever, selling over 60 million fee-bearing tickets and delivering over 5 billion in fee-bearing GTV. Ticketmaster continues to lead the ticket in the industry, both operationally and in digital ticketing. Looking at 2020, I'm confident in Ticketmaster's ability to extend that leadership position globally as we add more customers, ticket more events and expand our digital ticketing platform. 
In summary, 2019 was another strong year for Live Nation, building our global concert business and driving growth in our high-margin venue, sponsorship and ticketing business. 
Looking at 2020, our double-digit fan and show count growth so far this year against the backdrop of very high artist activity across all venue types and markets sets up our flywheel to deliver another year of strong global growth. 
With this, I will turn the call over to Joe to take you through additional details."

As Michael indicated, fan attendance grew 5% to 98 million fans, demonstrating the strength of our global portfolio. And with this demand growth, highlighting the strong fundamentals underlying our business. Geographically, international had a strong year with growth in stadiums, festivals and theaters and clubs, driving 11% fan growth. Theaters and clubs globally led band growth for the year with 20% growth to nearly 30 million fans. Festivals also had a strong year with 7 new [indiscernible] polls, including Rock in Rio, helping deliver 13% fan growth globally. Our fan attendance is up from 47 million in 2010, closing out a decade by more than doubling our fan base. The key milestone that demonstrates the consistent and resilient growth at the core of our flywheel, creating significant scale over time. 
Looking specifically at the fourth quarter, while attendance and show count were up, our AOI was lower, heavily driven by an increase in advertising expense related to 2020 shows, an increased fixed expense associated with continuing to build our flywheel and operate more venues. Without this higher-than-projected advertising expense from putting more 2020 shows on sale in 2019, concerts' AOI for the year would have been up double digits. 
Moving on to sponsorship. In 2019, we again delivered double-digit AOI growth, up 16% for the year. International drill over 70% of this growth, with the addition of Rock in Rio, helping drive both international and festival sponsorship growth. For the fourth quarter, revenue was up 25%, and AOI was up 26%, with growth helped by the second weekend of Rock in Rio, Brazil. Our pipeline for 2020 is in good shape, demonstrating the strength of our concerts flywheel and driving all parts of the business, and we expect to continue growing our sponsorship AOI despite not having Rock in Rio, Brazil this year. 
Finally, Ticketmaster. Global GTV was flat in the quarter, matching 2018's record fourth quarter, while fee-bearing GTV was down 2%. North America fee-bearing GTV was flat for the quarter, while international was down 8%, reflecting the geographic shift in 2020 stadiums versus last year. This volume was up relative to our expectations for the quarter, reflecting both the timing shift and an even stronger 2020 pipeline of concerts than was previously projected. 
For the fourth quarter, Ticketmaster AOI was up 23% due to a 9% increase in secondary GTV, reduced customer acquisition costs and the benefit from comping against last year's costs related to a third-party data breach. These same factors then drove our margin improvement for the quarter. 
Looking at 2020, we expect a strong concert slate will drive Ticketmaster's GTV, including a strong Q1 when we'll have most of our stadium and arena on sales. 
A few more points. The coronavirus has had a lot of press lately, so I wanted to give some context for us. First, as it relates to the China and Asia shows generally, show cancellations have been minimal, given our activity levels in China, with 17 shows totaling approximately 75,000 fans. Looking over the next 3 months, our Asia activity is limited with 70 shows and 200,000 fans in the region. Second, as it relates to Italy. We have 30 shows booked over the next 3 months, with approximately 125,000 fans. Collectively, this accounts for less than 0.5% of our 100 million-plus fans we expect to attend our shows this year. More broadly, while we expect that there will be further areas of breakout over the next few months, one of our strengths is that we are highly diversified geographically. Thus far, we have seen no pullback in fan demand or ticket buying outside of the specifically affected areas. And overall, our attendance is weighted toward the latter part of this year with over 70% of our attendance expected from June through the end of the year. 
Finally, on the Assess acquisition, we continue to make progress working with the regulators in Mexico on their review, and at this point, we expect the acquisition to close sometime in the second quarter. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Kathy to go through more on our financial results."

Our key highlights for the fourth quarter of 2019 are: revenue increased by 11% to $2.9 billion; AOI was $81 million, up 18%; as of December 31, our deferred revenue related to future shows was up 10% to $1.2 billion compared to $1.1 billion last year; concerts was the primary driver of revenue growth as it increased 12% for more fans and shows; sponsorship revenue was up 25%, as we benefited from the second weekend of Rock in Rio, Brazil; and ticketing revenue grew 2% as a result of higher secondary ticket volume; AOI was up 18%, driven by growth in sponsorship due to the 4 days of Rock in Rio, and improved resale volume and lower operating cost in ticketing; concerts AOI declined from higher advertising expense for 2020 shows, and increased headcount and rent, primarily related to additional venues. As we've noted before, we recognize all show related advertising for future shows at the end of the year, so the higher volume of on sales for 2020 shows increases our year-end expenses. Operating loss for the quarter was $83 million compared to a loss of $90 million in the prior year as a result of the higher AOI. Net loss for the quarter was $160 million compared to a net loss of $148 million in the prior year, driven mainly by higher interest, taxes and noncontrolling interest expense. For full year 2019, revenue was $11.5 billion, a 7% increase over 2018. AOI was $943 million, up 14%. And free cash flow adjusted was $499 million, up 4% over last year, representing 53% of AOI due to the timing of distributions to NCI partners. 
Revenue growth was primarily driven by concerts, which was up 8% as we saw attendance growth across North America arenas, international stadiums and festivals and theaters and clubs globally. Sponsorship revenue was also strong with 17% growth, driven by Rock in Rio, high demand for our venue on-site sponsorship programs and growth from the number of our strategic sponsors and related spend. All of our segments contributed to our AOI growth. Concerts AOI was up 7%, as we grew our fan base and number of shows across arenas, theaters and clubs and festival, along with improved fan on-site spend at our amphitheaters, festivals and theaters and clubs. Sponsorship AOI grew by 16%. In ticketing, our largest AOI contributor grew 11% from higher revenue and lower operating costs. Operating income was $325 million, up 19% over last year, driven by the increase in AOI. Our net income for the full year was $70 million compared to $60 million in 2018 due to our improved operating results. Net loss per share was $0.02 after $75 million in accretion of redeemable noncontrolling interest. For 2019, we saw a 2% FX impact on both revenue and AOI. 
Turning to our balance sheet. As of December 31, we had total cash of $2.5 billion, including $838 million in ticketing client cash and $936 million in net concert event-related cash, [indiscernible] free cash of $697 million. Net cash provided by operating activities was $470 million compared to $942 million last year due to the timing of payables and ticket sales versus the prior year. Free cash flow adjusted was $499 million compared to $481 million last year. Our total capital expenditures were $316 million, 52% of which was spent on revenue-generating items. Our total net debt as of December 2019 after our refinancing in October was $3.3 billion, with a weighted average cost of 4.2%. Our current expectations for 2020 include: in concert, we expect most of the AOI growth to come in Q3, with some in Q2 and our seasonally quieter Q1 having a bit less activity than last year; in sponsorship, while we expect growth for the year, the Rock in Rio, Brazil biennial Festival will not occur in 2020; in ticketing, we currently expect the strong concert slate to drive growth in GTB with higher on sale activity, particularly in Q1. It is too early in the year for us to predict FX impact for 2020. We will provide guidance in future calls as the year developed. All of our guidance is currently in a constant currency to 2019. We expect our total capital expenditures to be approximately $375 million, with the increase largely driven by revenue-generating expenditures. And we currently expect accretion in noncontrolling interest to be approximately $55 million for 2020, with about half that in the first quarter, and the rest fairly evenly distributed across the remaining quarters.

I know you guys buy many tours outright, I think you pay artists, what, $8 billion per year. Are you left holding the bag if shows are canceled?

So we're not talking to any artist here. They're saying they don't want to be touring at all. Exactly where can I go when? So it's just talking about timing. Absolutely, as we look at very specific hotspot, there is certainly flexibility to reroute as need be or to help them come back and hit that area later as opposed to when it was previously planned. In general, we pay the artist when the show occurs. There's generally force majeure clauses if for some reason to show were to be canceled, we wouldn't have to pay the artist but again, we think that, that's going to be pretty limited, where we don't have some ability to either reroute or reschedule."

As an artist says, if we cancel a show next month in Milan, we don't pay the artist. There's no cost incurred and when the artist replace that show then we pay the artist. So these ones are actually the easier ones to manage. I mean, the ones that you always have the more challenge is when the festival gets canceled on the Saturday afternoon when 60,000 people are sitting there. That's when you have some marketing and some costs where it may affect you. When you have a month, 2 months, anytime you cancel in advance, there's actually no cost incurred yet. The artist isn't at the show, the people aren't in the venue, you haven't paid the cost. So this is -- the easiest economic challenge for us is to reroute and reschedule a show, no cost to us. As Joe said, the good news is, on the supply-demand, the show is not going away, it's just moving to a different quarter. The artist will tour whether they have to jump off this quarter and go in the fall or '21, we won't net lose the business. And the other demand part that we're just really impressed with, because we always talk about the resilience of the concert fan is, as of last night, we had a sellout in Australia on a festival that went up. The business is real strong. The consumer still seems to be buying the tickets on a global basis. So supply-demand will be there. We're going to take this cautiously as we watch the market and we assume a hotspot will flare up and a show will be canceled here and there. But we're confident, long term, the show will happen, the revenue will flow, and the fan will show up. On a macro -- micro 2020, as I think Joe mentioned, most of our business doesn't start until the middle of June onward. So the next few months, we'll have some cancellations. I assume here and there and some arenas and clubs. But the heart of our business happens this summer, and we're optimistic, we hope that it can be handled and the summer months bring us some relief and more business as usual. But right now, we're being cautious. We're looking at all markets, doing the right thing for the artist. We're playing along with the great demand of this industry."

As it ended up, this transaction got put with a different team in a different department, so we had to start a little bit more at the basics in terms of the industry. So we weren't able to shortcut it as much as we thought. There's nothing that, at this point, based on most recent discussions that give us great concern, just taking a bit longer. In terms of the transaction, look, our view is simply that we focus on building a great business at Ticketmaster and throughout all of our different pieces. It's up to you guys in the market, specifically, value them. We're building this for long-term value for our shareholders, up and down the flywheel, and we expect that we'll be successful in doing that."

In 2019, Live Nation delivered its ninth consecutive year of growth with revenue up 7% and AOI up 14%. 
Starting with the core of our business. Our concert fan count was up 5 million to 98 million globally, driving AOI growth in all of our divisions: concerts, sponsorship and ticketing, demonstrating the effectiveness of our flywheel business model. In our concert segment, fans continue to find the live experience, from club shows to arenas to festivals, a top entertainment choice and the best way to celebrate their favorite artists and share the experience with other fans. In the U.S., over the past 5 years, consumer spend on live entertainment has grown 7% annually, providing strong structural tailwinds to drive increased demand for concerts globally. 
With these demand dynamics, in 2019, we delivered growth in concerts revenue of 8% and AOI of 7%. This growth was broad-based across our portfolio, with international fan count up 11%, while in North America, arenas, festivals, theaters and clubs contributed to our growth. Globally, festivals, theaters and club attendance were up double digits, highlighting the strength of our global footprint and the value of a diversified portfolio of markets, genres and building types that have enabled our consistent growth over the past several years. And across all of the artists we work with, we invested well over $6 billion to promote 40,000 shows in 42 countries, with Live Nation by far the largest financial supporter of artists in music. 
Average ticket prices for our amphitheater and arena shows are up double digits since 2017 while sales of dynamically priced Platinum tickets are up 66% for the year across 3,000 shows as artists want more of the best seats in the house sold at face value at the onsale. Even with these increases, concerts remain a great deal for fans relative to other live experiences. Our average ticket price for a concert at any one of our amphitheaters was $46 in 2019 relative to a $75 NBA game, over $100 for an NFL game. 
Once at the show, average per fan spending grew as well. At our amphitheaters, spending grew by $2.50 to over $29 per head as we improved our product offering, reduced friction with shorter lines and improved VIP hospitality offerings. The hospitality focus also grew on-site spending at our festivals, theaters and clubs, the result of a better experience for our fans across our operated venues. 
We added 38 new venues in 2019, including 6 new festivals and 18 new theaters and clubs. As we have gotten better at on-site hospitality over the past several years, this opens up more opportunity for us to operate more buildings where we make more money per fan, which accelerates the on-site monetization part of our flywheel. 
The strength of our business is continuing with concert tickets sold through mid-February for 2020 shows up 10% to 38 million and a pipeline of 4,700 confirmed arena, stadium and amphitheater shows, up 30% from the same time last year. All venue types have strong show count growth led by North America stadium and arena concerts. 
In our high-margin sponsorship business, we grew revenue by 17% and AOI by 16% in 2019. Venue sponsorship was a key driver in the year, up double digits globally, with broad growth across amphitheaters, festivals, theaters and clubs. 
Festivals had a particularly strong year. With the addition of Rock and Rio to our portfolio of marquee festivals, sponsorship in this segment was up over 50%. Our top strategic sponsors have also been a key driver of our sponsorship segment, with 88 sponsors collectively spending approximately $400 million to reach our fans and revenue from this group up 19% in the year. 
In 2019, we broadened our brand partnership base by leveraging our Power of Live research, with particular success in the lifestyle space working with brands including Revlon, Vans and Clinique as we demonstrated the importance of their products to concertgoers. 
All this reinforces the power of our platform of 98 million fans and the priority of brands to reach fans during the live experience. With over 70% of budgeted sponsorship net revenue for the year committed and despite 2020 being an off year for Rock in Rio in Brazil, we are confident we will deliver continued growth in our sponsorship segment this year. 
Ticketmaster further built its leadership position in ticketing in 2019, growing AOI by 11%. Most of our growth came through reduced customer acquisition costs across both primary and secondary ticketing and from secondary ticketing volume, notably the NFL and other sporting events. 
Our international ticketing business drove our growth in fee-bearing tickets and GTV, led by our strong international concert ticket sales. We now provide services in 31 countries and, in 2019, delivered 115 million tickets internationally, with tremendous opportunity for continued growth on a global basis, particularly in the 15 markets where we promote concerts and don't yet have a substantial ticketing operation. Ticketmaster's recent entry into both the Taiwan and Singapore markets highlights this international expansion opportunity, leveraging our leading concert positions in these markets and now growing our ticketing presence to 7 countries in Asia as we continue to build our flywheel across more of these markets. 
In North America, our top priority in 2019 was deploying Presence, our secure ticketing digital product, which we see as key in differentiating Ticketmaster and providing venues, teams and artists with the information and tools to maximize the fan relationships. Presence was deployed in over 700 venues by the end of 2019, including over 90% of major sports and Live Nation buildings, operating 50,000 events for over 120 million fans, more than half of whom used digital ticketings for entry. We see our deployment in 2020 further accelerating, and we are planning to have Presence in over 1,300 venues by the end of the year, with over 200 million fans attending events at these buildings. At that point, we will cover 100% of major sports and Live Nation buildings and 90% of all fans in North American Ticketmaster venues, making Ticketmaster by far the global leader in digital ticketing. 
Artist-driven initiatives, such as ticketing Pearl Jam's entire tour with SafeTix, enabling their strategy of getting tickets into the hands of their greatest fans, is one demonstration of how digital ticketing is serving content more effectively. At the same time, we continue to scale our global ticketing marketplace with the fourth quarter being our second highest fee-bearing GTV quarter ever, selling over 60 million fee-bearing tickets and delivering over $5 billion in fee-bearing GTV. 
Ticketmaster continues to lead the ticketing industry both operationally and in digital ticketing. Looking at 2020, I'm confident in Ticketmaster's ability to extend that leadership position globally as we add more customers, ticket more events and expand our digital ticketing platform. 
In summary, 2019 was another strong year for Live Nation, building our global concert business and driving growth in our high-margin venue, sponsorship and ticketing business. 
Looking at 2020, our double-digit fan and show count growth so far this year against the backdrop of very high artist activity across all venue types and markets sets up our flywheel to deliver another year of strong global growth. 
With this, I will turn the call over to Joe to take you through additional details."
384687,654652258,1924580,"Live Nation Entertainment, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Feb 27, 2020",2020-02-27,"Earnings Calls","Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Michael.

Looking at our business segments, first, concerts. As Michael indicated, fan attendance grew 5% to 98 million fans, demonstrating the strength of our global portfolio and, with this demand growth, highlighting the strong fundamentals underlying our business. Geographically, international had a strong year, with growth in stadiums, festivals and theaters and clubs driving 11% fan growth. Theaters and clubs globally led fan growth for the year with 20% growth to nearly 30 million fans. Festivals also had a strong year with 7 new festivals, including Rock in Rio, helping deliver 13% fan growth globally. Our fan attendance is up from 47 million in 2010, closing out the decade by more than doubling our fan base, a key milestone that demonstrates the consistent and resilient growth at the core of our flywheel, creating significant scale over time. 
Looking specifically at the fourth quarter. While attendance and show count were up, our AOI was lower heavily driven by an increase in advertising expense related to 2020 shows and increased fixed expense associated with continuing to build our flywheel and operate more venues. Without this higher-than-projected advertising expense from putting more 2020 shows on sale in 2019, concerts AOI for the year would have been up double digits. 
Moving on to sponsorship. In 2019, we again delivered double-digit AOI growth, up 16% for the year. International drove over 70% of this growth, with the addition of Rock in Rio helping drive both international and festival sponsorship growth. For the fourth quarter, revenue was up 25%, and AOI was up 26%, with growth helped by the second weekend of Rock in Rio Brazil. Our pipeline for 2020 is in good shape, demonstrating the strength of our concerts flywheel and driving all parts of the business. And we expect to continue growing our sponsorship AOI despite not having Rock in Rio Brazil this year. 
Finally, Ticketmaster. Global GTV was flat in the quarter, matching 2018's record fourth quarter, while fee-bearing GTV was down 2%. North America fee-bearing GTV was flat for the quarter, while international was down 8%, reflecting the geographic shift in 2020 stadiums versus last year. This volume was up relative to our expectations for the quarter, reflecting both a timing shift and an even stronger 2020 pipeline of concerts than was previously projected. 
For the fourth quarter, Ticketmaster AOI was up 23% due to a 9% increase in secondary GTV, reduced customer acquisition costs and the benefit from comping against last year's costs related to a third-party data breach. These same factors then drove our margin improvement for the quarter. Looking at 2020, we expect a strong concert slate will drive Ticketmaster's GTV, including a strong Q1 when we'll have most of our stadium and arena onsales. 
A few more points. The coronavirus has had a lot of press lately, so I wanted to give some context for us. First, as it relates to China and Asia shows generally, show cancellations have been minimal given our activity levels in China, with 17 shows totaling approximately 75,000 fans. Looking over the next 3 months, our Asia activity is limited, with 70 shows and 200,000 fans in the region. 
Second, as it relates to Italy, we have 30 shows booked over the next 3 months with approximately 125,000 fans. Collectively, this accounts for less than 0.5% of our 100 million-plus fans we expect to attend our shows this year. More broadly, while we expect that there will be further areas of breakout over the next few months, one of our strengths is that we are highly diversified geographically. Thus far, we have seen no pullback in fan demand or ticket buying outside of the specifically affected areas. And overall, our attendance is weighted toward the latter part of this year with over 70% of our attendance expected from June through the end of the year. 
Finally, on the OCESA acquisition, we continue to make progress working with the regulators in Mexico on their review. And at this point, we expect the acquisition to close sometime in the second quarter. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Kathy to go through more on our financial results."

Our key highlights for the fourth quarter of 2019 are revenue increased by 11% to $2.9 billion. AOI was $81 million, up 18%. As of December 31, our deferred revenue related to future shows was up 10% to $1.2 billion compared to $1.1 billion last year. Concerts was the primary driver of revenue growth as it increased 12% for more fans and shows. Sponsorship revenue was up 25% as we benefited from the second weekend of Rock in Rio Brazil. And ticketing revenue grew 2% as a result of higher secondary ticket volume. AOI was up 18% driven by growth in sponsorship due to the 4 days of Rock in Rio, an improved resale volume and lower operating costs in ticketing. Concerts AOI declined from higher advertising expense for 2020 shows and increased headcount and rent primarily related to additional venues. As we've noted before, we recognize all show-related advertising for future shows at the end of the year, so the higher volume of onsales for 2020 shows increases our year-end expenses. Operating loss for the quarter was $83 million compared to a loss of $90 million in the prior year as a result of the higher AOI. Net loss for the quarter was $160 million compared to a net loss of $148 million in the prior year, driven mainly by higher interest, taxes and noncontrolling interest expense. 
For full year 2019, revenue was $11.5 billion, a 7% increase over 2018. AOI was $943 million, up 14%. And free cash flow adjusted was $499 million, up 4% over last year, representing 53% of AOI due to the timing of distributions to NCI partners. Revenue growth was primarily driven by concerts, which was up 8% as we saw attendance growth across North America arenas, international stadiums and festivals and theaters and clubs globally. Sponsorship revenue was also strong with 17% growth driven by Rock in Rio, high demand for our venue on-site sponsorship programs and growth in the number of our strategic sponsors and related spend. 
All of our segments contributed to our AOI growth. Concerts AOI was up 7% as we grew our fan base and number of shows across arenas, theaters and clubs and festivals along with improved fan on-site spend at our amphitheaters, festivals and theaters and clubs. Sponsorship AOI grew by 16%. And ticketing, our largest AOI contributor, grew 11% from higher revenue and lower operating costs. 
Operating income was $325 million, up 19% over last year driven by the increase in AOI. Our net income for the full year was $70 million compared to $60 million in 2018 due to our improved operating results. Net loss per share was $0.02 after $75 million in accretion of redeemable noncontrolling interests. For 2019, we saw a 2% FX impact on both revenue and AOI. 
Turning to our balance sheet. As of December 31, we had total cash of $2.5 billion, including $838 million in ticketing client cash and $936 million in net concert event-related cash, leaving free cash of $697 million. Net cash provided by operating activities was $470 million compared to $942 million last year due to the timing of payables and ticket sales versus the prior year. Free cash flow adjusted was $499 million compared to $481 million last year. Our total capital expenditures were $316 million, 52% of which was spent on revenue-generating items. Our total net debt as of December 2019 after our refinancing in October was $3.3 billion with a weighted average cost of 4.2%. 
Our current expectations for 2020 include, in concerts, we expect most of the AOI growth to come in Q3, with some in Q2 and our seasonally quieter Q1 having a bit less activity than last year. In sponsorship, while we expect growth for the year, the Rock in Rio Brazil biennial festival will not occur in 2020. In ticketing, we currently expect the strong concert slate to drive growth in GTV with higher onsale activity particularly in Q1. It is too early in the year for us to predict FX impact for 2020. We will provide guidance in future calls as the year develops. All of our guidance is currently in a constant currency to 2019. We expect our total capital expenditures to be approximately $375 million with the increase largely driven by revenue-generating expenditures. And we currently expect accretion of noncontrolling interests to be approximately $55 million for 2020, with about half that in the first quarter and the rest fairly evenly distributed across the remaining quarters.

I think the first thing, just to put it in the right context, is to your latter point, anything that is being talked about is generally being talked about just in terms of timing. It's not being talked about not doing the shows. As we've long discussed, artists see the touring as the fundamental part of what they do and how they earn their living. So they're -- we're not talking to any artists that are saying they don't want to be touring at all. Exactly where can I go when? So it's just talking about timing. Absolutely, as we look at very specific hotspots, there is certainly flexibility to reroute as need be or to help them come back and hit that area later as opposed to when it was previously planned. 
In general, we pay the artist when the show occurs. There's generally force majeure clauses. If for some reason, a show were to be canceled, we wouldn't have to pay the artist. But again, we think that that's going to be pretty limited where we don't have some ability to either reroute or reschedule."

If an artist says -- if we cancel a show next month in Milan, we don't pay the artist. There's no cost incurred. And when the artist replays that show, then we pay the artist. 
So these ones are actually the easier ones to manage. I mean the ones that you always have the more challenge is when the festival gets canceled on a Saturday afternoon when 60,000 people are sitting there. That's when you have some marketing and some sunk costs where it may affect you. When you have a month, 2 months, anytime you cancel in advance, there's actually no cost incurred yet. The artist isn't at the show, the people aren't in the venue, you haven't paid the cost. So this is -- the easiest economic challenge for us is to reroute and reschedule a show, no cost to us. 
As Joe said, the good news is, on the supply-demand, the show is not going away; it's just moving to a different quarter. The artist will tour whether they have to jump off this quarter and go into fall or '21. We won't net lose the business. And the other demand part that we're just really impressed with, because we always talk about the resilience of the concert fan is, as of last night, we had a sellout in Australia on a festival that went up. The business is real strong. The consumer still seems to be buying the tickets on a global basis. So supply-demand will be there. We're going to take this cautiously as we watch the markets and we assume a hotspot will flare up and a show will be canceled here and there. But we're confident long term, the show will happen, the revenue will flow, and the fan will show up. 
On a macro -- on a micro 2020, as I think Joe mentioned, most of our business doesn't start until the middle of June onward. So the next few months, we'll have some cancellations, I assume here and there in some arenas and clubs. But the heart of our business happens in the summer. And we're optimistic, we hope that it can be handled and the summer months bring us some relief and we'll -- business as usual. But right now, we're being cautious. We're looking at all markets, doing the right thing for the artist. We're playing along with the great demand of this industry."

Again, going back to our first point, as long as we're going to deliver net, over the next 2 years, the same amount of shows, the growth, the tickets that we've kind of delivered for that sponsorship commitment, then we see no pullback at all in the long-term sponsor.

In 2019, Live Nation delivered its ninth consecutive year of growth with revenue up 7% and AOI up 14%. 
Starting with the core of our business. Our concert fan count was up 5 million to 98 million globally, driving AOI growth in all of our divisions: concerts, sponsorship and ticketing, demonstrating the effectiveness of our flywheel business model. In our concert segment, fans continue to find the live experience, from club shows to arenas to festivals, a top entertainment choice and the best way to celebrate their favorite artists and share the experience with other fans. In the U.S., over the past 5 years, consumer spend on live entertainment has grown 7% annually, providing strong structural tailwinds to drive increased demand for concerts globally. 
With these demand dynamics, in 2019, we delivered growth in concerts revenue of 8% and AOI of 7%. This growth was broad-based across our portfolio, with international fan count up 11%, while in North America, arenas, festivals, theaters and clubs contributed to our growth. Globally, festivals, theaters and club attendance were up double digits, highlighting the strength of our global footprint and the value of a diversified portfolio of markets, genres and building types that have enabled our consistent growth over the past several years. And across all of the artists we work with, we invested well over $6 billion to promote 40,000 shows in 42 countries, with Live Nation by far the largest financial supporter of artists in music. 
Average ticket prices for our amphitheater and arena shows are up double digits since 2017 while sales of dynamically priced Platinum tickets are up 66% for the year across 3,000 shows as artists want more of the best seats in the house sold at face value at the onsale. Even with these increases, concerts remain a great deal for fans relative to other live experiences. Our average ticket price for a concert at any one of our amphitheaters was $46 in 2019 relative to a $75 NBA game, over $100 for an NFL game. 
Once at the show, average per fan spending grew as well. At our amphitheaters, spending grew by $2.50 to over $29 per head as we improved our product offering, reduced friction with shorter lines and improved VIP hospitality offerings. The hospitality focus also grew on-site spending at our festivals, theaters and clubs, the result of a better experience for our fans across our operated venues. 
We added 38 new venues in 2019, including 6 new festivals and 18 new theaters and clubs. As we have gotten better at on-site hospitality over the past several years, this opens up more opportunity for us to operate more buildings where we make more money per fan, which accelerates the on-site monetization part of our flywheel. 
The strength of our business is continuing with concert tickets sold through mid-February for 2020 shows up 10% to 38 million and a pipeline of 4,700 confirmed arena, stadium and amphitheater shows, up 30% from the same time last year. All venue types have strong show count growth led by North America stadium and arena concerts. 
In our high-margin sponsorship business, we grew revenue by 17% and AOI by 16% in 2019. Venue sponsorship was a key driver in the year, up double digits globally, with broad growth across amphitheaters, festivals, theaters and clubs. 
Festivals had a particularly strong year. With the addition of Rock and Rio to our portfolio of marquee festivals, sponsorship in this segment was up over 50%. Our top strategic sponsors have also been a key driver of our sponsorship segment, with 88 sponsors collectively spending approximately $400 million to reach our fans and revenue from this group up 19% in the year. 
In 2019, we broadened our brand partnership base by leveraging our Power of Live research, with particular success in the lifestyle space working with brands including Revlon, Vans and Clinique as we demonstrated the importance of their products to concertgoers. 
All this reinforces the power of our platform of 98 million fans and the priority of brands to reach fans during the live experience. With over 70% of budgeted sponsorship net revenue for the year committed and despite 2020 being an off year for Rock in Rio in Brazil, we are confident we will deliver continued growth in our sponsorship segment this year. 
Ticketmaster further built its leadership position in ticketing in 2019, growing AOI by 11%. Most of our growth came through reduced customer acquisition costs across both primary and secondary ticketing and from secondary ticketing volume, notably the NFL and other sporting events. 
Our international ticketing business drove our growth in fee-bearing tickets and GTV, led by our strong international concert ticket sales. We now provide services in 31 countries and, in 2019, delivered 115 million tickets internationally, with tremendous opportunity for continued growth on a global basis, particularly in the 15 markets where we promote concerts and don't yet have a substantial ticketing operation. Ticketmaster's recent entry into both the Taiwan and Singapore markets highlights this international expansion opportunity, leveraging our leading concert positions in these markets and now growing our ticketing presence to 7 countries in Asia as we continue to build our flywheel across more of these markets. 
In North America, our top priority in 2019 was deploying Presence, our secure ticketing digital product, which we see as key in differentiating Ticketmaster and providing venues, teams and artists with the information and tools to maximize the fan relationships. Presence was deployed in over 700 venues by the end of 2019, including over 90% of major sports and Live Nation buildings, operating 50,000 events for over 120 million fans, more than half of whom used digital ticketings for entry. We see our deployment in 2020 further accelerating, and we are planning to have Presence in over 1,300 venues by the end of the year, with over 200 million fans attending events at these buildings. At that point, we will cover 100% of major sports and Live Nation buildings and 90% of all fans in North American Ticketmaster venues, making Ticketmaster by far the global leader in digital ticketing. 
Artist-driven initiatives, such as ticketing Pearl Jam's entire tour with SafeTix, enabling their strategy of getting tickets into the hands of their greatest fans, is one demonstration of how digital ticketing is serving content more effectively. At the same time, we continue to scale our global ticketing marketplace with the fourth quarter being our second highest fee-bearing GTV quarter ever, selling over 60 million fee-bearing tickets and delivering over $5 billion in fee-bearing GTV. 
Ticketmaster continues to lead the ticketing industry both operationally and in digital ticketing. Looking at 2020, I'm confident in Ticketmaster's ability to extend that leadership position globally as we add more customers, ticket more events and expand our digital ticketing platform. 
In summary, 2019 was another strong year for Live Nation, building our global concert business and driving growth in our high-margin venue, sponsorship and ticketing business. 
Looking at 2020, our double-digit fan and show count growth so far this year against the backdrop of very high artist activity across all venue types and markets sets up our flywheel to deliver another year of strong global growth. 
With this, I will turn the call over to Joe to take you through additional details."
384687,654652258,1932438,"Live Nation Entertainment, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Feb 27, 2020",2020-02-27,"Earnings Calls","Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Michael.

As Michael indicated, fan attendance grew 5% to 98 million fans, demonstrating the strength of our global portfolio and, with this demand growth, highlighting the strong fundamentals unde",695,"Thanks, Michael. Looking at our business segments, first, concerts. As Michael indicated, fan attendance grew 5% to 98 million fans, demonstrating the strength of our global portfolio and, with this demand growth, highlighting the strong fundamentals underlying our business. Geographically, international had a strong year, with growth in stadiums, festivals and theaters and clubs driving 11% fan growth. Theaters and clubs globally led fan growth for the year with 20% growth to nearly 30 million fans. Festivals also had a strong year with 7 new festivals, including Rock in Rio, helping deliver 13% fan growth globally. Our fan attendance is up from 47 million in 2010, closing out the decade by more than doubling our fan base, a key milestone that demonstrates the consistent and resilient growth at the core of our flywheel, creating significant scale over time. 
Looking specifically at the fourth quarter. While attendance and show count were up, our AOI was lower heavily driven by an increase in advertising expense related to 2020 shows and increased fixed expense associated with continuing to build our flywheel and operate more venues. Without this higher-than-projected advertising expense from putting more 2020 shows on sale in 2019, concerts AOI for the year would have been up double digits. 
Moving on to sponsorship. In 2019, we again delivered double-digit AOI growth, up 16% for the year. International drove over 70% of this growth, with the addition of Rock in Rio helping drive both international and festival sponsorship growth. For the fourth quarter, revenue was up 25%, and AOI was up 26%, with growth helped by the second weekend of Rock in Rio Brazil. Our pipeline for 2020 is in good shape, demonstrating the strength of our concerts flywheel and driving all parts of the business. And we expect to continue growing our sponsorship AOI despite not having Rock in Rio Brazil this year. 
Finally, Ticketmaster. Global GTV was flat in the quarter, matching 2018's record fourth quarter, while fee-bearing GTV was down 2%. North America fee-bearing GTV was flat for the quarter, while international was down 8%, reflecting the geographic shift in 2020 stadiums versus last year. This volume was up relative to our expectations for the quarter, reflecting both a timing shift and an even stronger 2020 pipeline of concerts than was previously projected. 
For the fourth quarter, Ticketmaster AOI was up 23% due to a 9% increase in secondary GTV, reduced customer acquisition costs and the benefit from comping against last year's costs related to a third-party data breach. These same factors then drove our margin improvement for the quarter. Looking at 2020, we expect a strong concert slate will drive Ticketmaster's GTV, including a strong Q1 when we'll have most of our stadium and arena onsales. 
A few more points. The coronavirus has had a lot of press lately, so I wanted to give some context for us. First, as it relates to China and Asia shows generally, show cancellations have been minimal given our activity levels in China, with 17 shows totaling approximately 75,000 fans. Looking over the next 3 months, our Asia activity is limited, with 70 shows and 200,000 fans in the region. 
Second, as it relates to Italy, we have 30 shows booked over the next 3 months with approximately 125,000 fans. Collectively, this accounts for less than 0.5% of our 100 million-plus fans we expect to attend our shows this year. More broadly, while we expect that there will be further areas of breakout over the next few months, one of our strengths is that we are highly diversified geographically. Thus far, we have seen no pullback in fan demand or ticket buying outside of the specifically affected areas. And overall, our attendance is weighted toward the latter part of this year with over 70% of our attendance expected from June through the end of the year. 
Finally, on the OCESA acquisition, we continue to make progress working with the regulators in Mexico on their review. And at this point, we expect the acquisition to close sometime in the second quarter. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Kathy to go through more on our financial results."

Our key highlights for the fourth quarter of 2019 are revenue increased by 11% to $2.9 billion. AOI was $81 million, up 18%. As of December 31, our deferred revenue related to future shows was up 10% to $1.2 bill",772,"Thanks, Joe, and good afternoon, everyone. Our key highlights for the fourth quarter of 2019 are revenue increased by 11% to $2.9 billion. AOI was $81 million, up 18%. As of December 31, our deferred revenue related to future shows was up 10% to $1.2 billion compared to $1.1 billion last year. Concerts was the primary driver of revenue growth as it increased 12% for more fans and shows. Sponsorship revenue was up 25% as we benefited from the second weekend of Rock in Rio Brazil. And ticketing revenue grew 2% as a result of higher secondary ticket volume. AOI was up 18% driven by growth in sponsorship due to the 4 days of Rock in Rio, an improved resale volume and lower operating costs in ticketing. Concerts AOI declined from higher advertising expense for 2020 shows and increased head count and rent primarily related to additional venues. As we've noted before, we recognize all show-related advertising for future shows at the end of the year, so the higher volume of onsales for 2020 shows increases our year-end expenses. Operating loss for the quarter was $83 million compared to a loss of $90 million in the prior year as a result of the higher AOI. Net loss for the quarter was $160 million compared to a net loss of $148 million in the prior year, driven mainly by higher interest, taxes and noncontrolling interest expense. 
For full year 2019, revenue was $11.5 billion, a 7% increase over 2018. AOI was $943 million, up 14%. And free cash flow adjusted was $499 million, up 4% over last year, representing 53% of AOI due to the timing of distributions to NCI partners. Revenue growth was primarily driven by concerts, which was up 8% as we saw attendance growth across North America arenas, international stadiums and festivals and theaters and clubs globally. Sponsorship revenue was also strong with 17% growth driven by Rock in Rio, high demand for our venue on-site sponsorship programs and growth in the number of our strategic sponsors and related spend. 
All of our segments contributed to our AOI growth. Concerts AOI was up 7% as we grew our fan base and number of shows across arenas, theaters and clubs and festivals along with improved fan on-site spend at our amphitheaters, festivals and theaters and clubs. Sponsorship AOI grew by 16%. And ticketing, our largest AOI contributor, grew 11% from higher revenue and lower operating costs. 
Operating income was $325 million, up 19% over last year driven by the increase in AOI. Our net income for the full year was $70 million compared to $60 million in 2018 due to our improved operating results. Net loss per share was $0.02 after $75 million in accretion of redeemable noncontrolling interests. For 2019, we saw a 2% FX impact on both revenue and AOI. 
Turning to our balance sheet. As of December 31, we had total cash of $2.5 billion, including $838 million in ticketing client cash and $936 million in net concert event-related cash, leaving free cash of $697 million. Net cash provided by operating activities was $470 million compared to $942 million last year due to the timing of payables and ticket sales versus the prior year. Free cash flow adjusted was $499 million compared to $481 million last year. Our total capital expenditures were $316 million, 52% of which was spent on revenue-generating items. Our total net debt as of December 2019 after our refinancing in October was $3.3 billion with a weighted average cost of 4.2%. 
Our current expectations for 2020 include, in concerts, we expect most of the AOI growth to come in Q3, with some in Q2 and our seasonally quieter Q1 having a bit less activity than last year. In sponsorship, while we expect growth for the year, the Rock in Rio Brazil biennial festival will not occur in 2020. In ticketing, we currently expect the strong concert slate to drive growth in GTV with higher onsale activity particularly in Q1. It is too early in the year for us to predict FX impact for 2020. We will provide guidance in future calls as the year develops. All of our guidance is currently in a constant currency to 2019. We expect our total capital expenditures to be approximately $375 million with the increase largely driven by revenue-generating expenditures. And we currently expect accretion of noncontrolling interests to be approximately $55 million for 2020, with about half that in the first quarter and the rest fairly evenly distributed across the remaining quarters.

To the extent that an individual show is canceled, can you help us understand what the financial impact would be? I know you guys buy many tours outright. I think you pay artists, what, $8 billion per year. Are you left holding the bag if shows are canceled? And then if there are regions that are affected by corona, did you have the flexibility to reroute tours? And finally, you gave really strong leading indicators for '20 obviously shaping up to be a big year without corona.

I think the first thing, just to put it in the right context, is to your latter point, anything that is being talked about is generally being talked about just in terms of timing. It's not being talked about not doing the shows. As we've long discussed, artists see the touring as the fundamental part of what they do and how they earn their living. So they're -- we're not talking to any artists that are saying they don't want to be touring at all. Exactly where can I go when? So it's just talking about timing. Absolutely, as we look at very specific hotspots, there is certainly flexibility to reroute as need be or to help them come back and hit that area later as opposed to when it was previously planned. 
In general, we pay the artist when the show occurs. There's generally force majeure clauses. If for some reason, a show were to be canceled, we wouldn't have to pay the artist. But again, we think that that's going to be pretty limited where we don't have some ability to either reroute or reschedule."

If an artist says -- if we cancel a show next month in Milan, we don't pay the artist. There's no cost incurred. And when the artist replays that show, then we pay the artist. 
So these ones are actually the easier ones to manage. I mean the ones that you always have the more challenge is when the festival gets canceled on a Saturday afternoon when 60,000 people are sitting there. That's when you have some marketing and some sunk costs where it may affect you. When you have a month, 2 months, anytime you cancel in advance, there's actually no cost incurred yet. The artist isn't at the show, the people aren't in the venue, you haven't paid the cost. So this is -- the easiest economic challenge for us is to reroute and reschedule a show, no cost to us. 
As Joe said, the good news is, on the supply-demand, the show is not going away; it's just moving to a different quarter. The artist will tour whether they have to jump off this quarter and go into fall or '21. We won't net lose the business. And the other demand part that we're just really impressed with, because we always talk about the resilience of the concert fan is, as of last night, we had a sellout in Australia on a festival that went up. The business is real strong. The consumer still seems to be buying the tickets on a global basis. So supply-demand will be there. We're going to take this cautiously as we watch the markets and we assume a hotspot will flare up and a show will be canceled here and there. But we're confident long term, the show will happen, the revenue will flow, and the fan will show up. 
On a macro -- on a micro 2020, as I think Joe mentioned, most of our business doesn't start until the middle of June onward. So the next few months, we'll have some cancellations, I assume here and there in some arenas and clubs. But the heart of our business happens in the summer. And we're optimistic, we hope that it can be handled and the summer months bring us some relief and we'll -- business as usual. But right now, we're being cautious. We're looking at all markets, doing the right thing for the artist. We're playing along with the great demand of this industry."

In 2019, Live Nation delivered its ninth consecutive year of growth with revenue up 7% and AOI up 14%. 
Starting with the core of our business. Our concert fan count was up 5 million to 98 million globally, driving AOI growth in all of our divisions: concerts, sponsorship and ticketing, demonstrating the effectiveness of our flywheel business model. In our concert segment, fans continue to find the live experience, from club shows to arenas to festivals, a top entertainment choice and the best way to celebrate their favorite artists and share the experience with other fans. In the U.S., over the past 5 years, consumer spend on live entertainment has grown 7% annually, providing strong structural tailwinds to drive increased demand for concerts globally. 
With these demand dynamics, in 2019, we delivered growth in concerts revenue of 8% and AOI of 7%. This growth was broad-based across our portfolio, with international fan count up 11%, while in North America, arenas, festivals, theaters and clubs contributed to our growth. Globally, festivals, theaters and club attendance were up double digits, highlighting the strength of our global footprint and the value of a diversified portfolio of markets, genres and building types that have enabled our consistent growth over the past several years. And across all of the artists we work with, we invested well over $6 billion to promote 40,000 shows in 42 countries, with Live Nation by far the largest financial supporter of artists in music. 
Average ticket prices for our amphitheater and arena shows are up double digits since 2017 while sales of dynamically priced Platinum tickets are up 66% for the year across 3,000 shows as artists want more of the best seats in the house sold at face value at the onsale. Even with these increases, concerts remain a great deal for fans relative to other live experiences. Our average ticket price for a concert at any one of our amphitheaters was $46 in 2019 relative to a $75 NBA game, over $100 for an NFL game. 
Once at the show, average per fan spending grew as well. At our amphitheaters, spending grew by $2.50 to over $29 per head as we improved our product offering, reduced friction with shorter lines and improved VIP hospitality offerings. The hospitality focus also grew on-site spending at our festivals, theaters and clubs, the result of a better experience for our fans across our operated venues. 
We added 38 new venues in 2019, including 6 new festivals and 18 new theaters and clubs. As we have gotten better at on-site hospitality over the past several years, this opens up more opportunity for us to operate more buildings where we make more money per fan, which accelerates the on-site monetization part of our flywheel. 
The strength of our business is continuing with concert tickets sold through mid-February for 2020 shows up 10% to 38 million and a pipeline of 4,700 confirmed arena, stadium and amphitheater shows, up 30% from the same time last year. All venue types have strong show count growth led by North America stadium and arena concerts. 
In our high-margin sponsorship business, we grew revenue by 17% and AOI by 16% in 2019. Venue sponsorship was a key driver in the year, up double digits globally, with broad growth across amphitheaters, festivals, theaters and clubs. 
Festivals had a particularly strong year. With the addition of Rock and Rio to our portfolio of marquee festivals, sponsorship in this segment was up over 50%. Our top strategic sponsors have also been a key driver of our sponsorship segment, with 88 sponsors collectively spending approximately $400 million to reach our fans and revenue from this group up 19% in the year. 
In 2019, we broadened our brand partnership base by leveraging our Power of Live research, with particular success in the lifestyle space working with brands including Revlon, Vans and Clinique as we demonstrated the importance of their products to concertgoers. 
All this reinforces the power of our platform of 98 million fans and the priority of brands to reach fans during the live experience. With over 70% of budgeted sponsorship net revenue for the year committed and despite 2020 being an off year for Rock in Rio in Brazil, we are confident we will deliver continued growth in our sponsorship segment this year. 
Ticketmaster further built its leadership position in ticketing in 2019, growing AOI by 11%. Most of our growth came through reduced customer acquisition costs across both primary and secondary ticketing and from secondary ticketing volume, notably the NFL and other sporting events. 
Our international ticketing business drove our growth in fee-bearing tickets and GTV, led by our strong international concert ticket sales. We now provide services in 31 countries and, in 2019, delivered 115 million tickets internationally, with tremendous opportunity for continued growth on a global basis, particularly in the 15 markets where we promote concerts and don't yet have a substantial ticketing operation. Ticketmaster's recent entry into both the Taiwan and Singapore markets highlights this international expansion opportunity, leveraging our leading concert positions in these markets and now growing our ticketing presence to 7 countries in Asia as we continue to build our flywheel across more of these markets. 
In North America, our top priority in 2019 was deploying Presence, our secure ticketing digital product, which we see as key in differentiating Ticketmaster and providing venues, teams and artists with the information and tools to maximize the fan relationships. Presence was deployed in over 700 venues by the end of 2019, including over 90% of major sports and Live Nation buildings, operating 50,000 events for over 120 million fans, more than half of whom used digital ticketings for entry. We see our deployment in 2020 further accelerating, and we are planning to have Presence in over 1,300 venues by the end of the year, with over 200 million fans attending events at these buildings. At that point, we will cover 100% of major sports and Live Nation buildings and 90% of all fans in North American Ticketmaster venues, making Ticketmaster by far the global leader in digital ticketing. 
Artist-driven initiatives, such as ticketing Pearl Jam's entire tour with SafeTix, enabling their strategy of getting tickets into the hands of their greatest fans, is one demonstration of how digital ticketing is serving content more effectively. At the same time, we continue to scale our global ticketing marketplace with the fourth quarter being our second highest fee-bearing GTV quarter ever, selling over 60 million fee-bearing tickets and delivering over $5 billion in fee-bearing GTV. 
Ticketmaster continues to lead the ticketing industry both operationally and in digital ticketing. Looking at 2020, I'm confident in Ticketmaster's ability to extend that leadership position globally as we add more customers, ticket more events and expand our digital ticketing platform. 
In summary, 2019 was another strong year for Live Nation, building our global concert business and driving growth in our high-margin venue, sponsorship and ticketing business. 
Looking at 2020, our double-digit fan and show count growth so far this year against the backdrop of very high artist activity across all venue types and markets sets up our flywheel to deliver another year of strong global growth. 
With this, I will turn the call over to Joe to take you through additional details."
384687,654652258,1932834,"Live Nation Entertainment, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Feb 27, 2020",2020-02-27,"Earnings Calls","Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Michael.

Looking at our business segments, first, concerts. As Michael indicated, fan attendance grew 5% to 98 million fans, demonstrating the strength of our global portfolio and, with this demand growth, highlighting the strong fundamentals underlying our business. Geographically, international had a strong year, with growth in stadiums, festivals and theaters and clubs driving 11% fan growth. Theaters and clubs globally led fan growth for the year with 20% growth to nearly 30 million fans. Festivals also had a strong year with 7 new festivals, including Rock in Rio, helping deliver 13% fan growth globally. Our fan attendance is up from 47 million in 2010, closing out the decade by more than doubling our fan base, a key milestone that demonstrates the consistent and resilient growth at the core of our flywheel, creating significant scale over time. 
Looking specifically at the fourth quarter. While attendance and show count were up, our AOI was lower heavily driven by an increase in advertising expense related to 2020 shows and increased fixed expense associated with continuing to build our flywheel and operate more venues. Without this higher-than-projected advertising expense from putting more 2020 shows on sale in 2019, concerts AOI for the year would have been up double digits. 
Moving on to sponsorship. In 2019, we again delivered double-digit AOI growth, up 16% for the year. International drove over 70% of this growth, with the addition of Rock in Rio helping drive both international and festival sponsorship growth. For the fourth quarter, revenue was up 25%, and AOI was up 26%, with growth helped by the second weekend of Rock in Rio Brazil. Our pipeline for 2020 is in good shape, demonstrating the strength of our concerts flywheel and driving all parts of the business. And we expect to continue growing our sponsorship AOI despite not having Rock in Rio Brazil this year. 
Finally, Ticketmaster. Global GTV was flat in the quarter, matching 2018's record fourth quarter, while fee-bearing GTV was down 2%. North America fee-bearing GTV was flat for the quarter, while international was down 8%, reflecting the geographic shift in 2020 stadiums versus last year. This volume was up relative to our expectations for the quarter, reflecting both a timing shift and an even stronger 2020 pipeline of concerts than was previously projected. 
For the fourth quarter, Ticketmaster AOI was up 23% due to a 9% increase in secondary GTV, reduced customer acquisition costs and the benefit from comping against last year's costs related to a third-party data breach. These same factors then drove our margin improvement for the quarter. Looking at 2020, we expect a strong concert slate will drive Ticketmaster's GTV, including a strong Q1 when we'll have most of our stadium and arena onsales. 
A few more points. The coronavirus has had a lot of press lately, so I wanted to give some context for us. First, as it relates to China and Asia shows generally, show cancellations have been minimal given our activity levels in China, with 17 shows totaling approximately 75,000 fans. Looking over the next 3 months, our Asia activity is limited, with 70 shows and 200,000 fans in the region. 
Second, as it relates to Italy, we have 30 shows booked over the next 3 months with approximately 125,000 fans. Collectively, this accounts for less than 0.5% of our 100 million-plus fans we expect to attend our shows this year. More broadly, while we expect that there will be further areas of breakout over the next few months, one of our strengths is that we are highly diversified geographically. Thus far, we have seen no pullback in fan demand or ticket buying outside of the specifically affected areas. And overall, our attendance is weighted toward the latter part of this year with over 70% of our attendance expected from June through the end of the year. 
Finally, on the OCESA acquisition, we continue to make progress working with the regulators in Mexico on their review. And at this point, we expect the acquisition to close sometime in the second quarter. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Kathy to go through more on our financial results."

Our key highlights for the fourth quarter of 2019 are revenue increased by 11% to $2.9 billion. AOI was $81 million, up 18%.

Our key highlights for the fourth quarter of 2019 are revenue increased by 11% to $2.9 billion. AOI was $81 million, up 18%. As of December 31, our deferred revenue related to future shows was up 10% to $1.2 billion compared to $1.1 billion last year. Concerts was the primary driver of revenue growth as it increased 12% for more fans and shows. Sponsorship revenue was up 25% as we benefited from the second weekend of Rock in Rio Brazil. And ticketing revenue grew 2% as a result of higher secondary ticket volume. AOI was up 18% driven by growth in sponsorship due to the 4 days of Rock in Rio, an improved resale volume and lower operating costs in ticketing. Concerts AOI declined from higher advertising expense for 2020 shows and increased head count and rent primarily related to additional venues. As we've noted before, we recognize all show-related advertising for future shows at the end of the year, so the higher volume of onsales for 2020 shows increases our year-end expenses. Operating loss for the quarter was $83 million compared to a loss of $90 million in the prior year as a result of the higher AOI. Net loss for the quarter was $160 million compared to a net loss of $148 million in the prior year, driven mainly by higher interest, taxes and noncontrolling interest expense. 
For full year 2019, revenue was $11.5 billion, a 7% increase over 2018. AOI was $943 million, up 14%. And free cash flow adjusted was $499 million, up 4% over last year, representing 53% of AOI due to the timing of distributions to NCI partners. Revenue growth was primarily driven by concerts, which was up 8% as we saw attendance growth across North America arenas, international stadiums and festivals and theaters and clubs globally. Sponsorship revenue was also strong with 17% growth driven by Rock in Rio, high demand for our venue on-site sponsorship programs and growth in the number of our strategic sponsors and related spend. 
All of our segments contributed to our AOI growth. Concerts AOI was up 7% as we grew our fan base and number of shows across arenas, theaters and clubs and festivals along with improved fan on-site spend at our amphitheaters, festivals and theaters and clubs. Sponsorship AOI grew by 16%. And ticketing, our largest AOI contributor, grew 11% from higher revenue and lower operating costs. 
Operating income was $325 million, up 19% over last year driven by the increase in AOI. Our net income for the full year was $70 million compared to $60 million in 2018 due to our improved operating results. Net loss per share was $0.02 after $75 million in accretion of redeemable noncontrolling interests. For 2019, we saw a 2% FX impact on both revenue and AOI. 
Turning to our balance sheet. As of December 31, we had total cash of $2.5 billion, including $838 million in ticketing client cash and $936 million in net concert event-related cash, leaving free cash of $697 million. Net cash provided by operating activities was $470 million compared to $942 million last year due to the timing of payables and ticket sales versus the prior year. Free cash flow adjusted was $499 million compared to $481 million last year. Our total capital expenditures were $316 million, 52% of which was spent on revenue-generating items. Our total net debt as of December 2019 after our refinancing in October was $3.3 billion with a weighted average cost of 4.2%. 
Our current expectations for 2020 include, in concerts, we expect most of the AOI growth to come in Q3, with some in Q2 and our seasonally quieter Q1 having a bit less activity than last year. In sponsorship, while we expect growth for the year, the Rock in Rio Brazil biennial festival will not occur in 2020. In ticketing, we currently expect the strong concert slate to drive growth in GTV with higher onsale activity particularly in Q1. It is too early in the year for us to predict FX impact for 2020. We will provide guidance in future calls as the year develops. All of our guidance is currently in a constant currency to 2019. We expect our total capital expenditures to be approximately $375 million with the increase largely driven by revenue-generating expenditures. And we currently expect accretion of noncontrolling interests to be approximately $55 million for 2020, with about half that in the first quarter and the rest fairly evenly distributed across the remaining quarters.

I think the first thing, just to put it in the right context, is to your latter point, anything that is being talked about is generally being talked about just in terms of timing. It's not being talked about not doing the shows. As we've long discussed, artists see the touring as the fundamental part of what they do and how they earn their living. So they're -- we're not talking to any artists that are saying they don't want to be touring at all. Exactly where can I go when? So it's just talking about timing. Absolutely, as we look at very specific hotspots, there is certainly flexibility to reroute as need be or to help them come back and hit that area later as opposed to when it was previously planned. 
In general, we pay the artist when the show occurs. There's generally force majeure clauses. If for some reason, a show were to be canceled, we wouldn't have to pay the artist. But again, we think that that's going to be pretty limited where we don't have some ability to either reroute or reschedule."

If an artist says -- if we cancel a show next month in Milan, we don't pay the artist. There's no cost incurred. And when the artist replays that show, then we pay the artist. 
So these ones are actually the easier ones to manage. I mean the ones that you always have the more challenge is when the festival gets canceled on a Saturday afternoon when 60,000 people are sitting there. That's when you have some marketing and some sunk costs where it may affect you. When you have a month, 2 months, anytime you cancel in advance, there's actually no cost incurred yet. The artist isn't at the show, the people aren't in the venue, you haven't paid the cost. So this is -- the easiest economic challenge for us is to reroute and reschedule a show, no cost to us. 
As Joe said, the good news is, on the supply-demand, the show is not going away; it's just moving to a different quarter. The artist will tour whether they have to jump off this quarter and go into fall or '21. We won't net lose the business. And the other demand part that we're just really impressed with, because we always talk about the resilience of the concert fan is, as of last night, we had a sellout in Australia on a festival that went up. The business is real strong. The consumer still seems to be buying the tickets on a global basis. So supply-demand will be there. We're going to take this cautiously as we watch the markets and we assume a hotspot will flare up and a show will be canceled here and there. But we're confident long term, the show will happen, the revenue will flow, and the fan will show up. 
On a macro -- on a micro 2020, as I think Joe mentioned, most of our business doesn't start until the middle of June onward. So the next few months, we'll have some cancellations, I assume here and there in some arenas and clubs. But the heart of our business happens in the summer. And we're optimistic, we hope that it can be handled and the summer months bring us some relief and we'll -- business as usual. But right now, we're being cautious. We're looking at all markets, doing the right thing for the artist. We're playing along with the great demand of this industry."

In 2019, Live Nation delivered its ninth consecutive year of growth with revenue up 7% and AOI up 14%. 
Starting with the core of our business. Our concert fan count was up 5 million to 98 million globally, driving AOI growth in all of our divisions: concerts, sponsorship and ticketing, demonstrating the effectiveness of our flywheel business model. In our concert segment, fans continue to find the live experience, from club shows to arenas to festivals, a top entertainment choice and the best way to celebrate their favorite artists and share the experience with other fans. In the U.S., over the past 5 years, consumer spend on live entertainment has grown 7% annually, providing strong structural tailwinds to drive increased demand for concerts globally. 
With these demand dynamics, in 2019, we delivered growth in concerts revenue of 8% and AOI of 7%. This growth was broad-based across our portfolio, with international fan count up 11%, while in North America, arenas, festivals, theaters and clubs contributed to our growth. Globally, festivals, theaters and club attendance were up double digits, highlighting the strength of our global footprint and the value of a diversified portfolio of markets, genres and building types that have enabled our consistent growth over the past several years. And across all of the artists we work with, we invested well over $6 billion to promote 40,000 shows in 42 countries, with Live Nation by far the largest financial supporter of artists in music. 
Average ticket prices for our amphitheater and arena shows are up double digits since 2017 while sales of dynamically priced Platinum tickets are up 66% for the year across 3,000 shows as artists want more of the best seats in the house sold at face value at the onsale. Even with these increases, concerts remain a great deal for fans relative to other live experiences. Our average ticket price for a concert at any one of our amphitheaters was $46 in 2019 relative to a $75 NBA game, over $100 for an NFL game. 
Once at the show, average per fan spending grew as well. At our amphitheaters, spending grew by $2.50 to over $29 per head as we improved our product offering, reduced friction with shorter lines and improved VIP hospitality offerings. The hospitality focus also grew on-site spending at our festivals, theaters and clubs, the result of a better experience for our fans across our operated venues. 
We added 38 new venues in 2019, including 6 new festivals and 18 new theaters and clubs. As we have gotten better at on-site hospitality over the past several years, this opens up more opportunity for us to operate more buildings where we make more money per fan, which accelerates the on-site monetization part of our flywheel. 
The strength of our business is continuing with concert tickets sold through mid-February for 2020 shows up 10% to 38 million and a pipeline of 4,700 confirmed arena, stadium and amphitheater shows, up 30% from the same time last year. All venue types have strong show count growth led by North America stadium and arena concerts. 
In our high-margin sponsorship business, we grew revenue by 17% and AOI by 16% in 2019. Venue sponsorship was a key driver in the year, up double digits globally, with broad growth across amphitheaters, festivals, theaters and clubs. 
Festivals had a particularly strong year. With the addition of Rock and Rio to our portfolio of marquee festivals, sponsorship in this segment was up over 50%. Our top strategic sponsors have also been a key driver of our sponsorship segment, with 88 sponsors collectively spending approximately $400 million to reach our fans and revenue from this group up 19% in the year. 
In 2019, we broadened our brand partnership base by leveraging our Power of Live research, with particular success in the lifestyle space working with brands including Revlon, Vans and Clinique as we demonstrated the importance of their products to concertgoers. 
All this reinforces the power of our platform of 98 million fans and the priority of brands to reach fans during the live experience. With over 70% of budgeted sponsorship net revenue for the year committed and despite 2020 being an off year for Rock in Rio in Brazil, we are confident we will deliver continued growth in our sponsorship segment this year. 
Ticketmaster further built its leadership position in ticketing in 2019, growing AOI by 11%. Most of our growth came through reduced customer acquisition costs across both primary and secondary ticketing and from secondary ticketing volume, notably the NFL and other sporting events. 
Our international ticketing business drove our growth in fee-bearing tickets and GTV, led by our strong international concert ticket sales. We now provide services in 31 countries and, in 2019, delivered 115 million tickets internationally, with tremendous opportunity for continued growth on a global basis, particularly in the 15 markets where we promote concerts and don't yet have a substantial ticketing operation. Ticketmaster's recent entry into both the Taiwan and Singapore markets highlights this international expansion opportunity, leveraging our leading concert positions in these markets and now growing our ticketing presence to 7 countries in Asia as we continue to build our flywheel across more of these markets. 
In North America, our top priority in 2019 was deploying Presence, our secure ticketing digital product, which we see as key in differentiating Ticketmaster and providing venues, teams and artists with the information and tools to maximize the fan relationships. Presence was deployed in over 700 venues by the end of 2019, including over 90% of major sports and Live Nation buildings, operating 50,000 events for over 120 million fans, more than half of whom used digital ticketings for entry. We see our deployment in 2020 further accelerating, and we are planning to have Presence in over 1,300 venues by the end of the year, with over 200 million fans attending events at these buildings. At that point, we will cover 100% of major sports and Live Nation buildings and 90% of all fans in North American Ticketmaster venues, making Ticketmaster by far the global leader in digital ticketing. 
Artist-driven initiatives, such as ticketing Pearl Jam's entire tour with SafeTix, enabling their strategy of getting tickets into the hands of their greatest fans, is one demonstration of how digital ticketing is serving content more effectively. At the same time, we continue to scale our global ticketing marketplace with the fourth quarter being our second highest fee-bearing GTV quarter ever, selling over 60 million fee-bearing tickets and delivering over $5 billion in fee-bearing GTV. 
Ticketmaster continues to lead the ticketing industry both operationally and in digital ticketing. Looking at 2020, I'm confident in Ticketmaster's ability to extend that leadership position globally as we add more customers, ticket more events and expand our digital ticketing platform. 
In summary, 2019 was another strong year for Live Nation, building our global concert business and driving growth in our high-margin venue, sponsorship and ticketing business. 
Looking at 2020, our double-digit fan and show count growth so far this year against the backdrop of very high artist activity across all venue types and markets sets up our flywheel to deliver another year of strong global growth. 
With this, I will turn the call over to Joe to take you through additional details."
384687,654652258,1932835,"Live Nation Entertainment, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Feb 27, 2020",2020-02-27,"Earnings Calls","Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Michael.

Looking at our business segments, first, concerts. As Michael indicated, fan attendance grew 5% to 98 million fans, demonstrating the strength of our global portfolio and, with this demand growth, highlighting the strong fundamentals underlying our business. Geographically, international had a strong year, with growth in stadiums, festivals and theaters and clubs driving 11% fan growth. Theaters and clubs globally led fan growth for the year with 20% growth to nearly 30 million fans. Festivals also had a strong year with 7 new festivals, including Rock in Rio, helping deliver 13% fan growth globally. Our fan attendance is up from 47 million in 2010, closing out the decade by more than doubling our fan base, a key milestone that demonstrates the consistent and resilient growth at the core of our flywheel, creating significant scale over time. 
Looking specifically at the fourth quarter. While attendance and show count were up, our AOI was lower heavily driven by an increase in advertising expense related to 2020 shows and increased fixed expense associated with continuing to build our flywheel and operate more venues. Without this higher-than-projected advertising expense from putting more 2020 shows on sale in 2019, concerts AOI for the year would have been up double digits. 
Moving on to sponsorship. In 2019, we again delivered double-digit AOI growth, up 16% for the year. International drove over 70% of this growth, with the addition of Rock in Rio helping drive both international and festival sponsorship growth. For the fourth quarter, revenue was up 25%, and AOI was up 26%, with growth helped by the second weekend of Rock in Rio Brazil. Our pipeline for 2020 is in good shape, demonstrating the strength of our concerts flywheel and driving all parts of the business. And we expect to continue growing our sponsorship AOI despite not having Rock in Rio Brazil this year. 
Finally, Ticketmaster. Global GTV was flat in the quarter, matching 2018's record fourth quarter, while fee-bearing GTV was down 2%. North America fee-bearing GTV was flat for the quarter, while international was down 8%, reflecting the geographic shift in 2020 stadiums versus last year. This volume was up relative to our expectations for the quarter, reflecting both a timing shift and an even stronger 2020 pipeline of concerts than was previously projected. 
For the fourth quarter, Ticketmaster AOI was up 23% due to a 9% increase in secondary GTV, reduced customer acquisition costs and the benefit from comping against last year's costs related to a third-party data breach. These same factors then drove our margin improvement for the quarter. Looking at 2020, we expect a strong concert slate will drive Ticketmaster's GTV, including a strong Q1 when we'll have most of our stadium and arena onsales. 
A few more points. The coronavirus has had a lot of press lately, so I wanted to give some context for us. First, as it relates to China and Asia shows generally, show cancellations have been minimal given our activity levels in China, with 17 shows totaling approximately 75,000 fans. Looking over the next 3 months, our Asia activity is limited, with 70 shows and 200,000 fans in the region. 
Second, as it relates to Italy, we have 30 shows booked over the next 3 months with approximately 125,000 fans. Collectively, this accounts for less than 0.5% of our 100 million-plus fans we expect to attend our shows this year. More broadly, while we expect that there will be further areas of breakout over the next few months, one of our strengths is that we are highly diversified geographically. Thus far, we have seen no pullback in fan demand or ticket buying outside of the specifically affected areas. And overall, our attendance is weighted toward the latter part of this year with over 70% of our attendance expected from June through the end of the year. 
Finally, on the OCESA acquisition, we continue to make progress working with the regulators in Mexico on their review. And at this point, we expect the acquisition to close sometime in the second quarter. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Kathy to go through more on our financial results."

Our key highlights for the fourth quarter of 2019 are revenue increased by 11% to $2.9 billion. AOI was $81 million, up 18%. As of December 31, our deferred revenue related to future shows was up 10% to $1.2 billion compared to $1.1 billion last year. Concerts was the primary driver of revenue growth as it increased 12% for more fans and shows. Sponsorship revenue was up 25% as we benefited from the second weekend of Rock in Rio Brazil. And ticketing revenue grew 2% as a result of higher secondary ticket volume. AOI was up 18% driven by growth in sponsorship due to the 4 days of Rock in Rio, an improved resale volume and lower operating costs in ticketing. Concerts AOI declined from higher advertising expense for 2020 shows and increased head count and rent primarily related to additional venues. As we've noted before, we recognize all show-related advertising for future shows at the end of the year, so the higher volume of onsales for 2020 shows increases our year-end expenses. Operating loss for the quarter was $83 million compared to a loss of $90 million in the prior year as a result of the higher AOI. Net loss for the quarter was $160 million compared to a net loss of $148 million in the prior year, driven mainly by higher interest, taxes and noncontrolling interest expense. 
For full year 2019, revenue was $11.5 billion, a 7% increase over 2018. AOI was $943 million, up 14%. And free cash flow adjusted was $499 million, up 4% over last year, representing 53% of AOI due to the timing of distributions to NCI partners. Revenue growth was primarily driven by concerts, which was up 8% as we saw attendance growth across North America arenas, international stadiums and festivals and theaters and clubs globally. Sponsorship revenue was also strong with 17% growth driven by Rock in Rio, high demand for our venue on-site sponsorship programs and growth in the number of our strategic sponsors and related spend. 
All of our segments contributed to our AOI growth. Concerts AOI was up 7% as we grew our fan base and number of shows across arenas, theaters and clubs and festivals along with improved fan on-site spend at our amphitheaters, festivals and theaters and clubs. Sponsorship AOI grew by 16%. And ticketing, our largest AOI contributor, grew 11% from higher revenue and lower operating costs. 
Operating income was $325 million, up 19% over last year driven by the increase in AOI. Our net income for the full year was $70 million compared to $60 million in 2018 due to our improved operating results. Net loss per share was $0.02 after $75 million in accretion of redeemable noncontrolling interests. For 2019, we saw a 2% FX impact on both revenue and AOI. 
Turning to our balance sheet. As of December 31, we had total cash of $2.5 billion, including $838 million in ticketing client cash and $936 million in net concert event-related cash, leaving free cash of $697 million. Net cash provided by operating activities was $470 million compared to $942 million last year due to the timing of payables and ticket sales versus the prior year. Free cash flow adjusted was $499 million compared to $481 million last year. Our total capital expenditures were $316 million, 52% of which was spent on revenue-generating items. Our total net debt as of December 2019 after our refinancing in October was $3.3 billion with a weighted average cost of 4.2%. 
Our current expectations for 2020 include, in concerts, we expect most of the AOI growth to come in Q3, with some in Q2 and our seasonally quieter Q1 having a bit less activity than last year. In sponsorship, while we expect growth for the year, the Rock in Rio Brazil biennial festival will not occur in 2020. In ticketing, we currently expect the strong concert slate to drive growth in GTV with higher onsale activity particularly in Q1. It is too early in the year for us to predict FX impact for 2020. We will provide guidance in future calls as the year develops. All of our guidance is currently in a constant currency to 2019. We expect our total capital expenditures to be approximately $375 million with the increase largely driven by revenue-generating expenditures. And we currently expect accretion of noncontrolling interests to be approximately $55 million for 2020, with about half that in the first quarter and the rest fairly evenly distributed across the remaining quarters. 
Thank you for joining us today. Operator, we will now open the call for questions."

And you gave us some really good color on Italy and Asia, thanks for that. But I think investors want to understand the potential downside risk if there are broader show cancellations especially over the summer period. To the extent that an individual show is canceled, can you help us understand what the financial impact would be? I know you guys buy many tours outright. I think you pay artists, what, $8 billion per year. Are you left holding the bag if shows are canceled? And then if there are regions that are affected by corona, did you have the flexibility to reroute tours? And finally, you gave really strong leading indicators for '20 obviously shaping up to be a big year without corona. If there is major corona impact, would you anticipate that activity pushing out to '21? I think that covers most of it."
384687,654652258,1932835,"Live Nation Entertainment, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Feb 27, 2020",2020-02-27,"Earnings Calls","Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.","Executives","Sure, Brandon. It's Joe.

I think the first thing, just to put it in the right context, is to your latter point, anything that is being talked about is generally being talked about just in terms of timing. It's not being talked about not doing the shows. As we've long discussed, artists see the touring as the fundamental part of what they do and how they earn their living. So they're -- we're not talking to any artists that are saying they don't want to be touring at all. Exactly where can I go when? So it's just talking about timing. Absolutely, as we look at very specific hotspots, there is certainly flexibility to reroute as need be or to help them come back and hit that area later as opposed to when it was previously planned. 
In general, we pay the artist when the show occurs. There's generally force majeure clauses. If for some reason, a show were to be canceled, we wouldn't have to pay the artist. But again, we think that that's going to be pretty limited where we don't have some ability to either reroute or reschedule."

If an artist says -- if we cancel a show next month in Milan, we don't pay the artist. There's no cost incurred. And when the artist replays that show, then we pay the artist. 
So these ones are actually the easier ones to manage. I mean the ones that you always have the more challenge is when the festival gets canceled on a Saturday afternoon when 60,000 people are sitting there. That's when you have some marketing and some sunk costs where it may affect you. When you have a month, 2 months, anytime you cancel in advance, there's actually no cost incurred yet. The artist isn't at the show, the people aren't in the venue, you haven't paid the cost. So this is -- the easiest economic challenge for us is to reroute and reschedule a show, no cost to us. 
As Joe said, the good news is, on the supply-demand, the show is not going away; it's just moving to a different quarter. The artist will tour whether they have to jump off this quarter and go into fall or '21. We won't net lose the business. And the other demand part that we're just really impressed with, because we always talk about the resilience of the concert fan is, as of last night, we had a sellout in Australia on a festival that went up. The business is real strong. The consumer still seems to be buying the tickets on a global basis. So supply-demand will be there. We're going to take this cautiously as we watch the markets and we assume a hotspot will flare up and a show will be canceled here and there. But we're confident long term, the show will happen, the revenue will flow, and the fan will show up. 
On a macro -- on a micro 2020, as I think Joe mentioned, most of our business doesn't start until the middle of June onward. So the next few months, we'll have some cancellations, I assume here and there in some arenas and clubs. But the heart of our business happens in the summer. And we're optimistic, we hope that it can be handled and the summer months bring us some relief and we'll -- business as usual. But right now, we're being cautious. We're looking at all markets, doing the right thing for the artist. We're playing along with the great demand of this industry."

It's really dispersed across the globe, across different venues and genres, which is the part that makes us a bit risk adverse. So we see no sponsorship risk at all.

Again, going back to our first point, as long as we're going to deliver net, over the next 2 years, the same amount of shows, the growth, the tickets that we've kind of delivered for that sponsorship commitment, then we see no pullback at all in the long-term sponsor.

Thank you for joining us. I hope that everyone out there is healthy and safe. On our last call, we were on track for tremendous growth across all our businesses, with both fan demand and artists touring increasing on a global basis. Then i",630,"Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us. I hope that everyone out there is healthy and safe. On our last call, we were on track for tremendous growth across all our businesses, with both fan demand and artists touring increasing on a global basis. Then in mid-March, we came to a halt. We have held no concerts in almost 2 months. Despite these challenging times, we continue to have full confidence in the long-term supply and demand of the live concert industry. Live Nation's leadership position and our business model's ability to successfully deliver AOI growth and shareholder value. With that context, let me update you on our top priorities at this point.
Our top priority is to ensure the health and safety of our employees, fans and artists. Like most of the world, we have been working remotely since mid-March, and we will return to work only after there is clear consensus that it is safe to do so. And then in appropriate numbers with expanding cleaning and social distancing protocols. Similarly, we recognize the experience that our venues will change when concerts start back up. And we're working with medical experts and public health officials on procedures to keep people safe while enjoying our shows. When we asked over 8,000 fans across North America about the requirements for returning to shows they had 2 clear priorities, with 85% of fans stating they want increased cleaning and sanitizing of the venues, and ready access to hand sanitizing stations, while no other action received more than 40%. In addition, we expect to have additional safety protocols in place, potentially including reduced capacity, touchless concessions and creative ways to apply our digital ticketing technology.
Our next priority is planning for the reopening of concerts when the time is right. First and foremost, we will let the facts and science tell us when we should start putting on concerts again. We are working with government at federal and state levels in the U.S. and across all markets and building plans that fit with their reopening phases. In the meantime, we have fortified our balance sheet to help the resources to ramp up quickly when the time is right.
We know from fans that demand will be there when the shows return. Globally, over 90% of fans are holding on to their tickets for rescheduled shows when refunds are available. That's the clearest demonstration of pent-up demand that will enable us to quickly start concerts back up.
Looking a bit farther out, given that 80% of shows are rescheduled rather than canceled, and as noted, almost all fans are holding on to their tickets, we believe 2021 can return to show volume and fan attendance at levels consistent with what we've seen in recent years.
As we plan the resumption of concerts, we're also seeing a number of innovations within our company as artists look to stay connected to fans. Almost 1 million fans have come to our live at home site to find virtual tours and acoustic performances from their home. And millions of fans in over 100 different countries have joined Insomniac's virtual Rave-a-thons, while drive-in concerts are finding a new purpose to socially distance concert halls. Throughout all this, we are still motivated by the long-term potential of global live events. It's in the DNA of us to want to gather, socialize and celebrate. And as we provide assurances on health and safety at the venue, we expect our business to build back.
Live Nation is in the best position in the live ecosystem to play long and to capture new opportunities continue leading the industry into the future. I will now hand the call over to Kathy and Joe, who will provide additional full details on our balance sheet."
384687,665826875,1976620,"Live Nation Entertainment, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, May 07, 2020",2020-05-07,"Earnings Calls","Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. Before getting into the quarter, I want to give a quick update on our cost and cash management programs, which we launched in March. We previously announced initiatives to cut costs by $500 million this year.",795,"Thanks, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. Before getting into the quarter, I want to give a quick update on our cost and cash management programs, which we launched in March. We previously announced initiatives to cut costs by $500 million this year. And we've surpassed that goal and are now targeting $600 million in cost reductions. We've also expanded our cash management program, which including our cost initiatives, now eliminates or defers $1 billion in cash requirements this year. As a result, we project our monthly operational cost burn rate to be approximately $150 million per month for the second quarter and through the remainder of the year.
Now I will walk through the impact of the COVID shutdown on each of our businesses during the first quarter. As we previously indicated, at the end of February, we were headed toward delivering Q1 AOI, in line with last year, approximately $115 million. Instead, with the shutdown, we had 100 -- sorry, instead with the shutdown, we had a $21 million AOI loss for the quarter. The direct COVID impact in the quarter was approximately $165 million, which was partially offset by approximately $30 million in cost savings during the quarter.
Starting with concerts, our concerts division went from $5 million of AOI in the first quarter of last year to a loss of $88 million this year. Through February, we had promoted 5,500 shows for nearly 8 million fans, up year-on-year by 17% and 2%, respectively. We then ended the quarter with 7,100 shows for 10.4 million fans, down 14% and 30%, respectively, from last year. With 2,100 March shows canceled or rescheduled to a future date, we've lost approximately $40 million of anticipated contribution margin on those shows. Additionally, we had a onetime expense of approximately $25 million for sunk cost for canceled shows, which included the cost to pain show employees for those shows that didn't happen during the second half of March. We had always expected our concerts AOI to be down in Q1 given the show activity level and increased fixed costs of approximately $40 million largely associated with acquisitions made over the last year. But unfortunately, the March shutdown led to a substantially lower AOI.
On a separate matter, our OCESA acquisition was approved by Mexico's regulators in April. We've now entered into discussions with SIA and Televisa regarding the timing and terms of the previously announced OCESA transaction. And do not expect to close the transaction until we have greater clarity on the duration of the shutdown in Mexico and its impact on OCESA's business.
Next, Ticketmaster. Our ticketing division AOI fell from $100 million in the first quarter last year to $45 million this year. Similar to our concerts division, through February, we were on track for a strong Q1 with fee-bearing GTV up 31% to $3.2 billion. Net of refunds, we then ended the quarter with $3 billion in fee-bearing GTV, down 22% from Q1 last year. This drastic reduction in fee-bearing GTV led to an approximately $65 million reduction in contribution margin relative to our February forecast for the business. In addition, we refunded 5.2 million tickets for $432 million of GTV during March. And along with an accrual for future refunds of shows canceled in April, this resulted in a $35 million reduction in contribution margin.
To give you a little more color on our refunds through this past weekend, Ticketmaster has had 65,000 shows impacted by the virus. Virtually all canceled shows are currently refunding, and about 80% of rescheduled shows or postponed shows are currently offering refunds. For Live Nation concerts, about 9,000 shows have been impacted. Of those shows, about 20% have canceled and 80% are rescheduling. Again, almost all canceled shows are currently refunding. And over 90% of rescheduled shows are offering refunds with the remaining shows scheduled to be refunding in the near future. And as Michael said, less than 10% of fans are taking the refund for the rescheduled or postponed shows when given the choice with over 90% of them holding on to their tickets for a future date.
Finally, sponsorship. Our sponsorship business was the least impacted by the March shutdown, losing less than $5 million in contribution margin as a result. And this quarter delivered $47 million in AOI, up from $40 million in the first quarter last year.
Overall, we recognize the next few quarters will not be business as usual, so we won't be giving any direction on key operating metrics until we start selling tickets and promoting concerts again. Our focus is on managing our cost structure and cash burn, ensuring a strong balance sheet as we come out of the shutdown. And with that, I will turn the call over to Kathy."
384687,665826875,1976620,"Live Nation Entertainment, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, May 07, 2020",2020-05-07,"Earnings Calls","Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Joe, and good afternoon to everyone joining us. I will briefly recap our first quarter results and provide an update on our liquidity position.

I will briefly recap our first quarter results and provide an update on our liquidity position. For the quarter, we generated $1.4 billion in revenue, down 21% compared to last year as the shutdown shows due to COVID-19 reduced our revenue by approximately $435 million, primarily in concerts and also ticketing. Our AOI was a loss of $21 million for the quarter, down $136 million compared to last year driven by approximately $165 million in COVID-related impacts.
Our operating loss was $173 million, driven by an estimated $175 million COVID-19 impacts, including $10 million in intangible impairments in the quarter. Net loss for the quarter was $185 million, and net loss per share was $0.94.
Now on to our balance sheet and liquidity position. We are actively managing our cash to preserve our strong liquidity position during the stoppage in shows. We have taken quick and aggressive actions to conserve cash, including our cost savings initiatives and cash management program, which eliminates or defers $1 billion in cash outflows for 2020 relative to our budget as Joe outlined. In addition to the $600 million in cost savings, these cash impacts include a reduction in capital expenditures, lower acquisition activity and deferrals of concert and ticketing advances. We now estimate an operational cash burn rate of approximately $150 million per month for the rest of the year, prior to interest expense, debt payments, capital expenditures and other nonoperational items. 
As of March 31, we had total cash of $3.3 billion, which includes a free cash balance of $817 million. In April, we completed an amendment to our credit agreement, which suspends our net leverage covenant for the second and third quarters of 2020, replaced with a minimum liquidity [ test for those quarters ] Beginning in Q4 of this year, the net leverage covenant will use the bank-defined EBITDA from Q2 and Q3 of 2019 instead of the Q2 and Q3 2020 results. We continue to have a 20% add-back in that EBITDA calculation, which gives us added protection from our COVID-19 impacts during the period. We also added an incremental revolver of $130 million in April, providing us with additional financial and operational flexibility. That now gives us $963 million of available debt capacity between our revolvers and undrawn term loan A. And we will continue to monitor the capital markets for opportunities to expand liquidity at appropriate pricing.
Our total cash includes $2 billion of event-related deferred revenue as of March 31. This is part of our operating cash and therefore, provides us additional liquidity. We believe that our free cash balance of $817 million. Together with our $963 million of undrawn debt capacity, gives us sufficient liquidity to maintain critical operations for the remainder of the year, even in the extreme scenario that no major shows play off this year.
As of the end of the quarter, our total net debt position was $3.7 billion, with a weighted average cost of 3.9%. We expect to be in compliance with our debt covenants around our corporate debt structure for all of 2020.
Total capital expenditures for the quarter were $74 million. We are now estimating our full year CapEx to be approximately $200 million, down from our initial estimate at the beginning of the year of $375 million as part of our overall cash flow improvement process. Of the remaining $126 million in CapEx for the year, approximately $50 million is for capitalized labor in our ticketing segment, which we continue to rely on for our ticketing operations with the remainder largely venue-related long-term projects. We will continue to evaluate all projects as the year progresses, particularly as we gain more insight into opening time lines by region. 
With that, we'll open it up to questions. Operator?"

We're looking at all this data ongoing as we're trying to understand and make sure we're looking at a global basis of our consumers and any long-term effects. It was important, we wanted to make sure we got one of our surveys are online today because I think the general surveys aren't always useful, but we went and talk to 10,000 of casual and ongoing ticket buyers around the world. And the data's pretty compelling. I mean 90% of fans are saying, ""I can't wait to get back to the show."" I think our refund rate says everything. Anyone that has any view that says, will they come back? Will the consumer change behavior? We're running somewhere between a 5% and 10% refund rate right now on a global basis, much lower in Europe. Those aren't out of line with when we rescheduled just a traditional tour for different reasons. So 90% of fans in today's environment, saying, ""I'm going to hold on to those tickets because I can't wait to see the show,"" I think it's probably the most compelling data one could look at that says the consumer is going to come back strong. It's a big part of their old social DNA to get out, and gather and communal experiences with their friends and family. So we don't debate that consumers nor artists will be back on the road from a supply/demand -- I mean, since the early days, people have been gathering around artists, and we think long after we're dead, people will gather around artists. It's a communal primal need. We're just now debating and what month we start that back. So we don't think we have any consumer trends that worry us. This -- there was no acceleration in our industry of a decline. If anything we were having a global acceleration as emerging markets were becoming more sophisticated and opening up to the traditional concert. So we see that on a global basis that the show will be back. It'll be back as big as ever from a consumer demand.
And the second part of our equation that is really unique is the supply. We have all these artists who really look to go on the road for financial and to bond with their fans and build long-term franchises. And talking to those artists on a daily basis, they are waiting to get back on the road when it's safe for them and their fans. So supply/demand dynamics, I think we have a unique situation in the sense of fans are -- cherish those 2 hours when they get on the road and see their favorite performers. The artists want to get back out. Now we're just going to make sure we play the science, and when can we get out there on a safe manner on a scale basis. But we think demand in '21 and onward will be as big as it was in '20 -- or in '19."

David, let's start with where we're at, which is $800-and-something million in available cash $900-and-something million in untapped debt. So $1.7 billion of available untapped liquidity to start with. And then to the point I made of about $150 million a month of operational cash burn. So that says you can go through this year without doing shows at any scale without any concern. I think it's our expectation that even though likely to not have a huge volume of shows this year. As we get into Q4, you start having the ticket sales in some large-scale for shows next year. I think we're already seeing, obviously, the NFL is their schedule announced today or schedule release today. Most of the teams are going on sale with their tickets. Over the next day or so. So you're already seeing people going on sale even if the shows aren't happening, and that will drive some of our ticketing and sponsorship businesses. But just as the base case certainly getting through this year without any additional liquidity isn't a concern. More broadly, when we look at the markets, I think spreads have come back to more normal levels. The capital markets are absolutely open. Open to us, open to a wide range of folks that are looking for any increased liquidity. We'll watch that opportunistically and see what makes sense to do.
And then in terms of your question on deferred revenue, I think that to us has never historically been part of how we think about our ongoing operational liquidity. And I think in this instance, particularly given the very low level of refunds, as Michael went into, it's just some float that in effect, we could tap into if for short- to medium-term purposes, we had a need for that additional liquidity float. It's not part of our base case scenarios in any means."

And I didn't know what we should be thinking about those liabilities, whether or not you need to pay those down over the next couple of quarters.

I mean, again, the glass half full here. Thankfully, our show is not time dependent. So you feel for any other event companies where if you missed the final 4, you can't replay that.

The average customer go to 2.5 shows a year. So these are the Kodak moments, and they'll wait for them. So you're right. We're going to -- we're dealing right now as an industry, as a whole, I'd say, like most probably industries, the industry has never come together this well from the agents, the artists, the buildings, the managers, the promoters, we're all in the same boat so we're all looking to say, how do we move availabilities. The only challenge we've had with availabilities in terms of a little bit of the -- why we had to hang on to the refund strategy is the sports lakes. They're kind of the ones -- we need to understand what's going to happen in the fall time in their arenas. And what availability is and when is the season going to start. Traditionally, the NFL, and the NBA, NHL announced their season, and then we kind of know the next Q4, Q1, Q2 availabilities. That would really be our only gating issue. As soon as they get their exact schedules up, then we'll be able to slot all the dates in. As an industry, we have a great model right now that if you have a current date that was planned, you will get first holds get that back on the road. And if you're a new tour that was going to tour in '21, you're probably moving that to later in '21 or into '22. So we've talked about it. We think we'll have a very robust '21 back end and really, really robust back end '21, '22. But working together with the industry, we see no issues in moving all of these dates into '21, just waiting on some scheduling conflicts."

Wherever there's been challenges, there's been markets of opportunity. So the 2 things to remember about our business, unlike sports or NFL where it's stadiums or nothing, is we have a very diverse size of shows. We did 15,000 club and theater shows last year, and we did them in 40 countries. So we'll look in the next 6 months, but we'll be kind of starting slow and small, focusing on the basics kind of testing regionally. But it will be about whether it's in Arkansas or a state that is safe, secure and politically is fine to proceed in, we're going to dabble in fanless concerts with broadcast. We're going to go and reduce capacity shows because we can make the math work. There are a lot of great artists that maybe they can sell an arena out, but they'll do 10 higher-end smaller theaters or clubs. We're seeing lots of artists jumping to get back out when it's safe. So you're going to see us in different countries, whether it's Finland, whether it's Asia, Hong Kong, certain markets are farther ahead. And we kind of look at it as over the next over the summer period, they'll be testing happening, whether it's some fanless concerts which are really important for our sponsorship business. All the ways we can create great properties to keep all of our sponsors who have been amazing and sticking with us this year. So it's important for us to keep doing drive-in concerts. We're going to test and roll out, which we're having some success with. Fanless concerts, which have great broadcast opportunities, reduce capacity of festival concerts where it could be outdoors, could be in a theater, it could be in a large stadium floor where there's enough room to be safe. So we have all of these plans in place depending on the market and where the -- that local city may sit in their reopening phases. So we want to be smart. We don't want to rush. We're playing long ball. One of the realities is we and AEG are the 2 companies that can withstand this storm as long as it plays. And we're going to play for the long safety of business. So we're not looking to rush and provoke any new spread of the virus. We want to do it smart with local participation. But there's lots of great opportunities that are arising now where we will get to test over the summer period. And again, I remind you, those are important from my sponsorship business well as testing the feel on some new ideas we have. We think the fall time, if a lot of those things happen and don't cause any second hotspots, but you'll see markets around the world. Europe specifically has talked about September opening up 5,000-plus. So I think you'll see the fall time more experimental and more shows happening in more of a theater setting and into some arenas. And then our goal is really to be on sale in Q3 and 4 for '21 at full scale, and testing all through the summer.
I would say on the venue part that's really interesting, and we're dealing with Federal, White House to every government body, you can imagine, we're jumping on all practices with all the sports legs, the commissioners, the teams. So we've got a great task force around what have we got to do with the venue to make you safe. And I just think it's very interesting from our data. The fan's not looking for instant testing or thermometers, although those would be fabulous, and we hope those come fast in terms of 5-minute testing. 85% of fans want to make sure our venues are sanitized, enhanced sanitizers available. That's the bar they need to say it's safe to show up as the most important factors. So that's also important. We're working with the local governments on what is our venue prep plan, what's the protocol to make the fans feel safe, [ wells for ] testing. So making sure we have proper sanitization, hand sanitizers masks, physical distance, cashless concessions. So we've got a full plan in place. We think those are smart things for the future. Digital ticketing is something we've always been driving a bunch of reasons, but no better time than ever to have digital ticketing and cashless concessions. Part of our access program, we're going to continue to excel. I think that will be one of the real advantages of this crisis.
So we think we're well on plan on a global basis to have our venues ready. Now we're just going to go market-by-market with one of these or multiple ideas as the market's ready to test these, and that's our plan for the summer to keep the business moving."

Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us. I hope that everyone out there is healthy and safe. On our last call, we were on track for tremendous growth across all our businesses, with both fan demand and artists touring increasing on a global basis. Then in mid-March, we came to a halt. We have held no concerts in almost 2 months. Despite these challenging times, we continue to have full confidence in the long-term supply and demand of the live concert industry, Live Nation's leadership position and our business model's ability to successfully deliver AOI growth and shareholder value. With that context, let me update you on our top priorities at this point. 
Our top priority is to ensure the health and safety of our employees, fans and artists. Like most of the world, we have been working remotely since mid-March, and we will return to work only after there is clear consensus that it is safe to do so, and then in appropriate numbers with expanding cleaning and social distancing protocols. Similarly, we recognize the experience that our venues will change when concerts start back up. And we're working with medical experts and public health officials on procedures to keep people safe while enjoying our shows. 
When we asked over 8,000 fans across North America about the requirements for returning to shows, they had 2 clear priorities, with 85% of fans stating they want increased cleaning and sanitizing of the venues and ready access to hand sanitizing stations, while no other action received more than 40%. In addition, we expect to have additional safety protocols in place, potentially including reduced capacity, touchless concessions and creative ways to apply our digital ticketing technology. 
Our next priority is planning for the reopening of concerts when the time is right. First and foremost, we will let the facts and science tell us when we should start putting on concerts again. We are working with government at federal and state levels in the U.S. and across all markets in building plans that fit with their reopening phases. In the meantime, we have fortified our balance sheet to have the resources to ramp up quickly when the time is right. 
We know from fans that demand will be there when the shows return. Globally, over 90% of fans are holding on to their tickets for rescheduled shows when refunds are available. That's the clearest demonstration of pent-up demand that will enable us to quickly start concerts back up. 
Looking a bit farther out, given that 80% of shows are rescheduled rather than canceled, and as noted, almost all fans are holding on to their tickets, we believe 2021 can return to show volume and fan attendance at levels consistent with what we've seen in recent years. 
As we plan the resumption of concerts, we're also seeing a number of innovations within our company as artists look to stay connected to fans. Almost 1 million fans have come to our Live at Home site to find virtual tours and acoustic performances from their home. And millions of fans in over 100 different countries have joined Insomniac's Virtual Rave-a-Thons, while drive-in concerts are finding a new purpose to socially-distant concert halls. Throughout all this, we are still motivated by the long-term potential of global live events. It's in the DNA of us to want to gather, socialize and celebrate. And as we provide assurances on health and safety at the venue, we expect our business to build back. 
Live Nation is in the best position in the live ecosystem to play long and to capture new opportunities, continue leading the industry into the future. I'll now hand the call over to Kathy and Joe, who will provide additional full details on our balance sheet."
384687,665826875,1976826,"Live Nation Entertainment, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, May 07, 2020",2020-05-07,"Earnings Calls","Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. Before getting into the quarter, I want to give a quick update on our cost and cash management programs, which we launched in March. We previously announced initiatives to cut costs by $500 million this year.",795,"Thanks, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. Before getting into the quarter, I want to give a quick update on our cost and cash management programs, which we launched in March. We previously announced initiatives to cut costs by $500 million this year. And we've surpassed that goal and are now targeting $600 million in cost reductions. We've also expanded our cash management program, which including our cost initiatives, now eliminates or defers $1 billion in cash requirements this year. As a result, we project our monthly operational cost burn rate to be approximately $150 million per month for the second quarter and through the remainder of the year. 
Now I will walk through the impact of the COVID shutdown on each of our businesses during the first quarter. As we previously indicated, at the end of February, we were headed toward delivering Q1 AOI, in line with last year, approximately $115 million. Instead, with the shutdown, we had 100 -- sorry, instead, with the shutdown, we had a $21 million AOI loss for the quarter. The direct COVID impact in the quarter was approximately $165 million, which was partially offset by approximately $30 million in cost savings during the quarter. 
Starting with concerts. Our concerts division went from $5 million of AOI in the first quarter of last year to a loss of $88 million this year. Through February, we had promoted 5,500 shows for nearly 8 million fans, up year-on-year by 17% and 2%, respectively. We then ended the quarter with 7,100 shows for 10.4 million fans, down 14% and 30%, respectively, from last year. With 2,100 March shows canceled or rescheduled to a future date, we've lost approximately $40 million of anticipated contribution margin on those shows. Additionally, we had a onetime expense of approximately $25 million for sunk cost for canceled shows, which included the cost of paying show employees for those shows that didn't happen during the second half of March. We had always expected our concerts AOI to be down in Q1 given the show activity level and increased fixed costs of approximately $40 million largely associated with acquisitions made over the last year. But unfortunately, the March shutdown led to a substantially lower AOI. 
On a separate matter, our OCESA acquisition was approved by Mexico's regulators in April. We've now entered into discussions with CIE and Televisa regarding the timing and terms of the previously announced OCESA transaction. And do not expect to close the transaction until we have greater clarity on the duration of the shutdown in Mexico and its impact on OCESA's business. 
Next, Ticketmaster. Our ticketing division AOI fell from $100 million in the first quarter last year to $45 million this year. Similar to our concerts division, through February, we were on track for a strong Q1 with fee-bearing GTV up 31% to $3.2 billion. Net of refunds, we then ended the quarter with $3.0 billion in fee-bearing GTV, down 22% from Q1 last year. This drastic reduction in fee-bearing GTV led to an approximately $65 million reduction in contribution margin relative to our February forecast for the business. In addition, we refunded 5.2 million tickets for $432 million of GTV during March. And along with an accrual for future refunds of shows canceled in April, this resulted in a $35 million reduction in contribution margin. 
To give you a little more color on our refunds through this past weekend, Ticketmaster has had 65,000 shows impacted by the virus. Virtually all canceled shows are currently refunding, and about 80% of rescheduled shows or postponed shows are currently offering refunds. For Live Nation concerts, about 9,000 shows have been impacted. Of those shows, about 20% have canceled and 80% are rescheduling. Again, almost all canceled shows are currently refunding. And over 90% of rescheduled shows are offering refunds with the remaining shows scheduled to be refunding in the near future. And as Michael said, less than 10% of fans are taking the refund for the rescheduled or postponed shows when given the choice with over 90% of them holding on to their tickets for a future date. 
Finally, sponsorship. Our sponsorship business was the least impacted by the March shutdown, losing less than $5 million in contribution margin as a result, and this quarter delivered $47 million in AOI, up from $40 million in the first quarter last year. 
Overall, we recognize the next few quarters will not be business as usual, so we won't be giving any direction on key operating metrics until we start selling tickets and promoting concerts again. Our focus is on managing our cost structure and cash burn, ensuring a strong balance sheet as we come out of the shutdown. And with that, I will turn the call over to Kathy."

I will briefly recap our first quarter results and provide an update on our liquidity position. For the quarter, we generated $1.4 billion in revenue, down 21% compared to last year as the shutdown shows due to COVID-19 reduced our revenue by approximately $435 million, primarily in concerts and also ticketing. Our AOI was a loss of $21 million for the quarter, down $136 million compared to last year driven by approximately $165 million in COVID-related impacts.
Our operating loss was $173 million, driven by an estimated $175 million COVID-19 impacts, including $10 million in intangible impairments in the quarter. Net loss for the quarter was $185 million, and net loss per share was $0.94.
Now on to our balance sheet and liquidity position. We are actively managing our cash to preserve our strong liquidity position during the stoppage in shows. We have taken quick and aggressive actions to conserve cash, including our cost savings initiatives and cash management program, which eliminates or defers $1 billion in cash outflows for 2020 relative to our budget as Joe outlined. In addition to the $600 million in cost savings, these cash impacts include a reduction in capital expenditures, lower acquisition activity and deferrals of concert and ticketing advances. We now estimate an operational cash burn rate of approximately $150 million per month for the rest of the year, prior to interest expense, debt payments, capital expenditures and other nonoperational items. 
As of March 31, we had total cash of $3.3 billion, which includes a free cash balance of $817 million. In April, we completed an amendment to our credit agreement, which suspends our net leverage covenant for the second and third quarters of 2020, replaced with a minimum liquidity test for those quarters. Beginning in Q4 of this year, the net leverage covenant will use the bank-defined EBITDA from Q2 and Q3 of 2019 instead of the Q2 and Q3 2020 results. We continue to have a 20% add-back in that EBITDA calculation, which gives us added protection from our COVID-19 impacts during the period. We also added an incremental revolver of $130 million in April, providing us with additional financial and operational flexibility. That now gives us $963 million of available debt capacity between our revolvers and undrawn term loan A. And we will continue to monitor the capital markets for opportunities to expand liquidity at appropriate pricing.
Our total cash includes $2 billion of event-related deferred revenue as of March 31. This is part of our operating cash and therefore, provides us additional liquidity. We believe that our free cash balance of $817 million, together with our $963 million of undrawn debt capacity, gives us sufficient liquidity to maintain critical operations for the remainder of the year, even in the extreme scenario that no major shows play off this year.
As of the end of the quarter, our total net debt position was $3.7 billion, with a weighted average cost of 3.9%. We expect to be in compliance with our debt covenants around our corporate debt structure for all of 2020. Total capital expenditures for the quarter were $74 million. We are now estimating our full year CapEx to be approximately $200 million, down from our initial estimate at the beginning of the year of $375 million as part of our overall cash flow improvement process. Of the remaining $126 million in CapEx for the year, approximately $50 million is for capitalized labor in our ticketing segment, which we continue to rely on for our ticketing operations, with the remainder largely venue-related long-term projects. We will continue to evaluate all projects as the year progresses, particularly as we gain more insight into opening time lines by region. 
With that, we'll open it up to questions. Operator?"

We're looking at all this data ongoing as we're trying to understand and make sure we're looking at a global basis of our consumers and any long-term effects. It was important, we want to make sure we got one of our surveys online today because I think the general surveys aren't always useful, but we went and talk to 10,000 of casual and ongoing ticket buyers around the world. And the data's pretty compelling. I mean 90% of fans are saying, ""I can't wait to get back to the show."" I think our refund rate says everything. Anyone that has any view that says, will they come back? Will the consumer change behavior? We're running somewhere between a 5% and 10% refund rate right now on a global basis, much lower in Europe. 
Those aren't out of line with when we reschedule just a traditional tour for different reasons. So 90% of fans in today's environment saying, ""I'm going to hold on to those tickets because I can't wait to see the show,"" I think it's probably the most compelling data one could look at that says the consumer is going to come back strong. It's a big part of their old social DNA to get out and gather and communal experiences with their friends and family. 
So we don't debate that consumers nor artists will be back on the road from a supply/demand -- I mean, since the early days, people have been gathering around artists. And we think long after we're dead, people will gather around artists. It's a communal primal need. We're just not debating on what month we start that back. So we don't think we have any consumer trends that worry us. This -- there was no acceleration in our industry of a decline. If anything, we were having a global acceleration as emerging markets were becoming more sophisticated and opening up to the traditional concert. So we see that on a global basis that the show will be back. It'll be back as big as ever from a consumer demand.
And the second part of our equation that is really unique is the supply. We have all these artists who really look to go on the road for financial and to bond with their fans and build long-term franchises. And talking to those artists on a daily basis, they are waiting to get back on the road when it's safe for them and their fans. So supply/demand dynamics, I think we have a unique situation in the sense of fans are -- cherish those 2 hours when they get on the road and see their favorite performers. The artists want to get back out. Now we're just going to make sure we play the science, and when can we get out there on a safe manner on a scale basis. But we think demand in '21 and onward will be as big as it was in '20 -- or in '19."

David, let's start with where we're at, which is $800-and-something million in available cash, $900-and-something million in untapped debt. So $1.7 billion of available untapped liquidity to start with, and then to the point I made of about $15",317,"Yes. Sure. David, let's start with where we're at, which is $800-and-something million in available cash, $900-and-something million in untapped debt. So $1.7 billion of available untapped liquidity to start with, and then to the point I made of about $150 million a month of operational cash burn. So that says you can go through this year without doing shows at any scale without any concern. I think it's our expectation that even though likely to not have a huge volume of shows this year, as we get into Q4, you start having the ticket sales in some large scale for shows next year. 
I think we're already seeing -- obviously, the NFL has their schedule announced today or schedule release today. Most of the teams are going on sale with their tickets over the next day or so. So you're already seeing people going on sale even if the shows aren't happening, and that will drive some of our ticketing and sponsorship businesses. But just as the base case, certainly, getting through this year without any additional liquidity isn't a concern. More broadly, when we look at the markets, I think spreads have come back to more normal levels. The capital markets are absolutely open. Open to us, open to a wide range of folks that are looking for any increased liquidity. We'll watch that opportunistically and see what makes sense to do.
And then in terms of your question on deferred revenue, I think that, to us, has never historically been part of how we think about our ongoing operational liquidity. I think in this instance, particularly given the very low level of refunds, as Michael went into, it's just some float that in effect we could tap into if, for short- to medium-term purposes, we had a need for that additional liquidity float. It's not part of our base case scenarios in any means."

But I'm wondering as you start to go down that path, if you could just spend a few minutes on sort of how you go about doing that and what your opportunities and options are, and how you may or may not be working with other promoters and artists and things along those lines. 
And then just another cash question on the liability side. You guys have some accrued expenses and accounts payable at the end of the quarter. And I didn't know what we should be thinking about those liabilities, whether or not you need to pay those down over the next couple of quarters. Is there any color you can give us on  the accrued expense account payable front? I don't think that's captured in your cash burn number, but I could have that wrong."

I mean again, the glass half full here. Thankfully, our show is not time-dependent. So you feel for any other event companies where if you missed the final 4, you can't replay that. So the great advantage we have is it's just now timing. The fan wants to see Billie Eilish. They would have liked to see them in March, but they'll wait until October or they'll wait until February. The average customer goes to 2.5 shows a year. So these are the Kodak moments, and they'll wait for them. 
So you're right. We're going to -- we're dealing right now as an industry, as a whole, I'd say, like most probably industries. The industry has never come together this well from the agents, the artists, the buildings, the managers, the promoters, we're all in the same boat. So we're all looking to say, how do we move availabilities. Really, the only challenge we've had with availabilities in terms of a little bit of the -- why we had to hang on to the refund strategy is the sports lakes. They're kind of the ones -- we need to understand what's going to happen in the fall time in their arenas, and what availability is and when is the season going to start. Traditionally, the NFL, and the NBA, NHL announce their season, and then we kind of know the next Q4, Q1, Q2 availabilities. That would really be our only gating issue. As soon as they get their exact schedules up, then we'll be able to slot all the dates in. 
As an industry, we have a great model right now that if you have a current date that was planned, you will get first holds to get that back on the road. And if you're a new tour that was going to tour in '21, you're probably moving that to later in '21 or into '22. So we've talked about it. We think we'll have a very robust '21 backend and really, really robust backend '21, '22. But working together with the industry, we see no issues in moving all of these dates into '21, just waiting on some scheduling conflicts."

So the 2 things to remember about our b",839,"Thank you. Yes. Well, one of the things I always remind people on 2 fronts is our global diversity is our greatest strength. It always has been. Wherever there's been challenges, there's been markets of opportunity. So the 2 things to remember about our business, unlike sports or NFL where it's stadiums or nothing, is we have a very diverse size of shows. We did 15,000 club and theater shows last year, and we did them in 40 countries. So we'll look in the next 6 months, but we'll be kind of starting slow and small, focusing on the basics, kind of testing regionally. But it will be about whether it's in Arkansas or a state that is safe, secure and politically is fine to proceed in, we're going to dabble in fan-less concerts with broadcast. We're going to go and reduce capacity shows because we can make the math work. 
There are a lot of great artists that maybe they can sell an arena out, but they'll do 10 higher-end smaller theaters or clubs. We're seeing lots of artists jumping to get back out when it's safe. So you're going to see us in different countries, whether it's Finland, whether it's Asia, Hong Kong, certain markets are farther ahead. And we kind of look at it as over the next -- over the summer period, there'll be testing happening, whether it's some fan-less concerts, which are really important for our sponsorship business, all the ways we can create great properties to keep all of our sponsors who have been amazing and sticking with us this year. So it's important for us to keep doing drive-in concerts. We're going to test and roll out, which we're having some success with, fan-less concerts, which have great broadcast opportunities; reduce capacity of festival concerts where it could be outdoors, could be in a theater, it could be in a large stadium floor, where there's enough room to be safe. 
So we have all of these plans in place depending on the market and where the -- that local city may sit in their reopening phases. So we want to be smart. We don't want to rush. We're playing long ball. One of the realities is we and AEG are the 2 companies that can withstand this storm as long as it plays. And we're going to play for the long safety of business. So we're not looking to rush and provoke any new spread of the virus. We want to do it smart with local participation. But there's lots of great opportunities that are arising now where we will get to test over the summer period. 
And again, I remind you, those are important for my sponsorship business as well as testing the feel on some new ideas we have. We think the fall time, if a lot of those things happen and don't cause any second hot spots, that you'll see markets around the world. Europe specifically has talked about September opening up 5,000-plus. So I think you'll see the fall time more experimental and more shows happening in more of a theater setting and into some arenas. And then our goal is really to be on sale in Q3 and 4 for '21 at full scale, and testing all through the summer.
I would say on the venue part that's really interesting, and we're dealing with Federal, White House to every government body, you can imagine. We're jumping on all of the best practices with all the sports leagues, the commissioners, the teams. So we've got a great task force around what have we got to do with the venue to make you safe. And I just think it's very interesting from our data, the fan's not looking for instant testing or thermometers, although those would be fabulous, and we hope those come fast in terms of 5-minute testing. 85% of fans want to make sure our venues are sanitized, enhanced sanitizers available. That's the bar they need to say it's safe to show up. It's the most important factors. So that's also important. We're working with the local governments on what is our venue prep plan, what's the protocol to make the fans feel safe, well for testing. So making sure we have proper sanitization, hand sanitizers, masks, physical distance, cashless concessions. So we've got a full plan in place. We think those are smart things for the future. 
Digital ticketing is something we've always been driving for a bunch of reasons, but no better time than ever to have digital ticketing and cashless concessions, part of our access program, we're going to continue to excel. I think that will be one of the real advantages of this crisis.
So we think we're well on plan on a global basis to have our venues ready. Now we're just going to go market-by-market with one of these or multiple ideas as the market's ready to test these. And that's our plan for the summer, to keep the business moving."

Thank you for joining us. I hope that everyone out there is healthy and safe. On our last call, we were on track for tremendous growth across all our businesses, with both fan demand and artists touring increasing on a global basis. Then in mid-March, we came to a halt. We have held no concerts in almost 2 months. Despite these challenging times, we continue to have full confidence in the long-term supply and demand of the live concert industry, Live Nation's leadership position and our business model's ability to successfully deliver AOI growth and shareholder value. With that context, let me update you on our top priorities at this point. 
Our top priority is to ensure the health and safety of our employees, fans and artists. Like most of the world, we have been working remotely since mid-March, and we will return to work only after there is clear consensus that it is safe to do so, and then in appropriate numbers with expanding cleaning and social distancing protocols. Similarly, we recognize the experience that our venues will change when concerts start back up. And we're working with medical experts and public health officials on procedures to keep people safe while enjoying our shows. 
When we asked over 8,000 fans across North America about the requirements for returning to shows, they had 2 clear priorities, with 85% of fans stating they want increased cleaning and sanitizing of the venues and ready access to hand sanitizing stations, while no other action received more than 40%. In addition, we expect to have additional safety protocols in place, potentially including reduced capacity, touchless concessions and creative ways to apply our digital ticketing technology. 
Our next priority is planning for the reopening of concerts when the time is right. First and foremost, we will let the facts and science tell us when we should start putting on concerts again. We are working with government at federal and state levels in the U.S. and across all markets in building plans that fit with their reopening phases. In the meantime, we have fortified our balance sheet to have the resources to ramp up quickly when the time is right. 
We know from fans that demand will be there when the shows return. Globally, over 90% of fans are holding on to their tickets for rescheduled shows when refunds are available. That's the clearest demonstration of pent-up demand that will enable us to quickly start concerts back up. 
Looking a bit farther out, given that 80% of shows are rescheduled rather than canceled, and as noted, almost all fans are holding on to their tickets, we believe 2021 can return to show volume and fan attendance at levels consistent with what we've seen in recent years. 
As we plan the resumption of concerts, we're also seeing a number of innovations within our company as artists look to stay connected to fans. Almost 1 million fans have come to our Live at Home site to find virtual tours and acoustic performances from their home. And millions of fans in over 100 different countries have joined Insomniac's Virtual Rave-a-Thons, while drive-in concerts are finding a new purpose to socially-distant concert halls. Throughout all this, we are still motivated by the long-term potential of global live events. It's in the DNA of us to want to gather, socialize and celebrate. And as we provide assurances on health and safety at the venue, we expect our business to build back. 
Live Nation is in the best position in the live ecosystem to play long and to capture new opportunities, continue leading the industry into the future. I'll now hand the call over to Kathy and Joe, who will provide additional full details on our balance sheet."
384687,665826875,2016857,"Live Nation Entertainment, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, May 07, 2020",2020-05-07,"Earnings Calls","Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. Before getting into the quarter, I want to give a quick update on our cost and cash management programs, which we launched in March. We previously announced initiatives to cut costs by $500 million this year.",795,"Thanks, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. Before getting into the quarter, I want to give a quick update on our cost and cash management programs, which we launched in March. We previously announced initiatives to cut costs by $500 million this year. And we've surpassed that goal and are now targeting $600 million in cost reductions. We've also expanded our cash management program, which including our cost initiatives, now eliminates or defers $1 billion in cash requirements this year. As a result, we project our monthly operational cost burn rate to be approximately $150 million per month for the second quarter and through the remainder of the year. 
Now I will walk through the impact of the COVID shutdown on each of our businesses during the first quarter. As we previously indicated, at the end of February, we were headed toward delivering Q1 AOI, in line with last year, approximately $115 million. Instead, with the shutdown, we had 100 -- sorry, instead, with the shutdown, we had a $21 million AOI loss for the quarter. The direct COVID impact in the quarter was approximately $165 million, which was partially offset by approximately $30 million in cost savings during the quarter. 
Starting with concerts. Our concerts division went from $5 million of AOI in the first quarter of last year to a loss of $88 million this year. Through February, we had promoted 5,500 shows for nearly 8 million fans, up year-on-year by 17% and 2%, respectively. We then ended the quarter with 7,100 shows for 10.4 million fans, down 14% and 30%, respectively, from last year. With 2,100 March shows canceled or rescheduled to a future date, we've lost approximately $40 million of anticipated contribution margin on those shows. Additionally, we had a onetime expense of approximately $25 million for sunk cost for canceled shows, which included the cost of paying show employees for those shows that didn't happen during the second half of March. We had always expected our concerts AOI to be down in Q1 given the show activity level and increased fixed costs of approximately $40 million largely associated with acquisitions made over the last year. But unfortunately, the March shutdown led to a substantially lower AOI. 
On a separate matter, our OCESA acquisition was approved by Mexico's regulators in April. We've now entered into discussions with CIE and Televisa regarding the timing and terms of the previously announced OCESA transaction. And do not expect to close the transaction until we have greater clarity on the duration of the shutdown in Mexico and its impact on OCESA's business. 
Next, Ticketmaster. Our ticketing division AOI fell from $100 million in the first quarter last year to $45 million this year. Similar to our concerts division, through February, we were on track for a strong Q1 with fee-bearing GTV up 31% to $3.2 billion. Net of refunds, we then ended the quarter with $3.0 billion in fee-bearing GTV, down 22% from Q1 last year. This drastic reduction in fee-bearing GTV led to an approximately $65 million reduction in contribution margin relative to our February forecast for the business. In addition, we refunded 5.2 million tickets for $432 million of GTV during March. And along with an accrual for future refunds of shows canceled in April, this resulted in a $35 million reduction in contribution margin. 
To give you a little more color on our refunds through this past weekend, Ticketmaster has had 65,000 shows impacted by the virus. Virtually all canceled shows are currently refunding, and about 80% of rescheduled shows or postponed shows are currently offering refunds. For Live Nation concerts, about 9,000 shows have been impacted. Of those shows, about 20% have canceled and 80% are rescheduling. Again, almost all canceled shows are currently refunding. And over 90% of rescheduled shows are offering refunds with the remaining shows scheduled to be refunding in the near future. And as Michael said, less than 10% of fans are taking the refund for the rescheduled or postponed shows when given the choice with over 90% of them holding on to their tickets for a future date. 
Finally, sponsorship. Our sponsorship business was the least impacted by the March shutdown, losing less than $5 million in contribution margin as a result, and this quarter delivered $47 million in AOI, up from $40 million in the first quarter last year. 
Overall, we recognize the next few quarters will not be business as usual, so we won't be giving any direction on key operating metrics until we start selling tickets and promoting concerts again. Our focus is on managing our cost structure and cash burn, ensuring a strong balance sheet as we come out of the shutdown. And with that, I will turn the call over to Kathy."
384687,665826875,2016857,"Live Nation Entertainment, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, May 07, 2020",2020-05-07,"Earnings Calls","Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Joe, and good afternoon to everyone joining us.

I will briefly recap our first quarter results and provide an update on our liquidity position. For the quarter, we generated $1.4 billion in revenue, down 21% compared to last year as the shutdown shows due to COVID-19 reduced our revenue by approximately $435 million, primarily in concerts and also ticketing. Our AOI was a loss of $21 million for the quarter, down $136 million compared to last year driven by approximately $165 million in COVID-related impacts.
Our operating loss was $173 million, driven by an estimated $175 million COVID-19 impacts, including $10 million in intangible impairments in the quarter. Net loss for the quarter was $185 million, and net loss per share was $0.94.
Now on to our balance sheet and liquidity position. We are actively managing our cash to preserve our strong liquidity position during the stoppage in shows. We have taken quick and aggressive actions to conserve cash, including our cost savings initiatives and cash management program, which eliminates or defers $1 billion in cash outflows for 2020 relative to our budget as Joe outlined. In addition to the $600 million in cost savings, these cash impacts include a reduction in capital expenditures, lower acquisition activity and deferrals of concert and ticketing advances. We now estimate an operational cash burn rate of approximately $150 million per month for the rest of the year, prior to interest expense, debt payments, capital expenditures and other nonoperational items. 
As of March 31, we had total cash of $3.3 billion, which includes a free cash balance of $817 million. In April, we completed an amendment to our credit agreement, which suspends our net leverage covenant for the second and third quarters of 2020, replaced with a minimum liquidity test for those quarters. Beginning in Q4 of this year, the net leverage covenant will use the bank-defined EBITDA from Q2 and Q3 of 2019 instead of the Q2 and Q3 2020 results. We continue to have a 20% add-back in that EBITDA calculation, which gives us added protection from our COVID-19 impacts during the period. We also added an incremental revolver of $130 million in April, providing us with additional financial and operational flexibility. That now gives us $963 million of available debt capacity between our revolvers and undrawn term loan A. And we will continue to monitor the capital markets for opportunities to expand liquidity at appropriate pricing.
Our total cash includes $2 billion of event-related deferred revenue as of March 31. This is part of our operating cash and therefore, provides us additional liquidity. We believe that our free cash balance of $817 million, together with our $963 million of undrawn debt capacity, gives us sufficient liquidity to maintain critical operations for the remainder of the year, even in the extreme scenario that no major shows play off this year.
As of the end of the quarter, our total net debt position was $3.7 billion, with a weighted average cost of 3.9%. We expect to be in compliance with our debt covenants around our corporate debt structure for all of 2020. Total capital expenditures for the quarter were $74 million. We are now estimating our full year CapEx to be approximately $200 million, down from our initial estimate at the beginning of the year of $375 million as part of our overall cash flow improvement process. Of the remaining $126 million in CapEx for the year, approximately $50 million is for capitalized labor in our ticketing segment, which we continue to rely on for our ticketing operations, with the remainder largely venue-related long-term projects. We will continue to evaluate all projects as the year progresses, particularly as we gain more insight into opening time lines by region. 
With that, we'll open it up to questions. Operator?"

We're looking at all this data ongoing as we're trying to understand and make sure we're looking at a global basis of our consumers and any long-term effects. It was important, we want to make sure we got one of our surveys online today because I think the general surveys aren't always useful, but we went and talk to 10,000 of casual and ongoing ticket buyers around the world. And the data's pretty compelling. I mean 90% of fans are saying, ""I can't wait to get back to the show."" I think our refund rate says everything. Anyone that has any view that says, will they come back? Will the consumer change behavior? We're running somewhere between a 5% and 10% refund rate right now on a global basis, much lower in Europe. 
Those aren't out of line with when we reschedule just a traditional tour for different reasons. So 90% of fans in today's environment saying, ""I'm going to hold on to those tickets because I can't wait to see the show,"" I think it's probably the most compelling data one could look at that says the consumer is going to come back strong. It's a big part of their old social DNA to get out and gather and communal experiences with their friends and family. 
So we don't debate that consumers nor artists will be back on the road from a supply/demand -- I mean since the early days, people have been gathering around artists. And we think long after we're dead, people will gather around artists. It's a communal primal need. We're just not debating on what month we start that back. So we don't think we have any consumer trends that worry us. This -- there was no acceleration in our industry of a decline. If anything, we were having a global acceleration as emerging markets were becoming more sophisticated and opening up to the traditional concert. So we see that on a global basis that the show will be back. It'll be back as big as ever from a consumer demand.
And the second part of our equation that is really unique is the supply. We have all these artists who really look to go on the road for financial and to bond with their fans and build long-term franchises. And talking to those artists on a daily basis, they are waiting to get back on the road when it's safe for them and their fans. So supply/demand dynamics, I think we have a unique situation in the sense of fans are -- cherish those 2 hours when they get on the road and see their favorite performers. The artists want to get back out. Now we're just going to make sure we play the science, and when can we get out there on a safe manner on a scale basis. But we think demand in '21 and onward will be as big as it was in '20 -- or in '19."

David, let's start with where we're at, which is $800-and-something million in available cash, $900-and-something million in untapped debt. So $1.7 billion of available untapped liquidity to start with, and then to the point I made of about $15",317,"Yes. Sure. David, let's start with where we're at, which is $800-and-something million in available cash, $900-and-something million in untapped debt. So $1.7 billion of available untapped liquidity to start with, and then to the point I made of about $150 million a month of operational cash burn. So that says you can go through this year without doing shows at any scale without any concern. I think it's our expectation that even though likely to not have a huge volume of shows this year, as we get into Q4, you start having the ticket sales in some large scale for shows next year. 
I think we're already seeing -- obviously, the NFL has their schedule announced today or schedule release today. Most of the teams are going on sale with their tickets over the next day or so. So you're already seeing people going on sale even if the shows aren't happening, and that will drive some of our ticketing and sponsorship businesses. But just as the base case, certainly, getting through this year without any additional liquidity isn't a concern. More broadly, when we look at the markets, I think spreads have come back to more normal levels. The capital markets are absolutely open. Open to us, open to a wide range of folks that are looking for any increased liquidity. We'll watch that opportunistically and see what makes sense to do.
And then in terms of your question on deferred revenue, I think that, to us, has never historically been part of how we think about our ongoing operational liquidity. I think in this instance, particularly given the very low level of refunds, as Michael went into, it's just some float that in effect we could tap into if, for short- to medium-term purposes, we had a need for that additional liquidity float. It's not part of our base case scenarios in any means."

Michael, could you talk about the sort of operational approach and process of sort of rescheduling all of these events around the world? I mean the complexity, I think, you've talked about in the press is significant. But I'm wondering as you start to go down that path, if you could just spend a few minutes on sort of how you go about doing that and what your opportunities and options are, and how you may or may not be working with other promoters and artists and things along those lines. 
And then just another cash question on the liability side. You guys have some accrued expenses and accounts payable at the end of the quarter. And I didn't know what we should be thinking about those liabilities, whether or not you need to pay those down over the next couple of quarters. Is there any color you can give us on  the accrued expense account payable front? I don't think that's captured in your cash burn number, but I could have that wrong."

I mean again, the glass half full here. Thankfully, our show is not time-dependent. So you feel for any other event companies where if you missed the final 4, you can't replay that. So the great advantage we have is it's just now timing. The fan wants to see Billie Eilish. They would have liked to see them in March, but they'll wait until October or they'll wait until February. The average customer goes to 2.5 shows a year. So these are the Kodak moments, and they'll wait for them. 
So you're right. We're going to -- we're dealing right now as an industry, as a whole, I'd say, like most probably industries. The industry has never come together this well from the agents, the artists, the buildings, the managers, the promoters, we're all in the same boat. So we're all looking to say, how do we move availabilities. Really, the only challenge we've had with availabilities in terms of a little bit of the -- why we had to hang on to the refund strategy is the sports lakes. They're kind of the ones -- we need to understand what's going to happen in the fall time in their arenas, and what availability is and when is the season going to start. Traditionally, the NFL, and the NBA, NHL announce their season, and then we kind of know the next Q4, Q1, Q2 availabilities. That would really be our only gating issue. As soon as they get their exact schedules up, then we'll be able to slot all the dates in. 
As an industry, we have a great model right now that if you have a current date that was planned, you will get first holds to get that back on the road. And if you're a new tour that was going to tour in '21, you're probably moving that to later in '21 or into '22. So we've talked about it. We think we'll have a very robust '21 backend and really, really robust backend '21, '22. But working together with the industry, we see no issues in moving all of these dates into '21, just waiting on some scheduling conflicts."

I would say to you though that we absolutely are getting great latitude from the artists and agents to look at a traditional business of high guarantees and all of our risk, to help share that risk into '20 and 21, to get the shows back on the road and help us absorb the show, but not take all of the refund sales, sponsorship, food and beverage unknowns for the next 6 to 12 months.

Wherever there's been challenges, there's been markets of opportunity. So the 2 things to remember about our business, unlike sports or NFL where it's stadiums or nothing, is we have a very diverse size of shows. We did 15,000 club and theater shows last year, and we did them in 40 countries. So we'll look in the next 6 months, but we'll be kind of starting slow and small, focusing on the basics, kind of testing regionally. But it will be about whether it's in Arkansas or a state that is safe, secure and politically is fine to proceed in, we're going to dabble in fan-less concerts with broadcast. We're going to go and reduce capacity shows because we can make the math work. 
There are a lot of great artists that maybe they can sell an arena out, but they'll do 10 higher-end smaller theaters or clubs. We're seeing lots of artists jumping to get back out when it's safe. So you're going to see us in different countries, whether it's Finland, whether it's Asia, Hong Kong, certain markets are farther ahead. And we kind of look at it as over the next -- over the summer period, there'll be testing happening, whether it's some fan-less concerts, which are really important for our sponsorship business, all the ways we can create great properties to keep all of our sponsors who have been amazing and sticking with us this year. So it's important for us to keep doing drive-in concerts. We're going to test and roll out, which we're having some success with, fan-less concerts, which have great broadcast opportunities; reduce capacity of festival concerts where it could be outdoors, could be in a theater, it could be in a large stadium floor, where there's enough room to be safe. 
So we have all of these plans in place depending on the market and where the -- that local city may sit in their reopening phases. So we want to be smart. We don't want to rush. We're playing long ball. One of the realities is we and AEG are the 2 companies that can withstand this storm as long as it plays. And we're going to play for the long safety of business. So we're not looking to rush and provoke any new spread of the virus. We want to do it smart with local participation. But there's lots of great opportunities that are arising now where we will get to test over the summer period. 
And again, I remind you, those are important for my sponsorship business as well as testing the feel on some new ideas we have. We think the fall time, if a lot of those things happen and don't cause any second hot spots, that you'll see markets around the world. Europe specifically has talked about September opening up 5,000-plus. So I think you'll see the fall time more experimental and more shows happening in more of a theater setting and into some arenas. And then our goal is really to be on sale in Q3 and 4 for '21 at full scale, and testing all through the summer.
I would say on the venue part that's really interesting, and we're dealing with Federal, White House to every government body, you can imagine. We're jumping on all of the best practices with all the sports leagues, the commissioners, the teams. So we've got a great task force around what have we got to do with the venue to make you safe. And I just think it's very interesting from our data, the fan's not looking for instant testing or thermometers, although those would be fabulous, and we hope those come fast in terms of 5-minute testing. 85% of fans want to make sure our venues are sanitized, enhanced sanitizers available. That's the bar they need to say it's safe to show up. It's the most important factors. So that's also important. We're working with the local governments on what is our venue prep plan, what's the protocol to make the fans feel safe, well for testing. So making sure we have proper sanitization, hand sanitizers, masks, physical distance, cashless concessions. So we've got a full plan in place. We think those are smart things for the future. 
Digital ticketing is something we've always been driving for a bunch of reasons, but no better time than ever to have digital ticketing and cashless concessions, part of our access program, we're going to continue to excel. I think that will be one of the real advantages of this crisis.
So we think we're well on plan on a global basis to have our venues ready. Now we're just going to go market-by-market with one of these or multiple ideas as the market's ready to test these. And that's our plan for the summer, to keep the business moving."

Thank you for joining us. I hope that everyone out there is healthy and safe. On our last call, we were on track for tremendous growth across all our businesses, with both fan demand and artists touring increasing on a global basis. Then in mid-March, we came to a halt. We have held no concerts in almost 2 months. Despite these challenging times, we continue to have full confidence in the long-term supply and demand of the live concert industry, Live Nation's leadership position and our business model's ability to successfully deliver AOI growth and shareholder value. With that context, let me update you on our top priorities at this point. 
Our top priority is to ensure the health and safety of our employees, fans and artists. Like most of the world, we have been working remotely since mid-March, and we will return to work only after there is clear consensus that it is safe to do so, and then in appropriate numbers with expanding cleaning and social distancing protocols. Similarly, we recognize the experience that our venues will change when concerts start back up. And we're working with medical experts and public health officials on procedures to keep people safe while enjoying our shows. 
When we asked over 8,000 fans across North America about the requirements for returning to shows, they had 2 clear priorities, with 85% of fans stating they want increased cleaning and sanitizing of the venues and ready access to hand sanitizing stations, while no other action received more than 40%. In addition, we expect to have additional safety protocols in place, potentially including reduced capacity, touchless concessions and creative ways to apply our digital ticketing technology. 
Our next priority is planning for the reopening of concerts when the time is right. First and foremost, we will let the facts and science tell us when we should start putting on concerts again. We are working with government at federal and state levels in the U.S. and across all markets in building plans that fit with their reopening phases. In the meantime, we have fortified our balance sheet to have the resources to ramp up quickly when the time is right. 
We know from fans that demand will be there when the shows return. Globally, over 90% of fans are holding on to their tickets for rescheduled shows when refunds are available. That's the clearest demonstration of pent-up demand that will enable us to quickly start concerts back up. 
Looking a bit farther out, given that 80% of shows are rescheduled rather than canceled, and as noted, almost all fans are holding on to their tickets, we believe 2021 can return to show volume and fan attendance at levels consistent with what we've seen in recent years. 
As we plan the resumption of concerts, we're also seeing a number of innovations within our company as artists look to stay connected to fans. Almost 1 million fans have come to our Live at Home site to find virtual tours and acoustic performances from their home. And millions of fans in over 100 different countries have joined Insomniac's Virtual Rave-a-Thons, while drive-in concerts are finding a new purpose to socially-distant concert halls. Throughout all this, we are still motivated by the long-term potential of global live events. It's in the DNA of us to want to gather, socialize and celebrate. And as we provide assurances on health and safety at the venue, we expect our business to build back. 
Live Nation is in the best position in the live ecosystem to play long and to capture new opportunities, continue leading the industry into the future. I'll now hand the call over to Kathy and Joe, who will provide additional full details on our balance sheet."
384687,665826875,2016858,"Live Nation Entertainment, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, May 07, 2020",2020-05-07,"Earnings Calls","Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. Before getting into the quarter, I want to give a quick update on our cost and cash management programs, which we launched in March. We previously announced initiatives to cut costs by $500 million this year.",795,"Thanks, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. Before getting into the quarter, I want to give a quick update on our cost and cash management programs, which we launched in March. We previously announced initiatives to cut costs by $500 million this year. And we've surpassed that goal and are now targeting $600 million in cost reductions. We've also expanded our cash management program, which including our cost initiatives, now eliminates or defers $1 billion in cash requirements this year. As a result, we project our monthly operational cost burn rate to be approximately $150 million per month for the second quarter and through the remainder of the year. 
Now I will walk through the impact of the COVID shutdown on each of our businesses during the first quarter. As we previously indicated, at the end of February, we were headed toward delivering Q1 AOI, in line with last year, approximately $115 million. Instead, with the shutdown, we had 100 -- sorry, instead, with the shutdown, we had a $21 million AOI loss for the quarter. The direct COVID impact in the quarter was approximately $165 million, which was partially offset by approximately $30 million in cost savings during the quarter. 
Starting with concerts. Our concerts division went from $5 million of AOI in the first quarter of last year to a loss of $88 million this year. Through February, we had promoted 5,500 shows for nearly 8 million fans, up year-on-year by 17% and 2%, respectively. We then ended the quarter with 7,100 shows for 10.4 million fans, down 14% and 30%, respectively, from last year. With 2,100 March shows canceled or rescheduled to a future date, we've lost approximately $40 million of anticipated contribution margin on those shows. Additionally, we had a onetime expense of approximately $25 million for sunk cost for canceled shows, which included the cost of paying show employees for those shows that didn't happen during the second half of March. We had always expected our concerts AOI to be down in Q1 given the show activity level and increased fixed costs of approximately $40 million largely associated with acquisitions made over the last year. But unfortunately, the March shutdown led to a substantially lower AOI. 
On a separate matter, our OCESA acquisition was approved by Mexico's regulators in April. We've now entered into discussions with CIE and Televisa regarding the timing and terms of the previously announced OCESA transaction. And do not expect to close the transaction until we have greater clarity on the duration of the shutdown in Mexico and its impact on OCESA's business. 
Next, Ticketmaster. Our ticketing division AOI fell from $100 million in the first quarter last year to $45 million this year. Similar to our concerts division, through February, we were on track for a strong Q1 with fee-bearing GTV up 31% to $3.2 billion. Net of refunds, we then ended the quarter with $3.0 billion in fee-bearing GTV, down 22% from Q1 last year. This drastic reduction in fee-bearing GTV led to an approximately $65 million reduction in contribution margin relative to our February forecast for the business. In addition, we refunded 5.2 million tickets for $432 million of GTV during March. And along with an accrual for future refunds of shows canceled in April, this resulted in a $35 million reduction in contribution margin. 
To give you a little more color on our refunds through this past weekend, Ticketmaster has had 65,000 shows impacted by the virus. Virtually all canceled shows are currently refunding, and about 80% of rescheduled shows or postponed shows are currently offering refunds. For Live Nation concerts, about 9,000 shows have been impacted. Of those shows, about 20% have canceled and 80% are rescheduling. Again, almost all canceled shows are currently refunding. And over 90% of rescheduled shows are offering refunds with the remaining shows scheduled to be refunding in the near future. And as Michael said, less than 10% of fans are taking the refund for the rescheduled or postponed shows when given the choice with over 90% of them holding on to their tickets for a future date. 
Finally, sponsorship. Our sponsorship business was the least impacted by the March shutdown, losing less than $5 million in contribution margin as a result, and this quarter delivered $47 million in AOI, up from $40 million in the first quarter last year. 
Overall, we recognize the next few quarters will not be business as usual, so we won't be giving any direction on key operating metrics until we start selling tickets and promoting concerts again. Our focus is on managing our cost structure and cash burn, ensuring a strong balance sheet as we come out of the shutdown. And with that, I will turn the call over to Kathy."
384687,665826875,2016858,"Live Nation Entertainment, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, May 07, 2020",2020-05-07,"Earnings Calls","Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Joe, and good afternoon to everyone joining us.

I will briefly recap our first quarter results and provide an update on our liquidity position. For the quarter, we generated $1.4 billion in revenue, down 21% compared to last year as the shutdown shows due to COVID-19 reduced our revenue by approximately $435 million, primarily in concerts and also ticketing. Our AOI was a loss of $21 million for the quarter, down $136 million compared to last year driven by approximately $165 million in COVID-related impacts.
Our operating loss was $173 million, driven by an estimated $175 million COVID-19 impacts, including $10 million in intangible impairments in the quarter. Net loss for the quarter was $185 million, and net loss per share was $0.94.
Now on to our balance sheet and liquidity position. We are actively managing our cash to preserve our strong liquidity position during the stoppage in shows. We have taken quick and aggressive actions to conserve cash, including our cost savings initiatives and cash management program, which eliminates or defers $1 billion in cash outflows for 2020 relative to our budget as Joe outlined. In addition to the $600 million in cost savings, these cash impacts include a reduction in capital expenditures, lower acquisition activity and deferrals of concert and ticketing advances. We now estimate an operational cash burn rate of approximately $150 million per month for the rest of the year, prior to interest expense, debt payments, capital expenditures and other nonoperational items. 
As of March 31, we had total cash of $3.3 billion, which includes a free cash balance of $817 million. In April, we completed an amendment to our credit agreement, which suspends our net leverage covenant for the second and third quarters of 2020, replaced with a minimum liquidity test for those quarters. Beginning in Q4 of this year, the net leverage covenant will use the bank-defined EBITDA from Q2 and Q3 of 2019 instead of the Q2 and Q3 2020 results. We continue to have a 20% add-back in that EBITDA calculation, which gives us added protection from our COVID-19 impacts during the period. We also added an incremental revolver of $130 million in April, providing us with additional financial and operational flexibility. That now gives us $963 million of available debt capacity between our revolvers and undrawn term loan A. And we will continue to monitor the capital markets for opportunities to expand liquidity at appropriate pricing.
Our total cash includes $2 billion of event-related deferred revenue as of March 31. This is part of our operating cash and therefore, provides us additional liquidity. We believe that our free cash balance of $817 million, together with our $963 million of undrawn debt capacity, gives us sufficient liquidity to maintain critical operations for the remainder of the year, even in the extreme scenario that no major shows play off this year.
As of the end of the quarter, our total net debt position was $3.7 billion, with a weighted average cost of 3.9%. We expect to be in compliance with our debt covenants around our corporate debt structure for all of 2020. Total capital expenditures for the quarter were $74 million. We are now estimating our full year CapEx to be approximately $200 million, down from our initial estimate at the beginning of the year of $375 million as part of our overall cash flow improvement process. Of the remaining $126 million in CapEx for the year, approximately $50 million is for capitalized labor in our ticketing segment, which we continue to rely on for our ticketing operations, with the remainder largely venue-related long-term projects. We will continue to evaluate all projects as the year progresses, particularly as we gain more insight into opening time lines by region. 
With that, we'll open it up to questions. Operator?"

We're looking at all this data ongoing as we're trying to understand and make sure we're looking at a global basis of our consumers and any long-term effects. It was important, we want to make sure we got one of our surveys online today because I think the general surveys aren't always useful, but we went and talk to 10,000 of casual and ongoing ticket buyers around the world. And the data's pretty compelling. I mean 90% of fans are saying, ""I can't wait to get back to the show."" I think our refund rate says everything. Anyone that has any view that says, will they come back? Will the consumer change behavior? We're running somewhere between a 5% and 10% refund rate right now on a global basis, much lower in Europe. 
Those aren't out of line with when we reschedule just a traditional tour for different reasons. So 90% of fans in today's environment saying, ""I'm going to hold on to those tickets because I can't wait to see the show,"" I think it's probably the most compelling data one could look at that says the consumer is going to come back strong. It's a big part of their old social DNA to get out and gather and communal experiences with their friends and family. 
So we don't debate that consumers nor artists will be back on the road from a supply/demand -- I mean since the early days, people have been gathering around artists. And we think long after we're dead, people will gather around artists. It's a communal primal need. We're just not debating on what month we start that back. So we don't think we have any consumer trends that worry us. This -- there was no acceleration in our industry of a decline. If anything, we were having a global acceleration as emerging markets were becoming more sophisticated and opening up to the traditional concert. So we see that on a global basis that the show will be back. It'll be back as big as ever from a consumer demand.
And the second part of our equation that is really unique is the supply. We have all these artists who really look to go on the road for financial and to bond with their fans and build long-term franchises. And talking to those artists on a daily basis, they are waiting to get back on the road when it's safe for them and their fans. So supply/demand dynamics, I think we have a unique situation in the sense of fans are -- cherish those 2 hours when they get on the road and see their favorite performers. The artists want to get back out. Now we're just going to make sure we play the science, and when can we get out there on a safe manner on a scale basis. But we think demand in '21 and onward will be as big as it was in '20 -- or in '19."

David, let's start with where we're at, which is $800-and-something million in available cash, $900-and-something million in untapped debt.

David, let's start with where we're at, which is $800-and-something million in available cash, $900-and-something million in untapped debt. So $1.7 billion of available untapped liquidity to start with, and then to the point I made of about $150 million a month of operational cash burn. So that says you can go through this year without doing shows at any scale without any concern. I think it's our expectation that even though likely to not have a huge volume of shows this year, as we get into Q4, you start having the ticket sales in some large scale for shows next year. 
I think we're already seeing -- obviously, the NFL has their schedule announced today or schedule release today. Most of the teams are going on sale with their tickets over the next day or so. So you're already seeing people going on sale even if the shows aren't happening, and that will drive some of our ticketing and sponsorship businesses. But just as the base case, certainly, getting through this year without any additional liquidity isn't a concern. More broadly, when we look at the markets, I think spreads have come back to more normal levels. The capital markets are absolutely open. Open to us, open to a wide range of folks that are looking for any increased liquidity. We'll watch that opportunistically and see what makes sense to do.
And then in terms of your question on deferred revenue, I think that, to us, has never historically been part of how we think about our ongoing operational liquidity. I think in this instance, particularly given the very low level of refunds, as Michael went into, it's just some float that in effect we could tap into if, for short- to medium-term purposes, we had a need for that additional liquidity float. It's not part of our base case scenarios in any means."

But I'm wondering as you start to go down that path, if you could just spend a few minutes on sort of how you go about doing that and what your opportunities and options are, and how you may or may not be working with other promoters and artists and things along those lines. 
And then just another cash question on the liability side. You guys have some accrued expenses and accounts payable at the end of the quarter. And I didn't know what we should be thinking about those liabilities, whether or not you need to pay those down over the next couple of quarters. Is there any color you can give us on  the accrued expense account payable front? I don't think that's captured in your cash burn number, but I could have that wrong."

I mean again, the glass half full here. Thankfully, our show is not time-dependent. So you feel for any other event companies where if you missed the final 4, you can't replay that. So the great advantage we have is it's just now timing. The fan wants to see Billie Eilish. They would have liked to see them in March, but they'll wait until October or they'll wait until February. The average customer goes to 2.5 shows a year. So these are the Kodak moments, and they'll wait for them. 
So you're right. We're going to -- we're dealing right now as an industry, as a whole, I'd say, like most probably industries. The industry has never come together this well from the agents, the artists, the buildings, the managers, the promoters, we're all in the same boat. So we're all looking to say, how do we move availabilities. Really, the only challenge we've had with availabilities in terms of a little bit of the -- why we had to hang on to the refund strategy is the sports lakes. They're kind of the ones -- we need to understand what's going to happen in the fall time in their arenas, and what availability is and when is the season going to start. Traditionally, the NFL, and the NBA, NHL announce their season, and then we kind of know the next Q4, Q1, Q2 availabilities. That would really be our only gating issue. As soon as they get their exact schedules up, then we'll be able to slot all the dates in. 
As an industry, we have a great model right now that if you have a current date that was planned, you will get first holds to get that back on the road. And if you're a new tour that was going to tour in '21, you're probably moving that to later in '21 or into '22. So we've talked about it. We think we'll have a very robust '21 backend and really, really robust backend '21, '22. But working together with the industry, we see no issues in moving all of these dates into '21, just waiting on some scheduling conflicts."

They're helping sharing some of that risk which will provide us great opportunity to get back, scale fast, but not have to worry about losing money on the show."

We're all looking at our business and wondering, now that we have been able to stop, catch our breath and look at our business, are we running the most efficient way we can? How do we restructure our business, our cost basis on a global basis to be more efficient? We have gone into furloughs and cost reductions, as you know. We absolutely plan on coming out of this a leaner machine, much more efficient on how we go to market. 
And then probably as other companies have learned, there are some areas we're going to have to spend and acquire a better skill set at, to help us diversify our core business in terms of virtual concerts and other things that we've dabbled in, but maybe we got to spend a bit more time in that area. So bottom line is we look at this as a great opportunity on a global basis for us to restructure our cost basis, come out a leaner organization while still as aggressive as ever in terms of our global growth strategy."

Wherever there's been challenges, there's been markets of opportunity. So the 2 things to remember about our business, unlike sports or NFL where it's stadiums or nothing, is we have a very diverse size of shows. We did 15,000 club and theater shows last year, and we did them in 40 countries. So we'll look in the next 6 months, but we'll be kind of starting slow and small, focusing on the basics, kind of testing regionally. But it will be about whether it's in Arkansas or a state that is safe, secure and politically is fine to proceed in, we're going to dabble in fan-less concerts with broadcast. We're going to go and reduce capacity shows because we can make the math work. 
There are a lot of great artists that maybe they can sell an arena out, but they'll do 10 higher-end smaller theaters or clubs. We're seeing lots of artists jumping to get back out when it's safe. So you're going to see us in different countries, whether it's Finland, whether it's Asia, Hong Kong, certain markets are farther ahead. And we kind of look at it as over the next -- over the summer period, there'll be testing happening, whether it's some fan-less concerts, which are really important for our sponsorship business, all the ways we can create great properties to keep all of our sponsors who have been amazing and sticking with us this year. So it's important for us to keep doing drive-in concerts. We're going to test and roll out, which we're having some success with, fan-less concerts, which have great broadcast opportunities; reduce capacity of festival concerts where it could be outdoors, could be in a theater, it could be in a large stadium floor, where there's enough room to be safe. 
So we have all of these plans in place depending on the market and where the -- that local city may sit in their reopening phases. So we want to be smart. We don't want to rush. We're playing long ball. One of the realities is we and AEG are the 2 companies that can withstand this storm as long as it plays. And we're going to play for the long safety of business. So we're not looking to rush and provoke any new spread of the virus. We want to do it smart with local participation. But there's lots of great opportunities that are arising now where we will get to test over the summer period. 
And again, I remind you, those are important for my sponsorship business as well as testing the feel on some new ideas we have. We think the fall time, if a lot of those things happen and don't cause any second hot spots, that you'll see markets around the world. Europe specifically has talked about September opening up 5,000-plus. So I think you'll see the fall time more experimental and more shows happening in more of a theater setting and into some arenas. And then our goal is really to be on sale in Q3 and 4 for '21 at full scale, and testing all through the summer.
I would say on the venue part that's really interesting, and we're dealing with Federal, White House to every government body, you can imagine. We're jumping on all of the best practices with all the sports leagues, the commissioners, the teams. So we've got a great task force around what have we got to do with the venue to make you safe. And I just think it's very interesting from our data, the fan's not looking for instant testing or thermometers, although those would be fabulous, and we hope those come fast in terms of 5-minute testing. 85% of fans want to make sure our venues are sanitized, enhanced sanitizers available. That's the bar they need to say it's safe to show up. It's the most important factors. So that's also important. We're working with the local governments on what is our venue prep plan, what's the protocol to make the fans feel safe, well for testing. So making sure we have proper sanitization, hand sanitizers, masks, physical distance, cashless concessions. So we've got a full plan in place. We think those are smart things for the future. 
Digital ticketing is something we've always been driving for a bunch of reasons, but no better time than ever to have digital ticketing and cashless concessions, part of our access program, we're going to continue to excel. I think that will be one of the real advantages of this crisis.
So we think we're well on plan on a global basis to have our venues ready. Now we're just going to go market-by-market with one of these or multiple ideas as the market's ready to test these. And that's our plan for the summer, to keep the business moving."

Our expectatio",578,"Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Over the past 3 months, our top priority has been strengthening our financial position to ensure that we have the liquidity and flexibility to get through an extended period with no live events. Our expectation that live events will return at scale in the summer of 2021, with ticket sales ramping up in the quarters leading up to these shows. Importantly, we remain confident that fans will return to live events when it is safe to do so. Our strongest indicator of demand is that fans are holding on to their tickets, even when given the option of a refund. Through the end of the second quarter, 86% of concert fans are keeping their tickets for rescheduled shows, demonstrating a continued desire to attend concerts in the future despite the current uncertainty. Our expectation for robust outdoor summer season in 2021 are also reinforced by the 2/3 of fans keeping their tickets for canceled festivals so they can go to next year's show. Along with the strong early ticket sales for the festivals in the U.K. next summer, for example, Download and the Isle of Wight are pacing well ahead of last year.
Between the tickets held by fans for the rescheduled shows and these festival onsales, we have already sold 19 million tickets to more than 4,000 concerts and festivals scheduled for 2021, creating a strong baseload of demand that is pacing well ahead of this point last year. At the same time, surveys continue to show the concerts remain fans' highest priority social event when it is safe to gather, with almost 90% of fans globally planning on attending concerts again.
Understanding that it will be some time before we put on concerts at scale, we are innovating to find new and creative ways to help artists and fans connected in the meantime. Virtual concerts have proven to be a huge demand with fans, so we established a live-from-home platform to provide a convenient place for fans of all types to find performances from their favorite artists. In the second quarter, we had 67 million fans and over 18,000 concerts and festivals globally. Among our highlights this past weekend, we streamed 150 performances from our virtual Lollapalooza festival.
Given the tremendous popularity of these shows, we are seeing the potential for live streaming to become an additional long-term component of our concert business, allowing fans in other cities or those who can't attend to enjoy the concert as well. At the same time, recognizing fans want to get back to attending concerts in person as soon as possible, we've launched socially distant shows when and where permitted included in New Zealand, France, Denmark, Spain, Germany, Finland and as well as cities across the U.S.
While this is a challenging time for everyone, the Live Events business, in particular, there are a few things that I'm confident about. We are well positioned to weather this crisis and we will get through this. With a safety return, we will have an abundance of fans and artists ready to join live music again. In Live Nation will do everything in its power to meet our responsibilities to artists, fans, and employees and everyone else affected by the shutdown by bringing back as much live music as fast as possible when it's responsible to do so. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Joe for more detail on our results."

As Michael mentioned, our top priority during this time has been strengthening our financial position, and we are confident that our actions taking to cut costs and increase liquidity will provide us with the runway we need until the time is right to bring shows back. We have now reduced costs for this year by over $800 million, and reduced our cash usage by $1.4 billion relative to our pre-COVID plans. With these reductions, we have lowered the estimate on our operational cash burn rate to $125 million per month, and our gross burn rate to $185 million per month on average for the second quarter through the end of the year. At the same time, we raised an additional $1.2 billion providing us with a $1.8 billion of free cash at the end of the second quarter, along with over $950 million of available debt capacity, totaling over $2.7 billion in readily available liquidity. And last week, we amended our credit agreement to send our maintenance covenant to a more favorable liquidity metric to Q4 of 2021, providing us with added flexibility until business returns.
Turning to our Q2 results, starting with AOI. Our AOI for the quarter was a loss of $432 million driven primarily by operational fixed costs of $334 million, inclusive of approximately $60 million in benefits from various government payroll funding programs. So with our cost initiatives, we expect operational fixed costs to average approximately [ $125 million ] per month for the second quarter through the end of the year. We then had negative $98 million in contribution margin, largely driven by onetime events in Ticketmaster and our concerts business.
For Ticketmaster, recording refunds for 11 million tickets across 42,000 shows generated a loss of approximately $79 million for our portion of the service fees. In our concerts business, riding off some costs associated with concerts that have been canceled or rescheduled for 2021, generated an expense of approximately $87 million, about 2/3 of which is a write-off of advertising expenses given the calendar year shift in show timing. Partially offsetting these expenses, we had $68 million of contribution margin generated by business operations and insurance recoveries for events impacted by the pandemic.
Looking at free cash, we ended the first quarter with approximately $820 million in free cash, added $1.2 billion in cash from additional debt during the second quarter and then ended the quarter with $1.8 billion of free cash. This implies $250 million in cash used during the quarter. As part of this, we had a timing benefit to free cash of $415 million, which will flip back out in Q3 and Q4. Of this timing benefit, $225 million is accrued but not yet paid ticket refunds, and $190 million is working capital timing. This puts our total effective cash burn at $665 million for the quarter. The largest onetime impact was the payment for Ticketmaster refunds, which totaled $110 million for our portion of service fees refunded to fans during the quarter. We then had our operational cash burn, starting with our $334 million in operational fixed costs, then adding back $54 million of noncash benefits, our operational cash burn totals $388 million for the quarter.
In addition, we had $217 million of ongoing nonoperational cash burn items including capital expenditures, acquisition activity, net advances and interest payments. These items ran slightly higher for the quarter due to contractually obligated payments for past acquisitions, so we expect this nonoperational component to our cash burn to average approximately $60 million per month for the second quarter through the end of the year. Finally, we had $50 million of inflows from operations and improved cash management.
Lastly, let me give you an update on ticket refunds and how's that impacted our deferred revenue.
Ticket refunds first. The global refund rate for Live Nation concerts that are rescheduled and are in or have gone through a refund window is 14% through the end of Q2. Festivals have generally canceled this year's events. But for festivals where fans can retain their tickets for next year's show, as Michael mentioned, about 2/3 of them are keeping their tickets. Across both concerts and festivals, we refunded $218 million for rescheduled shows since March. In addition, we have refunded $477 million for canceled shows over this period. Of this $695 million total, $230 million was funds held by third-party venues and $465 million from the Live Nation-held funds. We still have some shows in the process of rescheduling or are rescheduled but not yet offering refunds. If we apply the same fan behavior and mix on these events, we forecast approximately $270 million in additional fan refunds, of which about $180 million will be from Live Nation-held funds. Given this estimate, we have shifted these funds from deferred revenue to accrued but not yet paid ticket refunds.
Now to look at how these refunds flow through our related deferred revenue. At the end of the first quarter, our deferred revenue for events over the next 12 months is $2 billion. At the end of the second quarter, deferred revenue for events in the next 12 months was $941 million. Of this, approximately $1 billion decrease, $405 million was due to a shift from short-term deferred revenue to long-term deferred revenue as a number of concerts were shifted into the second half of 2021. As a result, we had $486 million of long-term deferred revenue at the end of the second quarter, of which we estimate approximately $400 million will shift back to short-term deferred revenue over the course of the year.
The Live Nation concert ticket refunds recorded in the quarter then accounted for $465 million, and estimated additional future refunds from Live Nation-held cash totals $180 million. We then had ticket sales in the quarter that generated roughly $30 million of new deferred revenue.
Looking at the rest of the year, our forecast for event-related deferred revenue at the end of the year, prior to additional ticket sales and based on our projected refund rates, is approximately $1.3 billion. Given all the uncertainty in the market and timing of shows, we cannot give you any further guidance beyond these burn rates and refund levels we just gave you.
And with that, I will turn the call over to Kathy."

I will review our second quarter and 6-month results and provide updates on our balance sheet. All of our results for this quarter and the first 6 months of the year have been significantly impacted by the shutdo",575,"Thanks, Joe, and good afternoon, everyone. I will review our second quarter and 6-month results and provide updates on our balance sheet. All of our results for this quarter and the first 6 months of the year have been significantly impacted by the shutdown of our shows since mid-March due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which is driving all of the variances for both periods in total and across all segments.
For the quarter, our revenue was $74 million compared to $3.2 billion last year, down 98%. AOI was a loss of $432 million for the quarter compared to earnings of $319 million in 2019. Our operating loss was $588 million compared to $172 million in operating income last year. And net loss for the quarter was $568 million compared to net income of $103 million in 2019.
For the first 6 months, we generated $1.4 billion in revenue compared to $4.9 billion last year, down 71%. Most of this revenue in 2020 was driven by our show activity in the first 2.5 months of the year prior to the shutdown. AOI was a loss of $452 million for the first 6 months compared to income of $435 million in 2019. Our operating loss was $761 million compared to $148 million in operating income last year. And net loss for the first 6 months was $752 million compared to net income of $51 million in 2019.
Now on to our balance sheet. As of June 30, we had total cash of $3.3 billion, which includes a free cash balance of $1.8 billion. Our total cash includes $941 million of current event-related deferred revenue as well as $486 million of long-term deferred revenue for events that have been rescheduled more than 1 year out as of June 30. This is part of our operating cash and therefore, provides us additional liquidity. As Joe outlined, we estimate that our actions to conserve cash eliminates or defers approximately $1.4 billion in cash outflows for 2020, which includes the cash portion of our approximately $800 million in cost savings, along with a reduction in capital expenditures, lower acquisition activity and reduced concert and ticketing advances. In May 2020, we issued $1.2 billion principal amount of 6.5% senior secured notes due 2027. As of the end of the quarter, our total debt was $4.9 billion with a weighted average cost of 4.4%. We also have $966 million of available debt capacity between our revolvers and undrawn term loan A. Last week, we completed an amendment to our credit agreement, which amends and further suspends our net leverage covenant until December 31, 2021, if we choose, replacing it with a minimum liquidity test of $500 million, which is measured against our free cash, available debt capacity and up to $250 million of our event-related deferred revenue. We believe that our free cash, together with our undrawn debt capacity, gives us sufficient liquidity to maintain critical operations until shows return.
Capital expenditures for the quarter were $55 million, giving us a total for the 6 months of $129 million. We are now estimating our full year spend to be approximately $215 million, down from our initial estimate for the year of $375 million. Of the remaining $86 million in capital expenditures for the year, approximately $30 million is for capitalized labor for updates to our ticketing systems, with the remainder largely venue-related and long-term projects.

We expect it to be more back-half loaded. But we do expect the onsales to be somewhere around a few towards the end of the year and the bulk of them as we get into the first quarter of the year.
Second question, in terms of the cash burn. The cash burn is with -- I'll call it, relatively limited inflows more similar to what we have in Q2. So we did have some inflows but not obviously at scale or substantial. The cash burn numbers we give you are assuming the status quo through Q4. And as we move further into it, and we have better visibility on Q4, there is some ramp-ups in activity, which would give us both increased contribution margin as well as increased costs. We'll guide you to that as we get closer. We thought the prudent simple thing to do at this point is to give you the status quo. And then as we have more going on, we'll increase both sides from there."

The press got a hold of a kind of a work in progress, which was too bad because it wasn't meant to be that. We -- [ for a living ] are negotiating deals with agents and managers. That's the business model. Their job is to look for competition, and our job is to bid on these shows in different terms for different artists in different times. So the process is always fluid. We're obviously trying to do our side of the negotiation and the agents do in their side. This got -- this -- look, I guess, as I got reported, it was just a mid-statement, and it wasn't meant to be anything more than that. But what we really wanted to accomplish is, I would just step back and say the industry overall has been amazing dealing with restructuring '20 into '21. The agents, the managers and all the artists all have been very cooperative that understand that if you had a show this year and you wanted to reschedule next year, some compromise in the terms would have to be met. And the biggest risk we all had on the promoting side that we wanted to make sure that we could incorporate was the refunds. Now the refunds, as we've seen, have been surprisingly really strong on the concert side. And we didn't know what we were going to head into when we started renegotiating. But we do know on festivals, refund rates are much higher because it's a bigger cash outlet, but it's also just a bigger time commitment. They don't tend to be as local as your average concert. So we wanted to make sure, going into '21, if you were a headline artist that was going to play a certain festival this year, and we wanted -- and you still wanted to play it next year, the 2 things we want to make sure that we were protected in and that we both shared some of the risk was a refund reduction and insurance. And those are the 2 principles, if you take all of the drama from the press leaks aside, those are the 2 things we wanted to make sure that we weren't stuck paying the same price in '20 if we had a 31% refund rate on the festival. Now if those tickets also backed through, and that festival ended up at the same place it was in '20, then we should all share the  upside. And every agent and artists and manager have been incredibly accommodating to all the promoters in the business who are looking for some help in terms of rescheduling next year's shows and taking, and refunding insurance, and making sure we are clear on those 2 terms. So that was the net result of it all. The rest was a wish list of things as we head into any negotiation. We'd all like to win but those are the 2 points that made sense that were most important for our business and for the festival P&Ls."

So I would say to you, if you had a tour that was on sale, and it wasn't doing well, you and the artist decided to pull it down and not to go forward with it regardless of COVID. So any tour that you rescheduled, you have the opportunity to look at that deal, and at that show, and the number of dates, et cetera, and negotiate with the agent manager and the artists on what was the best go-forward strategy. So anything -- we talk about 2021's going to be a spectacular year in the sense of the stuff that did get pushed, you can guarantee was all of the stuff that was selling well in high demand. So that stuff is all going to those shows will still be continuing next year. We didn't have anything really on sale for '21 ahead of our '20 season of any substance.

I think it was our last earnings call, we were kind of showing you some statistics to make sure that everyone understood that touring had not had a structural change. There was a debate back then whether fans would gather when they got out of this. I think if anything, we learned in 3 months, we got to figure out how they don't gather short term so we can have a better business faster. So I would just say to you that we have  been really, really -- we're going to play long on this one. So we have artists with lots of ideas on shows they could do now. We won't be doing DJ sets in the Hamptons anytime soon. We're going to play long and play safe. So the artists -- you nailed it, I was talking to an artist this morning. I think as you've read elsewhere, I think you're going to see a creative boom. I saw the record labels this week also down slightly because they need new releases and touring to happen to keep the machine moving. So yes, I think '21, you have artists that are all just keep calling me daily saying, when can I go? When is it going to be safe? When are we going to go? I'm dying to go? I got new music, I want to drop music. So I think this is why we believe long term, regardless of what quarter we exactly scale at, that the business will be stronger than ever with the creative push by all these artists who need to get on the road to drive their new music. So '21, '22, we can debate what quarter exactly ramps, but we believe '21 into '22 will be record years with artists on the road who are pent up. They need to get on the road economically, and they're now powered by creative backlog, and they're all waiting. I [indiscernible] this morning, they were going to release in November. They're going to wait until March now, so they can coincide with a tour scheduled later in the year in '21. So huge demand. We are very gifted in this industry and that we have an incredible supply chain of ongoing creative geniuses who make their living connecting with fans on the road. So that will continue. And we know now from all of the craziness we've seen across America, the fans are going to gather. We just got to make sure we could do it safely.
As far as canceling and postponing, one of the things we decided really early on was to make sure that we offered refunds on postponed events also. We didn't want deferred revenue to have any false narrative to it. And we still -- we are leading the industry. There are many companies that are not giving refunds, even ones that have got government money. But we believe that you need to offer the fans refunds for postponed and canceled shows, and we've done that. So we believe our actual number when we talk about fans holding on, it's real. We make it very easy for you to get a refund right now at Ticketmaster. If you go look at our site versus others. We even see a concert sold at Ticketmaster versus other ticket sites, the take rate is higher at Ticketmaster because it's very easy to get a refund. So I believe that the refund numbers are true. They're not suppressed in any manner on our business because we're offering both options. And if you see an artist that canceled versus postponed, it wouldn't be because he wants his fan to get money back. We've offered both those options for any tour. We have -- it may just be an artist that -- wasn't going to go -- was going to go on the road, probably an older artist that is looking at it saying, maybe I'm not going to run back and try to figure out if May is going to happen right now. I'll take a year off. So you've seen some of those ones, if they've said, I'll just wait. If you're a younger artist tied to more record releases, you're probably really still waiting and ready to go up probably a little earlier given your demo."

So if our model were perfect, then that would have already been taken out. And the second is, when we use the term deferred revenue, it is with regards to deferred revenue for events taking place over the next 12 months. That's never been an important nuance in the past because deferred revenue for things over a year ago has tended to be pretty small. But in this case, because we deferred a lot of shows into the second half of 2021, we have about $400 million of long-term deferred revenue that will flip into deferred revenue over the next 6 months. So your $900 million plus $400 million equals the $1.3 billion, rough numbers."

So first of all, to answer your question on what do you mean by scale. Does that scale our normal business model in the summer, we'd be doing several thousand concerts a quarter and for tens of millions of fans. So we're not going to try to predict right now the exactness. Is it 70%? Is it 90%? What percent of last year is it, but it's in that type of volume. So why do we think it's going to happen? A couple of things. First of all, I think the effort on the vaccine front are moving faster than anybody predicted 3 or 4 months ago, if you listened to the experts, the Dr. Faucis of the world, and what are they saying in terms of their expectations. Where you have multiple different vaccines with multiple different approaches and their belief that something is going to happen by the end of the year is one of the vectors that gives you some comfort.
The other is the progress being made on the treatments. We've obviously -- as a medical community, learned a huge amount over the past 4 months, in terms of the basic treatment, in terms of the -- perhaps the potential of antibody treatments, the use of other drugs, [ REM deceiver ] and others in terms of helping to reduce the mortality rate of it. So overall, in terms of -- as we've talked, we're going about the facts and the science lead us, we've been pleasantly surprised thus far on the progress of vaccines. Probably some of the testing and tracing has been slower, but still now is ramping up. So between the testing, the tracing, the treatment also providing opportunities. So amongst those, I think we believe sitting here today that the facts would say that by the beginning of the year, you're able to put on the tickets on sale with comfort, you're going to be able to do the shows next summer. And then for the reasons that we've talked about, we have a high degree of comfort that the demand is going to be there. 86% of the people keeping their tickets to the shows. 2/3 of the people keeping their tickets for festivals that were canceled this year. That have canceled, but still saying they want to go to the show next year instead of getting their refund. So in total, over 19 million tickets for [ 4,000 ] that have already been sold, which that alone, what we've already sold for 2021 would make us one of the largest promoters in the world. So all those factors together, I think, is what gives us the comfort."

Over the past 3 months, our top priority has been strengthening our financial position to ensure that we have the liquidity and flexibility to get through an extended period with no live events. Our expectatio",583,"Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Over the past 3 months, our top priority has been strengthening our financial position to ensure that we have the liquidity and flexibility to get through an extended period with no live events. Our expectation that live events will return at scale is the summer of 2021, with ticket sales ramping up in the quarters leading up to these shows. Importantly, we remain confident that fans will return to live events when it is safe to do so. 
Our strongest indicator of demand is that fans are holding on to their tickets even when given the option of a refund. Through the end of the second quarter, 86% of concert fans are keeping their tickets for rescheduled shows, demonstrating a continued desire to attend concerts in the future despite the current uncertainty. Our expectation for robust outdoor summer season in 2021 are also reinforced by the 2/3 of fans keeping their tickets for canceled festivals so they can go to next year's show, along with the strong early ticket sales for the festivals in the U.K. next summer, for example, Download and the Isle of Wight, are pacing well ahead of last year. Between the tickets held by fans for the rescheduled shows and these festival on-sales, we have already sold 19 million tickets to more than 4,000 concerts and festivals scheduled for 2021, creating a strong baseload of demand that is pacing well ahead of this point last year. At the same time, surveys continue to show that concerts remain fans' highest priority social event when it is safe to gather, with almost 90% of fans globally planning on attending concerts again. 
Understanding that it will be some time before we put on concerts at scale, we are innovating to find new and creative ways to help artists keep fans connected in the meantime. Virtual concerts have proven to be a huge demand with fans. So we established a Live From Home platform to provide a convenient place for fans of all types to find performances from their favorite artists. In the second quarter, we had 67 million fans and over 18,000 concerts and festivals globally. Among our highlights, this past weekend, we streamed 150 performances from our Virtual Lollapalooza Festival. Given the tremendous popularity of these shows, we are seeing the potential for live streaming to become an additional long-term component of our concert business, allowing fans in other cities or those who can't attend to enjoy the concert as well. At the same time, recognizing fans want to get back to attending concerts in person as soon as possible, we've launched socially distant shows when and where permitted, included in New Zealand, France, Denmark, Spain, Germany, Finland and as well as cities across the U.S. 
While this is a challenging time for everyone, the live events business in particular, there are a few things that I am confident about. We are well positioned to weather this crisis and we will get through this. When it is safe to return, we will have an abundance of fans and artists ready to join live music again. And Live Nation will do everything in its power to meet our responsibilities to artists, fans, our employees and everyone else affected by the shutdown by bringing back as much live music as fast as possible when it's responsible to do so. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Joe for more detail on our results."
384687,681032228,2061572,"Live Nation Entertainment, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2020",2020-08-05,"Earnings Calls","Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. As Michael mentioned, our top priority during this time has been strengthening our financial position, and we are confident that our actions taking to cut costs and increase liquidity will provide us with the",1057,"Thanks, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. As Michael mentioned, our top priority during this time has been strengthening our financial position, and we are confident that our actions taking to cut costs and increase liquidity will provide us with the runway we need until the time is right to bring shows back. We have now reduced costs for this year by over $800 million and reduced our cash usage by $1.4 billion relative to our pre-COVID plans. With these reductions, we have lowered the estimate on our operational cash burn rate to $125 million per month and our gross burn rate to $185 million per month on average for the second quarter through the end of the year. At the same time, we raised an additional $1.2 billion providing us with a $1.8 billion of free cash at the end of the second quarter, along with over $950 million of available debt capacity, totaling over $2.7 billion in readily available liquidity. And last week, we amended our credit agreement to suspend our maintenance covenant to a more favorable liquidity metric to Q4 of 2021, providing us with added flexibility until business returns. 
Turning to our Q2 results, starting with AOI. Our AOI for the quarter was a loss of $432 million driven primarily by operational fixed costs of $334 million, inclusive of approximately $60 million in benefits from various government payroll funding programs. So with our cost initiatives, we expect operational fixed costs to average approximately $125 million per month for the second quarter through the end of the year. We then had negative $98 million in contribution margin, largely driven by onetime events in Ticketmaster and our concerts business. For Ticketmaster, recording refunds for 11 million tickets across 42,000 shows generated a loss of approximately $79 million for our portion of the service fees. In our concerts business, writing off some costs associated with concerts that have been canceled or rescheduled for 2021, generated an expense of approximately $87 million, about 2/3 of which is a write-off of advertising expenses given the calendar year shift in show timing. Partially offsetting these expenses, we had $68 million of contribution margin generated by business operations and insurance recoveries for events impacted by the pandemic. 
Looking at free cash, we ended the first quarter with approximately $820 million in free cash, added $1.2 billion in cash from additional debt during the second quarter and then ended the quarter with $1.8 billion of free cash. This implies $250 million in cash used during the quarter. As part of this, we had a timing benefit to free cash of $415 million, which will flip back out in Q3 and Q4. Of this timing benefit, $225 million is accrued but not yet paid ticket refunds, and $190 million is working capital timing. This puts our total effective cash burn at $665 million for the quarter. The largest onetime impact was the payment of Ticketmaster refunds, which totaled $110 million for our portion of service fees refunded to fans during the quarter. 
We then had our operational cash burn. Starting with our $334 million in operational fixed costs then adding back $54 million of noncash benefits, our operational cash burn totaled $388 million for the quarter. In addition, we had $217 million of ongoing nonoperational cash burn items, including capital expenditures, acquisition activity, net advances and interest payments. These items ran slightly higher for the quarter due to contractually obligated payments for past acquisitions. So we expect this nonoperational component to our cash burn to average approximately $60 million per month for the second quarter through the end of the year. Finally, we had $50 million of inflows from operations and improved cash management. 
Lastly, let me give you an update on ticket refunds and how's that impacted our deferred revenue. Ticket refunds first. The global refund rate for Live Nation concerts that are rescheduled and are in or have gone through a refund window is 14% through the end of Q2. Festivals have generally canceled this year's events. But for festivals where fans can retain their tickets for next year's show, as Michael mentioned, about 2/3 of them are keeping their tickets. Across both concerts and festivals, we refunded $218 million for rescheduled shows since March. In addition, we have refunded $477 million for canceled shows over this period. Of this $695 million total, $230 million was funds held by third-party venues and $465 million from the Live Nation-held funds. We still have some shows in the process of rescheduling or are rescheduled but not yet offering refunds. If we apply the same fan behavior and mix on these events, we forecast approximately $270 million in additional fan refunds, of which about $180 million will be from Live Nation-held funds. Given this estimate, we have shifted these funds from deferred revenue to accrued but not yet paid ticket refunds. 
Now to look at how these refunds flow through our event-related deferred revenue. At the end of the first quarter, our deferred revenue for events over the next 12 months is $2 billion. At the end of the second quarter, deferred revenue for events in the next 12 months was $941 million. Of this approximately $1 billion decrease, $405 million was due to a shift from short-term deferred revenue to long-term deferred revenue as a number of concerts were shifted into the second half of 2021. As a result, we had $486 million of long-term deferred revenue at the end of the second quarter, of which we estimate approximately $400 million will shift back to short-term deferred revenue over the course of the year. The Live Nation concert ticket refunds recorded in the quarter then accounted for $465 million, and estimated additional future refunds from Live Nation-held cash totals $180 million. We then had ticket sales in the quarter that generated roughly $30 million of new deferred revenue. 
Looking at the rest of the year, our forecast for event-related deferred revenue at the end of the year prior to additional ticket sales and based on our projected refund rates is approximately $1.3 billion. Given all the uncertainty in the market and timing of shows, we cannot give you any further guidance beyond these burn rates and refund levels we just gave you. 
And with that, I will turn the call over to Kathy."

I will review our second quarter and 6-month results and provide updates on our balance sheet. All of our results for this quarter and the first 6 months of the year have been significantly impacted by the shutdown of our shows since mid-March due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which is driving all of the variances for both periods in total and across all segments. 
For the quarter, our revenue was $74 million compared to $3.2 billion last year, down 98%. AOI was a loss of $432 million for the quarter compared to earnings of $319 million in 2019. Our operating loss was $588 million compared to $172 million in operating income last year. And net loss for the quarter was $568 million compared to net income of $103 million in 2019. 
For the first 6 months, we generated $1.4 billion in revenue compared to $4.9 billion last year, down 71%. Most of this revenue in 2020 was driven by our show activity in the first 2.5 months of the year prior to the shutdown. AOI was a loss of $452 million for the first 6 months compared to income of $435 million in 2019. Our operating loss was $761 million compared to $148 million in operating income last year. And net loss for the first 6 months was $752 million compared to net income of $51 million in 2019. 
Now on to our balance sheet. As of June 30, we had total cash of $3.3 billion, which includes a free cash balance of $1.8 billion. Our total cash includes $941 million of current event-related deferred revenue as well as $486 million of long-term deferred revenue for events that have been rescheduled more than 1 year out as of June 30. This is part of our operating cash and therefore provides us additional liquidity. As Joe outlined, we estimate that our actions to conserve cash eliminates or defers approximately $1.4 billion in cash outflows for 2020, which includes the cash portion of our approximately $800 million in cost savings, along with a reduction in capital expenditures, lower acquisition activity and reduced concert and ticketing advances. 
In May 2020, we issued $1.2 billion principal amount of 6.5% senior secured notes due 2027. As of the end of the quarter, our total debt was $4.9 billion with a weighted average cost of 4.4%. We also have $966 million of available debt capacity between our revolvers and undrawn term loan A. Last week, we completed an amendment to our credit agreement, which amends and further suspends our net leverage covenant until December 31, 2021, if we choose, replacing it with a minimum liquidity test of $500 million, which is measured against our free cash, available debt capacity and up to $250 million of our event-related deferred revenue. We believe that our free cash, together with our undrawn debt capacity, gives us sufficient liquidity to maintain critical operations until shows return. 
Capital expenditures for the quarter were $55 million, giving us a total for the 6 months of $129 million. We are now estimating our full year spend to be approximately $215 million, down from our initial estimate for the year of $375 million.

In terms of the on-sales timing, as we indicated, we expect to be returning to scale with next summer particularly focused on the amphitheaters and festivals first. So I think that we would expect the usual timing of those on-sales, which would typically be for amphitheaters around the end of the year. So we don't expect for the full year the same. We expect it to be more back-half-loaded. But we do expect the on-sales to be somewhere around a few towards the end of the year and the bulk of them as we get into the first quarter of the year.
Second question in terms of the cash burn. The cash burn is with, I'll call it, relatively limited inflows more similar to what we have in Q2. So we did have some inflows but not obviously at scale or substantial. The cash burn numbers we gave you are assuming the status quo through Q4. And as we move further into it and we have better visibility on Q4, if there is some ramp-ups in activity which would give us both increased contribution margin as well as increased costs, we'll guide you to that as we get closer. But we thought that the more prudent and simple thing to do at this point is to give you the status quo. And then as we're -- as we have more going on, we'll increase both sides from there."

The press got ahold of a kind of a work in progress, which was too bad because it wasn't meant to be that. We, for a living, are negotiating deals with agents and managers. That's the business model. Their job is to look for competition, and our job is to bid on these shows in different terms for different artists and different times. So the process is always fluid. We're obviously trying to do our side of the negotiation and the agents do in their side. This got -- look -- this looked, I guess as it got reported, it was just a mid-statement. That wasn't meant to be anything more than that. But what we really wanted to accomplish is -- I would just step back and say the industry overall has been amazing dealing with restructuring '20 into '21. The agents, the managers and all the artists all have been very cooperative that -- understand that if you had a show this year and you wanted to reschedule next year, some compromise in the terms would have to be met. And the biggest risk we all had on the promoting side that we wanted to make sure that we could incorporate was the refunds. 
Now the refunds, as we've seen, have been surprisingly really strong on the concert side. And we didn't know what we were going to head into when we started renegotiating. But we do know on festivals, refund rates are much higher because it's a bigger cash outlet but it's also just a bigger time commitment. They don't tend to be as local as your average concert. So we wanted to make sure going into '21, if you were a headline artist that was going to play a certain festival this year and we wanted -- and you still wanted to play it next year, the 2 things we wanted to make sure that we were protected in and that we both shared some of the risk was a refund reduction and insurance. Those are the 2 principles. If you take all of the drama from the press leak aside, those are the 2 things we wanted to make sure that we weren't stuck paying the same price in '20 if we had a 31% refund rate on the festival. 
Now if those tickets also backed through and that festival ended up at the same place it was in '20, then we should all share the upside. And every agent and artists and manager have been incredibly accommodating to all the promoters in the business who are all looking for some help in terms of rescheduling next year's shows and taking and refunding insurance and making sure we are clear on those 2 terms. So that was the net result of it all. The rest was a wish list of things as we head into any negotiation. We'd all like to win but those are the 2 points that made sense that were most important for our business and for the festival P&Ls."

Every show basically was canceled in some sense, not to our doing. So everyone was in the same boat. You were all starting with a clean slate. So I would say to you, if you had a tour that was on sale and it wasn't doing well, you and the artist decided to pull it down and not go forward with it regardless of COVID. So any tour that you rescheduled, you have the opportunity to look at that deal and at that show and then the number of dates, et cetera, and negotiate with the agent, manager and the artists on what was the best go-forward strategy. So anything -- we talk about 2021 is going to be a spectacular year in the sense of the stuff that did get pushed, you can guarantee was all of the stuff that was selling well and high demand. So that stuff is all going to -- those shows will still be continuing next year. We didn't have anything really on sale for '21 ahead of our '20 season of any substance.

I think it was -- our last earnings call, we were kind of showing you some statistics to make sure that everyone understood that touring had not had a structural change. There was a debate back then whether fans would gather when they got out of this. I think if anything, we learned in 3 months. We got to figure out how they don't gather short term so we can have a better business faster. So I would just say to you that we have been really, really -- we're going to play long on this one. So we have artists with lots of ideas on shows they could do now. We won't be doing DJ sets in the Hamptons anytime soon. We're going to play long and play safe. 
So the artists -- you nailed it. I was talking to an artist this morning. I think as you've read elsewhere, I think you're going to see a creative boom. I saw the record labels this week also down slightly because they need new releases and touring to happen to keep the machine moving. So yes, I think '21, you have artists that are -- all just keep calling me daily saying, ""When can I go? When is it going to be safe? When are we going to go? I'm dying to go. I got new music. I want to drop music."" So I think this is why we believe long term, regardless of what quarter we exactly scale at, the business will be stronger than ever with the creative push by all these artists who need to get on the road to drive their new music. So '21, '22, we can debate what quarter exactly ramps, but we believe '21 into '22 will be record years with artists on the road who are pent up. They need to get on the road economically, and they're now powered by creative backlog, and they're all waiting. I talked to an artist this morning. They were going to release in November. They're going to wait until March now so they can coincide with a tour scheduled later in the year in '21. So huge demand. We are very gifted in this industry in that we have an incredible supply chain of ongoing creative geniuses who make their living connecting with fans on the road. So that will continue. And we know now from all of the craziness we've seen across America that fans are going to gather. We just got to make sure we can do it safely.
As far as canceling and postponing, one of the things we decided really early on was to make sure that we offered refunds on postponed events also. We didn't want our deferred -- we didn't want deferred revenue to have any false narrative to it. And we still -- we are leading the industry. There are many companies that are not giving refunds. I think even ones who've got government money. But we believe that you need to offer the fans refunds for postponed and canceled shows, and we've done that. So we believe our actual number. When we talk about fans holding on, it's real. We make it very easy for you to get a refund right now at Ticketmaster if you go look at our site versus others. We even see a concert sold at Ticketmaster versus other ticket sites, the take rate is higher at Ticketmaster because it's very easy to get a refund. So I believe that the refund numbers are true. They're not suppressed in any manner on our business because we're offering both options. And if you see an artist that canceled versus postponed, it wouldn't be because he wants his fan to get money back. We've offered both those options for any tour. We have -- it may just be an artist that wasn't going to go on -- was going to go on the road, probably an older artist that is looking at it saying, ""Maybe I'm not going to run back and try to figure out if May is going to happen right now. I'll take a year off."" So you've seen some of those ones if they've said, ""I'll just wait."" If you're a younger artist tied to more record releases, you're probably really still waiting and ready to go up probably a little earlier given your demo."

One is we -- as part of that $941 million, that includes $180 million of what we've modeled out as additional refunds that we expect to happen.

And the second is when we use the term deferred revenue, it is with regards to deferred revenue for events taking place over the next 12 months. That's never been an important nuance in the past because deferred revenue for things over a year ago has tended to be pretty small. But in this case, because we deferred a lot of shows into the second half of 2021, we have about $400 million of long-term deferred revenue that will flip into deferred revenue over the next 6 months.

So first of all, to answer your question on what do you mean by scale, that scale, our normal business model in the summer, we'd be doing several thousand concerts a quarter and for tens of millions of fans. So we're not going to try to predict right now the exactness. Is it 70%? Is it 90%? What percent of last year is it? But it's in that type of volume. So why do we think it's going to happen? A couple of things. First of all, I think the efforts on the vaccine front are moving faster than anybody predicted 3 or 4 months ago. If you listen to the experts, the Dr. Faucis of the world and what are they saying in terms of their expectations where you have multiple, different vaccines with multiple, different approaches and their belief that something is going to happen by the end of the year is one of the vectors that gives you some comfort. The other is the progress being made on the treatments. We've obviously, as a medical community, learned a huge amount over the past 4 months in terms of the basic treatment, in terms of the -- perhaps the potential of antibody treatments, the use of other drugs, remdesivir and others, in terms of helping to reduce the mortality rate of it. 
So overall, in terms of -- as we've talked, we'll let the facts and the science lead us. We've been pleasantly surprised thus far on the progress of vaccines. Probably some of the testing and tracing has been slower but still now is ramping up, so between the testing, the tracing, the treatment also providing opportunities. So amongst those, I think we believe sitting here today that the facts would say that by the beginning of the year, you're able to put on the tickets on sale with comfort, you're going to be able to do the shows next summer. And then for the reasons that we've talked about, we have a high degree of comfort that the demand is going to be there, 86% of the people keeping their tickets to the shows, 2/3 of the people keeping their tickets for festivals that were canceled this year -- that have canceled but still saying they want to go to the show next year instead of getting their refund. So in total, over 19 million tickets for 4,000 shows that have already been sold, which, that alone, what we've already sold for 2021, would make us one of the largest promoters in the world. So all those factors together, I think, is what gives us the comfort."

Over the past 3 months, our top priority has been strengthening our financial position to ensure that we have the liquidity and flexibility to get through an extended period with no live events. Our expectatio",583,"Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Over the past 3 months, our top priority has been strengthening our financial position to ensure that we have the liquidity and flexibility to get through an extended period with no live events. Our expectation that live events will return at scale is the summer of 2021, with ticket sales ramping up in the quarters leading up to these shows. Importantly, we remain confident that fans will return to live events when it is safe to do so. 
Our strongest indicator of demand is that fans are holding on to their tickets even when given the option of a refund. Through the end of the second quarter, 86% of concert fans are keeping their tickets for rescheduled shows, demonstrating a continued desire to attend concerts in the future despite the current uncertainty. Our expectation for robust outdoor summer season in 2021 are also reinforced by the 2/3 of fans keeping their tickets for canceled festivals so they can go to next year's show, along with the strong early ticket sales for the festivals in the U.K. next summer, for example, Download and the Isle of Wight, are pacing well ahead of last year. Between the tickets held by fans for the rescheduled shows and these festival on-sales, we have already sold 19 million tickets to more than 4,000 concerts and festivals scheduled for 2021, creating a strong baseload of demand that is pacing well ahead of this point last year. At the same time, surveys continue to show that concerts remain fans' highest priority social event when it is safe to gather, with almost 90% of fans globally planning on attending concerts again. 
Understanding that it will be some time before we put on concerts at scale, we are innovating to find new and creative ways to help artists keep fans connected in the meantime. Virtual concerts have proven to be a huge demand with fans. So we established a Live From Home platform to provide a convenient place for fans of all types to find performances from their favorite artists. In the second quarter, we had 67 million fans and over 18,000 concerts and festivals globally. Among our highlights, this past weekend, we streamed 150 performances from our Virtual Lollapalooza Festival. Given the tremendous popularity of these shows, we are seeing the potential for live streaming to become an additional long-term component of our concert business, allowing fans in other cities or those who can't attend to enjoy the concert as well. At the same time, recognizing fans want to get back to attending concerts in person as soon as possible, we've launched socially distant shows when and where permitted, included in New Zealand, France, Denmark, Spain, Germany, Finland and as well as cities across the U.S. 
While this is a challenging time for everyone, the live events business in particular, there are a few things that I am confident about. We are well positioned to weather this crisis and we will get through this. When it is safe to return, we will have an abundance of fans and artists ready to join live music again. And Live Nation will do everything in its power to meet our responsibilities to artists, fans, our employees and everyone else affected by the shutdown by bringing back as much live music as fast as possible when it's responsible to do so. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Joe for more detail on our results."

As Michael mentioned, our top priority during this time has been strengthening our financial position, and we are confident that our actions taking to cut costs and increase liquidity will provide us with the",1057,"Thanks, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. As Michael mentioned, our top priority during this time has been strengthening our financial position, and we are confident that our actions taking to cut costs and increase liquidity will provide us with the runway we need until the time is right to bring shows back. We have now reduced costs for this year by over $800 million and reduced our cash usage by $1.4 billion relative to our pre-COVID plans. With these reductions, we have lowered the estimate on our operational cash burn rate to $125 million per month and our gross burn rate to $185 million per month on average for the second quarter through the end of the year. At the same time, we raised an additional $1.2 billion providing us with a $1.8 billion of free cash at the end of the second quarter, along with over $950 million of available debt capacity, totaling over $2.7 billion in readily available liquidity. And last week, we amended our credit agreement to suspend our maintenance covenant to a more favorable liquidity metric to Q4 of 2021, providing us with added flexibility until business returns. 
Turning to our Q2 results, starting with AOI. Our AOI for the quarter was a loss of $432 million driven primarily by operational fixed costs of $334 million, inclusive of approximately $60 million in benefits from various government payroll funding programs. So with our cost initiatives, we expect operational fixed costs to average approximately $125 million per month for the second quarter through the end of the year. We then had negative $98 million in contribution margin, largely driven by onetime events in Ticketmaster and our concerts business. For Ticketmaster, recording refunds for 11 million tickets across 42,000 shows generated a loss of approximately $79 million for our portion of the service fees. In our concerts business, writing off some costs associated with concerts that have been canceled or rescheduled for 2021, generated an expense of approximately $87 million, about 2/3 of which is a write-off of advertising expenses given the calendar year shift in show timing. Partially offsetting these expenses, we had $68 million of contribution margin generated by business operations and insurance recoveries for events impacted by the pandemic. 
Looking at free cash, we ended the first quarter with approximately $820 million in free cash, added $1.2 billion in cash from additional debt during the second quarter and then ended the quarter with $1.8 billion of free cash. This implies $250 million in cash used during the quarter. As part of this, we had a timing benefit to free cash of $415 million, which will flip back out in Q3 and Q4. Of this timing benefit, $225 million is accrued but not yet paid ticket refunds, and $190 million is working capital timing. This puts our total effective cash burn at $665 million for the quarter. The largest onetime impact was the payment of Ticketmaster refunds, which totaled $110 million for our portion of service fees refunded to fans during the quarter. 
We then had our operational cash burn. Starting with our $334 million in operational fixed costs then adding back $54 million of noncash benefits, our operational cash burn totaled $388 million for the quarter. In addition, we had $217 million of ongoing nonoperational cash burn items, including capital expenditures, acquisition activity, net advances and interest payments. These items ran slightly higher for the quarter due to contractually obligated payments for past acquisitions. So we expect this nonoperational component to our cash burn to average approximately $60 million per month for the second quarter through the end of the year. Finally, we had $50 million of inflows from operations and improved cash management. 
Lastly, let me give you an update on ticket refunds and how's that impacted our deferred revenue. Ticket refunds first. The global refund rate for Live Nation concerts that are rescheduled and are in or have gone through a refund window is 14% through the end of Q2. Festivals have generally canceled this year's events. But for festivals where fans can retain their tickets for next year's show, as Michael mentioned, about 2/3 of them are keeping their tickets. Across both concerts and festivals, we refunded $218 million for rescheduled shows since March. In addition, we have refunded $477 million for canceled shows over this period. Of this $695 million total, $230 million was funds held by third-party venues and $465 million from the Live Nation-held funds. We still have some shows in the process of rescheduling or are rescheduled but not yet offering refunds. If we apply the same fan behavior and mix on these events, we forecast approximately $270 million in additional fan refunds, of which about $180 million will be from Live Nation-held funds. Given this estimate, we have shifted these funds from deferred revenue to accrued but not yet paid ticket refunds. 
Now to look at how these refunds flow through our event-related deferred revenue. At the end of the first quarter, our deferred revenue for events over the next 12 months is $2 billion. At the end of the second quarter, deferred revenue for events in the next 12 months was $941 million. Of this approximately $1 billion decrease, $405 million was due to a shift from short-term deferred revenue to long-term deferred revenue as a number of concerts were shifted into the second half of 2021. As a result, we had $486 million of long-term deferred revenue at the end of the second quarter, of which we estimate approximately $400 million will shift back to short-term deferred revenue over the course of the year. The Live Nation concert ticket refunds recorded in the quarter then accounted for $465 million, and estimated additional future refunds from Live Nation-held cash totals $180 million. We then had ticket sales in the quarter that generated roughly $30 million of new deferred revenue. 
Looking at the rest of the year, our forecast for event-related deferred revenue at the end of the year prior to additional ticket sales and based on our projected refund rates is approximately $1.3 billion. Given all the uncertainty in the market and timing of shows, we cannot give you any further guidance beyond these burn rates and refund levels we just gave you. 
And with that, I will turn the call over to Kathy."

I will review our second quarter and 6-month results and provide updates on our balance sheet. All of our results for this quarter and the first 6 months of the year have been significantly impacted by the shutdown of our shows since mid-March due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which is driving all of the variances for both periods in total and across all segments. 
For the quarter, our revenue was $74 million compared to $3.2 billion last year, down 98%. AOI was a loss of $432 million for the quarter compared to earnings of $319 million in 2019. Our operating loss was $588 million compared to $172 million in operating income last year. And net loss for the quarter was $568 million compared to net income of $103 million in 2019. 
For the first 6 months, we generated $1.4 billion in revenue compared to $4.9 billion last year, down 71%. Most of this revenue in 2020 was driven by our show activity in the first 2.5 months of the year prior to the shutdown. AOI was a loss of $452 million for the first 6 months compared to income of $435 million in 2019. Our operating loss was $761 million compared to $148 million in operating income last year. And net loss for the first 6 months was $752 million compared to net income of $51 million in 2019. 
Now on to our balance sheet. As of June 30, we had total cash of $3.3 billion, which includes a free cash balance of $1.8 billion. Our total cash includes $941 million of current event-related deferred revenue as well as $486 million of long-term deferred revenue for events that have been rescheduled more than 1 year out as of June 30. This is part of our operating cash and therefore provides us additional liquidity. As Joe outlined, we estimate that our actions to conserve cash eliminates or defers approximately $1.4 billion in cash outflows for 2020, which includes the cash portion of our approximately $800 million in cost savings, along with a reduction in capital expenditures, lower acquisition activity and reduced concert and ticketing advances. 
In May 2020, we issued $1.2 billion principal amount of 6.5% senior secured notes due 2027. As of the end of the quarter, our total debt was $4.9 billion with a weighted average cost of 4.4%. We also have $966 million of available debt capacity between our revolvers and undrawn term loan A. Last week, we completed an amendment to our credit agreement, which amends and further suspends our net leverage covenant until December 31, 2021, if we choose, replacing it with a minimum liquidity test of $500 million, which is measured against our free cash, available debt capacity and up to $250 million of our event-related deferred revenue. We believe that our free cash, together with our undrawn debt capacity, gives us sufficient liquidity to maintain critical operations until shows return. 
Capital expenditures for the quarter were $55 million, giving us a total for the 6 months of $129 million. We are now estimating our full year spend to be approximately $215 million, down from our initial estimate for the year of $375 million. Of the remaining $86 million in capital expenditures for the year, approximately $30 million is for capitalized labor for updates to our ticketing systems, with the remainder largely venue-related and long-term projects.

So I think that we would expect the usual timing of those on-sales, which would typically be for amphitheaters around the end of the year. So we don't expect for the full year the same. We expect it to be more back-half-loaded. But we do expect the on-sales to be somewhere around a few towards the end of the year and the bulk of them as we get into the first quarter of the year.
Second question in terms of the cash burn. The cash burn is with, I'll call it, relatively limited inflows more similar to what we have in Q2. So we did have some inflows but not obviously at scale or substantial. The cash burn numbers we gave you are assuming the status quo through Q4. And as we move further into it and we have better visibility on Q4, if there is some ramp-ups in activity which would give us both increased contribution margin as well as increased costs, we'll guide you to that as we get closer. But we thought that the more prudent and simple thing to do at this point is to give you the status quo. And then as we're -- as we have more going on, we'll increase both sides from there."

The press got ahold of a kind of a work in progress, which was too bad because it wasn't meant to be that. We, for a living, are negotiating deals with agents and managers. That's the business model. Their job is to look for competition, and our job is to bid on these shows in different terms for different artists and different times. So the process is always fluid. We're obviously trying to do our side of the negotiation and the agents do in their side. This got -- look -- this looked, I guess as it got reported, it was just a mid-statement. That wasn't meant to be anything more than that. But what we really wanted to accomplish is -- I would just step back and say the industry overall has been amazing dealing with restructuring '20 into '21. The agents, the managers and all the artists all have been very cooperative that -- understand that if you had a show this year and you wanted to reschedule next year, some compromise in the terms would have to be met. And the biggest risk we all had on the promoting side that we wanted to make sure that we could incorporate was the refunds. 
Now the refunds, as we've seen, have been surprisingly really strong on the concert side. And we didn't know what we were going to head into when we started renegotiating. But we do know on festivals, refund rates are much higher because it's a bigger cash outlet but it's also just a bigger time commitment. They don't tend to be as local as your average concert. So we wanted to make sure going into '21, if you were a headline artist that was going to play a certain festival this year and we wanted -- and you still wanted to play it next year, the 2 things we wanted to make sure that we were protected in and that we both shared some of the risk was a refund reduction and insurance. Those are the 2 principles. If you take all of the drama from the press leak aside, those are the 2 things we wanted to make sure that we weren't stuck paying the same price in '20 if we had a 31% refund rate on the festival. 
Now if those tickets also backed through and that festival ended up at the same place it was in '20, then we should all share the upside. And every agent and artists and manager have been incredibly accommodating to all the promoters in the business who are all looking for some help in terms of rescheduling next year's shows and taking and refunding insurance and making sure we are clear on those 2 terms. So that was the net result of it all. The rest was a wish list of things as we head into any negotiation. We'd all like to win but those are the 2 points that made sense that were most important for our business and for the festival P&Ls."

Every show basically was canceled in some sense, not to our doing. So everyone was in the same boat. You were all starting with a clean slate. So I would say to you, if you had a tour that was on sale and it wasn't doing well, you and the artist decided to pull it down and not go forward with it regardless of COVID. So any tour that you rescheduled, you have the opportunity to look at that deal and at that show and then the number of dates, et cetera, and negotiate with the agent, manager and the artists on what was the best go-forward strategy. So anything -- we talk about 2021 is going to be a spectacular year in the sense of the stuff that did get pushed, you can guarantee was all of the stuff that was selling well and high demand. So that stuff is all going to -- those shows will still be continuing next year. We didn't have anything really on sale for '21 ahead of our '20 season of any substance. We -- 95% of what we were dealing with was 2020 rescheduled to '21 shows."

I think it was -- our last earnings call, we were kind of showing you some statistics to make sure that everyone understood that touring had not had a structural change.

I think it was -- our last earnings call, we were kind of showing you some statistics to make sure that everyone understood that touring had not had a structural change. There was a debate back then whether fans would gather when they got out of this. I think if anything, we learned in 3 months. We got to figure out how they don't gather short term so we can have a better business faster. So I would just say to you that we have been really, really -- we're going to play long on this one. So we have artists with lots of ideas on shows they could do now. We won't be doing DJ sets in the Hamptons anytime soon. We're going to play long and play safe. 
So the artists -- you nailed it. I was talking to an artist this morning. I think as you've read elsewhere, I think you're going to see a creative boom. I saw the record labels this week also down slightly because they need new releases and touring to happen to keep the machine moving. So yes, I think '21, you have artists that are -- all just keep calling me daily saying, ""When can I go? When is it going to be safe? When are we going to go? I'm dying to go. I got new music. I want to drop music."" So I think this is why we believe long term, regardless of what quarter we exactly scale at, the business will be stronger than ever with the creative push by all these artists who need to get on the road to drive their new music. So '21, '22, we can debate what quarter exactly ramps, but we believe '21 into '22 will be record years with artists on the road who are pent up. They need to get on the road economically, and they're now powered by creative backlog, and they're all waiting. I talked to an artist this morning. They were going to release in November. They're going to wait until March now so they can coincide with a tour scheduled later in the year in '21. So huge demand. We are very gifted in this industry in that we have an incredible supply chain of ongoing creative geniuses who make their living connecting with fans on the road. So that will continue. And we know now from all of the craziness we've seen across America that fans are going to gather. We just got to make sure we can do it safely.
As far as canceling and postponing, one of the things we decided really early on was to make sure that we offered refunds on postponed events also. We didn't want our deferred -- we didn't want deferred revenue to have any false narrative to it. And we still -- we are leading the industry. There are many companies that are not giving refunds. I think even ones who've got government money. But we believe that you need to offer the fans refunds for postponed and canceled shows, and we've done that. So we believe our actual number. When we talk about fans holding on, it's real. We make it very easy for you to get a refund right now at Ticketmaster if you go look at our site versus others. We even see a concert sold at Ticketmaster versus other ticket sites, the take rate is higher at Ticketmaster because it's very easy to get a refund. So I believe that the refund numbers are true. They're not suppressed in any manner on our business because we're offering both options. And if you see an artist that canceled versus postponed, it wouldn't be because he wants his fan to get money back. We've offered both those options for any tour. We have -- it may just be an artist that wasn't going to go on -- was going to go on the road, probably an older artist that is looking at it saying, ""Maybe I'm not going to run back and try to figure out if May is going to happen right now. I'll take a year off."" So you've seen some of those ones if they've said, ""I'll just wait."" If you're a younger artist tied to more record releases, you're probably really still waiting and ready to go up probably a little earlier given your demo."

One is we -- as part of that $941 million, that includes $180 million of what we've modeled out as additional refunds that we expect to happen.

And the second is when we use the term deferred revenue, it is with regards to deferred revenue for events taking place over the next 12 months. That's never been an important nuance in the past because deferred revenue for things over a year ago has tended to be pretty small. But in this case, because we deferred a lot of shows into the second half of 2021, we have about $400 million of long-term deferred revenue that will flip into deferred revenue over the next 6 months. So your $900 million plus $400 million equals the $1.3 billion, rough numbers."

So first of all, to answer your question on what do you mean by scale, that scale, our normal business model in the summer, we'd be doing several thousand concerts a quarter and for tens of millions of fans. So we're not going to try to predict right now the exactness. Is it 70%? Is it 90%? What percent of last year is it? But it's in that type of volume. So why do we think it's going to happen? A couple of things. First of all, I think the efforts on the vaccine front are moving faster than anybody predicted 3 or 4 months ago. If you listen to the experts, the Dr. Faucis of the world and what are they saying in terms of their expectations where you have multiple, different vaccines with multiple, different approaches and their belief that something is going to happen by the end of the year is one of the vectors that gives you some comfort. The other is the progress being made on the treatments. We've obviously, as a medical community, learned a huge amount over the past 4 months in terms of the basic treatment, in terms of the -- perhaps the potential of antibody treatments, the use of other drugs, remdesivir and others, in terms of helping to reduce the mortality rate of it. 
So overall, in terms of -- as we've talked, we'll let the facts and the science lead us. We've been pleasantly surprised thus far on the progress of vaccines. Probably some of the testing and tracing has been slower but still now is ramping up, so between the testing, the tracing, the treatment also providing opportunities. So amongst those, I think we believe sitting here today that the facts would say that by the beginning of the year, you're able to put on the tickets on sale with comfort, you're going to be able to do the shows next summer. And then for the reasons that we've talked about, we have a high degree of comfort that the demand is going to be there, 86% of the people keeping their tickets to the shows, 2/3 of the people keeping their tickets for festivals that were canceled this year -- that have canceled but still saying they want to go to the show next year instead of getting their refund. So in total, over 19 million tickets for 4,000 shows that have already been sold, which, that alone, what we've already sold for 2021, would make us one of the largest promoters in the world. So all those factors together, I think, is what gives us the comfort."

So I don't think you'll see it there -- any effect there. I would say that it looks like in most of the countries, maybe the U.S. now, there's ongoing stimulus programs in effect and -- that seem to be coming to life for the live business in general, whether it's the employees, whether it's the venues, small or big. So I would assume some of them will have a continued, ongoing support through government programs to keep them afloat through this time. I mean listen, we're all in the same boat. We're all looking to figure out how to get through the downtime and reduce costs. And I think they're banding together, and hopefully, they'll find their support systems also."

Our expectatio",583,"Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Over the past 3 months, our top priority has been strengthening our financial position to ensure that we have the liquidity and flexibility to get through an extended period with no live events. Our expectation that live events will return at scale is the summer of 2021, with ticket sales ramping up in the quarters leading up to these shows. Importantly, we remain confident that fans will return to live events when it is safe to do so. 
Our strongest indicator of demand is that fans are holding on to their tickets even when given the option of a refund. Through the end of the second quarter, 86% of concert fans are keeping their tickets for rescheduled shows, demonstrating a continued desire to attend concerts in the future despite the current uncertainty. Our expectation for robust outdoor summer season in 2021 are also reinforced by the 2/3 of fans keeping their tickets for canceled festivals so they can go to next year's show, along with the strong early ticket sales for the festivals in the U.K. next summer, for example, Download and the Isle of Wight, are pacing well ahead of last year. Between the tickets held by fans for the rescheduled shows and these festival on-sales, we have already sold 19 million tickets to more than 4,000 concerts and festivals scheduled for 2021, creating a strong baseload of demand that is pacing well ahead of this point last year. At the same time, surveys continue to show that concerts remain fans' highest priority social event when it is safe to gather, with almost 90% of fans globally planning on attending concerts again. 
Understanding that it will be some time before we put on concerts at scale, we are innovating to find new and creative ways to help artists keep fans connected in the meantime. Virtual concerts have proven to be a huge demand with fans. So we established a Live From Home platform to provide a convenient place for fans of all types to find performances from their favorite artists. In the second quarter, we had 67 million fans and over 18,000 concerts and festivals globally. Among our highlights, this past weekend, we streamed 150 performances from our Virtual Lollapalooza Festival. Given the tremendous popularity of these shows, we are seeing the potential for live streaming to become an additional long-term component of our concert business, allowing fans in other cities or those who can't attend to enjoy the concert as well. At the same time, recognizing fans want to get back to attending concerts in person as soon as possible, we've launched socially distant shows when and where permitted, included in New Zealand, France, Denmark, Spain, Germany, Finland and as well as cities across the U.S. 
While this is a challenging time for everyone, the live events business in particular, there are a few things that I am confident about. We are well positioned to weather this crisis and we will get through this. When it is safe to return, we will have an abundance of fans and artists ready to join live music again. And Live Nation will do everything in its power to meet our responsibilities to artists, fans, our employees and everyone else affected by the shutdown by bringing back as much live music as fast as possible when it's responsible to do so. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Joe for more detail on our results."

As Michael mentioned, our top priority during this time has been strengthening our financial position, and we are confident that our actions taking to cut costs and increase liquidity will provide us with the",1057,"Thanks, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. As Michael mentioned, our top priority during this time has been strengthening our financial position, and we are confident that our actions taking to cut costs and increase liquidity will provide us with the runway we need until the time is right to bring shows back. We have now reduced costs for this year by over $800 million and reduced our cash usage by $1.4 billion relative to our pre-COVID plans. With these reductions, we have lowered the estimate on our operational cash burn rate to $125 million per month and our gross burn rate to $185 million per month on average for the second quarter through the end of the year. At the same time, we raised an additional $1.2 billion providing us with a $1.8 billion of free cash at the end of the second quarter, along with over $950 million of available debt capacity, totaling over $2.7 billion in readily available liquidity. And last week, we amended our credit agreement to suspend our maintenance covenant to a more favorable liquidity metric to Q4 of 2021, providing us with added flexibility until business returns. 
Turning to our Q2 results, starting with AOI. Our AOI for the quarter was a loss of $432 million driven primarily by operational fixed costs of $334 million, inclusive of approximately $60 million in benefits from various government payroll funding programs. So with our cost initiatives, we expect operational fixed costs to average approximately $125 million per month for the second quarter through the end of the year. We then had negative $98 million in contribution margin, largely driven by onetime events in Ticketmaster and our concerts business. For Ticketmaster, recording refunds for 11 million tickets across 42,000 shows generated a loss of approximately $79 million for our portion of the service fees. In our concerts business, writing off some costs associated with concerts that have been canceled or rescheduled for 2021, generated an expense of approximately $87 million, about 2/3 of which is a write-off of advertising expenses given the calendar year shift in show timing. Partially offsetting these expenses, we had $68 million of contribution margin generated by business operations and insurance recoveries for events impacted by the pandemic. 
Looking at free cash, we ended the first quarter with approximately $820 million in free cash, added $1.2 billion in cash from additional debt during the second quarter and then ended the quarter with $1.8 billion of free cash. This implies $250 million in cash used during the quarter. As part of this, we had a timing benefit to free cash of $415 million, which will flip back out in Q3 and Q4. Of this timing benefit, $225 million is accrued but not yet paid ticket refunds, and $190 million is working capital timing. This puts our total effective cash burn at $665 million for the quarter. The largest onetime impact was the payment of Ticketmaster refunds, which totaled $110 million for our portion of service fees refunded to fans during the quarter. 
We then had our operational cash burn. Starting with our $334 million in operational fixed costs then adding back $54 million of noncash benefits, our operational cash burn totaled $388 million for the quarter. In addition, we had $217 million of ongoing nonoperational cash burn items, including capital expenditures, acquisition activity, net advances and interest payments. These items ran slightly higher for the quarter due to contractually obligated payments for past acquisitions. So we expect this nonoperational component to our cash burn to average approximately $60 million per month for the second quarter through the end of the year. Finally, we had $50 million of inflows from operations and improved cash management. 
Lastly, let me give you an update on ticket refunds and how's that impacted our deferred revenue. Ticket refunds first. The global refund rate for Live Nation concerts that are rescheduled and are in or have gone through a refund window is 14% through the end of Q2. Festivals have generally canceled this year's events. But for festivals where fans can retain their tickets for next year's show, as Michael mentioned, about 2/3 of them are keeping their tickets. Across both concerts and festivals, we refunded $218 million for rescheduled shows since March. In addition, we have refunded $477 million for canceled shows over this period. Of this $695 million total, $230 million was funds held by third-party venues and $465 million from the Live Nation-held funds. We still have some shows in the process of rescheduling or are rescheduled but not yet offering refunds. If we apply the same fan behavior and mix on these events, we forecast approximately $270 million in additional fan refunds, of which about $180 million will be from Live Nation-held funds. Given this estimate, we have shifted these funds from deferred revenue to accrued but not yet paid ticket refunds. 
Now to look at how these refunds flow through our event-related deferred revenue. At the end of the first quarter, our deferred revenue for events over the next 12 months is $2 billion. At the end of the second quarter, deferred revenue for events in the next 12 months was $941 million. Of this approximately $1 billion decrease, $405 million was due to a shift from short-term deferred revenue to long-term deferred revenue as a number of concerts were shifted into the second half of 2021. As a result, we had $486 million of long-term deferred revenue at the end of the second quarter, of which we estimate approximately $400 million will shift back to short-term deferred revenue over the course of the year. The Live Nation concert ticket refunds recorded in the quarter then accounted for $465 million, and estimated additional future refunds from Live Nation-held cash totals $180 million. We then had ticket sales in the quarter that generated roughly $30 million of new deferred revenue. 
Looking at the rest of the year, our forecast for event-related deferred revenue at the end of the year prior to additional ticket sales and based on our projected refund rates is approximately $1.3 billion. Given all the uncertainty in the market and timing of shows, we cannot give you any further guidance beyond these burn rates and refund levels we just gave you. 
And with that, I will turn the call over to Kathy."

I will review our second quarter and 6-month results and provide updates on our balance sheet. All of our results for this quarter and the first 6 months of the year have been significantly impacted by the shutdown of our shows since mid-March due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which is driving all of the variances for both periods in total and across all segments. 
For the quarter, our revenue was $74 million compared to $3.2 billion last year, down 98%. AOI was a loss of $432 million for the quarter compared to earnings of $319 million in 2019. Our operating loss was $588 million compared to $172 million in operating income last year. And net loss for the quarter was $568 million compared to net income of $103 million in 2019. 
For the first 6 months, we generated $1.4 billion in revenue compared to $4.9 billion last year, down 71%. Most of this revenue in 2020 was driven by our show activity in the first 2.5 months of the year prior to the shutdown. AOI was a loss of $452 million for the first 6 months compared to income of $435 million in 2019. Our operating loss was $761 million compared to $148 million in operating income last year. And net loss for the first 6 months was $752 million compared to net income of $51 million in 2019. 
Now on to our balance sheet. As of June 30, we had total cash of $3.3 billion, which includes a free cash balance of $1.8 billion. Our total cash includes $941 million of current event-related deferred revenue as well as $486 million of long-term deferred revenue for events that have been rescheduled more than 1 year out as of June 30. This is part of our operating cash and therefore provides us additional liquidity. As Joe outlined, we estimate that our actions to conserve cash eliminates or defers approximately $1.4 billion in cash outflows for 2020, which includes the cash portion of our approximately $800 million in cost savings, along with a reduction in capital expenditures, lower acquisition activity and reduced concert and ticketing advances. 
In May 2020, we issued $1.2 billion principal amount of 6.5% senior secured notes due 2027. As of the end of the quarter, our total debt was $4.9 billion with a weighted average cost of 4.4%. We also have $966 million of available debt capacity between our revolvers and undrawn term loan A. Last week, we completed an amendment to our credit agreement, which amends and further suspends our net leverage covenant until December 31, 2021, if we choose, replacing it with a minimum liquidity test of $500 million, which is measured against our free cash, available debt capacity and up to $250 million of our event-related deferred revenue. We believe that our free cash, together with our undrawn debt capacity, gives us sufficient liquidity to maintain critical operations until shows return. 
Capital expenditures for the quarter were $55 million, giving us a total for the 6 months of $129 million. We are now estimating our full year spend to be approximately $215 million, down from our initial estimate for the year of $375 million. Of the remaining $86 million in capital expenditures for the year, approximately $30 million is for capitalized labor for updates to our ticketing systems, with the remainder largely venue-related and long-term projects.

In terms of the on-sales timing, as we indicated, we expect to be returning to scale with next summer particularly focused on the amphitheaters and festivals first. So I think that we would expect the usual timing of those on-sales, which would typically be for amphitheaters around the end of the year. So we don't expect for the full year the same. We expect it to be more back-half-loaded. But we do expect the on-sales to be somewhere around a few towards the end of the year and the bulk of them as we get into the first quarter of the year.
Second question in terms of the cash burn. The cash burn is with, I'll call it, relatively limited inflows more similar to what we have in Q2. So we did have some inflows but not obviously at scale or substantial. The cash burn numbers we gave you are assuming the status quo through Q4. And as we move further into it and we have better visibility on Q4, if there is some ramp-ups in activity which would give us both increased contribution margin as well as increased costs, we'll guide you to that as we get closer. But we thought that the more prudent and simple thing to do at this point is to give you the status quo. And then as we're -- as we have more going on, we'll increase both sides from there."

The press got ahold of a kind of a work in progress, which was too bad because it wasn't meant to be that. We, for a living, are negotiating deals with agents and managers. That's the business model. Their job is to look for competition, and our job is to bid on these shows in different terms for different artists and different times. So the process is always fluid. We're obviously trying to do our side of the negotiation and the agents do in their side. This got -- look -- this looked, I guess as it got reported, it was just a mid-statement. That wasn't meant to be anything more than that. But what we really wanted to accomplish is -- I would just step back and say the industry overall has been amazing dealing with restructuring '20 into '21. The agents, the managers and all the artists all have been very cooperative that -- understand that if you had a show this year and you wanted to reschedule next year, some compromise in the terms would have to be met. And the biggest risk we all had on the promoting side that we wanted to make sure that we could incorporate was the refunds. 
Now the refunds, as we've seen, have been surprisingly really strong on the concert side. And we didn't know what we were going to head into when we started renegotiating. But we do know on festivals, refund rates are much higher because it's a bigger cash outlet but it's also just a bigger time commitment. They don't tend to be as local as your average concert. So we wanted to make sure going into '21, if you were a headline artist that was going to play a certain festival this year and we wanted -- and you still wanted to play it next year, the 2 things we wanted to make sure that we were protected in and that we both shared some of the risk was a refund reduction and insurance. Those are the 2 principles. If you take all of the drama from the press leak aside, those are the 2 things we wanted to make sure that we weren't stuck paying the same price in '20 if we had a 31% refund rate on the festival. 
Now if those tickets also backed through and that festival ended up at the same place it was in '20, then we should all share the upside. And every agent and artists and manager have been incredibly accommodating to all the promoters in the business who are all looking for some help in terms of rescheduling next year's shows and taking and refunding insurance and making sure we are clear on those 2 terms. So that was the net result of it all. The rest was a wish list of things as we head into any negotiation. We'd all like to win but those are the 2 points that made sense that were most important for our business and for the festival P&Ls."

So I would say to you, if you had a tour that was on sale and it wasn't doing well, you and the artist decided to pull it down and not go forward with it regardless of COVID. So any tour that you rescheduled, you have the opportunity to look at that deal and at that show and then the number of dates, et cetera, and negotiate with the agent, manager and the artists on what was the best go-forward strategy. So anything -- we talk about 2021 is going to be a spectacular year in the sense of the stuff that did get pushed, you can guarantee was all of the stuff that was selling well and high demand. So that stuff is all going to -- those shows will still be continuing next year. We didn't have anything really on sale for '21 ahead of our '20 season of any substance.

I know a lot either postponing releasing new music or at least some have. Others, I'm sure, are trying to be sensitive to the economic pressures that their fans are seeing. What are you hearing from artists that you have relationships with around getting back on the road sooner rather than later? And maybe a similar question for you on their decision process on canceling versus postponing. I think there have been some who have decided to cancel in order to help their fans get their money back faster. I don't know if that was something you thought would grow as the year progressed. And then I just had a follow-up on the deferred revenue point."

I think it was -- our last earnings call, we were kind of showing you some statistics to make sure that everyone understood that touring had not had a structural change.

I think it was -- our last earnings call, we were kind of showing you some statistics to make sure that everyone understood that touring had not had a structural change. There was a debate back then whether fans would gather when they got out of this. I think if anything, we learned in 3 months. We got to figure out how they don't gather short term so we can have a better business faster. So I would just say to you that we have been really, really -- we're going to play long on this one. So we have artists with lots of ideas on shows they could do now. We won't be doing DJ sets in the Hamptons anytime soon. We're going to play long and play safe. 
So the artists -- you nailed it. I was talking to an artist this morning. I think as you've read elsewhere, I think you're going to see a creative boom. I saw the record labels this week also down slightly because they need new releases and touring to happen to keep the machine moving. So yes, I think '21, you have artists that are -- all just keep calling me daily saying, ""When can I go? When is it going to be safe? When are we going to go? I'm dying to go. I got new music. I want to drop music."" So I think this is why we believe long term, regardless of what quarter we exactly scale at, the business will be stronger than ever with the creative push by all these artists who need to get on the road to drive their new music. So '21, '22, we can debate what quarter exactly ramps, but we believe '21 into '22 will be record years with artists on the road who are pent up. They need to get on the road economically, and they're now powered by creative backlog, and they're all waiting. I talked to an artist this morning. They were going to release in November. They're going to wait until March now so they can coincide with a tour scheduled later in the year in '21. So huge demand. We are very gifted in this industry in that we have an incredible supply chain of ongoing creative geniuses who make their living connecting with fans on the road. So that will continue. And we know now from all of the craziness we've seen across America that fans are going to gather. We just got to make sure we can do it safely.
As far as canceling and postponing, one of the things we decided really early on was to make sure that we offered refunds on postponed events also. We didn't want our deferred -- we didn't want deferred revenue to have any false narrative to it. And we still -- we are leading the industry. There are many companies that are not giving refunds. I think even ones who've got government money. But we believe that you need to offer the fans refunds for postponed and canceled shows, and we've done that. So we believe our actual number. When we talk about fans holding on, it's real. We make it very easy for you to get a refund right now at Ticketmaster if you go look at our site versus others. We even see a concert sold at Ticketmaster versus other ticket sites, the take rate is higher at Ticketmaster because it's very easy to get a refund. So I believe that the refund numbers are true. They're not suppressed in any manner on our business because we're offering both options. And if you see an artist that canceled versus postponed, it wouldn't be because he wants his fan to get money back. We've offered both those options for any tour. We have -- it may just be an artist that wasn't going to go on -- was going to go on the road, probably an older artist that is looking at it saying, ""Maybe I'm not going to run back and try to figure out if May is going to happen right now. I'll take a year off."" So you've seen some of those ones if they've said, ""I'll just wait."" If you're a younger artist tied to more record releases, you're probably really still waiting and ready to go up probably a little earlier given your demo."

One is we -- as part of that $941 million, that includes $180 million of what we've modeled out as additional refunds that we expect to happen. Because we were able to model it, we needed to shift that out of deferred revenue. So if our model were perfect, then that would have already been taken out. And the second is when we use the term deferred revenue, it is with regards to deferred revenue for events taking place over the next 12 months. That's never been an important nuance in the past because deferred revenue for things over a year ago has tended to be pretty small. But in this case, because we deferred a lot of shows into the second half of 2021, we have about $400 million of long-term deferred revenue that will flip into deferred revenue over the next 6 months. So your $900 million plus $400 million equals the $1.3 billion, rough numbers."

We also have such a huge sponsorship base when you have 900 sponsors. Adding live from home this year alone has been a big part of helping deliver some benchmarks as well as driving concerts.

So first of all, to answer your question on what do you mean by scale, that scale, our normal business model in the summer, we'd be doing several thousand concerts a quarter and for tens of millions of fans. So we're not going to try to predict right now the exactness. Is it 70%? Is it 90%? What percent of last year is it? But it's in that type of volume. So why do we think it's going to happen? A couple of things. First of all, I think the efforts on the vaccine front are moving faster than anybody predicted 3 or 4 months ago. If you listen to the experts, the Dr. Faucis of the world and what are they saying in terms of their expectations where you have multiple, different vaccines with multiple, different approaches and their belief that something is going to happen by the end of the year is one of the vectors that gives you some comfort. The other is the progress being made on the treatments. We've obviously, as a medical community, learned a huge amount over the past 4 months in terms of the basic treatment, in terms of the -- perhaps the potential of antibody treatments, the use of other drugs, remdesivir and others, in terms of helping to reduce the mortality rate of it. 
So overall, in terms of -- as we've talked, we'll let the facts and the science lead us. We've been pleasantly surprised thus far on the progress of vaccines. Probably some of the testing and tracing has been slower but still now is ramping up, so between the testing, the tracing, the treatment also providing opportunities. So amongst those, I think we believe sitting here today that the facts would say that by the beginning of the year, you're able to put on the tickets on sale with comfort, you're going to be able to do the shows next summer. And then for the reasons that we've talked about, we have a high degree of comfort that the demand is going to be there, 86% of the people keeping their tickets to the shows, 2/3 of the people keeping their tickets for festivals that were canceled this year -- that have canceled but still saying they want to go to the show next year instead of getting their refund. So in total, over 19 million tickets for 4,000 shows that have already been sold, which, that alone, what we've already sold for 2021, would make us one of the largest promoters in the world. So all those factors together, I think, is what gives us the comfort."

So I don't think you'll see it there -- any effect there. I would say that it looks like in most of the countries, maybe the U.S. now, there's ongoing stimulus programs in effect and -- that seem to be coming to life for the live business in general, whether it's the employees, whether it's the venues, small or big. So I would assume some of them will have a continued, ongoing support through government programs to keep them afloat through this time. I mean listen, we're all in the same boat.

Joe will have a further update on cost and cash management efforts later in the call. 
We also continue to see strong fan demand across the board. Our sales and survey data tell us fan demand will be there when the time is right. Our refund rate on rescheduled shows remained consistently low with 83% of fans globally keeping their tickets. Our recent global survey indicates that 95% of fans are planning to return to live events when restrictions are lifted, the highest point of confidence since the start of the pandemic. 
Festival on sales for next year have been strong, with EDC Las Vegas 2021 selling out in 24 hours at a higher capacity than last year, and ticket sales for Ready and Greenfields and halo light festivals pacing ahead of last year. And we are encouraged by the enthusiasm for recent events and gatherings that have to take place, including our first sold out room tour with 20,000 fans in New Zealand, where business is headed back to normal. 
Meanwhile, we are working on our road map to get back to live safely. We are encouraged by progress on testing technology, treatments and vaccines, which will help us build our plans. We still expect shows at scale next summer, but recognize that some exact time line of this return will vary by region, so we continue to focus on remaining flexible. 
In preparation, there are 2 areas we are focusing on. On the technology front, Ticketmaster is creating the tools we need to make sure live events can deliver a variety of safe precautions when returning. New products such as our social distancing seat mapping tool and time entry technology have been created to give venues the flexibility to plan how to manage everything from venue access to box office interactions. 
Existing products, including our SafeTix digital ticket technology can fulfill new needs, including being a key facilitator for contact tracing. And the ability to integrate third-party applications with our digital ticketing platform enables a range of customizable features, from contactless concessions to testing and health questionnaire tracking. 
On the concert front, Live Nation is developing a set of standards for executing shows at our venues. We are collaborating with health experts to develop show guidelines to put in place procedures which can adopt to various situations across all regions. 
From venue sanitation procedures to fan-friendly policies on ticket purchases and the latest testing options, we are setting standards that will give fans, crews and artists peace of mind before, during and after the show. As we look ahead, it is clear the path to live will not be a straight one. As such, we will maintain flexibility and focus on innovating during these times. On November 19 at our investor event, we will outline in more detail the opportunities we see emerging for our business. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Joe."
384687,692756434,2131434,"Live Nation Entertainment, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Nov 05, 2020",2020-11-05,"Earnings Calls","Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. We've added some additional tables at the back of our earnings release. So this quarter, I will hit the key numbers as opposed to reconciling every number as I did last quarter. As Michael noted, we've cont",830,"Thanks, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. We've added some additional tables at the back of our earnings release. So this quarter, I will hit the key numbers as opposed to reconciling every number as I did last quarter. 
As Michael noted, we've continued to strengthen our financial position during the third quarter, and all the key numbers are in line with or better than what we forecast last quarter. As a result, we are confident that our actions taking to cut costs and increase liquidity will provide us with the runway we need until the time is right to bring shows back. 
As part of this, we have further reduced all discretionary spending by another approximately $100 million and have now lowered costs for this year by over $900 million and reduced our cash usage by $1.5 billion relative to our pre-COVID plans. With these reductions, we have lowered the estimate on our operational cash burn rate to $110 million per month and our gross burn rate to $175 million per month, on average, for the last 9 months of the year and prior to the benefit of contribution margin generated by the business. 
Included in our gross burn estimate is approximately $40 million in severance expense estimated through year-end, which we expect to generate over $200 million in annual run rate savings. Our free cash at the end of the third quarter is $951 million. And along with over $950 million of available debt capacity, we have $1.9 billion in readily available liquidity. At the same time, refund rates for Q3 remained low at 17% globally.  As a result, deferred revenue is at $1.4 billion as of the end of Q3, and we have increased our forecast than what we expect at the end of the year, now $1.4 billion. 
Turning to our Q3 results, starting with AOI. Our AOI loss for the quarter was [ $319 million ], which consisted of $337 million in operational cash burn, $50 million in other noncash fixed costs and $68 million of contribution margin, which included $73 million from operations, along with other onetime items. One point to note here is that TSCM from operations includes our sponsorship business, where we've been able to maintain 90% of the commitments that were in place at the end of February. The bulk of the sponsorship moved into 2021, but some of it was repurposed into other assets, including streaming concerts. 
Looking at free cash. We ended the third quarter with $951 million in free cash compared to $1.8 billion at the end of Q2, in line with what we expected and consistent with what we told you last quarter, which translates to an $821 million reduction in our free cash metric for the quarter. As part of this, we had a reduction in free cash of $333 million due to working capital timing, which is part of the $415 million flip we told you last quarter would be happening in Q3 and Q4. We expect the remaining $80 million of this timing impact will affect free cash in Q4. 
The majority of this timing shift resulted from shows scheduled for Q3 of 2021 shifting from long-term deferred revenue to current deferred revenue, so is an accounting shift as opposed to actual use of cash. As a result, our total effective cash burn was $488 million for the quarter -- for the quarter, or approximately $100 million per month, which aligns with our gross cash burn, net of contribution margin generated in the quarter. 
Now ticket refunds. As I indicated, the global refund rate for Live Nation concerts that are rescheduled and are in or have gone through a refund window at 17% through the end of Q3. Festivals have generally canceled this year's event. But for festivals where fans can retain their tickets for next year's show, 63% of fans are doing so and keeping their tickets. 
A bit more detail on deferred revenue, which is tracking ahead of where we told you last quarter we were going to be. At the end of the third quarter, deferred revenue for events in the next 12 months was $1.4 billion. Of the $421 million increase  $383 million was due to a shift from long-term deferred revenue to current deferred revenue for concerts rescheduled to Q3 of 2021. At the end of the third quarter, we still had $103 million of long-term deferred revenue, most of which will flip to short-term deferred revenue by the end of the year. 
Given this, along with the projected Q4 outflow of $74 million from additional ticket refunds, we now forecast deferred revenue of $1.4 billion at the end of the year prior to any additional ticket sales. Given the uncertainty in the market on timing of shows returning, we cannot give any more guidance beyond the burn rates and refund levels we just gave you. 
With that, let's open the call for any questions for Michael, Kathy or me."

There's always a few global superstars that probably can go direct and drive some significant dollars. But generally, this business, we think, is a complement to and a promotion to their core concert. 
So we think it's a great opportunity. Listen, we've been dabbling in virtual for years, whether it was streaming through Twitter and Yahoo! and streaming ourselves for sponsors. So we've been streaming our festivals on YouTube for years. We now look at that as a continuation of that. And we think going into '21 and '22, we'll be streaming a lot more of our concerts to fans that maybe either can't show up at the event. Or some that may want to still stream on our app when they're at the event because there's some added value of digital backrooms or camera angles, et cetera. 
So we think it's a great complement. It helps us probably drive a few incremental dollars per show. And also it has always been a great tool for sponsorship fulfillment."

There's nothing to read. This is like everyone is probably saying COVID excelled any strategy you had, in our case, while we've been sitting tight, we've been able to do a bunch of restructuring and rethinking of the business that we had planned over the next 3 years that we were able to do in the last 3 months. So going global on Ticketmaster was always the #1 priority. 
We always knew that our greatest opportunity for kind of the TAM on Ticketmaster is going to be outside of the U.S. It's an incredible, powerful brand. We've expanded into markets where Live Nation has content. It's an allocation market. So as your concerts grow, you can feed your ticketing business. So it's been a huge opportunity. 
We haven't been successful at getting the global technology architecture excelled as fast as we wanted. The U.S. is always such a big kind of drag on resources when we're running at full steam, that we always get that projects get slightly pushed back to solve the latest U.S. technology need. This just let us excel the strategy that says we're going to now have one global technology stack, a much better efficient architecture around it, common global products that we can roll out at once and help excel our international expansion. 
So I myself on the product when I moved from Toronto to London and lived there for 5 years, I think it was the single reason Live Nation is what it is today and plays global, is when you see from the outside in all the opportunity, it gets you thinking differently. So I believe that the fastest way we would grow Ticketmaster to a global brand was let someone from the global side who's working the business every day, take the reins and drive that product. 
So we're -- we've been working with Mark for years, and they've been having a product strategy to get there. We just excelled the leadership team to do it now.

We're at the core, we're an enterprise platform, white labeling teams and venues all around the world. So whether it's the NFL or the Phoenix Suns or ultimately, artists, we're a great software platform to power your ticket needs. 
And we're going to get better and better at that in terms of our do-it-yourself and white labeling and empowering artists and venues and teams to deliver their ticketing needs. It's been a great, great kind of test platform is the virtual business. We've overnight had to become a virtual ticketing company at scale across the globe. And we've been able to do that. We are powering through our portfolio, all of these virtual shows and selling tickets to them. 
So that's been what we do at our core. And then two, we've always talked about being a better marketplace, making sure that the marketplace, the app, making sure that we have full inventory on the shelves, adding more inventory to the shelves, whether it's Ticketmaster clients or not, being a true marketplace where consumers can find tickets, buy them, stock the shelf through secondary third-party partners, adding more content to the shelves is the strategy. 
So just take that global, then those 2 core strategies continue. We've got lots of clients to service on a global basis. We're under serviced and under market share in many markets where our concerts are strong, and we're rolling out our global marketplace, best-in-class practices across our global marketplaces that are sitting on old platforms."

And there's no doubt, everyone in live service providers and companies are having a rough year. We've been very focused on making sure that the 12 million employees in lives, from the hair dresser to the lighting crew to the security guards, get some stimulus and help. We think those people are in the most need. So we've been very vocal about that. 
When it gets to the venues, in general, the thesis out there with Mark Geiger and some others, is that these independent venues are so distressed that they're going to throw someone the keys at a very cheap price, and you can maybe roll up some of these cheaply and have some scale. Well, the thesis is basically broken at the first point is, any great live club is not throwing anybody in the keys cheaply. There's a lot of capital out there. So if you own the Troubadour in Los Angeles, it's a legendary business and you're having a tough year, you're not selling to Mark Geiger or anyone else at 1 or 2x multiple. Your access to capital, PPE loans, lots of ways you can keep your business afloat will you get to the storm. 
So we don't think that there's a huge opportunity that there's a fire sale happening at that level. Now #2 is, we're the -- we have a consolidation of clubs in our business. Clubs on their own are a tough business if you scale them up on their own. They're not a really, really fruitful business on their own. So we like them as part of our overall ecosystem. But we don't believe that clubs, whether you own 10, whether you own 20 of them on their own, provide you much global synergy or U.S. synergy to leverage off of. 
So we hope all these clubs find their way through this pandemic, like we hope all live service providers find their way through this and that the government and stimulus program is going to help them survive it. But we don't think that there's probably many that are going through fire sale to anybody because there's too many great options for them."

One of the things I want to make sure we're -- it's not just about severance. We're -- we've had a time to reengineer.

We were a very decentralized organization with lots of offices from Tampa Bay to Cleveland. And we're now learning what everyone is learning. We can we can shut down a lot of those regional offices. We can have a work from home strategy. We can reduce our office burn, our monthly burn and have a much more flexible work force, too. So work from home, a decentralized service model like ours, has been an incredible new gift to figure out how can we now restructure and still deliver the same volume without some of the costs. 
We've also reengineered where we need offices and how we can have a regional model versus maybe a local at times. So between reengineering, work from home, our goal has been both at Ticketmaster, Live Nation and globally to run at a $200 million annual run rate reduction on our fixed costs.

There have been no major changes in our business conditions or outlook since the last time we spoke. And while we see signs of promise around the world as some live events return, most regions we operate in continue to have various restrictions on live events. For now, we continue to maintain a strong cash management discipline while planning for the ramp-up to resume live shows as soon as possible. Joe will have a further update on cost and cash management efforts later in the call.
We also continue to see strong fan demand across the board. Our sales and survey data tell us fan demand will be there when the time is right. Our refund rate on rescheduled shows remained consistently low with 83% of fans globally keeping their tickets.  Our recent global survey indicates that 95% of fans are planning to return to live events when restrictions are lifted, the highest point of confidence since the start of the pandemic.  
Festival on sales for next year have been strong, with EDC Las Vegas 2021 selling out in 24 hours at a higher capacity than last year, and ticket sales for Redding, Creamfields and Isle of Wight festivals pacing ahead of last year. And we are encouraged by the enthusiasm for recent events and gatherings that have started to take place, including our first sold out arena tour with 20,000 fans in New Zealand, where business is headed back to normal.
Meanwhile, we are working on our roadmap to get back to live safely. We are encouraged by progress on testing technology, treatments and vaccines, which will help us build our plans. We still expect shows at scale next summer, but recognize that some exact timeline of this return will vary by region, so we continue to focus on remaining flexible.  
In preparation, there are 2 areas we are focusing on. On the technology front, Ticketmaster is creating the tools we need to make sure live events can deliver a variety of safe precautions when returning. New products such as our social distancing seat mapping tool and timed entry technology have been created to give venues the flexibility to plan how to manage everything from venue access to box office interactions.
Existing products, including our SafeTix digital ticket technology can fulfill new needs, including being a key facilitator for contact tracing. And the ability to integrate third-party applications with our digital ticketing platform enables a range of customizable features, from contactless concessions to testing and health questionnaire tracking.
On the concert front, Live Nation is developing a set of standards for executing shows at our venues. We are collaborating with health experts to develop show guidelines to put in place procedures, which can adopt to various situations across all regions.  
From venue sanitation procedures to fan-friendly policies on ticket purchases and the latest testing options, we are setting standards that will give the fans, crews and artists peace of mind before, during and after the show. As we look ahead, it is clear the path to live will not be a straight one. As such, we will maintain flexibility and focus on innovating during these times. On November 19 at our investor event, we will outline, in more detail, the opportunities we see emerging for our business.  
With that, I'll turn it over to Joe."
384687,692756434,2131592,"Live Nation Entertainment, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Nov 05, 2020",2020-11-05,"Earnings Calls","Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. We've added some additional tables at the back of our earnings release. So this quarter, I will hit the key numbers as opposed to reconciling every number as I did last quarter.  As Michael noted, we've con",825,"Thanks, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. We've added some additional tables at the back of our earnings release. So this quarter, I will hit the key numbers as opposed to reconciling every number as I did last quarter.  
As Michael noted, we've continued to strengthen our financial position during the third quarter, and all the key numbers are in line with or better than what we forecast last quarter. As a result, we are confident that our actions taken to cut costs and increase liquidity will provide us with the runway we need until the time is right to bring shows back.  
As part of this, we have further reduced all discretionary spending by another approximately $100 million and have now lowered costs for this year by over $900 million and reduced our cash usage by $1.5 billion relative to our pre-COVID plans. With these reductions, we have lowered the estimate on our operational cash burn rate to $110 million per month and our gross burn rate to $175 million per month, on average, for the last 9 months of the year and prior to the benefit of contribution margin generated by the business.  
Included in our gross burn estimate is approximately $40 million in severance expense estimated through year-end, which we expect to generate over $200 million in annual run rate savings. Our free cash at the end of the third quarter is $951 million. And along with over $950 million of available debt capacity, we have $1.9 billion in readily available liquidity. At the same time, refund rates for Q3 remained low at 17% globally.  As a result, deferred revenue is at $1.4 billion as of the end of Q3, and we have increased our forecast than what we expect at the end of the year, now $1.4 billion.
Turning to our Q3 results, starting with AOI. Our AOI loss for the quarter was $319 million, which consisted of $337 million in operational cash burn, $50 million in other noncash fixed costs and $68 million of contribution margin, which included $73 million from operations, along with other onetime items. One point to note here is that this CM from operations includes our sponsorship business, where we've been able to maintain 90% of the commitments that were in place at the end of February. The bulk of the sponsorship moved into 2021, but some of it was repurposed into other assets, including streaming concerts.
Looking at free cash. We ended the third quarter with $951 million in free cash compared to $1.8 billion at the end of Q2, in line with what we expected and consistent with what we told you last quarter, which translates to an $821 million reduction in our free cash metric for the quarter. As part of this, we had a reduction in free cash of $333 million due to working capital timing, which is part of the $415 million flip we told you last quarter would be happening in Q3 and Q4. We expect the remaining $80 million of this timing impact will affect free cash in Q4.
The majority of this timing shift resulted from shows scheduled for Q3 of 2021 shifting from long-term deferred revenue to current deferred revenue, so is an accounting shift as opposed to actual use of cash. As a result, our total effective cash burn was $488 million for the quarter, or approximately $160 million per month, which aligns with our gross cash burn, net of contribution margin generated in the quarter.
Now ticket refunds. As I indicated, the global refund rate for Live Nation concerts that are rescheduled and are in or have gone through a refund window is 17% through the end of Q3. Festivals have generally canceled this year's event. But for festivals where fans can retain their tickets for next year's show, 63% of fans are doing so and keeping their tickets.
A bit more detail on deferred revenue, which is tracking ahead of where we told you last quarter we were going to be. At the end of the third quarter, deferred revenue for events in the next 12 months was $1.4 billion. Of the $421 million increase, $383 million was due to a shift from long-term deferred revenue to current deferred revenue for concerts rescheduled to Q3 of 2021. At the end of the third quarter, we still had $103 million of long-term deferred revenue, most of which will flip to short-term deferred revenue by the end of the year.
Given this, along with the projected Q4 outflow of $74 million from additional ticket refunds, we now forecast deferred revenue of $1.4 billion at the end of the year prior to any additional ticket sales. Given the uncertainty in the market on timing of shows returning, we cannot give any more guidance beyond the burn rates and refund levels we just gave you.  
With that, let's open the call for any questions for Michael, Kathy or me."

There's going to be always Beyoncés and BTSes and Billie Eilishes in the world that can probably do like the old school pay-per-view, if you think of it that way. There's always a few global superstars that probably can go direct and drive some significant dollars. But generally, this business, we think, is a complement to and a promotion to their core concert. 
So we think it's a great opportunity. Listen, we've been dabbling in virtual for years, whether it was streaming through Twitter and Yahoo! and streaming ourselves for sponsors. So we've been streaming our festivals on YouTube for years. We now look at that as a continuation of that. And we think going into '21 and '22, we'll be streaming a lot more of our concerts to fans that maybe either can't show up at the event. Or some that may want to still stream on our app when they're at the event because there's some added value of digital backrooms or camera angles, et cetera. 
So we think it's a great complement. It helps us probably drive a few incremental dollars per show. And also it has always been a great tool for sponsorship fulfillment."

There's nothing to read. This is like everyone is probably saying COVID excelled any strategy you had, in our case, while we've been sitting tight, we've been able to do a bunch of restructuring and rethinking of the business that we had planned over the next 3 years that we were able to do in the last 3 months. So going global on Ticketmaster was always the #1 priority.
We always knew that our greatest opportunity for kind of the TAM on Ticketmaster is going to be outside of the U.S. It's an incredible, powerful brand. We've expanded into markets where Live Nation has content. It's an allocation market. So as your concerts grow, you can feed your ticketing business. So it's been a huge opportunity.  
We haven't been successful at getting the global technology architecture excelled as fast as we wanted. The U.S. is always such a big kind of drag on resources when we're running at full steam, that we always get that -- projects get slightly pushed back to solve the latest U.S. technology need. This just let us excel the strategy that says we're going to now have one global technology stack, a much better efficient architecture around it, common global products that we can roll out at once and help excel our international expansion.
So I'm, myself, on the product when I moved from Toronto to London and lived there for 5 years, I think it was the single reason Live Nation is what it is today and plays global, is when you see from the outside in, all the opportunity, it gets you thinking differently. So I believe that the fastest way we would grow Ticketmaster to a global brand was let someone from the global side who's working the business every day, take the reins and drive that product. So we're -- we've been working with Marc for years, and they've been having a product strategy to get there. We just excelled the leadership team to do it now.
As far as -- sorry, go ahead."

I think the priorities haven't changed, although when we get back to business, they're going to continually be about -- we got an incredible 2 businesses at a Ticketmaster. We're -- at the core, we're an enterprise platform, white labeling teams and venues all around the world. So whether it's the NFL or the Phoenix Suns or ultimately, artists, we're a great software platform to power your ticket needs.
And we're going to get better and better at that in terms of our do-it-yourself and white labeling and empowering artists and venues and teams to deliver their ticketing needs. It's been a great, great kind of test platform, is the virtual business. We've, overnight, had to become a virtual ticketing company at scale across the globe. And we've been able to do that. We are powering through our portfolio, all of these virtual shows and selling tickets to them. 
So that's been what we do at our core. And then two, we've always talked about being a better marketplace, making sure that the marketplace, the app, making sure that we have full inventory on the shelves, adding more inventory to the shelves, whether it's Ticketmaster clients or not, being a true marketplace where consumers can find tickets, buy them, stock the shelf through secondary third-party partners, adding more content to the shelves is the strategy.
So just just take that global, then those 2 core strategies continue. We've got lots of clients to service on a global basis. We're under serviced and under market shared in many markets where our concerts are strong, and we're rolling out our global marketplace, best-in-class practices across our global marketplaces that are sitting on old platforms."

And there's no doubt, everyone in live service providers and companies are having a rough year. We've been very focused on making sure that the 12 million employees in Live, from the hairdresser to the lighting crew to the security guards, get some stimulus and help. We think those people are in the most need. So we've been very vocal about that.  
When it gets to the venues, in general, the thesis out there with Marc Geiger and some others, is that these independent venues are so distressed that they're going to throw someone the keys at a very cheap price, and you can maybe roll up some of these cheaply and have some scale. Well, the thesis is basically broken at the first point is, any great live club is not throwing anybody the keys cheaply. There's a lot of capital out there. So if you own the Troubadour in Los Angeles, it's a legendary business and you're having a tough year, you're not selling to Marc Geiger or anyone else at 1 or 2x multiple. Your access to capital, PPE loans, lots of ways you can keep your business afloat while you get through the storm.
So we don't think that there's a huge opportunity that there's a fire sale happening at that level. Now #2 is, we're the -- we have a consolidation of clubs in our business. Clubs on their own are a tough business if you scale them up on their own. They're not a really, really fruitful business on their own. So we like them as part of our overall ecosystem. But we don't believe that clubs, whether you own 10, whether you own 20 of them on their own, provide you much global synergy or U.S. synergy to leverage off of.
So we hope all these clubs find their way through this pandemic, like we hope all live service providers find their way through this and that the government and stimulus program is going to help them survive it. But we don't think that, that there's probably many that are going through fire sale to anybody because there's too many great options for them."

We can have a work-from-home strategy. We can reduce our office burn, our monthly burn and have a much more flexible work force, too. So work from home, a decentralized service model like ours, has been an incredible new gift to figure out how can we now restructure and still deliver the same volume without some of the costs.  
We've also re-engineered where we need offices and how we can have a regional model versus maybe a local at times.

Our expectatio",583,"Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Over the past 3 months, our top priority has been strengthening our financial position to ensure that we have the liquidity and flexibility to get through an extended period with no live events. Our expectation that live events will return at scale is the summer of 2021, with ticket sales ramping up in the quarters leading up to these shows. Importantly, we remain confident that fans will return to live events when it is safe to do so. 
Our strongest indicator of demand is that fans are holding on to their tickets even when given the option of a refund. Through the end of the second quarter, 86% of concert fans are keeping their tickets for rescheduled shows, demonstrating a continued desire to attend concerts in the future despite the current uncertainty. Our expectation for robust outdoor summer season in 2021 are also reinforced by the 2/3 of fans keeping their tickets for canceled festivals so they can go to next year's show, along with the strong early ticket sales for the festivals in the U.K. next summer, for example, Download and the Isle of Wight, are pacing well ahead of last year. Between the tickets held by fans for the rescheduled shows and these festival on-sales, we have already sold 19 million tickets to more than 4,000 concerts and festivals scheduled for 2021, creating a strong baseload of demand that is pacing well ahead of this point last year. At the same time, surveys continue to show that concerts remain fans' highest priority social event when it is safe to gather, with almost 90% of fans globally planning on attending concerts again. 
Understanding that it will be some time before we put on concerts at scale, we are innovating to find new and creative ways to help artists keep fans connected in the meantime. Virtual concerts have proven to be a huge demand with fans. So we established a Live From Home platform to provide a convenient place for fans of all types to find performances from their favorite artists. In the second quarter, we had 67 million fans and over 18,000 concerts and festivals globally. Among our highlights, this past weekend, we streamed 150 performances from our Virtual Lollapalooza Festival. Given the tremendous popularity of these shows, we are seeing the potential for live streaming to become an additional long-term component of our concert business, allowing fans in other cities or those who can't attend to enjoy the concert as well. At the same time, recognizing fans want to get back to attending concerts in person as soon as possible, we've launched socially distant shows when and where permitted, included in New Zealand, France, Denmark, Spain, Germany, Finland and as well as cities across the U.S. 
While this is a challenging time for everyone, the live events business in particular, there are a few things that I am confident about. We are well positioned to weather this crisis and we will get through this. When it is safe to return, we will have an abundance of fans and artists ready to join live music again. And Live Nation will do everything in its power to meet our responsibilities to artists, fans, our employees and everyone else affected by the shutdown by bringing back as much live music as fast as possible when it's responsible to do so. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Joe for more detail on our results."

As Michael mentioned, our top priority during this time has been strengthening our financial position, and we are confident that our actions taking to cut costs and increase liquidity will provide us with the runway we need until the time is right to bring shows back. We have now reduced costs for this year by over $800 million and reduced our cash usage by $1.4 billion relative to our pre-COVID plans. With these reductions, we have lowered the estimate on our operational cash burn rate to $125 million per month and our gross burn rate to $185 million per month on average for the second quarter through the end of the year. At the same time, we raised an additional $1.2 billion providing us with a $1.8 billion of free cash at the end of the second quarter, along with over $950 million of available debt capacity, totaling over $2.7 billion in readily available liquidity. And last week, we amended our credit agreement to suspend our maintenance covenant to a more favorable liquidity metric to Q4 of 2021, providing us with added flexibility until business returns. 
Turning to our Q2 results, starting with AOI. Our AOI for the quarter was a loss of $432 million driven primarily by operational fixed costs of $334 million, inclusive of approximately $60 million in benefits from various government payroll funding programs. So with our cost initiatives, we expect operational fixed costs to average approximately $125 million per month for the second quarter through the end of the year. We then had negative $98 million in contribution margin, largely driven by onetime events in Ticketmaster and our concerts business. For Ticketmaster, recording refunds for 11 million tickets across 42,000 shows generated a loss of approximately $79 million for our portion of the service fees. In our concerts business, writing off some costs associated with concerts that have been canceled or rescheduled for 2021, generated an expense of approximately $87 million, about 2/3 of which is a write-off of advertising expenses given the calendar year shift in show timing. Partially offsetting these expenses, we had $68 million of contribution margin generated by business operations and insurance recoveries for events impacted by the pandemic. 
Looking at free cash, we ended the first quarter with approximately $820 million in free cash, added $1.2 billion in cash from additional debt during the second quarter and then ended the quarter with $1.8 billion of free cash. This implies $250 million in cash used during the quarter. As part of this, we had a timing benefit to free cash of $415 million, which will flip back out in Q3 and Q4. Of this timing benefit, $225 million is accrued but not yet paid ticket refunds, and $190 million is working capital timing. This puts our total effective cash burn at $665 million for the quarter. The largest onetime impact was the payment of Ticketmaster refunds, which totaled $110 million for our portion of service fees refunded to fans during the quarter. 
We then had our operational cash burn. Starting with our $334 million in operational fixed costs then adding back $54 million of noncash benefits, our operational cash burn totaled $388 million for the quarter. In addition, we had $217 million of ongoing nonoperational cash burn items, including capital expenditures, acquisition activity, net advances and interest payments. These items ran slightly higher for the quarter due to contractually obligated payments for past acquisitions. So we expect this nonoperational component to our cash burn to average approximately $60 million per month for the second quarter through the end of the year. Finally, we had $50 million of inflows from operations and improved cash management. 
Lastly, let me give you an update on ticket refunds and how's that impacted our deferred revenue. Ticket refunds first. The global refund rate for Live Nation concerts that are rescheduled and are in or have gone through a refund window is 14% through the end of Q2. Festivals have generally canceled this year's events. But for festivals where fans can retain their tickets for next year's show, as Michael mentioned, about 2/3 of them are keeping their tickets. Across both concerts and festivals, we refunded $218 million for rescheduled shows since March. In addition, we have refunded $477 million for canceled shows over this period. Of this $695 million total, $230 million was funds held by third-party venues and $465 million from the Live Nation-held funds. We still have some shows in the process of rescheduling or are rescheduled but not yet offering refunds. If we apply the same fan behavior and mix on these events, we forecast approximately $270 million in additional fan refunds, of which about $180 million will be from Live Nation-held funds. Given this estimate, we have shifted these funds from deferred revenue to accrued but not yet paid ticket refunds. 
Now to look at how these refunds flow through our event-related deferred revenue. At the end of the first quarter, our deferred revenue for events over the next 12 months is $2 billion. At the end of the second quarter, deferred revenue for events in the next 12 months was $941 million. Of this approximately $1 billion decrease, $405 million was due to a shift from short-term deferred revenue to long-term deferred revenue as a number of concerts were shifted into the second half of 2021. As a result, we had $486 million of long-term deferred revenue at the end of the second quarter, of which we estimate approximately $400 million will shift back to short-term deferred revenue over the course of the year. The Live Nation concert ticket refunds recorded in the quarter then accounted for $465 million, and estimated additional future refunds from Live Nation-held cash totals $180 million. We then had ticket sales in the quarter that generated roughly $30 million of new deferred revenue. 
Looking at the rest of the year, our forecast for event-related deferred revenue at the end of the year prior to additional ticket sales and based on our projected refund rates is approximately $1.3 billion. Given all the uncertainty in the market and timing of shows, we cannot give you any further guidance beyond these burn rates and refund levels we just gave you. 
And with that, I will turn the call over to Kathy."

I will review our second quarter and 6-month results and provide updates on our balance sheet. All of our results for this quarter and the first 6 months of the year have been significantly impacted by the shutdown of our shows since mid-March due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which is driving all of the variances for both periods in total and across all segments. 
For the quarter, our revenue was $74 million compared to $3.2 billion last year, down 98%. AOI was a loss of $432 million for the quarter compared to earnings of $319 million in 2019. Our operating loss was $588 million compared to $172 million in operating income last year. And net loss for the quarter was $568 million compared to net income of $103 million in 2019. 
For the first 6 months, we generated $1.4 billion in revenue compared to $4.9 billion last year, down 71%. Most of this revenue in 2020 was driven by our show activity in the first 2.5 months of the year prior to the shutdown. AOI was a loss of $452 million for the first 6 months compared to income of $435 million in 2019. Our operating loss was $761 million compared to $148 million in operating income last year. And net loss for the first 6 months was $752 million compared to net income of $51 million in 2019. 
Now on to our balance sheet. As of June 30, we had total cash of $3.3 billion, which includes a free cash balance of $1.8 billion. Our total cash includes $941 million of current event-related deferred revenue as well as $486 million of long-term deferred revenue for events that have been rescheduled more than 1 year out as of June 30. This is part of our operating cash and therefore provides us additional liquidity. As Joe outlined, we estimate that our actions to conserve cash eliminates or defers approximately $1.4 billion in cash outflows for 2020, which includes the cash portion of our approximately $800 million in cost savings, along with a reduction in capital expenditures, lower acquisition activity and reduced concert and ticketing advances. 
In May 2020, we issued $1.2 billion principal amount of 6.5% senior secured notes due 2027. As of the end of the quarter, our total debt was $4.9 billion with a weighted average cost of 4.4%. We also have $966 million of available debt capacity between our revolvers and undrawn term loan A. Last week, we completed an amendment to our credit agreement, which amends and further suspends our net leverage covenant until December 31, 2021, if we choose, replacing it with a minimum liquidity test of $500 million, which is measured against our free cash, available debt capacity and up to $250 million of our event-related deferred revenue. We believe that our free cash, together with our undrawn debt capacity, gives us sufficient liquidity to maintain critical operations until shows return. 
Capital expenditures for the quarter were $55 million, giving us a total for the 6 months of $129 million. We are now estimating our full year spend to be approximately $215 million, down from our initial estimate for the year of $375 million. Of the remaining $86 million in capital expenditures for the year, approximately $30 million is for capitalized labor for updates to our ticketing systems, with the remainder largely venue-related and long-term projects.

In terms of the on-sales timing, as we indicated, we expect to be returning to scale with next summer particularly focused on the amphitheaters and festivals first. So I think that we would expect the usual timing of those on-sales, which would typically be for amphitheaters around the end of the year. So we don't expect for the full year the same. We expect it to be more back-half-loaded. But we do expect the on-sales to be somewhere around a few towards the end of the year and the bulk of them as we get into the first quarter of the year.
Second question in terms of the cash burn. The cash burn is with, I'll call it, relatively limited inflows more similar to what we have in Q2. So we did have some inflows but not obviously at scale or substantial. The cash burn numbers we gave you are assuming the status quo through Q4. And as we move further into it and we have better visibility on Q4, if there is some ramp-ups in activity which would give us both increased contribution margin as well as increased costs, we'll guide you to that as we get closer. But we thought that the more prudent and simple thing to do at this point is to give you the status quo. And then as we're -- as we have more going on, we'll increase both sides from there."

The press got ahold of a kind of a work in progress, which was too bad because it wasn't meant to be that. We, for a living, are negotiating deals with agents and managers. That's the business model. Their job is to look for competition, and our job is to bid on these shows in different terms for different artists and different times. So the process is always fluid. We're obviously trying to do our side of the negotiation and the agents do in their side. This got -- look -- this looked, I guess as it got reported, it was just a mid-statement. That wasn't meant to be anything more than that. But what we really wanted to accomplish is -- I would just step back and say the industry overall has been amazing dealing with restructuring '20 into '21. The agents, the managers and all the artists all have been very cooperative that -- understand that if you had a show this year and you wanted to reschedule next year, some compromise in the terms would have to be met. And the biggest risk we all had on the promoting side that we wanted to make sure that we could incorporate was the refunds. 
Now the refunds, as we've seen, have been surprisingly really strong on the concert side. And we didn't know what we were going to head into when we started renegotiating. But we do know on festivals, refund rates are much higher because it's a bigger cash outlet but it's also just a bigger time commitment. They don't tend to be as local as your average concert. So we wanted to make sure going into '21, if you were a headline artist that was going to play a certain festival this year and we wanted -- and you still wanted to play it next year, the 2 things we wanted to make sure that we were protected in and that we both shared some of the risk was a refund reduction and insurance. Those are the 2 principles. If you take all of the drama from the press leak aside, those are the 2 things we wanted to make sure that we weren't stuck paying the same price in '20 if we had a 31% refund rate on the festival. 
Now if those tickets also backed through and that festival ended up at the same place it was in '20, then we should all share the upside. And every agent and artists and manager have been incredibly accommodating to all the promoters in the business who are all looking for some help in terms of rescheduling next year's shows and taking and refunding insurance and making sure we are clear on those 2 terms. So that was the net result of it all. The rest was a wish list of things as we head into any negotiation. We'd all like to win but those are the 2 points that made sense that were most important for our business and for the festival P&Ls."

So I would say to you, if you had a tour that was on sale and it wasn't doing well, you and the artist decided to pull it down and not go forward with it regardless of COVID. So any tour that you rescheduled, you have the opportunity to look at that deal and at that show and then the number of dates, et cetera, and negotiate with the agent, manager and the artists on what was the best go-forward strategy. So anything -- we talk about 2021 is going to be a spectacular year in the sense of the stuff that did get pushed, you can guarantee was all of the stuff that was selling well and high demand. So that stuff is all going to -- those shows will still be continuing next year. We didn't have anything really on sale for '21 ahead of our '20 season of any substance.

And then even the 100-plus clubs and theaters that we have, as one would expect, that some of the lower volume of number of people gathering will happen sooner than some of the large gathering indoor because we have those buildings, because we can manage the processes with them. I think that will let us ramp up faster than otherwise we'd be able to."

I know a lot either postponing releasing new music or at least some have. Others, I'm sure, are trying to be sensitive to the economic pressures that their fans are seeing. What are you hearing from artists that you have relationships with around getting back on the road sooner rather than later? And maybe a similar question for you on their decision process on canceling versus postponing. I think there have been some who have decided to cancel in order to help their fans get their money back faster. I don't know if that was something you thought would grow as the year progressed. And then I just had a follow-up on the deferred revenue point."
384687,681032228,2159454,"Live Nation Entertainment, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2020",2020-08-05,"Earnings Calls","Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.","Executives","Yes. I think it was -- our last earnings call, we were kind of showing you some statistics to make sure that everyone understood that touring had not had a structural change. There was a debate back then whether fans would gather when they got out of this",735,"Yes. I think it was -- our last earnings call, we were kind of showing you some statistics to make sure that everyone understood that touring had not had a structural change. There was a debate back then whether fans would gather when they got out of this. I think if anything, we learned in 3 months. We got to figure out how they don't gather short term so we can have a better business faster. So I would just say to you that we have been really, really -- we're going to play long on this one. So we have artists with lots of ideas on shows they could do now. We won't be doing DJ sets in the Hamptons anytime soon. We're going to play long and play safe. 
So the artists -- you nailed it. I was talking to an artist this morning. I think as you've read elsewhere, I think you're going to see a creative boom. I saw the record labels this week also down slightly because they need new releases and touring to happen to keep the machine moving. So yes, I think '21, you have artists that are -- all just keep calling me daily saying, ""When can I go? When is it going to be safe? When are we going to go? I'm dying to go. I got new music. I want to drop music."" So I think this is why we believe long term, regardless of what quarter we exactly scale at, the business will be stronger than ever with the creative push by all these artists who need to get on the road to drive their new music. So '21, '22, we can debate what quarter exactly ramps, but we believe '21 into '22 will be record years with artists on the road who are pent up. They need to get on the road economically, and they're now powered by creative backlog, and they're all waiting. I talked to an artist this morning. They were going to release in November. They're going to wait until March now so they can coincide with a tour scheduled later in the year in '21. So huge demand. We are very gifted in this industry in that we have an incredible supply chain of ongoing creative geniuses who make their living connecting with fans on the road. So that will continue. And we know now from all of the craziness we've seen across America that fans are going to gather. We just got to make sure we can do it safely.
As far as canceling and postponing, one of the things we decided really early on was to make sure that we offered refunds on postponed events also. We didn't want our deferred -- we didn't want deferred revenue to have any false narrative to it. And we still -- we are leading the industry. There are many companies that are not giving refunds. I think even ones who've got government money. But we believe that you need to offer the fans refunds for postponed and canceled shows, and we've done that. So we believe our actual number. When we talk about fans holding on, it's real. We make it very easy for you to get a refund right now at Ticketmaster if you go look at our site versus others. We even see a concert sold at Ticketmaster versus other ticket sites, the take rate is higher at Ticketmaster because it's very easy to get a refund. So I believe that the refund numbers are true. They're not suppressed in any manner on our business because we're offering both options. And if you see an artist that canceled versus postponed, it wouldn't be because he wants his fan to get money back. We've offered both those options for any tour. We have -- it may just be an artist that wasn't going to go on -- was going to go on the road, probably an older artist that is looking at it saying, ""Maybe I'm not going to run back and try to figure out if May is going to happen right now. I'll take a year off."" So you've seen some of those ones if they've said, ""I'll just wait."" If you're a younger artist tied to more record releases, you're probably really still waiting and ready to go up probably a little earlier given your demo."

One is we -- as part of that $941 million, that includes $180 million of what we've modeled out as additional refunds that we expect to happen. Because we were able to model it, we needed to shift that out of deferred revenue. So if our model were perfect, then that would have already been taken out. And the second is when we use the term deferred revenue, it is with regards to deferred revenue for events taking place over the next 12 months. That's never been an important nuance in the past because deferred revenue for things over a year ago has tended to be pretty small. But in this case, because we deferred a lot of shows into the second half of 2021, we have about $400 million of long-term deferred revenue that will flip into deferred revenue over the next 6 months. So your $900 million plus $400 million equals the $1.3 billion, rough numbers."

So first of all, to answer your question on what do you mean by scale, that scale, our normal business model in the summer, we'd be doing several thousand concerts a quarter and for tens of millions of fans. So we're not going to try to predict right now the exactness. Is it 70%? Is it 90%? What percent of last year is it? But it's in that type of volume. So why do we think it's going to happen? A couple of things. First of all, I think the efforts on the vaccine front are moving faster than anybody predicted 3 or 4 months ago. If you listen to the experts, the Dr. Faucis of the world and what are they saying in terms of their expectations where you have multiple, different vaccines with multiple, different approaches and their belief that something is going to happen by the end of the year is one of the vectors that gives you some comfort. The other is the progress being made on the treatments. We've obviously, as a medical community, learned a huge amount over the past 4 months in terms of the basic treatment, in terms of the -- perhaps the potential of antibody treatments, the use of other drugs, remdesivir and others, in terms of helping to reduce the mortality rate of it. 
So overall, in terms of -- as we've talked, we'll let the facts and the science lead us. We've been pleasantly surprised thus far on the progress of vaccines. Probably some of the testing and tracing has been slower but still now is ramping up, so between the testing, the tracing, the treatment also providing opportunities. So amongst those, I think we believe sitting here today that the facts would say that by the beginning of the year, you're able to put on the tickets on sale with comfort, you're going to be able to do the shows next summer. And then for the reasons that we've talked about, we have a high degree of comfort that the demand is going to be there, 86% of the people keeping their tickets to the shows, 2/3 of the people keeping their tickets for festivals that were canceled this year -- that have canceled but still saying they want to go to the show next year instead of getting their refund. So in total, over 19 million tickets for 4,000 shows that have already been sold, which, that alone, what we've already sold for 2021, would make us one of the largest promoters in the world. So all those factors together, I think, is what gives us the comfort."

So I would assume some of them will have a continued, ongoing support through government programs to keep them afloat through this time. I mean listen, we're all in the same boat.

Over the past 3 months, our top priority has been strengthening our financial position to ensure that we have the liquidity and flexibility to get through an extended period with no live events. Our expectation that live events will return at scale is the summer of 2021, with ticket sales ramping up in the quarters leading up to these shows. Importantly, we remain confident that fans will return to live events when it is safe to do so. 
Our strongest indicator of demand is that fans are holding on to their tickets even when given the option of a refund. Through the end of the second quarter, 86% of concert fans are keeping their tickets for rescheduled shows, demonstrating a continued desire to attend concerts in the future despite the current uncertainty. Our expectation for robust outdoor summer season in 2021 are also reinforced by the 2/3 of fans keeping their tickets for canceled festivals so they can go to next year's show, along with the strong early ticket sales for the festivals in the U.K. next summer, for example, Download and the Isle of Wight, are pacing well ahead of last year. Between the tickets held by fans for the rescheduled shows and these festival on-sales, we have already sold 19 million tickets to more than 4,000 concerts and festivals scheduled for 2021, creating a strong baseload of demand that is pacing well ahead of this point last year. At the same time, surveys continue to show that concerts remain fans' highest priority social event when it is safe to gather, with almost 90% of fans globally planning on attending concerts again. 
Understanding that it will be some time before we put on concerts at scale, we are innovating to find new and creative ways to help artists keep fans connected in the meantime. Virtual concerts have proven to be a huge demand with fans. So we established a Live From Home platform to provide a convenient place for fans of all types to find performances from their favorite artists. In the second quarter, we had 67 million fans and over 18,000 concerts and festivals globally. Among our highlights, this past weekend, we streamed 150 performances from our Virtual Lollapalooza Festival. Given the tremendous popularity of these shows, we are seeing the potential for live streaming to become an additional long-term component of our concert business, allowing fans in other cities or those who can't attend to enjoy the concert as well. At the same time, recognizing fans want to get back to attending concerts in person as soon as possible, we've launched socially distant shows when and where permitted, included in New Zealand, France, Denmark, Spain, Germany, Finland and as well as cities across the U.S. 
While this is a challenging time for everyone, the live events business in particular, there are a few things that I am confident about. We are well positioned to weather this crisis and we will get through this. When it is safe to return, we will have an abundance of fans and artists ready to join live music again. And Live Nation will do everything in its power to meet our responsibilities to artists, fans, our employees and everyone else affected by the shutdown by bringing back as much live music as fast as possible when it's responsible to do so. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Joe for more detail on our results."

As Michael mentioned, our top priority during this time has been strengthening our financial position, and we are confident that our actions taking to cut costs and increase liquidity will provide us with the",1057,"Thanks, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. As Michael mentioned, our top priority during this time has been strengthening our financial position, and we are confident that our actions taking to cut costs and increase liquidity will provide us with the runway we need until the time is right to bring shows back. We have now reduced costs for this year by over $800 million and reduced our cash usage by $1.4 billion relative to our pre-COVID plans. With these reductions, we have lowered the estimate on our operational cash burn rate to $125 million per month and our gross burn rate to $185 million per month on average for the second quarter through the end of the year. At the same time, we raised an additional $1.2 billion providing us with a $1.8 billion of free cash at the end of the second quarter, along with over $950 million of available debt capacity, totaling over $2.7 billion in readily available liquidity. And last week, we amended our credit agreement to suspend our maintenance covenant to a more favorable liquidity metric to Q4 of 2021, providing us with added flexibility until business returns. 
Turning to our Q2 results, starting with AOI. Our AOI for the quarter was a loss of $432 million driven primarily by operational fixed costs of $334 million, inclusive of approximately $60 million in benefits from various government payroll funding programs. So with our cost initiatives, we expect operational fixed costs to average approximately $125 million per month for the second quarter through the end of the year. We then had negative $98 million in contribution margin, largely driven by onetime events in Ticketmaster and our concerts business. For Ticketmaster, recording refunds for 11 million tickets across 42,000 shows generated a loss of approximately $79 million for our portion of the service fees. In our concerts business, writing off some costs associated with concerts that have been canceled or rescheduled for 2021, generated an expense of approximately $87 million, about 2/3 of which is a write-off of advertising expenses given the calendar year shift in show timing. Partially offsetting these expenses, we had $68 million of contribution margin generated by business operations and insurance recoveries for events impacted by the pandemic. 
Looking at free cash, we ended the first quarter with approximately $820 million in free cash, added $1.2 billion in cash from additional debt during the second quarter and then ended the quarter with $1.8 billion of free cash. This implies $250 million in cash used during the quarter. As part of this, we had a timing benefit to free cash of $415 million, which will flip back out in Q3 and Q4. Of this timing benefit, $225 million is accrued but not yet paid ticket refunds, and $190 million is working capital timing. This puts our total effective cash burn at $665 million for the quarter. The largest onetime impact was the payment of Ticketmaster refunds, which totaled $110 million for our portion of service fees refunded to fans during the quarter. 
We then had our operational cash burn. Starting with our $334 million in operational fixed costs then adding back $54 million of noncash benefits, our operational cash burn totaled $388 million for the quarter. In addition, we had $217 million of ongoing nonoperational cash burn items, including capital expenditures, acquisition activity, net advances and interest payments. These items ran slightly higher for the quarter due to contractually obligated payments for past acquisitions. So we expect this nonoperational component to our cash burn to average approximately $60 million per month for the second quarter through the end of the year. Finally, we had $50 million of inflows from operations and improved cash management. 
Lastly, let me give you an update on ticket refunds and how's that impacted our deferred revenue. Ticket refunds first. The global refund rate for Live Nation concerts that are rescheduled and are in or have gone through a refund window is 14% through the end of Q2. Festivals have generally canceled this year's events. But for festivals where fans can retain their tickets for next year's show, as Michael mentioned, about 2/3 of them are keeping their tickets. Across both concerts and festivals, we refunded $218 million for rescheduled shows since March. In addition, we have refunded $477 million for canceled shows over this period. Of this $695 million total, $230 million was funds held by third-party venues and $465 million from the Live Nation-held funds. We still have some shows in the process of rescheduling or are rescheduled but not yet offering refunds. If we apply the same fan behavior and mix on these events, we forecast approximately $270 million in additional fan refunds, of which about $180 million will be from Live Nation-held funds. Given this estimate, we have shifted these funds from deferred revenue to accrued but not yet paid ticket refunds. 
Now to look at how these refunds flow through our event-related deferred revenue. At the end of the first quarter, our deferred revenue for events over the next 12 months is $2 billion. At the end of the second quarter, deferred revenue for events in the next 12 months was $941 million. Of this approximately $1 billion decrease, $405 million was due to a shift from short-term deferred revenue to long-term deferred revenue as a number of concerts were shifted into the second half of 2021. As a result, we had $486 million of long-term deferred revenue at the end of the second quarter, of which we estimate approximately $400 million will shift back to short-term deferred revenue over the course of the year. The Live Nation concert ticket refunds recorded in the quarter then accounted for $465 million, and estimated additional future refunds from Live Nation-held cash totals $180 million. We then had ticket sales in the quarter that generated roughly $30 million of new deferred revenue. 
Looking at the rest of the year, our forecast for event-related deferred revenue at the end of the year prior to additional ticket sales and based on our projected refund rates is approximately $1.3 billion. Given all the uncertainty in the market and timing of shows, we cannot give you any further guidance beyond these burn rates and refund levels we just gave you. 
And with that, I will turn the call over to Kathy."

I will review our second quarter and 6-month results and provide updates on our balance sheet. All of our results for this quarter and the first 6 months of the year have been significantly impacted by the shutdo",575,"Thanks, Joe, and good afternoon, everyone. I will review our second quarter and 6-month results and provide updates on our balance sheet. All of our results for this quarter and the first 6 months of the year have been significantly impacted by the shutdown of our shows since mid-March due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which is driving all of the variances for both periods in total and across all segments. 
For the quarter, our revenue was $74 million compared to $3.2 billion last year, down 98%. AOI was a loss of $432 million for the quarter compared to earnings of $319 million in 2019. Our operating loss was $588 million compared to $172 million in operating income last year. And net loss for the quarter was $568 million compared to net income of $103 million in 2019. 
For the first 6 months, we generated $1.4 billion in revenue compared to $4.9 billion last year, down 71%. Most of this revenue in 2020 was driven by our show activity in the first 2.5 months of the year prior to the shutdown. AOI was a loss of $452 million for the first 6 months compared to income of $435 million in 2019. Our operating loss was $761 million compared to $148 million in operating income last year. And net loss for the first 6 months was $752 million compared to net income of $51 million in 2019. 
Now on to our balance sheet. As of June 30, we had total cash of $3.3 billion, which includes a free cash balance of $1.8 billion. Our total cash includes $941 million of current event-related deferred revenue as well as $486 million of long-term deferred revenue for events that have been rescheduled more than 1 year out as of June 30. This is part of our operating cash and therefore provides us additional liquidity. As Joe outlined, we estimate that our actions to conserve cash eliminates or defers approximately $1.4 billion in cash outflows for 2020, which includes the cash portion of our approximately $800 million in cost savings, along with a reduction in capital expenditures, lower acquisition activity and reduced concert and ticketing advances. 
In May 2020, we issued $1.2 billion principal amount of 6.5% senior secured notes due 2027. As of the end of the quarter, our total debt was $4.9 billion with a weighted average cost of 4.4%. We also have $966 million of available debt capacity between our revolvers and undrawn term loan A. Last week, we completed an amendment to our credit agreement, which amends and further suspends our net leverage covenant until December 31, 2021, if we choose, replacing it with a minimum liquidity test of $500 million, which is measured against our free cash, available debt capacity and up to $250 million of our event-related deferred revenue. We believe that our free cash, together with our undrawn debt capacity, gives us sufficient liquidity to maintain critical operations until shows return. 
Capital expenditures for the quarter were $55 million, giving us a total for the 6 months of $129 million. We are now estimating our full year spend to be approximately $215 million, down from our initial estimate for the year of $375 million. Of the remaining $86 million in capital expenditures for the year, approximately $30 million is for capitalized labor for updates to our ticketing systems, with the remainder largely venue-related and long-term projects.

In terms of the on-sales timing, as we indicated, we expect to be returning to scale with next summer particularly focused on the amphitheaters and festivals first. So I think that we would expect the usual timing of those on-sales, which would typically be for amphitheaters around the end of the year. So we don't expect for the full year the same. We expect it to be more back-half-loaded. But we do expect the on-sales to be somewhere around a few towards the end of the year and the bulk of them as we get into the first quarter of the year.
Second question in terms of the cash burn. The cash burn is with, I'll call it, relatively limited inflows more similar to what we have in Q2. So we did have some inflows but not obviously at scale or substantial. The cash burn numbers we gave you are assuming the status quo through Q4. And as we move further into it and we have better visibility on Q4, if there is some ramp-ups in activity which would give us both increased contribution margin as well as increased costs, we'll guide you to that as we get closer. But we thought that the more prudent and simple thing to do at this point is to give you the status quo. And then as we're -- as we have more going on, we'll increase both sides from there."

The press got ahold of a kind of a work in progress, which was too bad because it wasn't meant to be that. We, for a living, are negotiating deals with agents and managers. That's the business model. Their job is to look for competition, and our job is to bid on these shows in different terms for different artists and different times. So the process is always fluid. We're obviously trying to do our side of the negotiation and the agents do in their side. This got -- look -- this looked, I guess as it got reported, it was just a mid-statement. That wasn't meant to be anything more than that. But what we really wanted to accomplish is -- I would just step back and say the industry overall has been amazing dealing with restructuring '20 into '21. The agents, the managers and all the artists all have been very cooperative that -- understand that if you had a show this year and you wanted to reschedule next year, some compromise in the terms would have to be met. And the biggest risk we all had on the promoting side that we wanted to make sure that we could incorporate was the refunds. 
Now the refunds, as we've seen, have been surprisingly really strong on the concert side. And we didn't know what we were going to head into when we started renegotiating. But we do know on festivals, refund rates are much higher because it's a bigger cash outlet but it's also just a bigger time commitment. They don't tend to be as local as your average concert. So we wanted to make sure going into '21, if you were a headline artist that was going to play a certain festival this year and we wanted -- and you still wanted to play it next year, the 2 things we wanted to make sure that we were protected in and that we both shared some of the risk was a refund reduction and insurance. Those are the 2 principles. If you take all of the drama from the press leak aside, those are the 2 things we wanted to make sure that we weren't stuck paying the same price in '20 if we had a 31% refund rate on the festival. 
Now if those tickets also backed through and that festival ended up at the same place it was in '20, then we should all share the upside. And every agent and artists and manager have been incredibly accommodating to all the promoters in the business who are all looking for some help in terms of rescheduling next year's shows and taking and refunding insurance and making sure we are clear on those 2 terms. So that was the net result of it all. The rest was a wish list of things as we head into any negotiation. We'd all like to win but those are the 2 points that made sense that were most important for our business and for the festival P&Ls."

So I would say to you, if you had a tour that was on sale and it wasn't doing well, you and the artist decided to pull it down and not go forward with it regardless of COVID. So any tour that you rescheduled, you have the opportunity to look at that deal and at that show and then the number of dates, et cetera, and negotiate with the agent, manager and the artists on what was the best go-forward strategy. So anything -- we talk about 2021 is going to be a spectacular year in the sense of the stuff that did get pushed, you can guarantee was all of the stuff that was selling well and high demand. So that stuff is all going to -- those shows will still be continuing next year. We didn't have anything really on sale for '21 ahead of our '20 season of any substance.

So we have artists with lots of ideas on shows they could do now. We won't be doing DJ sets in the Hamptons anytime soon. We're going to play long and play safe. 
So the artists -- you nailed it. I was talking to an artist this morning. I think as you've read elsewhere, I think you're going to see a creative boom. I saw the record labels this week also down slightly because they need new releases and touring to happen to keep the machine moving. So yes, I think '21, you have artists that are -- all just keep calling me daily saying, ""When can I go? When is it going to be safe? When are we going to go? I'm dying to go. I got new music. I want to drop music."" So I think this is why we believe long term, regardless of what quarter we exactly scale at, the business will be stronger than ever with the creative push by all these artists who need to get on the road to drive their new music. So '21, '22, we can debate what quarter exactly ramps, but we believe '21 into '22 will be record years with artists on the road who are pent up. They need to get on the road economically, and they're now powered by creative backlog, and they're all waiting. I talked to an artist this morning. They were going to release in November. They're going to wait until March now so they can coincide with a tour scheduled later in the year in '21. So huge demand. We are very gifted in this industry in that we have an incredible supply chain of ongoing creative geniuses who make their living connecting with fans on the road. So that will continue. And we know now from all of the craziness we've seen across America that fans are going to gather. We just got to make sure we can do it safely.
As far as canceling and postponing, one of the things we decided really early on was to make sure that we offered refunds on postponed events also. We didn't want our deferred -- we didn't want deferred revenue to have any false narrative to it. And we still -- we are leading the industry. There are many companies that are not giving refunds. I think even ones who've got government money. But we believe that you need to offer the fans refunds for postponed and canceled shows, and we've done that. So we believe our actual number. When we talk about fans holding on, it's real. We make it very easy for you to get a refund right now at Ticketmaster if you go look at our site versus others. We even see a concert sold at Ticketmaster versus other ticket sites, the take rate is higher at Ticketmaster because it's very easy to get a refund. So I believe that the refund numbers are true. They're not suppressed in any manner on our business because we're offering both options. And if you see an artist that canceled versus postponed, it wouldn't be because he wants his fan to get money back. We've offered both those options for any tour. We have -- it may just be an artist that wasn't going to go on -- was going to go on the road, probably an older artist that is looking at it saying, ""Maybe I'm not going to run back and try to figure out if May is going to happen right now. I'll take a year off."" So you've seen some of those ones if they've said, ""I'll just wait."" If you're a younger artist tied to more record releases, you're probably really still waiting and ready to go up probably a little earlier given your demo."

Deferred revenue for events, I think at the end of the quarter, was about $940 million. And I think you said you thought it would be $1.3 billion at the end of the year. It's obviously the higher number, which is sort of counterintuitive given there is some refund activity expected. And I think, Joe, you said that did not include any benefit from on-sales. So what's the reconciling item? Or did I just maybe mishear you?"

One is we -- as part of that $941 million, that includes $180 million of what we've modeled out as additional refunds that we expect to happen. Because we were able to model it, we needed to shift that out of deferred revenue. So if our model were perfect, then that would have already been taken out. And the second is when we use the term deferred revenue, it is with regards to deferred revenue for events taking place over the next 12 months. That's never been an important nuance in the past because deferred revenue for things over a year ago has tended to be pretty small. But in this case, because we deferred a lot of shows into the second half of 2021, we have about $400 million of long-term deferred revenue that will flip into deferred revenue over the next 6 months. So your $900 million plus $400 million equals the $1.3 billion, rough numbers."

So first of all, to answer your question on what do you mean by scale, that scale, our normal business model in the summer, we'd be doing several thousand concerts a quarter and for tens of millions of fans. So we're not going to try to predict right now the exactness. Is it 70%? Is it 90%? What percent of last year is it? But it's in that type of volume. So why do we think it's going to happen? A couple of things. First of all, I think the efforts on the vaccine front are moving faster than anybody predicted 3 or 4 months ago. If you listen to the experts, the Dr. Faucis of the world and what are they saying in terms of their expectations where you have multiple, different vaccines with multiple, different approaches and their belief that something is going to happen by the end of the year is one of the vectors that gives you some comfort. The other is the progress being made on the treatments. We've obviously, as a medical community, learned a huge amount over the past 4 months in terms of the basic treatment, in terms of the -- perhaps the potential of antibody treatments, the use of other drugs, remdesivir and others, in terms of helping to reduce the mortality rate of it. 
So overall, in terms of -- as we've talked, we'll let the facts and the science lead us. We've been pleasantly surprised thus far on the progress of vaccines. Probably some of the testing and tracing has been slower but still now is ramping up, so between the testing, the tracing, the treatment also providing opportunities. So amongst those, I think we believe sitting here today that the facts would say that by the beginning of the year, you're able to put on the tickets on sale with comfort, you're going to be able to do the shows next summer. And then for the reasons that we've talked about, we have a high degree of comfort that the demand is going to be there, 86% of the people keeping their tickets to the shows, 2/3 of the people keeping their tickets for festivals that were canceled this year -- that have canceled but still saying they want to go to the show next year instead of getting their refund. So in total, over 19 million tickets for 4,000 shows that have already been sold, which, that alone, what we've already sold for 2021, would make us one of the largest promoters in the world. So all those factors together, I think, is what gives us the comfort."

So I don't think you'll see it there -- any effect there. I would say that it looks like in most of the countries, maybe the U.S. now, there's ongoing stimulus programs in effect and -- that seem to be coming to life for the live business in general, whether it's the employees, whether it's the venues, small or big. So I would assume some of them will have a continued, ongoing support through government programs to keep them afloat through this time. I mean listen, we're all in the same boat.

There have been no major changes in our business conditions or outlook since the last time we spoke. And while we see signs of promise around the world as some live events return, most regions we operate in continue to have various restrictions on live events. For now, we continue to maintain a strong cash management discipline while planning for the ramp-up to resume live shows as soon as possible. Joe will have a further update on cost and cash management efforts later in the call.
We also continue to see strong fan demand across the board. Our sales and survey data tell us fan demand will be there when the time is right. Our refund rate on rescheduled shows remained consistently low with 83% of fans globally keeping their tickets.  Our recent global survey indicates that 95% of fans are planning to return to live events when restrictions are lifted, the highest point of confidence since the start of the pandemic.  
Festival on sales for next year have been strong, with EDC Las Vegas 2021 selling out in 24 hours at a higher capacity than last year, and ticket sales for Redding, Creamfields and Isle of Wight festivals pacing ahead of last year. And we are encouraged by the enthusiasm for recent events and gatherings that have started to take place, including our first sold out arena tour with 20,000 fans in New Zealand, where business is headed back to normal.
Meanwhile, we are working on our roadmap to get back to live safely. We are encouraged by progress on testing technology, treatments and vaccines, which will help us build our plans. We still expect shows at scale next summer, but recognize that some exact timeline of this return will vary by region, so we continue to focus on remaining flexible.  
In preparation, there are 2 areas we are focusing on. On the technology front, Ticketmaster is creating the tools we need to make sure live events can deliver a variety of safe precautions when returning. New products such as our social distancing seat mapping tool and timed entry technology have been created to give venues the flexibility to plan how to manage everything from venue access to box office interactions.
Existing products, including our SafeTix digital ticket technology can fulfill new needs, including being a key facilitator for contact tracing. And the ability to integrate third-party applications with our digital ticketing platform enables a range of customizable features, from contactless concessions to testing and health questionnaire tracking.
On the concert front, Live Nation is developing a set of standards for executing shows at our venues. We are collaborating with health experts to develop show guidelines to put in place procedures, which can adopt to various situations across all regions.  
From venue sanitation procedures to fan-friendly policies on ticket purchases and the latest testing options, we are setting standards that will give the fans, crews and artists peace of mind before, during and after the show. As we look ahead, it is clear the path to live will not be a straight one. As such, we will maintain flexibility and focus on innovating during these times. On November 19 at our investor event, we will outline, in more detail, the opportunities we see emerging for our business.  
With that, I'll turn it over to Joe."
384687,692756434,3283409,"Live Nation Entertainment, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Nov 05, 2020",2020-11-05,"Earnings Calls","Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. We've added some additional tables at the back of our earnings release. So this quarter, I will hit the key numbers as opposed to reconciling every number as I did last quarter.  As Michael noted, we've con",825,"Thanks, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. We've added some additional tables at the back of our earnings release. So this quarter, I will hit the key numbers as opposed to reconciling every number as I did last quarter.  
As Michael noted, we've continued to strengthen our financial position during the third quarter, and all the key numbers are in line with or better than what we forecast last quarter. As a result, we are confident that our actions taken to cut costs and increase liquidity will provide us with the runway we need until the time is right to bring shows back.  
As part of this, we have further reduced all discretionary spending by another approximately $100 million and have now lowered costs for this year by over $900 million and reduced our cash usage by $1.5 billion relative to our pre-COVID plans. With these reductions, we have lowered the estimate on our operational cash burn rate to $110 million per month and our gross burn rate to $175 million per month, on average, for the last 9 months of the year and prior to the benefit of contribution margin generated by the business.  
Included in our gross burn estimate is approximately $40 million in severance expense estimated through year-end, which we expect to generate over $200 million in annual run rate savings. Our free cash at the end of the third quarter is $951 million. And along with over $950 million of available debt capacity, we have $1.9 billion in readily available liquidity. At the same time, refund rates for Q3 remained low at 17% globally.  As a result, deferred revenue is at $1.4 billion as of the end of Q3, and we have increased our forecast than what we expect at the end of the year, now $1.4 billion.
Turning to our Q3 results, starting with AOI. Our AOI loss for the quarter was $319 million, which consisted of $337 million in operational cash burn, $50 million in other noncash fixed costs and $68 million of contribution margin, which included $73 million from operations, along with other onetime items. One point to note here is that this CM from operations includes our sponsorship business, where we've been able to maintain 90% of the commitments that were in place at the end of February. The bulk of the sponsorship moved into 2021, but some of it was repurposed into other assets, including streaming concerts.
Looking at free cash. We ended the third quarter with $951 million in free cash compared to $1.8 billion at the end of Q2, in line with what we expected and consistent with what we told you last quarter, which translates to an $821 million reduction in our free cash metric for the quarter. As part of this, we had a reduction in free cash of $333 million due to working capital timing, which is part of the $415 million flip we told you last quarter would be happening in Q3 and Q4. We expect the remaining $80 million of this timing impact will affect free cash in Q4.
The majority of this timing shift resulted from shows scheduled for Q3 of 2021 shifting from long-term deferred revenue to current deferred revenue, so is an accounting shift as opposed to actual use of cash. As a result, our total effective cash burn was $488 million for the quarter, or approximately $160 million per month, which aligns with our gross cash burn, net of contribution margin generated in the quarter.
Now ticket refunds. As I indicated, the global refund rate for Live Nation concerts that are rescheduled and are in or have gone through a refund window is 17% through the end of Q3. Festivals have generally canceled this year's event. But for festivals where fans can retain their tickets for next year's show, 63% of fans are doing so and keeping their tickets.
A bit more detail on deferred revenue, which is tracking ahead of where we told you last quarter we were going to be. At the end of the third quarter, deferred revenue for events in the next 12 months was $1.4 billion. Of the $421 million increase, $383 million was due to a shift from long-term deferred revenue to current deferred revenue for concerts rescheduled to Q3 of 2021. At the end of the third quarter, we still had $103 million of long-term deferred revenue, most of which will flip to short-term deferred revenue by the end of the year.
Given this, along with the projected Q4 outflow of $74 million from additional ticket refunds, we now forecast deferred revenue of $1.4 billion at the end of the year prior to any additional ticket sales. Given the uncertainty in the market on timing of shows returning, we cannot give any more guidance beyond the burn rates and refund levels we just gave you.  
With that, let's open the call for any questions for Michael, Kathy or me."

There's always a few global superstars that probably can go direct and drive some significant dollars. But generally, this business, we think, is a complement to and a promotion to their core concert. 
So we think it's a great opportunity. Listen, we've been dabbling in virtual for years, whether it was streaming through Twitter and Yahoo! and streaming ourselves for sponsors. So we've been streaming our festivals on YouTube for years. We now look at that as a continuation of that. And we think going into '21 and '22, we'll be streaming a lot more of our concerts to fans that maybe either can't show up at the event. Or some that may want to still stream on our app when they're at the event because there's some added value of digital backrooms or camera angles, et cetera. 
So we think it's a great complement. It helps us probably drive a few incremental dollars per show. And also it has always been a great tool for sponsorship fulfillment."

There's nothing to read. This is like everyone is probably saying COVID excelled any strategy you had, in our case, while we've been sitting tight, we've been able to do a bunch of restructuring and rethinking of the business that we had planned over the next 3 years that we were able to do in the last 3 months. So going global on Ticketmaster was always the #1 priority.
We always knew that our greatest opportunity for kind of the TAM on Ticketmaster is going to be outside of the U.S. It's an incredible, powerful brand. We've expanded into markets where Live Nation has content. It's an allocation market. So as your concerts grow, you can feed your ticketing business. So it's been a huge opportunity.  
We haven't been successful at getting the global technology architecture excelled as fast as we wanted. The U.S. is always such a big kind of drag on resources when we're running at full steam, that we always get that -- projects get slightly pushed back to solve the latest U.S. technology need. This just let us excel the strategy that says we're going to now have one global technology stack, a much better efficient architecture around it, common global products that we can roll out at once and help excel our international expansion.
So I'm, myself, on the product when I moved from Toronto to London and lived there for 5 years, I think it was the single reason Live Nation is what it is today and plays global, is when you see from the outside in, all the opportunity, it gets you thinking differently. So I believe that the fastest way we would grow Ticketmaster to a global brand was let someone from the global side who's working the business every day, take the reins and drive that product. So we're -- we've been working with Marc for years, and they've been having a product strategy to get there. We just excelled the leadership team to do it now.

We're -- at the core, we're an enterprise platform, white labeling teams and venues all around the world. So whether it's the NFL or the Phoenix Suns or ultimately, artists, we're a great software platform to power your ticket needs.
And we're going to get better and better at that in terms of our do-it-yourself and white labeling and empowering artists and venues and teams to deliver their ticketing needs. It's been a great, great kind of test platform, is the virtual business. We've, overnight, had to become a virtual ticketing company at scale across the globe. And we've been able to do that. We are powering through our portfolio, all of these virtual shows and selling tickets to them. 
So that's been what we do at our core. And then two, we've always talked about being a better marketplace, making sure that the marketplace, the app, making sure that we have full inventory on the shelves, adding more inventory to the shelves, whether it's Ticketmaster clients or not, being a true marketplace where consumers can find tickets, buy them, stock the shelf through secondary third-party partners, adding more content to the shelves is the strategy.
So just take that global, then those 2 core strategies continue. We've got lots of clients to service on a global basis. We're under serviced and under market shared in many markets where our concerts are strong, and we're rolling out our global marketplace, best-in-class practices across our global marketplaces that are sitting on old platforms."

And there's no doubt, everyone in live service providers and companies are having a rough year. We've been very focused on making sure that the 12 million employees in Live, from the hairdresser to the lighting crew to the security guards, get some stimulus and help. We think those people are in the most need. So we've been very vocal about that.  
When it gets to the venues, in general, the thesis out there with Marc Geiger and some others, is that these independent venues are so distressed that they're going to throw someone the keys at a very cheap price, and you can maybe roll up some of these cheaply and have some scale. Well, the thesis is basically broken at the first point is, any great live club is not throwing anybody the keys cheaply. There's a lot of capital out there. So if you own the Troubadour in Los Angeles, it's a legendary business and you're having a tough year, you're not selling to Marc Geiger or anyone else at 1 or 2x multiple. Your access to capital, PPE loans, lots of ways you can keep your business afloat while you get through the storm.
So we don't think that there's a huge opportunity that there's a fire sale happening at that level. Now #2 is, we're the -- we have a consolidation of clubs in our business. Clubs on their own are a tough business if you scale them up on their own. They're not a really, really fruitful business on their own. So we like them as part of our overall ecosystem. But we don't believe that clubs, whether you own 10, whether you own 20 of them on their own, provide you much global synergy or U.S. synergy to leverage off of.
So we hope all these clubs find their way through this pandemic, like we hope all live service providers find their way through this and that the government and stimulus program is going to help them survive it. But we don't think that, that there's probably many that are going through fire sale to anybody because there's too many great options for them."

We can have a work-from-home strategy. We can reduce our office burn, our monthly burn and have a much more flexible work force, too. So work from home, a decentralized service model like ours, has been an incredible new gift to figure out how can we now restructure and still deliver the same volume without some of the costs.  
We've also re-engineered where we need offices and how we can have a regional model versus maybe a local at times.

I mean, everyone has been affected by this understands that the world is going to start differently. And it's going to require a slower ramp-up. So we see it already, and you see the drive-in shows we're doing, the social distance shows in Atlanta, The Roxy on the weekend, where we have maybe 20% to 40% attendance depending on the state. Those are all adjusted artist guarantees based on the capacity. So 100%, the artists will be coming back to work and adjusting their expectations to the realities of the capacity as we all, as an industry, start to scale up from 25% to 100% eventually."

We think that we've got enough to get us through until we ramp back up.  
Also remember that a lot of the cash starts flowing back into the business months before the shows themselves start, because you've got the concerts going on sale, which generates the cash in the Ticketmaster and in the sponsorship. So we think that will take us through this period until we can get ramped back up. At the same time, we know the same thing that you and everybody else knows is that there is tremendous liquidity out in the market should, at some point, the need arise, but we just don't see it at this point."

And the fact that we see streaming as being a very interesting complement to our business going forward, and we think it makes sense as an additional point of revenue for the artist and for the overall ecosystem. And when they do a show, they can also stream it for fans and other markets who can't get to the sold-out show and so on. So the ability to provide that digital ticket along with traditional tickets and do [Audio Gap] more important than something we're doing right now. So no question on that.
And then in terms of TM going forward in the globalization, again, Michael spoke to, and we've given you some of the numbers on the cost reduction, obviously, a chunk of that is associated with Ticketmaster and how we think about driving that on a globalized platform and taking some of the rust and inefficiencies that might have existed in accelerating, bringing that all together. I don't think we're going to give you specific numbers here today. But we certainly see overall some further reductions in the cost structure."

Nobody's going to want. And that's proven fundamentally wrong.
We're sitting at 17%, 6 months later, a fraction of what I think almost everybody was saying. So we remain very confident that it's -- there's not going to be an exact formula, but fans who were able to get a good ticket for an artist they want to go to, they're going to want to go to that show as soon as they possibly can, whenever that is."
