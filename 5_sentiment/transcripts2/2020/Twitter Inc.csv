I'd be very curious to get some additional color there. And then, Ned, on the investment side, I wanted to know if we could understand that on the CapEx guidance.

I'll take both, and if Jack wants [indiscernible] on the audience side, he'll jump in. On the funnel, we continue to see a really consistent group of people who come to Twitter every day who haven't used the service for a month or more or who have never used it before. And the work for us continues to be to help them find what they're looking for and give them a great experience on the service so that they'll come back more frequently. We see lots of opportunity, both to continue to convert people who have been infrequent users of Twitter and to convert those who are new to the service to become people who want to use Twitter every day to find out what's happening in the world and what people are talking about. So lots of opportunity in both. And if you look at the breadth of the MDAU growth that we delivered this quarter, where we grew double digits in all of our top 10 markets, with 15% growth in the U.S. and 23% growth internationally, we feel like that breadth demonstrates the opportunity. Your second question was on CapEx. So we grew CapEx 10% in 2019. Remember that number is going to move around from 1 period to another based on when servers show up and when checks go out. And we're not really optimizing for 90-day windows when we solve these things, optimizing for much longer timeframes than that. Our CapEx will grow between 45% and 55% this year. And the big change from the 10 to the 45 to 55 range, is that new data center that you mentioned. We're not going to break out the details in terms of how much of it is associated with 1 particular investment, but I suspect that the spend associated with the new data center will be biased more towards the second half of the year. And how far along we get in that project will cause that range to -- will be the biggest variable within the range that we've provided. This isn't a new normal for us in terms of CapEx growth rates. This is something that is more directly tied to a specific investment decision that we've made."

So just to step back a little bit, I do see Twitter more as an interest network then particularly the social network. And what we mean by that is for close to 14 years now, people have come to Twitter because they're interested in something happening in the world, some topics, some interests. And we make them do a ton of work at the moment to find and follow all the related accounts. We've had a number of initiatives in the past to address this, but none that have been as cohesive as our most recent ones. We have -- 2 vectors for this one, around lists and enabling people to very easily create a list, pin it to the top of their timeline, switch between those very quickly. We're going to have a ton more capabilities to this as well so they become even richer. You can add potentially other entities besides just accounts. And this is a great way to somewhat equivalent to a playlist where you can make something that you continue to maintain and then share with others. So that's the social aspect of it. And then with interest, you all have probably seen by now that if you see a tweet for instance about basketball, you might be prompted to follow the NBA or the Golden State Warriors. And after you do that, more tweets will show up right in your timeline. This gives us an opportunity to show the best tweets per any interest, the best accounts per any interest. It just really broadens our approach in the timeline and it makes the timeline extremely rich. We think this is great for people who use Twitter today. And we have seen a lot of engagement that signals a lot of positive things early on. But where I think this really makes a difference is how we think about onboarding. And keep in mind, when people come to Twitter, they still have to do all that work around finding and following the accounts that are related to their interest. And we think we can take a bunch of that friction away, pay attention to the context that they happen to be in such as location and give them a rich timeline right away. Now again, we've had a ton of experiments on on-boarding in the past, but I don't think we fully saw through to how people would be using Twitter on a daily basis. So I do believe this is ultimately transformational in all the positive ways. I think it gives people a rich timeline right away, but it also gives them a path towards discovering even more. And ideally, getting them to a position where they feel a lot more comfortable participating in a conversation and not feeling like they're just tweeting at the world but treating at a particular interest."

So those did indeed have 4 or more points of impact in the fourth quarter, as we talked about back in October. It doesn't make sense to break that out over the course of this year as those are issues that we're going to continue to address as the year continues. As a reminder, the way we think about remediation for those things is a fewfold. The first is we worked in Q4 to ship anonymized aggregated data to measurement partners. That's a first step along the way. A second step is we want to continue to help the people who use the service, realize the benefits of a more personalized experience on Twitter. We continue to see that as an opportunity for us. And as we continue to carefully balance our own company principles around data privacy and transparency with local regulation, with the desire to get people into a timeline quickly, with the desire to make sure they have a great experience on Twitter over time, our thinking continues to evolve. And again, we see opportunity there. And then the third step is to continue our work on rebuilding the ad server that Jack went through in his opening comments, which we expect to complete in the first half of this year. And to continue our work to come out with a new version of our mobile application promotion ad format, not just to help, improve an existing ad format for us. That's important for our current advertisers, but also because this will give us a better path towards more direct response advertising over time. If I step back from all this stuff, I'd just point out that advertiser sentiment remains strong. They continue to want to work with us to launch new products and services and connect with what's happening. And you asked about the rest of this year. And although we're not giving guidance beyond the first quarter, there's a ton of stuff that we're really excited about both from an audience perspective and from an advertiser perspective. Some of it is quadrennial in nature, like the Olympics, the Eurocup, the U.S. presidential election, but there also are the annual events and those unanticipated things that bring people to Twitter to find out what's happening and what people are talking about."

Can you get into the specifics of some of the improvements that you have made to your programmatic technologies and maybe what the pipeline looks like there, particularly the degree to which you've been able to close the gap between where Twitter is in terms of being able to handle the demands of direct response advertisers and what you see from some of the bigger platforms?

We want to attract great people to the company who want to work on the latest technology. We want to make sure that when you want to improve something that you can work on a component of the ad server and that you don't need teams that work across all of it. We want to be able to test things faster and roll them faster. An example of that is our revenue science team now is 5x the capacity to build new products and features which should ultimately lead to improved relevance for advertisers over time. So we've shipped a number of improvements already, and we expect that work to continue during the first half of the year but to be completed within this year -- I'm sorry, within the first half of the year. And the work is also tied to our work on Map because as we continue to work to ship a new version of Map, we feel like we'll have a better opportunity to help advertisers with more direct response type opportunities over time. The second part of your question was around international DAU. We don't break out the DAU by region, but I'd just point to the fact that we grew double digits in all of our top 10 markets to give you a sense for the breadth that we saw in terms of how people came to and embraced use of the service on a daily basis. It's no particular event, it's no particular region, it's no particular demographic or use case. The way Twitter is designed is to allow people to find out about the topics and events that are most important to them wherever they are in the world and whatever those topics may be and to allow them to see all sides of those topics and events. And we're really proud of the momentum that we've developed all around the world, not in any particular place."

So 2 stores we're showing when you unpack the ad revenue from Q4. The first is that 20% growth in the United States, which demonstrates the strength of advertiser sentiment and the way we've been able to deliver for advertisers. A great example of that is Disney+ where we were able to help them with a critical launch where it was obviously a global launch, and we help them all over the world. But you saw it resonate with people in the United States, where they advertise the app, where they advertise the shows that people can see, where they want to help people help form their opinions about the service as well as download the app. That's a great example of a success story from us from Q4. We find that map and direct response tends to be a bigger part of our business outside of the United States than it is inside of the United States. We grew international revenue 3%. And inside of that, Japan grew 1%. So anticipating your questions around that, I'd really point to Map. And just to give you an anecdote, if you looked at APAC, broadly, Map was down 25% in APAC; brand continued to grow. And hopefully, that gives you a sense that advertiser sentiment in terms of wanting to work with Twitter to launch new products and services and to connect with what's happening, remains strong, but work remains for us on those different areas where we talked about on the revenue product side in order to better help advertisers outside of the United States. And so that's the work that we'll continue to undertake over the course of 2020. 
Sorry, I guess, another part of your question was around Q1 and what gives us the confidence around the range. The guidance philosophy continues to be that we want to give you the most likely scenarios for how things could play out at the time of the earnings call when we've got a couple of months left to go in the quarter. Q1 is a time when we see lots of people, get new devices and download apps for their devices. We see lots of annual events that come up in the U.S. and all around the world that are great engagement and revenue or advertising opportunities for us. And so we continue to work hard to execute well against those and to help advertisers realize their objectives. I'll give you a cool stat. When we look at the Super Bowl, we had all but one of the eligible advertisers from the Super Bowl advertising on Twitter around the time of the Super Bowl. A couple of them were political advertisers. And you all know that we don't accept their ads. But to get all all of it one of the others to advertise on Twitter, something we're really proud of and demonstrates how important we are to them, amplifying their message."

I on the Olympics, there are a couple of things to point out. When you think about all the work that we've done since the last summer Olympics, we now have event specific timelines. It's so much easier to find the information you're looking for on Twitter. We also have a much better sense for how to use live and stored video in order to improve the experience. So we'll have near real-time highlights of the most important events. People will get to vote on the content that they want to see on the service, the highlights that they want to see. And we announced our partnership with NBC a year before the opening ceremonies, which gave us the time to go find the right partners for all this great content, and then ultimately, we'll share the revenue the ad dollars with our content partners around these highlights all around the world. So we've learned a lot from the past about how to improve the conversation, how to improve the content and how to deliver better for advertisers, and you'll see a lot of that show up in the Olympics, which, of course, happen in our second largest market in Japan. I'll turn it to Jack on the second part. 
Just 1 point on the Olympics. We have to build infrastructure and product experiences that are scalable to every type of event. And I think the biggest experience that I think helps the Olympics a lot and helps people find the Olympics is around interest and topics. I do think, as I said earlier, this will be transformational for our service, but certainly, a much, much better foundation for us to serve events like the Olympics and events like the elections coming up and elections around the world. So these are -- our goal here is not just to focus on any 1 particular event, but to actually build scalable experiences that serve all events in an enduring way, in a durable way. In terms of location, as I said in my opening, I spent all last year traveling. I visited every one of our offices around the world. We -- our execution throughout the year, as I was traveling and as the management team was traveling continued its pace. I believe that we focused on our priorities in the same way that we would have otherwise I believe we had really good frameworks to understand any issues that would come up. We had a good understanding of how to address anything that we saw and move quickly on any opportunities that we saw as well. So I don't fear any slowness as we work to distribute our workforce more. And I do think that we have to build a company that's not dependent entirely upon San Francisco. We already have 2 members of our leadership team in New York, the rest -- the balance of that in San Francisco. I think as we look forward, we're reaching a talent pool that expects a lot more remote work, expects to work outside of California and outside of San Francisco. And we should be building our company around that. I haven't made any plans just yet for this year. But I do expect that I will travel. And I do think that we need to figure out how to build a company that is distributed, that is not burdened by time zones, but it is advantaged by them. And I think it will give us a lot more perspective into markets continue to emerge and are growing extremely quickly. And to the point where even our peers are looking very, very deeply within those markets and within this continent. So I think we have a good framework. No major changes to speak of, but we have to constantly improve it."

Is there any sense you can give us of just how many of your users on a global basis are actually following at least 1 topic? And then, Jack, in your opening remarks, you made a comment that there was issues blocking iteration. You know what they are. Could you give us a sense of what those blockages are just so we understand how quickly they can get addressed? And does that also apply to ad products or was that specifically about the kind of the core timeline product of Twitter? And then just sort of a big picture for either you or Ned, for a long time, I think both of you were sort of talking about being stuck in this 9% to 14% band for DAU growth or MDAU growth. Obviously, you've broken out of that the last couple of quarters, showing the sort of the product changes are working. But at 31 million U.S. DAU users, you're still tiny versus kind of the universe of available users. Is Twitter a product that you envisioned? Like, could it be 60 million U.S. users or 100 million U.S. users? Like how big do you think this product ultimately can be?"

We still really haven't promoted them heavily within the service. So they're still a little bit hard to discover. The topic browser is an initial go at what we want to do. It's over in the side menu, if you're in the app and you can browse topics and we continue to add topics every single day. We're adding more languages as well. But when we get a lot more confidence around the experience we're providing, we'll make it much, much more discoverable. In addition to the timeline prompts in the navigation itself. So right now, we're doing work to look at our navigation and really make sure that we're putting our best foot forward in terms of making that discoverable so that people can see it immediately. Onboarding is another opportunity obviously that we've been speaking to. And again, we want to make sure that the experience that people are going into is great before we put it in front of people who are just coming to the service or coming back to the service. So those are the only blockers to that. But the early signals are quite positive. And I'm really, really excited about this feature. This has been a long time coming. It's something we have wanted to do for years. And we're finally at the point where we can bring it all together. So I do think this changes a lot. In terms of the issues to our development speed, a lot of this has to do with our infrastructure. We're still working through how -- what we build on. And certainly, that affects the consumer side but also the ad product side. The revenue product team has moved very, very quickly to focus on the core ad infrastructure. And at the end of the day, per the previous question, what this means is as we look at the core infrastructure and we look at how people, how our engineers are actually building it, the better that is, the more stable it is, the easier it is to develop. It just means that we can run more experiments faster. We can build products much faster. We can learn much faster. We can get feedback loops from our customers much faster. So everything improves. And the same is true on the consumer side. We have to look deeply at our tools. We have to look deeply at our development time and what's blocking us. We have a better understanding of what some of those things are and also just our understanding of the service, how we utilize the data that we're seeing to better inform our decisions around experiments that we run. So we're working really hard to make sure that we can move much faster, so that we can experiment faster, we can learn faster and we can ship much faster. And this is something that has plagued us for years. But we've put it as our #1 priority as a company and we have an incredible team. Some of whom have been here for years, some of whom we've just attracted to the company to help us address this. And to your last question, absolutely. I mean, I think Twitter has value to everyone in the world. I think a big part of our work has been to help unlock that value for folks to help them understand why Twitter is variable. A lot of people see tweets every single day. They see them on television, they see them in newspapers. We haven't given them enough reason yet to come to the app and utilize it themselves. But everything that we're doing from interest to relevance in the timeline to conversations is towards that goal. And ultimately, this will come down to what people experienced when they first download the app or when they first open twitter.com. But we have the foundations in a really strong place where we can actually put a cohesive picture together for people. And that gets me really excited and confident that when people do hear Twitter, they'll have more reason to download and use it."

On the data licensing and other side, remember, there's 2 pieces to that revenue line. The first is the data and enterprise solutions opportunity where we feel really good about our execution. And as we mentioned a year ago, we said that we'd execute it so well on our strategy and bringing people to the right type of contract over the right term that we expected the growth rate to moderate. That proved to be the case, but we also continue to both renew our existing customers and find other new customers who we could help create a business or further build their business around our APIs. And there's lots more opportunity for us there. We made our APIs premium, and we're still seeing lots of opportunity in front of us around the data business. The second piece is MoPub, which is our mobile ad exchange. And we've got work to do there, and that's holding the growth rate down a bit. But we think we've got a good path forward. And one of the ways that MoPub will benefit is as we continue our work around more direct response oriented ad formats, starting with Map, that should benefit MoPub as well."

The same is true around our revenue products. We're rebuilding the ad server, we're coming out with a new version of MAP and leading to more direct response. Advertising formats for us over time will allow us to innovate faster and move faster, experiment faster. So we certainly think about leading with R&D when we think about the revenue products. On the Olympics, so as important as it is for us when we step back and think about the larger opportunity for us to have more direct response related offerings, starting with MAP. When we think about a quadrennial event like the Olympics and a lot of the advertising that you see are on these we feel like we're really well-positioned with our existing ad formats. That isn't to say that we're not focused on launching the new version of MAP as soon as we can, but it also means that the pre-roll that you often see around highlights the connecting with what's happening that you just saw around the Super Bowl that you'll see around the Olympics in the summer are things that we feel like we're really well-positioned to address with our existing ad formats.

More tha",579,"Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our fourth quarter call. A few highlights from me and Ned before we get to your questions. 
2019 was a great year for Twitter. Our focus on making the service more instantly relevant is compounding. More than half of the 26 million mDAUs we added in 2019 were directly driven by improvements to the core product. This quarter alone, we saw 21% year-over-year growth in daily active usage, our highest reported, bringing us to 152 million mDAU. This is an incredibly strong foundation to build upon. 
We're focused on 5 -- 4 priorities as we look forward. I'll talk about each now. First, we'll increase our development velocity and trust. While we've come a long way in improving our core infrastructure, we still aren't happy with how quickly we're able to move. The time it takes to go from an idea to shipping something remarkable to customers simply takes too long. We have a clear sense of what's blocking us, and we're working hard to fix it. Addressing this makes everything we want to do stronger and faster. 
Second, we'll increase healthy public conversation.
As we said before, we believe our work on health is a growth vector for us over the long term and fuels more conversations on Twitter. Misleading information is probably the biggest challenge facing us in our industry. This will be a key focus for us as we also continue to broaden the service towards following interest and topics, which, I believe, will be transformational for the service. Interest represent an entirely new way to use Twitter and will deliver far richer timelines from onboarding to daily use. 
Third, we'll increase revenue durability. As you are all aware, we found some bugs last quarter which impacted our performance. I'm confident in our work to address these issues and our path forward. One positive signal is that parts of our new ad stack that have already been shipped handled all the Super Bowl traffic. And while there's more work to do, we've worked through a lot on MAP with the goal of being a more performance-centric ads business. This work takes time, and we're committed to doing it in the right way. 
And finally, we'll enable anyone, anywhere to work to Twitter. I spent the majority of last year traveling to every one of our offices and some places we don't yet have a presence. We are a global service that requires global perspective. For us to continue to thrive and be valuable to people around the world, we need people from around the world to work with us. Our concentration in San Francisco is not serving us any longer, and we will strive to be a far more distributed workforce, which we will use to improve our execution. These 4 priorities will guide us for the next few years, and you should expect to see the results in our numbers. We have overcome so many challenges over the past 5 years. We've shown resilience in all the lows and highs, boldness in our stances and openness as we work to help public conversation in a way that benefits all, not just Twitter. I'm really proud of what we've been able to make happen, and I'm even more excited about how Twitter is evolving. We're working hard every day to make Twitter the public conversation layer of the Internet, and we love our work. 
And now, over to Ned."

Before we get into Q&A, I'll highlight a couple of points.

Before we get into Q&A, I'll highlight a couple of points. Total revenue reached $3.46 billion, up 15% on a constant currency basis with ad revenue also up 15% on a constant currency basis primarily driven by 21% growth in the United States. 
Q4 was a strong finish to the year with mDAU up 21% year-over-year. As Jack mentioned, this was largely driven by product improvements. 
We delivered solid operating performance across most major geographies despite the MAP headwinds, resulting in revenue up 11% year-over-year with particular strength in U.S. ads up 20% year-over-year. We also had our first $1 billion quarter. 
We continue to see a tremendous opportunity in front of us to get the whole world to use Twitter and to provide a more personalized experience across both organic and promoted content, delivering increasing value for both consumers and advertisers. 
Jack talked a bit about our objectives for 2020. To support that work, we expect to grow headcount by 20% or more this year with a focus on engineering, product design and research. Given investment decisions made in previous years and our anticipated 2020 headcount growth, we expect total expenses, which include cost of revenue and all operating expenses, to grow approximately 20% in 2020, ramping in absolute dollars over the course of the year.

I'll take both, and if Jack wants that thing on the audience side, he'll jump in. On the funnel, we continue to see a really consistent group of people who come to Twitter every day, who haven't used the service for a month or more or who have never used it before. And the work for us continues to be to help them find what they're looking for and give them a great experience on the service so that they'll come back more frequently. We see lots of opportunity both to continue to convert people who have been infrequent users of Twitter and to convert those who are new to the service to become people who want to use Twitter every day to find out what's happening in the world and what people are talking about. So lots of opportunity in both. And if you look at the breadth of the mDAU growth that we delivered this quarter where we grew double digits in all of our top 10 markets with 15% growth in the U.S. and 23% growth internationally, we feel like that breadth demonstrates the opportunity. 
Your second question was on CapEx. So we grew CapEx 10% in 2019. Remember, that number's going to move around from 1 period to another based on when servers show up and when checks go out. And we're not really optimizing for 90-day windows when we solve these things, we're optimizing for much longer time frames than that. Our CapEx will grow between 45% and 55% this year. And the big change from the 10% to the 45% to 55% range is that new data center that you mentioned. We're not going to break out the details in terms of how much of it is associated with 1 particular investment, but I suspect that the spend associated with the new data center will be biased more towards the second half of the year. And how far along we get in that project will cause that range to -- will be the biggest variable within the range that we've provided. This isn't a new normal for us in terms of CapEx growth rates. This is something that is more directly tied to a specific investment decision that we've made."

So just to step back a little bit, I do see Twitter more as an interest network than particularly a social network. And what we mean by that is for close to 14 years now, people have come to Twitter because they're interested in something happening in the world, some topics, some interests. And we make them do a ton of work at the moment to find and follow all the related accounts. We've had a number of initiatives in the past to address this, but none that have been as cohesive as our most recent ones. We have 2 -- 2 vectors for this one is around lists and enabling people to very easily create a list, pin it to the top of their timeline, switch between those very quickly. We're going to add a ton more capabilities to this as well so they become even richer. You can add potentially other entities besides just accounts. And this is a great way to -- it's somewhat equivalent to a playlist where you can make something that you continue to maintain and then share it with others. So that's the social aspect of it. 
And then with interest, you all have probably seen by now that if you see a tweet for instance about basketball, you might be prompted to follow the NBA or the Golden State Warriors. And after you do that, more tweets will show up right in your timeline. This gives us an opportunity to show the best tweets per any interest, the best accounts per any interest. It just really broadens our approach in the timeline, and it makes the timeline extremely rich. We think this is great for people who use Twitter today, and we have seen a lot of engagement that signals a lot of positive things early on. But where I think this really makes a difference is how we think about onboarding. And keep in mind, when people come to Twitter, they still have to do all that work around finding and following the accounts that are related to their interest. And we think we can take a bunch of that friction away, pay attention to the context that they happen to be in such as location and give them a rich timeline right away. Now again, we've had a ton of experiments on onboarding in the past, but I don't think we fully saw through to how people would be using Twitter on a daily basis. So I do believe this is ultimately transformational in all the positive ways. I think it gives people a rich timeline right away, but it also gives them a path towards discovering even more and ideally, getting them to a -- getting them to a position where they feel a lot more comfortable participating in a conversation and not feeling like they're just tweeting at the world, but tweeting at a particular interest."

So those did indeed have 4 or more points of impact in the fourth quarter, as we talked about back in October. It doesn't make sense to break that out over the course of this year as those are issues that we're going to continue to address as the year continues. As a reminder, the way we think about remediation for those things is a fewfold. The first is we worked in Q4 to ship anonymized aggregated data to measurement partners. That's a first step along the way. A second step is we want to continue to help the people who use the service realize the benefits of a more personalized experience on Twitter. We continue to see that as an opportunity for us. And as we continue to carefully balance our own company principles around data privacy and transparency with local regulation with the desire to get people into a timeline quickly, with the desire to make sure they have a great experience on Twitter over time, our thinking continues to evolve. And again, we see opportunity there. And then the third step is to continue our work on rebuilding the ad server that Jack went through in his opening comments, which we expect to complete in the first half of this year, and to continue our work to come out with a new version of our mobile application promotion ad format not just to help improve an existing ad format for us, that's important for our current advertisers, but also because this will give us a better path towards more direct response advertising over time. If I step back from all this stuff, I'd just point out that advertiser sentiment remains strong. They continue to want to work with us to launch new products and services and connect with what's happening. 
And you asked about the rest of this year. And although we're not giving guidance beyond the first quarter, there's a ton of stuff that we're really excited about both from an audience perspective and from an advertiser perspective. Some of it's quadrennial in nature like the Olympics, the EuroCup, the U.S. Presidential Election, but there also are the annual events and those unanticipated things that bring people to Twitter to find out what's happening and what people are talking about."

And then Ned, you've added 11 million international DAUs over the last 2 quarters. Could you break down some of the contributors to that DAU growth? To what degree is this new users to the platform, higher engagement among existing users? Are there specific countries, regions, topics, usage profiles that you would say are contributing to this significant growth?"

We want to attract great people to the company who want to work on the latest technology. We want to make sure that when you want to improve something that you can work on a component of the ad server and that you don't need teams that work across all of it. We want to be able to test things faster and roll them faster. An example of that is our revenue science team now is 5x the capacity to build new products and features, which should ultimately lead to improved relevance for advertisers over time. So we've shipped a number of improvements already, and we expect that work to continue during the first half of the year but to be completed within this year -- I'm sorry, within the first half of the year. And the work is also tied to our work on MAP. Because as we continue to work to ship a new version of MAP, we feel like we'll have a better opportunity to help advertisers with more direct-response-type opportunities over time. 
The second part of your question was around international DAU. We don't break out the DAU by region, but I'd just point to the fact that we grew double digits in all of our top 10 markets to give you a sense for the breadth that we saw in terms of how people came to and embraced use of the service on a daily basis. It's no particular event. It's no particular region. It's no particular demographic or use case. The way Twitter is designed is to allow people to find out about the topics and events that are most important to them wherever they are in the world and whatever those topics may be and to allow them to see all sides of those topics and events. And we're really proud of the momentum that we've developed all around the world, not in any particular place."

So there -- our 2 stores were showing when you unpack the ad revenue from Q4. The first is that 20% growth in the United States, which demonstrates the strength of advertiser sentiment and the way we've been able to deliver for advertisers. A great example of that is Disney+ where we were able to help them with a critical launch, where it was obviously a global launch, and we helped them all over the world. But you saw it resonate with people in the United States where they advertise the app, where they advertise the shows that people can see where they want to help people help form their opinions about the service as well as download the app. That's a great example of a success story from us from Q4. We find that MAP and direct response tends to be a bigger part of our business outside of the United States than it is inside of the United States. We grew international revenue 3%. And inside of that, Japan grew 1%. So anticipating your questions around that, I'd really point to MAP. And just to give you an anecdote, if you look at APAC, broadly, MAP was down 25% in APAC; brand continued to grow. And hopefully, that gives you a sense that advertiser sentiment in terms of wanting to work with Twitter to launch new products and services and to connect with what's happening remain strong, but work remains for us on those different areas where we talked about on the revenue product side in order to better help advertisers outside of the United States. And so that's the work that we'll continue to undertake over the course of 2020. 
Sorry, I guess another part of your question was around Q1 and what gives us the confidence around the range. The guidance philosophy continues to be that we want to give you the most likely scenarios for how things could play out at the time of the earnings call when we've got a couple of months left to go in the quarter. Q1 is a time when we see lots of people get new devices and download apps for their devices. We see lots of annual events that come up in the U.S. and all around the world that are great engagement and revenue or advertising opportunities for us. And so we continue to work hard to execute well against those and to help advertisers realize their objectives. I'll give you a cool stat. When we look at the Super Bowl, we had all but one of the eligible advertisers from the Super Bowl advertising on Twitter around the time of the Super Bowl. A couple of them were political advertisers. And you all know that we don't accept their ads. But to get all of it one of the others to advertise on Twitter, it's something we're really proud of and demonstrates how important we are to them in amplifying their message."

We historically have done a great job of showing people ads in their home timeline and have had opportunity to do a better job for them in other parts of the app. And we came out with the Promoted Trends spotlight, which is a great example of a way that we can help people in other parts of the app late last year and early this year. And there are other ways that we'll continue to work to help advertisers reach their customers when they're in an event-specific timeline, when they're searching for things in other parts of the surface area of the app. The ad server work, a lot of it is foundational and things where you'll find that we'll be able to move faster, we'll be able to test things faster, we'll be able to learn and adapt more quickly because we won't need to work across all the different components of the ad server in order to do our work."

Over time, we continue to believe that revenue can grow in excess of audience.

In terms of location, as I said in my opening, I spent all last year traveling. I visited every one of our offices around the world. We -- our execution throughout the year, as I was traveling and as the management team was traveling, continued its pace. I believe that we focused on our priorities in the same way that we would have otherwise. I believe we had really good frameworks to understand any issues that would come up. We had a good understanding of how to address anything that we saw and moved quickly on any opportunities that we saw as well. So I don't fear any slowness as we work to distribute our workforce more. And I do think that we have to build a company that's not dependent entirely upon San Francisco. We already have 2 members of our leadership team in New York, the rest -- the balance of that in San Francisco. I think as we look forward, we're reaching a talent pool that expects a lot more remote work, expects to work outside of California and outside of San Francisco, and we should be building our company around that. I haven't made any plans just yet for this year, but I do expect that I will travel. And I do think that we need to figure out how to build a company that is distributed, that is not burdened by time zones, but it is advantaged by them. And I think it'll give us a lot more perspective into markets that continue to emerge and are growing extremely quickly and to the point where even our peers are looking very, very deeply within those markets and within those continents. So I think we have a good framework. No major changes to speak of, but we have to constantly improve it."

It's over in the side menu if you're in the app and you can browse topics, and we continue to add topics every single day. We're adding more languages as well. But when we get a lot more confidence around the experience we're providing, we'll make it much, much more discoverable in addition to the timeline prompts in the navigation itself. So right now, we're doing work to look at our navigation and really make sure that we're putting our best foot forward in terms of making that discoverable so that people can see it immediately. 
Onboarding is another opportunity obviously that we've been speaking to. And again, we want to make sure that the experience that people are going into is great before we put it in front of people who are just coming to the service or coming back to the service. So that -- those are the only blockers to that. But the early signals are quite positive, and I'm really, really excited about this feature. This has been a long time coming. It's something we have wanted to do for years, and we're finally at a point where we can bring it all together. So I do think this changes a lot. 
In terms of the issues to our development speed, a lot of this has to do with our infrastructure. We're still working through how -- what we build on. And certainly, that affects the consumer side, but also the ad product side. The revenue product team has moved very, very quickly to focus on the core ad infrastructure. And at the end of the day, per the previous question, what this means is as we look at the core infrastructure and we look at how people -- how our engineers are actually building it that the better that is, the more stable it is, the easier it is to develop, it just means that we can run more experiments faster. We can build products much faster. We can learn much faster. We can get feedback loops from our customers much faster. So everything improves. And the same is true on the consumer side. We have to look deeply at our tools. We have to look deeply at our development time and what's blocking us. We have a better understanding of what some of those things are and also just our understanding of the service, how we utilize the data that we're seeing to better inform our decisions around experiments that we run. So we're working really hard to make sure that we can move much faster so that we can experiment faster, we can learn faster and we can ship much faster. And this is something that has plagued us for years, but we've put it as our #1 priority as a company. And we have an incredible team. Some of whom have been here for years, some of whom we've just attracted to the company to help us address this. 
And to your last question, absolutely. I mean I think Twitter has value to everyone in the world. I think a big part of our work has been to help unlock that value for folks to help them understand why Twitter is variable. A lot of people see tweets every single day. They see them on television, they see them in newspapers. We haven't given them enough reason yet to come to the app and utilize it themselves. But everything that we're doing from interest to relevance in the timeline to conversations is towards that goal. And ultimately, this will come down to what people experienced when they first download the app or when they first open twitter.com. But we have the foundations in a really strong place where we can actually put a cohesive piece -- picture together for people. And that gets me really excited and confident that when people do hear Twitter, they'll have more reason to download and use it."

So nothing to update on there. 
On the data licensing and other side, remember, there's 2 pieces to that revenue line. The first is the data and enterprise solutions opportunity where we feel really good about our execution. And as we mentioned a year ago, we said that we had executed so well on our strategy in bringing people to the right type of contract over the right term that we expected the growth rate to moderate. That proved to be the case, but we also continued to both renew our existing customers and find other new customers who we could help create a business or further build their business around our APIs. And there's lots more opportunity for us there. We made our APIs premium, and we're still seeing lots of opportunity in front of us around the data business. The second piece is MoPub, which is our mobile ad exchange. And we've got work to do there, and that's holding the growth rate down a bit. But we think we've got a good path forward. And one of the ways that MoPub will benefit is as we continue our work around more direct response-oriented ad formats, starting with MAP, that should benefit MoPub as well. Thank you."

When we tell them that we're the place to launch something new or to connect with what's happening, that really resonates. When we share our thinking that we've got the most valuable audience when they're most receptive, that really resonates with them as well. And so we feel good about advertiser sentiment and the way that our DAU growth is contributing to that. 
When we look at cohorts of people who are new to Twitter, we continue to be pleased with what we see in terms of their engagement and how they use the service.

On R&D. So we always try to lead with technology solutions, whether it's the work we do around health where we mentioned last quarter that more than half of the abuse in tweets that we action we're finding through machine learning as opposed to through people identifying them or this quarter where we mentioned that we have reduced the bystander reports by 27%, which we think is directly linked to the hard work that we're doing to be proactive and identify content that shouldn't be on the service before people pointed out to us. The same is true around our revenue products. We're rebuilding the ad server. We're coming out with a new version of MAP and leading to more direct response. Advertising formats for us over time will allow us to innovate faster and move faster, experiment faster. So we certainly think about leading with R&D when we think about the revenue products. 
On the Olympics, so as important as it is for us when we step back and think about the larger opportunity for us to have more direct-response-related offerings, starting with MAP, when we think about a quadrennial event like the Olympics, and a lot of the advertising that you see are on these, we feel like we're really well positioned with our existing ad formats. That isn't to say that we're not focused on launching the new version of MAP when -- as soon as we can, but it also means that the pre-roll that you often see around highlights, the connecting with what's happening that you just saw around the Super Bowl that you'll see around the Olympics in the summer are things that we feel like we're really well positioned to address with our existing ad formats.

More tha",579,"Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our fourth quarter call. A few highlights from me and Ned before we get to your questions. 
2019 was a great year for Twitter. Our focus on making the service more instantly relevant is compounding. More than half of the 26 million mDAUs we added in 2019 were directly driven by improvements to the core product. This quarter alone, we saw 21% year-over-year growth in daily active usage, our highest reported, bringing us to 152 million mDAU. This is an incredibly strong foundation to build upon. 
We're focused on 5 -- 4 priorities as we look forward. I'll talk about each now. First, we'll increase our development velocity and trust. While we've come a long way in improving our core infrastructure, we still aren't happy with how quickly we're able to move. The time it takes to go from an idea to shipping something remarkable to customers simply takes too long. We have a clear sense of what's blocking us, and we're working hard to fix it. Addressing this makes everything we want to do stronger and faster. 
Second, we'll increase healthy public conversation.
As we said before, we believe our work on health is a growth vector for us over the long term and fuels more conversations on Twitter. Misleading information is probably the biggest challenge facing us in our industry. This will be a key focus for us as we also continue to broaden the service towards following interest and topics, which, I believe, will be transformational for the service. Interest represent an entirely new way to use Twitter and will deliver far richer timelines from onboarding to daily use. 
Third, we'll increase revenue durability. As you are all aware, we found some bugs last quarter which impacted our performance. I'm confident in our work to address these issues and our path forward. One positive signal is that parts of our new ad stack that have already been shipped handled all the Super Bowl traffic. And while there's more work to do, we've worked through a lot on MAP with the goal of being a more performance-centric ads business. This work takes time, and we're committed to doing it in the right way. 
And finally, we'll enable anyone, anywhere to work at Twitter. I spent the majority of last year traveling to every one of our offices and some places we don't yet have a presence. We are a global service that requires global perspective. For us to continue to thrive and be valuable to people around the world, we need people from around the world to work with us. Our concentration in San Francisco is not serving us any longer, and we will strive to be a far more distributed workforce, which we will use to improve our execution. These 4 priorities will guide us for the next few years, and you should expect to see the results in our numbers. We have overcome so many challenges over the past 5 years. We've shown resilience in all the lows and highs, boldness in our stances and openness as we work to help public conversation in a way that benefits all, not just Twitter. I'm really proud of what we've been able to make happen, and I'm even more excited about how Twitter is evolving. We're working hard every day to make Twitter the public conversation layer of the Internet, and we love our work. 
And now, over to Ned."

Before we get into Q&A, I'll highlight a couple of points.

Before we get into Q&A, I'll highlight a couple of points. Total revenue reached $3.46 billion, up 15% on a constant currency basis with ad revenue also up 15% on a constant currency basis primarily driven by 21% growth in the United States. 
Q4 was a strong finish to the year with mDAU up 21% year-over-year. As Jack mentioned, this was largely driven by product improvements. 
We delivered solid operating performance across most major geographies despite the MAP headwinds, resulting in revenue up 11% year-over-year with particular strength in U.S. ads up 20% year-over-year. We also had our first $1 billion quarter. 
We continue to see a tremendous opportunity in front of us to get the whole world to use Twitter and to provide a more personalized experience across both organic and promoted content, delivering increasing value for both consumers and advertisers. 
Jack talked a bit about our objectives for 2020. To support that work, we expect to grow headcount by 20% or more this year with a focus on engineering, product design and research. Given investment decisions made in previous years and our anticipated 2020 headcount growth, we expect total expenses, which include cost of revenue and all operating expenses, to grow approximately 20% in 2020, ramping in absolute dollars over the course of the year. 
With that, we're ready to take your questions. Operator?"

Maybe just talk a little bit about what you're seeing of the funnel evolving from the MAUs you have today and the onboarding process at the top of the funnel compared to some of the product innovation you're doing and how that's translating into mDAU growth lower down the funnel. I'd be very curious to get some additional color there. 
And then, Ned, on the investment side, I wanted to know if we could understand better on the CapEx guidance. You called out 1 data center in 2020. How much of that CapEx is onetime in nature in 2020 versus maybe against the baseline that investors should be thinking about capital expenditures' needs for the business over the longer term?"

I'll take both, and if Jack wants to add anything on the audience side, he'll jump in. On the funnel, we continue to see a really consistent group of people who come to Twitter every day, who haven't used the service for a month or more or who have never used it before. And the work for us continues to be to help them find what they're looking for and give them a great experience on the service so that they'll come back more frequently. We see lots of opportunity both to continue to convert people who have been infrequent users of Twitter and to convert those who are new to the service to become people who want to use Twitter every day to find out what's happening in the world and what people are talking about. So lots of opportunity in both. And if you look at the breadth of the mDAU growth that we delivered this quarter where we grew double digits in all of our top 10 markets with 15% growth in the U.S. and 23% growth internationally, we feel like that breadth demonstrates the opportunity. 
Your second question was on CapEx. So we grew CapEx 10% in 2019. Remember, that number's going to move around from 1 period to another based on when servers show up and when checks go out. And we're not really optimizing for 90-day windows when we solve these things, we're optimizing for much longer time frames than that. Our CapEx will grow between 45% and 55% this year. And the big change from the 10% to the 45% to 55% range is that new data center that you mentioned. We're not going to break out the details in terms of how much of it is associated with 1 particular investment, but I suspect that the spend associated with the new data center will be biased more towards the second half of the year. And how far along we get in that project will cause that range to -- will be the biggest variable within the range that we've provided. This isn't a new normal for us in terms of CapEx growth rates. This is something that is more directly tied to a specific investment decision that we've made."

And then, Ned, you talked about the ad issues from last quarter weighing by 4 percentage points in 4Q. How should we think about that impact in 1Q and really in the first half of 2020? And can you talk a little bit about just the trajectory on revenue through the course of this year?"

So just to step back a little bit, I do see Twitter more as an interest network than particularly a social network. And what we mean by that is for close to 14 years now, people have come to Twitter because they're interested in something happening in the world, some topics, some interests. And we make them do a ton of work at the moment to find and follow all the related accounts. We've had a number of initiatives in the past to address this, but none that have been as cohesive as our most recent ones. We have 2 -- 2 vectors for this. One is around lists and enabling people to very easily create a list, pin it to the top of their timeline, switch between those very quickly. We're going to add a ton more capabilities to this as well so they become even richer. You can add potentially other entities besides just accounts. And this is a great way to -- it's somewhat equivalent to a playlist where you can make something that you continue to maintain and then share it with others. So that's the social aspect of it. 
And then with interest, you all have probably seen by now that if you see a tweet for instance about basketball, you might be prompted to follow the NBA or the Golden State Warriors. And after you do that, more tweets will show up right in your timeline. This gives us an opportunity to show the best tweets per any interest, the best accounts per any interest. It just really broadens our approach in the timeline, and it makes the timeline extremely rich. We think this is great for people who use Twitter today, and we have seen a lot of engagement that signals a lot of positive things early on. But where I think this really makes a difference is how we think about onboarding. And keep in mind, when people come to Twitter, they still have to do all that work around finding and following the accounts that are related to their interest. And we think we can take a bunch of that friction away, pay attention to the context that they happen to be in such as location and give them a rich timeline right away. Now again, we've had a ton of experiments on onboarding in the past, but I don't think we fully saw through to how people would be using Twitter on a daily basis. So I do believe this is ultimately transformational in all the positive ways. I think it gives people a rich timeline right away, but it also gives them a path towards discovering even more and ideally, getting them to a -- getting them to a position where they feel a lot more comfortable participating in a conversation and not feeling like they're just tweeting at the world, but tweeting at a particular interest."

So those did indeed have 4 or more points of impact in the fourth quarter, as we talked about back in October. It doesn't make sense to break that out over the course of this year as those are issues that we're going to continue to address as the year continues. As a reminder, the way we think about remediation for those things is a fewfold. The first is we worked in Q4 to ship anonymized aggregated data to measurement partners. That's a first step along the way. A second step is we want to continue to help the people who use the service realize the benefits of a more personalized experience on Twitter. We continue to see that as an opportunity for us. And as we continue to carefully balance our own company principles around data privacy and transparency with local regulation with the desire to get people into a timeline quickly, with the desire to make sure they have a great experience on Twitter over time, our thinking continues to evolve. And again, we see opportunity there. And then the third step is to continue our work on rebuilding the ad server that Jack went through in his opening comments, which we expect to complete in the first half of this year, and to continue our work to come out with a new version of our mobile application promotion ad format not just to help improve an existing ad format for us, that's important for our current advertisers, but also because this will give us a better path towards more direct response advertising over time. If I step back from all this stuff, I'd just point out that advertiser sentiment remains strong. They continue to want to work with us to launch new products and services and connect with what's happening. 
And you asked about the rest of this year. And although we're not giving guidance beyond the first quarter, there's a ton of stuff that we're really excited about both from an audience perspective and from an advertiser perspective. Some of it's quadrennial in nature like the Olympics, the EuroCup, the U.S. Presidential Election, but there also are the annual events and those unanticipated things that bring people to Twitter to find out what's happening and what people are talking about."

And then Ned, you've added 11 million international DAUs over the last 2 quarters. Could you break down some of the contributors to that DAU growth? To what degree is this new users to the platform, higher engagement among existing users? Are there specific countries, regions, topics, usage profiles that you would say are contributing to this significant growth?"

We want to attract great people to the company who want to work on the latest technology. We want to make sure that when you want to improve something that you can work on a component of the ad server and that you don't need teams that work across all of it. We want to be able to test things faster and roll them faster. An example of that is our revenue science team now is 5x the capacity to build new products and features, which should ultimately lead to improved relevance for advertisers over time. So we've shipped a number of improvements already, and we expect that work to continue during the first half of the year but to be completed within this year -- I'm sorry, within the first half of the year. And the work is also tied to our work on MAP. Because as we continue to work to ship a new version of MAP, we feel like we'll have a better opportunity to help advertisers with more direct-response-type opportunities over time. 
The second part of your question was around international DAU. We don't break out the DAU by region, but I'd just point to the fact that we grew double digits in all of our top 10 markets to give you a sense for the breadth that we saw in terms of how people came to and embraced use of the service on a daily basis. It's no particular event. It's no particular region. It's no particular demographic or use case. The way Twitter is designed is to allow people to find out about the topics and events that are most important to them wherever they are in the world and whatever those topics may be and to allow them to see all sides of those topics and events. And we're really proud of the momentum that we've developed all around the world, not in any particular place."

So there are 2 stories worth sharing when you unpack the ad revenue from Q4. The first is that 20% growth in the United States, which demonstrates the strength of advertiser sentiment and the way we've been able to deliver for advertisers. A great example of that is Disney+ where we were able to help them with a critical launch, where it was obviously a global launch, and we helped them all over the world. But you saw it resonate with people in the United States where they advertise the app, where they advertise the shows that people can see where they want to help people help form their opinions about the service as well as download the app. That's a great example of a success story from us from Q4. We find that MAP and direct response tends to be a bigger part of our business outside of the United States than it is inside of the United States. We grew international revenue 3%. And inside of that, Japan grew 1%. So anticipating your questions around that, I'd really point to MAP. And just to give you an anecdote, if you look at APAC, broadly, MAP was down 25% in APAC; brand continued to grow. And hopefully, that gives you a sense that advertiser sentiment in terms of wanting to work with Twitter to launch new products and services and to connect with what's happening remain strong, but work remains for us on those different areas where we talked about on the revenue product side in order to better help advertisers outside of the United States. And so that's the work that we'll continue to undertake over the course of 2020. 
Sorry, I guess another part of your question was around Q1 and what gives us the confidence around the range. The guidance philosophy continues to be that we want to give you the most likely scenarios for how things could play out at the time of the earnings call when we've got a couple of months left to go in the quarter. Q1 is a time when we see lots of people get new devices and download apps for their devices. We see lots of annual events that come up in the U.S. and all around the world that are great engagement and revenue or advertising opportunities for us. And so we continue to work hard to execute well against those and to help advertisers realize their objectives. I'll give you a cool stat. When we look at the Super Bowl, we had all but one of the eligible advertisers from the Super Bowl advertising on Twitter around the time of the Super Bowl. A couple of them were political advertisers. And you all know that we don't accept their ads. But to get all but one of the others to advertise on Twitter is something we're really proud of and demonstrates how important we are to them in amplifying their message."

If you want to learn more about the Super Bowl or about an event that's happening in your part of the world, we can show you a relevant ad based on the search that you run. We historically have done a great job of showing people ads in their home timeline and have had opportunity to do a better job for them in other parts of the app. And we came out with the Promoted Trends spotlight, which is a great example of a way that we can help people in other parts of the app late last year and early this year. And there are other ways that we'll continue to work to help advertisers reach their customers when they're in an event-specific timeline, when they're searching for things in other parts of the surface area of the app. The ad server work, a lot of it is foundational and things where you'll find that we'll be able to move faster, we'll be able to test things faster, we'll be able to learn and adapt more quickly because we won't need to work across all the different components of the ad server in order to do our work."

So these are -- our goal here is not just to focus on any 1 particular event, but to actually build scalable experiences that serve all events in an enduring way and a durable way. 
In terms of location, as I said in my opening, I spent all last year traveling. I visited every one of our offices around the world. We -- our execution throughout the year, as I was traveling and as the management team was traveling, continued its pace. I believe that we focused on our priorities in the same way that we would have otherwise. I believe we had really good frameworks to understand any issues that would come up. We had a good understanding of how to address anything that we saw and moved quickly on any opportunities that we saw as well. So I don't fear any slowness as we work to distribute our workforce more. And I do think that we have to build a company that's not dependent entirely upon San Francisco. We already have 2 members of our leadership team in New York, the rest -- the balance of that in San Francisco. I think as we look forward, we're reaching a talent pool that expects a lot more remote work, expects to work outside of California and outside of San Francisco, and we should be building our company around that. I haven't made any plans just yet for this year, but I do expect that I will travel. And I do think that we need to figure out how to build a company that is distributed, that is not burdened by time zones, but it is advantaged by them. And I think it'll give us a lot more perspective into markets that continue to emerge and are growing extremely quickly and to the point where even our peers are looking very, very deeply within those markets and within those continents. So I think we have a good framework. No major changes to speak of, but we have to constantly improve it."

And then just sort of a big picture for either you or Ned, you -- for a long time, I think both of you were sort of talking about being stuck in this 9% to 14% band for DAU growth or mDAU growth. Obviously, you've broken out of that the last couple of quarters, showing the sort of the product changes are working. But at 31 million U.S. DAU users, you're still tiny versus kind of the universe of available users. Is Twitter a product that you envisioned?

We still really haven't promoted them heavily within the service. So they're still a little bit hard to discover. The topic browser is an initial go at what we want to do. It's over in the side menu if you're in the app and you can browse topics, and we continue to add topics every single day. We're adding more languages as well. But when we get a lot more confidence around the experience we're providing, we'll make it much, much more discoverable in addition to the timeline prompts in the navigation itself. So right now, we're doing work to look at our navigation and really make sure that we're putting our best foot forward in terms of making that discoverable so that people can see it immediately. 
Onboarding is another opportunity obviously that we've been speaking to. And again, we want to make sure that the experience that people are going into is great before we put it in front of people who are just coming to the service or coming back to the service. So that -- those are the only blockers to that. But the early signals are quite positive, and I'm really, really excited about this feature. This has been a long time coming. It's something we have wanted to do for years, and we're finally at a point where we can bring it all together. So I do think this changes a lot. 
In terms of the issues to our development speed, a lot of this has to do with our infrastructure. We're still working through how -- what we build on. And certainly, that affects the consumer side, but also the ad product side. The revenue product team has moved very, very quickly to focus on the core ad infrastructure. And at the end of the day, per the previous question, what this means is as we look at the core infrastructure and we look at how people -- how our engineers are actually building it that the better that is, the more stable it is, the easier it is to develop, it just means that we can run more experiments faster. We can build products much faster. We can learn much faster. We can get feedback loops from our customers much faster. So everything improves. And the same is true on the consumer side. We have to look deeply at our tools. We have to look deeply at our development time and what's blocking us. We have a better understanding of what some of those things are and also just our understanding of the service, how we utilize the data that we're seeing to better inform our decisions around experiments that we run. So we're working really hard to make sure that we can move much faster so that we can experiment faster, we can learn faster and we can ship much faster. And this is something that has plagued us for years, but we've put it as our #1 priority as a company. And we have an incredible team. Some of whom have been here for years, some of whom we've just attracted to the company to help us address this. 
And to your last question, absolutely. I mean I think Twitter has value to everyone in the world. I think a big part of our work has been to help unlock that value for folks to help them understand why Twitter is valuable. A lot of people see tweets every single day. They see them on television, they see them in newspapers. We haven't given them enough reason yet to come to the app and utilize it themselves. But everything that we're doing from interest to relevance in the timeline to conversations is towards that goal. And ultimately, this will come down to what people experience when they first download the app or when they first open twitter.com.

So nothing to update on there. 
On the data licensing and other side, remember, there's 2 pieces to that revenue line. The first is the data and enterprise solutions opportunity where we feel really good about our execution. And as we mentioned a year ago, we said that we had executed so well on our strategy in bringing people to the right type of contract over the right term that we expected the growth rate to moderate. That proved to be the case, but we also continued to both renew our existing customers and find other new customers who we could help create a business or further build their business around our APIs. And there's lots more opportunity for us there. We made our APIs premium, and we're still seeing lots of opportunity in front of us around the data business. The second piece is MoPub, which is our mobile ad exchange. And we've got work to do there, and that's holding the growth rate down a bit. But we think we've got a good path forward. And one of the ways that MoPub will benefit is as we continue our work around more direct response-oriented ad formats, starting with MAP, that should benefit MoPub as well. Thank you."

When we share our thinking that we've got the most valuable audience when they're most receptive, that really resonates with them as well.

The same is true around our revenue products. We're rebuilding the ad server. We're coming out with a new version of MAP and leading to more direct response. Advertising formats for us over time will allow us to innovate faster and move faster, experiment faster. So we certainly think about leading with R&D when we think about the revenue products. 
On the Olympics, so as important as it is for us when we step back and think about the larger opportunity for us to have more direct-response-related offerings, starting with MAP, when we think about a quadrennial event like the Olympics, and a lot of the advertising that you see are on these, we feel like we're really well positioned with our existing ad formats.

More tha",579,"Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our fourth quarter call. A few highlights from me and Ned before we get to your questions. 
2019 was a great year for Twitter. Our focus on making the service more instantly relevant is compounding. More than half of the 26 million mDAUs we added in 2019 were directly driven by improvements to the core product. This quarter alone, we saw 21% year-over-year growth in daily active usage, our highest reported, bringing us to 152 million mDAU. This is an incredibly strong foundation to build upon. 
We're focused on 5 -- 4 priorities as we look forward. I'll talk about each now. First, we'll increase our development velocity and trust. While we've come a long way in improving our core infrastructure, we still aren't happy with how quickly we're able to move. The time it takes to go from an idea to shipping something remarkable to customers simply takes too long. We have a clear sense of what's blocking us, and we're working hard to fix it. Addressing this makes everything we want to do stronger and faster. 
Second, we'll increase healthy public conversation.
As we said before, we believe our work on health is a growth vector for us over the long term and fuels more conversations on Twitter. Misleading information is probably the biggest challenge facing us in our industry. This will be a key focus for us as we also continue to broaden the service towards following interest and topics, which I believe, will be transformational for the service. Interest represent an entirely new way to use Twitter and will deliver far richer timelines from onboarding to daily use. 
Third, we'll increase revenue durability. As you are all aware, we found some bugs last quarter which impacted our performance. I'm confident in our work to address these issues and our path forward. One positive signal is that parts of our new ad stack that have already been shipped handled all the Super Bowl traffic. And while there's more work to do, we've worked through a lot on MAP with the goal of being a more performance-centric ads business. This work takes time, and we're committed to doing it in the right way. 
And finally, we'll enable anyone, anywhere to work at Twitter. I spent the majority of last year traveling to every one of our offices and some places we don't yet have a presence. We are a global service that requires global perspective. For us to continue to thrive and be valuable to people around the world, we need people from around the world to work with us. Our concentration in San Francisco is not serving us any longer, and we will strive to be a far more distributed workforce, which we will use to improve our execution. These 4 priorities will guide us for the next few years, and you should expect to see the results in our numbers. We have overcome so many challenges over the past 5 years. We've shown resilience in all the lows and highs, boldness in our stances and openness as we work to help public conversation in a way that benefits all, not just Twitter. I'm really proud of what we've been able to make happen, and I'm even more excited about how Twitter is evolving. We're working hard every day to make Twitter the public conversation layer of the Internet, and we love our work. 
And now, over to Ned."

Before we get into Q&A, I'll highlight a couple of points.

Before we get into Q&A, I'll highlight a couple of points. Total revenue reached $3.46 billion, up 15% on a constant currency basis with ad revenue also up 15% on a constant currency basis primarily driven by 21% growth in the United States. 
Q4 was a strong finish to the year with mDAU up 21% year-over-year. As Jack mentioned, this was largely driven by product improvements. 
We delivered solid operating performance across most major geographies despite the MAP headwinds, resulting in revenue up 11% year-over-year with particular strength in U.S. ads up 20% year-over-year. We also had our first $1 billion quarter. 
We continue to see a tremendous opportunity in front of us to get the whole world to use Twitter and to provide a more personalized experience across both organic and promoted content, delivering increasing value for both consumers and advertisers. 
Jack talked a bit about our objectives for 2020. To support that work, we expect to grow headcount by 20% or more this year with a focus on engineering, product design and research. Given investment decisions made in previous years and our anticipated 2020 headcount growth, we expect total expenses, which include cost of revenue and all operating expenses, to grow approximately 20% in 2020, ramping in absolute dollars over the course of the year. 
With that, we're ready to take your questions. Operator?"

Maybe just talk a little bit about what you're seeing of the funnel evolving from the MAUs you have today and the onboarding process at the top of the funnel compared to some of the product innovation you're doing and how that's translating into mDAU growth lower down the funnel. I'd be very curious to get some additional color there. 
And then, Ned, on the investment side, I wanted to know if we could understand better on the CapEx guidance. You called out 1 data center in 2020. How much of that CapEx is onetime in nature in 2020 versus maybe against the baseline that investors should be thinking about capital expenditures' needs for the business over the longer term?"

I'll take both, and if Jack wants to add anything on the audience side, he'll jump in. On the funnel, we continue to see a really consistent group of people who come to Twitter every day, who haven't used the service for a month or more or who have never used it before. And the work for us continues to be to help them find what they're looking for and give them a great experience on the service so that they'll come back more frequently. We see lots of opportunity both to continue to convert people who have been infrequent users of Twitter and to convert those who are new to the service to become people who want to use Twitter every day to find out what's happening in the world and what people are talking about. So lots of opportunity in both. And if you look at the breadth of the mDAU growth that we delivered this quarter where we grew double digits in all of our top 10 markets with 15% growth in the U.S. and 23% growth internationally, we feel like that breadth demonstrates the opportunity. 
Your second question was on CapEx. So we grew CapEx 10% in 2019. Remember, that number's going to move around from 1 period to another based on when servers show up and when checks go out. And we're not really optimizing for 90-day windows when we solve these things, we're optimizing for much longer time frames than that. Our CapEx will grow between 45% and 55% this year. And the big change from the 10% to the 45% to 55% range is that new data center that you mentioned. We're not going to break out the details in terms of how much of it is associated with 1 particular investment, but I suspect that the spend associated with the new data center will be biased more towards the second half of the year. And how far along we get in that project will cause that range to -- will be the biggest variable within the range that we've provided. This isn't a new normal for us in terms of CapEx growth rates. This is something that is more directly tied to a specific investment decision that we've made."

So just to step back a little bit, I do see Twitter more as an interest network than particularly a social network. And what we mean by that is for close to 14 years now, people have come to Twitter because they're interested in something happening in the world, some topics, some interests. And we make them do a ton of work at the moment to find and follow all the related accounts. We've had a number of initiatives in the past to address this, but none that have been as cohesive as our most recent ones. We have 2 -- 2 vectors for this. One is around lists and enabling people to very easily create a list, pin it to the top of their timeline, switch between those very quickly. We're going to add a ton more capabilities to this as well so they become even richer. You can add potentially other entities besides just accounts. And this is a great way to -- it's somewhat equivalent to a playlist where you can make something that you continue to maintain and then share it with others. So that's the social aspect of it. 
And then with interest, you all have probably seen by now that if you see a tweet for instance about basketball, you might be prompted to follow the NBA or the Golden State Warriors. And after you do that, more tweets will show up right in your timeline. This gives us an opportunity to show the best tweets per any interest, the best accounts per any interest. It just really broadens our approach in the timeline, and it makes the timeline extremely rich. We think this is great for people who use Twitter today, and we have seen a lot of engagement that signals a lot of positive things early on. But where I think this really makes a difference is how we think about onboarding. And keep in mind, when people come to Twitter, they still have to do all that work around finding and following the accounts that are related to their interest. And we think we can take a bunch of that friction away, pay attention to the context that they happen to be in such as location and give them a rich timeline right away. Now again, we've had a ton of experiments on onboarding in the past, but I don't think we fully saw through to how people would be using Twitter on a daily basis. So I do believe this is ultimately transformational in all the positive ways. I think it gives people a rich timeline right away, but it also gives them a path towards discovering even more and ideally, getting them to a -- getting them to a position where they feel a lot more comfortable participating in a conversation and not feeling like they're just tweeting at the world, but tweeting at a particular interest."

So those did indeed have 4 or more points of impact in the fourth quarter, as we talked about back in October. It doesn't make sense to break that out over the course of this year as those are issues that we're going to continue to address as the year continues. As a reminder, the way we think about remediation for those things is a fewfold. The first is we worked in Q4 to ship anonymized aggregated data to measurement partners. That's a first step along the way. A second step is we want to continue to help the people who use the service realize the benefits of a more personalized experience on Twitter. We continue to see that as an opportunity for us. And as we continue to carefully balance our own company principles around data privacy and transparency with local regulation with the desire to get people into a timeline quickly, with the desire to make sure they have a great experience on Twitter over time, our thinking continues to evolve. And again, we see opportunity there. And then the third step is to continue our work on rebuilding the ad server that Jack went through in his opening comments, which we expect to complete in the first half of this year, and to continue our work to come out with a new version of our mobile application promotion ad format not just to help improve an existing ad format for us, that's important for our current advertisers, but also because this will give us a better path towards more direct response advertising over time. If I step back from all this stuff, I'd just point out that advertiser sentiment remains strong. They continue to want to work with us to launch new products and services and connect with what's happening. 
And you asked about the rest of this year. And although we're not giving guidance beyond the first quarter, there's a ton of stuff that we're really excited about both from an audience perspective and from an advertiser perspective. Some of it's quadrennial in nature like the Olympics, the EuroCup, the U.S. Presidential Election, but there also are the annual events and those unanticipated things that bring people to Twitter to find out what's happening and what people are talking about."

And then Ned, you've added 11 million international DAUs over the last 2 quarters. Could you break down some of the contributors to that DAU growth? To what degree is this new users to the platform, higher engagement among existing users?

We want to attract great people to the company who want to work on the latest technology. We want to make sure that when you want to improve something that you can work on a component of the ad server and that you don't need teams that work across all of it. We want to be able to test things faster and roll them faster. An example of that is our revenue science team now is 5x the capacity to build new products and features, which should ultimately lead to improved relevance for advertisers over time. So we've shipped a number of improvements already, and we expect that work to continue during the first half of the year but to be completed within this year -- I'm sorry, within the first half of the year. And the work is also tied to our work on MAP. Because as we continue to work to ship a new version of MAP, we feel like we'll have a better opportunity to help advertisers with more direct-response-type opportunities over time. 
The second part of your question was around international DAU. We don't break out the DAU by region, but I'd just point to the fact that we grew double digits in all of our top 10 markets to give you a sense for the breadth that we saw in terms of how people came to and embraced use of the service on a daily basis. It's no particular event. It's no particular region. It's no particular demographic or use case. The way Twitter is designed is to allow people to find out about the topics and events that are most important to them wherever they are in the world and whatever those topics may be and to allow them to see all sides of those topics and events. And we're really proud of the momentum that we've developed all around the world, not in any particular place."

So there are 2 stories worth sharing when you unpack the ad revenue from Q4. The first is that 20% growth in the United States, which demonstrates the strength of advertiser sentiment and the way we've been able to deliver for advertisers. A great example of that is Disney+ where we were able to help them with a critical launch, where it was obviously a global launch, and we helped them all over the world. But you saw it resonate with people in the United States where they advertise the app, where they advertise the shows that people can see where they want to help people help form their opinions about the service as well as download the app. That's a great example of a success story from us from Q4. We find that MAP and direct response tends to be a bigger part of our business outside of the United States than it is inside of the United States. We grew international revenue 3%. And inside of that, Japan grew 1%. So anticipating your questions around that, I'd really point to MAP. And just to give you an anecdote, if you look at APAC, broadly, MAP was down 25% in APAC; brand continued to grow. And hopefully, that gives you a sense that advertiser sentiment in terms of wanting to work with Twitter to launch new products and services and to connect with what's happening remain strong, but work remains for us on those different areas where we talked about on the revenue product side in order to better help advertisers outside of the United States. And so that's the work that we'll continue to undertake over the course of 2020. 
Sorry, I guess another part of your question was around Q1 and what gives us the confidence around the range. The guidance philosophy continues to be that we want to give you the most likely scenarios for how things could play out at the time of the earnings call when we've got a couple of months left to go in the quarter. Q1 is a time when we see lots of people get new devices and download apps for their devices. We see lots of annual events that come up in the U.S. and all around the world that are great engagement and revenue or advertising opportunities for us. And so we continue to work hard to execute well against those and to help advertisers realize their objectives. I'll give you a cool stat. When we look at the Super Bowl, we had all but one of the eligible advertisers from the Super Bowl advertising on Twitter around the time of the Super Bowl. A couple of them were political advertisers. And you all know that we don't accept their ads. But to get all but one of the others to advertise on Twitter is something we're really proud of and demonstrates how important we are to them in amplifying their message."

If you want to learn more about the Super Bowl or about an event that's happening in your part of the world, we can show you a relevant ad based on the search that you run. We historically have done a great job of showing people ads in their home timeline and have had opportunity to do a better job for them in other parts of the app. And we came out with the Promoted Trends spotlight, which is a great example of a way that we can help people in other parts of the app late last year and early this year. And there are other ways that we'll continue to work to help advertisers reach their customers when they're in an event-specific timeline, when they're searching for things in other parts of the surface area of the app. The ad server work, a lot of it is foundational and things where you'll find that we'll be able to move faster, we'll be able to test things faster, we'll be able to learn and adapt more quickly because we won't need to work across all the different components of the ad server in order to do our work."

And we continue to see opportunity to improve upon both of those things as well as help people who want to build businesses around our APIs and other ways that we can grow revenue faster than audience. But they won't match up perfectly every quarter, as evidenced by the last couple of quarters where audience has grown in excess of revenue. Over time, we continue to believe that revenue can grow in excess of audience.

So we'll have near real-time highlights of the most important events. People will get to vote on the content that they want to see on the service, the highlights that they want to see. And we announced our partnership with NBC a year before the opening ceremonies, which gave us the time to go find the right partners for all this great content.

So these are -- our goal here is not just to focus on any 1 particular event, but to actually build scalable experiences that serve all events in an enduring way and a durable way. 
In terms of location, as I said in my opening, I spent all last year traveling. I visited every one of our offices around the world. We -- our execution throughout the year, as I was traveling and as the management team was traveling, continued its pace. I believe that we focused on our priorities in the same way that we would have otherwise. I believe we had really good frameworks to understand any issues that would come up. We had a good understanding of how to address anything that we saw and moved quickly on any opportunities that we saw as well. So I don't fear any slowness as we work to distribute our workforce more. And I do think that we have to build a company that's not dependent entirely upon San Francisco. We already have 2 members of our leadership team in New York, the rest -- the balance of that in San Francisco. I think as we look forward, we're reaching a talent pool that expects a lot more remote work, expects to work outside of California and outside of San Francisco, and we should be building our company around that. I haven't made any plans just yet for this year, but I do expect that I will travel. And I do think that we need to figure out how to build a company that is distributed, that is not burdened by time zones, but it is advantaged by them. And I think it'll give us a lot more perspective into markets that continue to emerge and are growing extremely quickly and to the point where even our peers are looking very, very deeply within those markets and within those continents. So I think we have a good framework. No major changes to speak of, but we have to constantly improve it."

Could you give us a sense of what those blockages are just so we understand how quickly they can get addressed? And does that also apply to ad products? Or was that specifically about the kind of the core timeline product of Twitter? 
And then just sort of a big picture for either you or Ned, you -- for a long time, I think both of you were sort of talking about being stuck in this 9% to 14% band for DAU growth or mDAU growth. Obviously, you've broken out of that the last couple of quarters, showing the sort of the product changes are working. But at 31 million U.S. DAU users, you're still tiny versus kind of the universe of available users. Is Twitter a product that you envisioned?

We still really haven't promoted them heavily within the service. So they're still a little bit hard to discover. The topic browser is an initial go at what we want to do. It's over in the side menu if you're in the app and you can browse topics, and we continue to add topics every single day. We're adding more languages as well. But when we get a lot more confidence around the experience we're providing, we'll make it much, much more discoverable in addition to the timeline prompts in the navigation itself. So right now, we're doing work to look at our navigation and really make sure that we're putting our best foot forward in terms of making that discoverable so that people can see it immediately. 
Onboarding is another opportunity obviously that we've been speaking to. And again, we want to make sure that the experience that people are going into is great before we put it in front of people who are just coming to the service or coming back to the service. So that -- those are the only blockers to that. But the early signals are quite positive, and I'm really, really excited about this feature. This has been a long time coming. It's something we have wanted to do for years, and we're finally at a point where we can bring it all together. So I do think this changes a lot. 
In terms of the issues to our development speed, a lot of this has to do with our infrastructure. We're still working through how -- what we build on. And certainly, that affects the consumer side, but also the ad product side. The revenue product team has moved very, very quickly to focus on the core ad infrastructure. And at the end of the day, per the previous question, what this means is as we look at the core infrastructure and we look at how people -- how our engineers are actually building it that the better that is, the more stable it is, the easier it is to develop, it just means that we can run more experiments faster. We can build products much faster. We can learn much faster. We can get feedback loops from our customers much faster. So everything improves. And the same is true on the consumer side. We have to look deeply at our tools. We have to look deeply at our development time and what's blocking us. We have a better understanding of what some of those things are and also just our understanding of the service, how we utilize the data that we're seeing to better inform our decisions around experiments that we run. So we're working really hard to make sure that we can move much faster so that we can experiment faster, we can learn faster and we can ship much faster. And this is something that has plagued us for years, but we've put it as our #1 priority as a company. And we have an incredible team. Some of whom have been here for years, some of whom we've just attracted to the company to help us address this. 
And to your last question, absolutely. I mean I think Twitter has value to everyone in the world. I think a big part of our work has been to help unlock that value for folks to help them understand why Twitter is valuable. A lot of people see tweets every single day. They see them on television, they see them in newspapers. We haven't given them enough reason yet to come to the app and utilize it themselves. But everything that we're doing from interest to relevance in the timeline to conversations is towards that goal. And ultimately, this will come down to what people experience when they first download the app or when they first open twitter.com. But we have the foundations in a really strong place where we can actually put a cohesive piece -- picture together for people. And that gets me really excited and confident that when people do hear of Twitter, they'll have more reason to download and use it."

But the best way for you to measure is going to be to look at that growth in monetizable daily active usage as if that number is growing, it means that we're delivering value on a daily basis to people around the topics and events that they care about most. So nothing to update on there. 
On the data licensing and other side, remember, there's 2 pieces to that revenue line. The first is the data and enterprise solutions opportunity where we feel really good about our execution. And as we mentioned a year ago, we said that we had executed so well on our strategy in bringing people to the right type of contract over the right term that we expected the growth rate to moderate. That proved to be the case, but we also continued to both renew our existing customers and find other new customers who we could help create a business or further build their business around our APIs. And there's lots more opportunity for us there. We made our APIs premium, and we're still seeing lots of opportunity in front of us around the data business. The second piece is MoPub, which is our mobile ad exchange. And we've got work to do there, and that's holding the growth rate down a bit. But we think we've got a good path forward. And one of the ways that MoPub will benefit is as we continue our work around more direct response-oriented ad formats, starting with MAP, that should benefit MoPub as well. Thank you."

And that's helped us a ton. Whether I think about the conversations we have with advertisers at the Consumer Electronics Show or at other points during the year, the sentiment remains strong, and they have embraced our objectives. When we tell them that we're the place to launch something new or to connect with what's happening, that really resonates. When we share our thinking that we've got the most valuable audience when they're most receptive, that really resonates with them as well. And so we feel good about advertiser sentiment and the way that our DAU growth is contributing to that. 
When we look at cohorts of people who are new to Twitter, we continue to be pleased with what we see in terms of their engagement and how they use the service. We also know that there's lots that we can do better for them. We're doing a better job of surfacing content for them, accounts they should follow, topics they should follow. But we know there's even more that we can do there to help them, but nothing new to report in terms of the cohorts and how they're behaving."

The same is true around our revenue products. We're rebuilding the ad server. We're coming out with a new version of MAP and leading to more direct response. Advertising formats for us over time will allow us to innovate faster and move faster, experiment faster. So we certainly think about leading with R&D when we think about the revenue products. 
On the Olympics, so as important as it is for us when we step back and think about the larger opportunity for us to have more direct-response-related offerings, starting with MAP, when we think about a quadrennial event like the Olympics, and a lot of the advertising that you see are on these, we feel like we're really well positioned with our existing ad formats. That isn't to say that we're not focused on launching the new version of MAP when -- as soon as we can, but it also means that the pre-roll that you often see around highlights, the connecting with what's happening that you just saw around the Super Bowl that you'll see around the Olympics in the summer are things that we feel like we're really well positioned to address with our existing ad formats.

I want to start by thanking all the folks around the world who are currently on the front lines in our battle against COVID-19. We would not be able to do our work without the incredible sacrifices you're making to do yours. To everyone who's treating us, feeling us, feeding us, carrying for us and building for us, we see you, and we appreciate you. Thank you. We're here to serve the public conversation because we believe it helps the world learn faster, solve common problems and shows us that we're all in this together. COVID-19 has proven this. For the first time in history, the entire world is focused on learning how to solve one global problem. People are turning to Twitter to stay informed, to share solutions and to ask for help and support one another. And we see it in the numbers. 
Average mDAU grew 24% year-over-year, which brings us to a total of 166 million, our highest reported growth rate to date. Our consistent focus on increasing relevance and making conversation more accessible and powerful continues to be right. The real power of Twitter is unlocked though through list and interest, however, and we remain confident in our work here will enable entirely new forms of participation for people all over the world. 
There has been a rapid and significant decrease in global advertising spend due to COVID-19, which is also reflected in our numbers. Total revenue was $808 million in Q1, up 3% year-over-year. As we've talked about on these calls before, our goal is to increase our revenue durability by building a world-class performance ads product, starting with MAP. In light of the environment and the increasing importance of our revenue product work, we've now made this our #1 priority, so we can deliver the product as quickly as possible and accelerate our direct response around them. Development on velocity and agility continues to be a focus for our engineering team with a goal of doubling the rate at which we're able to ship features to our customers. COVID-19 also accelerated our efforts to decentralize our workforce as we've all been working from home since the 1st week of March. We've seen no significant decrease in productivity, which gives us a lot of optionality for the future. 
I've never been more sure the value Twitter brings to people around the world. Folks trust us every day to carry some of the most important questions, ideas, commentary and critiques in the world. We acknowledge and appreciate our role in making this incredibly powerful service accessible and directly valuable to everyone. There's nothing else like it. Thank you. And now over to Ned."

Before we get into Q&A, I want to highlight a few things, which are in the letter, but mentioning at the outset of the call.

Before we get into Q&A, I want to highlight a few things, which are in the letter, but mentioning at the outset of the call. We had a strong start to the quarter that was impacted by widespread economic disruption related to COVID-19 in March, leading to a significant decrease in global advertising spend. As we noted in the letter, ad revenue from March 11 to March 31 declined approximately 27% year-over-year. Jack mentioned our increased focus on DR. An improved MAP product and more direct response ad formats would increase our addressable market with more exposure to advertising demand that may be more resilient through an economic downturn, while building on our strengths and helping brands launch something new and connect with what's happening. 
I'm also pleased to share that our ad server rebuild should be complete by the end of Q2. We've moved quickly to consider our expenses and slow our hiring rate. We're continuing to grow our engineering, product design, research and trust and safety teams, while largely holding headcount at current levels and other functions as we continue to monitor the broader environment and our own operations. Lower headcount growth, decisions we've made to reduce nonlabor costs and savings from business activities such as travel and customer events that have been significantly curtailed, combined with future decisions we make as this very dynamic environment continues to unfold, are expected to result in full year 2020 total expense growth that will be considerably less than the 20% we expected at the beginning of the year. We currently expect Q2 expenses to be meaningfully below the year-over-year growth we observed in Q1, likely closer to a year-over-year percentage growth rate in the low teens. 
As people turn to brands, institutions and leaders for answers, we've also seen brands turn to Twitter as they've adapted their advertising to respect the current environment. We've seen brands like Verizon and Salesforce leverage our live brand studio to raise awareness about their live streaming events, while Hyundai utilized video website cards to drive awareness for their job loss protection program that offers deferred payments for new or current owners. We supported Xiaomi through our arthouse team and content creators to launch the MI 10 phone series with the entire marketing execution done remotely and broadcast through live stream on Twitter. Coupled with our record mDAU growth, these handful of examples demonstrate why we're so passionate about continuing to invest in our most impactful work. We remain confident in the significant long-term growth opportunity for Twitter. 
With that, we're ready to take your questions. Operator?"

So I'd just point you back to that March 11 to March 31 time frame. 
I should point out within that, that the U.S. was impacted a bit more. And that other parts of the world, especially places in Asia, where things had been impacted earlier by COVID-19 that they were less bad than they had been earlier in the quarter when you look at the March time frame. 
The second part of your question was around MAP and DR. There are no changes to our thinking there, where we'll work hard to accelerate our long-term road map. As Jack mentioned, making revenue product, our #1 priority. Our MAP work will continue throughout this year. We actually have recently launched a pilot, where we have new parts of new MAP in the hands of advertisers where they can work on launching a campaign with new formats, and we'll get some good feedback from that. And we hope that we can build upon that over the course of this year. Remember, we've said that the impact from our MAP work ought to be felt gradually over time as we test and roll things out and then we see MAP advertisers models adjust. Remember, this is a multi tens of billions of dollar market to advertise mobile games, video services, food delivery services and other things. And we believe that those models will be able to adjust quickly once we're able to roll out a product to people that is more performant than the one that we've got today.

To me, this is like the biggest unlock for what makes someone really see the potential of Twitter. It just hasn't been that accessible in the past to people. People have had to find and follow all the accounts related to a particular topic or an interest. We should be doing that work for them. This also gives us much, much stronger signal to our revenue products into our business. So a lot of the work that we're doing right now on that is to make list a whole lot more powerful and to make following topics a lot easier. And as we perfect that experience and we make a great experience for people to go into, it's an obvious candidate to put right at onboarding so that you may come in to learn about what's happening with COVID-19, but you also see all the interest based on the signals we have about you, whether it be where you are or tweets that you like or engage with. So you can follow those topics directly. We can then suggest tweets and accounts for you. So our strategy remains true.

Remember the impact ought to be felt gradually as we've said on this call and over time. 
But let me just step back more broadly and remind you of a few things about direct response. The first is this is an important area for us already today, whether it's through website, clicks or app download, ads. This is something that's been important to us for a long time and somewhere where we've done a good job with video website cards and video app cards in the past. But we know we can do better for advertisers, not just with app installs, but moving all the way down the funnel over time. And so that road map is something that we'll work hard to accelerate here to make sure that we can to help advertisers launch new products and services and connect with what's happening, not just from a brand and awareness perspective, but all the way down the advertising funnel. 
Remember, we've said in the past that there's an awful lot of signal that we have today from how people use the service. And Jack mentioned some of the time line-related or tweets-related benefits to that just now, but it also really helps on the advertising side. And we think that personalization continues to be more of an opportunity for us than a risk as we look ahead and think about how we can serve more direct response as to people over time."

First, let me start where you ended there, although a lot of people are coming to Twitter around COVID-19 to learn more, and we're working hard to point them to trusted sources, be it the CDC or the relevant agency in their part of the world to verify trusted sources to make sure that we're removing this information as quickly as we can. There's so much more happening on Twitter right now, whether it's the conversation around the last dance and allowing people to feel like they're in the room with their friends and the colleagues who they can't be in the room with today, the NFL draft or other things in other parts of the world that bring people together where they're looking for that connection and conversation. And so there's a ton of other stuff happening on Twitter, and we continue to see advertisers want to launch new products and services, whether it's that [ dummy ] example I gave earlier or tablets that have been launched and new video services that had been launched recently or connecting with what's happening, whether it's a global concert that brings everybody to their sofa to watch, and Pepsi is advertising around it, or advertisers who we have helped pivot their campaigns, where before, Intuit may have been advertising QuickBooks, but now they're advertising their Go Fund Me to help small businesses. Helping advertisers pivot has been a big part of the work of our commercial team, and we're so proud of all the efforts that they've done on video to quickly adapt and help their customers. 
When we look ahead to events that have been postponed or canceled, things that will happen down the road, it's hard to really parse out from those things how things will play out, both because of the broader economic environment and because there's a lot that has to happen between now and then. But the work that we're doing to continue to help this increased audience and the people who will be new to Twitter in the future, the work that we're doing to improve our ad formats can only help us more down the road with these events that come up, whether it's the Olympics next year or some of the other things that will come back in the fall of this year."

So when we think about pulling forward, that's not really a term that we consider. 
Having said that, if we look at the way the March quarter played out, we did have DAU strength in January and February tied to the typical seasonality that we see and the ongoing product improvements that we've delivered. And then there really was a surge in March as people flocked to the service to learn more about COVID-19 as their behavior has changed and they came to Twitter to learn more about what was happening in the world and what people were talking about. That did level off towards the end of March. And so we think about the opportunity today is continuing to add people who are new to Twitter, and help them make the service part of their daily lives and to continue to help those people who have recently found us or haven't used the services frequently in the past and help them make Twitter a part of their daily lives. We still see lots of opportunity in both of those buckets."

And really what it comes down to is our focus on public conversation. And what has blocked us in the past is people just understanding the power of the service, and the power of the services is really incredible. 
One of the things that we've identified as lacking is this work that I mentioned earlier that people have to do to find and follow all the accounts that are related to their particular interest. So that's why interesting topics are such a high priority for us. 
We also see the power of Twitter really being the conversation, being able to follow conversations, find conversations, but also participate in them. And in the past, they were just far too an accessible far too buried and not something that I could easily grasp and get into. So a lot of our work recently to make conversations more organized much more intuitive is really paying off. 
And finally, there's a lot of work around making sure people feel comfortable in expressing themselves in Twitter. And here, I would point you to tweets. This is an opportunity for people to share something that disappears in 24 hours. There's no likes, there's no retweets. There's no replies. And what -- the reason we built this is because it helps people who don't necessarily have something to say to the world, but do have something to say to a group of friends or followers and don't necessarily want that content, that tweet to be run forever. They're just off the moment thoughts and something that they want to express, but it should disappear. So we launched this in Brazil. We're seeing incredible feedback, both in terms of usage and also people telling us how much they like it. And we hope to roll that out as quickly as possible all around the world."

Advertisers want a performant product that's easy to use, where they can launch a campaign quickly and where they can have clear attribution for where success comes from and what they ought to pay for it. And so we really feel like a lot of the work is on our end. As we roll out that work through testing and adapting and improving it, we believe that the models that the advertisers use to buy app install ads ought to adapt on their own as we've seen them in both directions in our business over time. That can play out favorably and it can hurt you when you're not performing. So we feel like a lot of this is in our control in a multi tens of billions of dollar growing market for app install ads. 
Your second part of your question was around some of the issues that we've talked about in the past around our revenue products. Let me remind you on the ad server work that we began talking about in 2019, that work ought to be completed in Q2. We were pleased that the record Super Bowl traffic actually ran in many ways on the new ad server technology. And that will allow us to move faster. We'll have a more modular architecture that allows more people to work on the ad server at a time. And so we're really pleased and excited about the progress there and what that will allow us to do over time. When we think about how people use Twitter, we feel like there are tremendous direct response opportunities beyond the ones that we benefit from today, whether it's website clicks or app downloads. And it's up to us right now to do the work to come up with these great formats and to leverage the signal that we already have from how people use a service to help them find even more compelling ads than we do today."

So first, when we look at what we saw from March 11 to the 31st, which I think is the best time frame to look at if you want to think about what has been like for us to navigate this very dynamic and unprecedented environment, I think you'd see a few things at play, which remind you about some of the real strengths of our business. The first is we are a big beneficiary of events, both our customers' events when they're launching a new product or service and events that bring people to the service to learn about them and to be involved in a public conversation around them. And so I think we were impacted by both of those kinds of events being delayed or canceled in some cases. 
Secondly, if you look at the geographies, the U.S. was impacted more in that time frame than Asia. As an example, Asia saw more impact earlier in the quarter. And as things in the economies there began to come back a little bit, we did see some impact on -- from that in that March 11 to March 31 time frame. 
When we look at the verticals that advertise on Twitter most, remember, a lot of these are consumer packaged goods, tech and telco, media, financial services companies who have large consumer businesses and we're being out in front of their customers at the times that are important to them is really impactful. So we tend to have less advertising from things like travel or considered purchases than some others may. And as we work hard to improve our direct response offerings, we think that will help us even more with the group of advertisers as in a more constrained economic environment. They really want to be able to measure everything they're doing, assign attribution to it. These better ad formats that are further down the funnel, we think will better position us to help them with that. 
Your second question, sorry, OpEx for the year. So when we think about the decisions that we've made already, we feel really good about how we've adapted to this environment. We've reduced our headcount growth from what we had expected previously, continuing to focus on engineering, product design, research and trust and safety. And there are a lot of other areas of the company where we will hold headcount relatively flat. Although we've cut some of the nonlabor spend growth, things like travel and events that just can't happen in this environment and then other things that are real decisions that we've made to prioritize and make sure that every dollar is most appropriately spent in a more constrained environment. 
When you ask what's temporary versus structural as we look out for the year, it's hard right now to really, in such a dynamic environment, assess exactly how things will play out over the rest of the year. We want to continue to be nimble and adapt to the environment while staying very respectful of the long-term opportunity that we see to continue to improve the product to bring even more people to the service and to continue to improve our revenue products to help more advertisers. So as we balance those, we'll just have to talk more about it over the course of the year."

First, I think it's too early for us to predict what happens in terms of audience growth over the course of this year. Remember, the product improvements that Jack talked about earlier in the call really are designed to help us grow the base of people who use the service through any time frame, whether it's one like what we went through in March as people flock to the service to learn more about COVID-19 or in any other environment. So I wouldn't want to predict how that plays out from an events perspective, either because it's hard to predict when the events will happen and it's hard to predict how people behave around them, but we'll just keep improving the service so that we can help as many of them as possible. 
On the DR side, these are such big advertising markets. If you think about DR as the largest piece of the digital ads market that is faster-growing than the brand side, there are so many dollars at play that we tend to think a lot less about competing with specific platforms and a lot more about the reasons that advertisers use Twitter. They come to launch a new product or service, whether it's ridesharing in a different environment or food delivery in this one. And they come to connect with what's happening, whether that's something like the last stand, which brings people to Twitter even in a shelter in place environment or other events that can happen in the environment like the one we find ourselves in today. 
So we feel like there's still a tremendous opportunity for us to do more for advertisers with more performant, easier-to-launch ad formats and campaigns on the service."

Because the letter has a lot of details, like last quarter, we'll keep our opening remarks brief and then dive right into your questions. We also take questions asked on Twitter, so please tweet us at @TwitterIR using the #TWTR.  
Also during this call, we will make forward-looking statements. Those are things like our operational plans and strategies, our expectations regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and our expectations regarding future expenses and the timing of those expenses. Our actual results could differ materially from those contemplated by our forward-looking statements for a number of reasons, including risks related to the impact of COVID-19 on market conditions and on our business. And you should not consider our reported results as an indication of future performance. We are making these forward-looking statements based on information available to us as of today, and we disclaim any duty to update them later unless required by law. 
Please take a look at our filings with the SEC, especially in the Risk Factors section in our 10-Q for the first quarter of 2020, which will be subsequently filed, and in our most recent 10-K, for a discussion of the factors that could cause our results to differ.  
Also during this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. We have reconciled those to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in our shareholder letter. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for our GAAP results.

I want to start by thanking all the folks around the world who are currently on the front lines in our battle against COVID-19. We would not be able to do our work without the incredible sacrifices you're making to do yours. To everyone who's treating us, feeling us, feeding us, caring for us and building for us, we see you and we appreciate you. Thank you. 
We're here to serve the public conversation because we believe it helps the world learn faster, solve common problems and shows us that we're all in this together. COVID-19 has proven this. For the first time in history, the entire world is focused on learning how to solve one global problem. People are turning to Twitter to stay informed, to share solutions and to ask for help and support one another. And we see it in the numbers.  
Average mDAU grew 24% year-over-year, which brings us to a total of 166 million, our highest reported growth rate to date. Our consistent focus on increasing relevance and making conversation more accessible and powerful continues to be right. The real power of Twitter is unlocked, though, through lists and interests, however, and we remain confident in our work here will enable entirely new forms of participation for people all over the world.  
There has been a rapid and significant decrease in global advertising spend due to COVID-19, which is also reflected in our numbers. Total revenue was $808 million in Q1, up 3% year-over-year. As we've talked about on these calls before, our goal is to increase our revenue durability by building a world-class performance ads product, starting with MAP. In light of the environment and the increasing importance of our revenue product work, we've now made this our #1 priority so we can deliver the product as quickly as possible and accelerate our direct response around that. Development velocity and agility continues to be a focus for our Engineering team with a goal of doubling the rate at which we're able to ship features to our customers. COVID-19 also accelerated our efforts to decentralize our workforce as we've all been working from home since the 1st week of March. We've seen no significant decrease in productivity, which gives us a lot of optionality for the future.  
I've never been more sure of the value Twitter brings to people around the world. Folks trust us every day to carry some of the most important questions, ideas, commentary and critiques in the world. We acknowledge and appreciate our role in making this incredibly powerful service accessible and directly valuable to everyone. There's nothing else like it. Thank you. And now over to Ned."

Before we get into Q&A, I want to highlight a few things which are in the letter but merit mentioning at the outset of the call. 
We had a strong start to the quarter that was impacted by widespread economic disruption related to COVID-19 in March, leading to a significant decrease in global advertising spend. As we noted in the letter, ad revenue from March 11 to March 31 declined approximately 27% year-over-year. 
Jack mentioned our increased focus on DR. An improved MAP product and more direct response ad formats would increase our addressable market with more exposure to advertising demand that may be more resilient through an economic downturn while building on our strengths and helping brands launch something new and connect with what's happening.  
I'm also pleased to share that our ad server rebuild should be complete by the end of Q2. 
We've moved quickly to consider our expenses and slow our hiring ramp. We're continuing to grow our Engineering, Product, Design, Research and Trust & Safety teams while largely holding headcount at current levels and other functions as we continue to monitor the broader environment and our own operations. Lower headcount growth, decisions we've made to reduce nonlabor costs and savings from business activities such as travel and customer events that have been significantly curtailed, combined with future decisions we make as this very dynamic environment continues to unfold, are expected to result in full year 2020 total expense growth that will be considerably less than the 20% we expected at the beginning of the year. We currently expect Q2 expenses to be meaningfully below the year-over-year growth we observed in Q1, likely closer to a year-over-year percentage growth rate in the low teens.  
As people turn to brands, institutions and leaders for answers, we've also seen brands turn to Twitter as they've adapted their advertising to respect the current environment. We've seen brands like Verizon and Salesforce leverage our Live Brand Studio to raise awareness about their live streaming events, while Hyundai utilized Video Website Cards to drive awareness for their job loss protection program that offers deferred payments for new or current owners. We supported Xiaomi through our ArtHouse team and content creators to launch the Mi 10 phone series with the entire marketing execution done remotely and broadcast through live stream on Twitter. Coupled with our record mDAU growth, these handful of examples demonstrate why we're so passionate about continuing to invest in our most impactful work. We remain confident in the significant long-term growth opportunity for Twitter.  
With that, we're ready to take your questions. Operator?"

First, when we think about what it's been like to navigate through this unprecedented time, I think the best time frame to point you to would be that March 11 to March 31 time frame. That gives you a good sense for what it's been like for us. And I'd just also point out, in such a dynamic environment, for you or us to try to discern trends based on the tremendous change in advertiser behavior as the economy continues to evolve may not be prudent. So I'd just point you back to that March 11 to March 31 time frame.  
I should point out within that, that the U.S. was impacted a bit more and that other parts of the world, especially places in Asia where things had been impacted earlier by COVID-19, that they were less bad than they had been earlier in the quarter when you look at the March time frame.  
The second part of your question was around MAP and DR. There are no changes to our thinking there, where we'll work hard to accelerate our long-term road map, as Jack mentioned, making revenue product our number one priority. So our MAP work will continue throughout this year. We actually have recently launched a pilot where we have new -- parts of new MAP in the hands of advertisers, where they can work on launching a campaign with new formats. And we'll get some good feedback from that, and we hope that we can build upon that over the course of this year. Remember, we've said that the impact from our MAP work ought to be felt gradually over time as we test and roll things out and then we see MAP advertisers' models adjust. Remember, this is a multi tens of billions of dollar market to advertise mobile games, video services, food delivery services and other things, and we believe that those models will be able to adjust quickly once we're able to roll out a product to people that has more performance than the one that we've got today.

So as I said in my opening remarks, the -- our focus on relevance and our focus on making conversation much more accessible and more powerful continues to pay off. So the relevance work that we're doing within the time line has been critical, and we're making really great strides in making that a whole lot more powerful, a whole lot more relevant as people come back to the service. And I think the biggest thing that will shift us from people who come to Twitter because they want to know what's happening and stay informed around COVID-19 is our work on interests, Topics and Lists in particular. To me, this is like the biggest unlock for what makes someone really see the potential of Twitter. It just hasn't been that accessible in the past to people. People have had to find and follow all the accounts related to a particular topic or an interest. We should be doing that work for them. This also gives us much, much stronger signal to our revenue products and to our business. So a lot of the work that we're doing right now on that is to make Lists a whole lot more powerful and to make following topics a lot easier. And as we perfect that experience and we make a great experience for people to go into, it's an obvious candidate to put right at onboarding so that you may come in to learn about what's happening with COVID-19, but you also see all the interests based on the signals we have about you, whether it be where you are or tweets that you like or engage with, so you can follow those topics directly that we can then suggest tweets and accounts for you. 
So our strategy remains true. And we're looking at everything that's going on in the service today, looking for any signs of new, emerging patterns, but they all come back to these interests and topics that we think are really durable and also really important to complete."

And so we'll keep you updated as it unfolds. Remember the impact ought to be felt gradually, as we've said on this call, and over time.  
But let me just step back more broadly and remind you of a few things about direct response. The first is this is an important area for us already today, whether it's through website, clicks or app download, ads. This is something that's been important to us for a long time and something where we've done a good job with Video Website Cards and Video App Cards in the past. But we know we can do better for advertisers not just with app installs but moving all the way down the funnel over time. And so that road map is something that we'll work hard to accelerate here to make sure that we can help advertisers launch new products and services and connect with what's happening not just from a brand and awareness perspective but all the way down the advertising funnel.  
Remember, we've said in the past that there's an awful lot of signal that we have today from how people use the service, and Jack mentioned some of the time line-related or tweets-related benefits to that just now. But it also really helps on the advertising side, and we think that personalization continues to be more of an opportunity for us than a risk as we look ahead and think about how we can serve more direct response ads to people over time."

And the flip side of that is as sports start happening this fall, do you expect brand advertising on Twitter to pick up in tandem with that? And how are you kind of retooling the sales process to adapt to this current environment if most of the conversation on Twitter is around COVID-19, which makes sense right now? Is there a way to kind of tweak the ad sales approach to take advantage of the situation from like a messaging standpoint or anything like that?"

Thanks, Ross. First, let me start where you ended there. Although a lot of people are coming to Twitter around COVID-19 to learn more, and we're working hard to point them to trusted sources, be it the CDC or the relevant agency in their part of the world, to verify trusted sources to make sure that we're removing misinformation as quickly as we can, there's so much more happening on Twitter right now, whether it's the conversation around The Last Dance and allowing people to feel like they're in the room with their friends and the colleagues who they can't be in the room with today, the NFL draft or other things in other parts of the world that bring people together where they're looking for that connection and conversation. And so there's a ton of other stuff happening on Twitter. 
And we continue to see advertisers want to launch new products and services, whether it's that dummy example I gave earlier or tablets that have been launched and new video services that have been launched recently, or connecting with what's happening, whether it's a global concert that brings everybody to their sofa to watch and Pepsi is advertising around it or advertisers who we have helped pivot their campaigns, where before Intuit may have been advertising QuickBooks but now they're advertising their GoFundMe to help small businesses. Helping advertisers pivot has been a big part of the work of our commercial team, and we're so proud of all the efforts that they've done on video to quickly adapt and help their customers.  
When we look ahead to events that have been postponed or canceled, things that will happen down the road, it's hard to really parse out from those things how things will play out both because of the broader economic environment and because there's a lot that has to happen between now and then. But the work that we're doing to continue to help this increased audience and the people who'll be new to Twitter in the future, the work that we're doing to improve our ad formats can only help us more down the road with these events that come up, whether it's the Olympics next year or some of the other things that'll come back in the fall of this year."

All those things go into the soup of improving MAP and helping us roll out a better product over time, and we're excited to learn more from the pilot we've got going on now and to keep you updated as we go."

So when we think about pulling forward, that's not really a term that we consider. 
Having said that, if we look at the way the March quarter played out, we did have DAU strength in January and February tied to the typical seasonality that we see and the ongoing product improvements that we've delivered. And then there really was a surge in March as people flocked to the service to learn more about COVID-19 as their behaviors changed and they came to Twitter to learn more about what was happening in the world and what people were talking about. That did level off towards the end of March. And so we think about -- the opportunity today is continuing to add people who are new to Twitter and help them make the service part of their daily lives and to continue to help those people who have recently found us or haven't used the service as frequently in the past and help them make Twitter a part of their daily lives. We still see lots of opportunity in both of those buckets."

And really, what it comes down to is our focus on public conversation. And what has blocked us in the past is people just understanding the power of the service, and the power of the service is really incredible.  
One of the things that we've identified as lacking is this work that I mentioned earlier that people have to do to find and follow all the accounts that are related to their particular interest. So that's why interests and Topics are such a high priority for us.  
We also see the power of Twitter really being the conversation, being able to follow conversations, find conversations but also participate in them. And in the past, they were just far too inaccessible, far too buried and not something that I could easily grasp and get into. So a lot of our work recently to make conversations more organized much more intuitive is really paying off.  
And finally, there's a lot of work around making sure people feel comfortable in expressing themselves in Twitter. And here, I would point you to tweets. This is an opportunity for people to share something that disappears in 24 hours. There's no likes, there's no retweets. There's no replies. And what -- the reason we built this is because it helps people who don't necessarily have something to say to the world but do have something to say to a group of friends or followers and don't necessarily want that content, that tweet to be around forever. They're just off-the-moment thoughts and something that they want to express but that should disappear. So we launched this in Brazil. We're seeing incredible feedback, both in terms of usage and also people telling us how much they like it, and we hope to roll that out as quickly as possible all around the world."

First, on where the work sits around MAP. We really feel like the bulk of the work is on our end. Advertisers want a performance product that's easy to use, where they can launch a campaign quickly and where they can have clear attribution for where success comes from and what they ought to pay for it. And so we really feel like a lot of the work is on our end. 
As we roll out that work through testing and adapting and improving it, we believe that the models that the advertisers use to buy app install ads ought to adapt on their own as we've seen them in both directions in our business over time. That can play out favorably and it can hurt you when you're not performing. So we feel like a lot of this is in our control in a multi tens of billions of dollar growing market for app install ads.  
Your second part of your question was around some of the issues that we've talked about in the past around our revenue products. Let me remind you on the ad server work that we began talking about in 2019, that work ought to be completed in Q2. But we were pleased that the record Super Bowl traffic actually ran in many ways on the new ad server technology, and that will allow us to move faster. We'll have a more modular architecture that allows more people to work on the ad server at a time. And so we're really pleased and excited about the progress there and what that will allow us to do over time. 
When we think about how people use Twitter, we feel like there are tremendous direct response opportunities beyond the ones that we benefit from today, whether it's website clicks or app downloads. And it's up to us right now to do the work to come up with these great formats and to leverage the signal that we already have from how people use a service to help them find even more compelling ads than we do today."

So first, when we look at what we saw from March 11 to the 31st, which I think is the best time frame to look at if you want to think about what it has been like for us to navigate this very dynamic and unprecedented environment, I think you'd see a few things at play which remind you about some of the real strengths of our business. The first is we are a big beneficiary of events, both our customers' events when they're launching a new product or service and events that bring people to the service to learn about them and to be involved in a public conversation around them. And so I think we were impacted by both of those kinds of events being delayed or canceled in some cases.  
Secondly, if you look at the geographies, the U.S. was impacted more in that time frame than Asia. As an example, Asia saw more impact earlier in the quarter. And as things in the economies there began to come back a little bit, we did see some impact on -- from that in the March 11 to March 31 time frame.  
When we look at the verticals that advertise on Twitter most, remember, a lot of these are consumer packaged goods, tech and telco, media, financial services, companies who have large consumer businesses and where being out in front of their customers at the times that are important to them is really impactful. So we tend to have less advertising from things like travel or considered purchases than some others may. And as we work hard to improve our direct response offerings, we think that will help us even more with this group of advertisers. As in a more constrained economic environment, they really want to be able to measure everything they're doing, assign attribution to it. These better ad formats that are further down the funnel, we think, will better position us to help them with that.  
Oh, your second question, sorry, OpEx for the year. So when we think about the decisions that we've made already, we feel really good about how we've adapted to this environment. We've reduced our headcount growth from what we had expected previously, continuing to focus on Engineering, Product, Design, Research and Trust & Safety. And there are a lot of other areas of the company where we will hold headcount relatively flat. Also, we've cut some of the nonlabor spend growth, things like travel and events that just can't happen in this environment, and then other things that are real decisions that we've made to prioritize and make sure that every dollar is most appropriately spent in a more constrained environment.  
When you ask what's temporary versus structural as we look out through the year, it's hard right now to really, in such a dynamic environment, assess exactly how things will play out over the rest of the year. We want to continue to be nimble and adapt to the environment while staying very insightful of the long-term opportunity that we see to continue to improve the product, to bring even more people to the service and to continue to improve our revenue products to help more advertisers. So as we balance those, we'll just have to talk more about it over the course of the year."

Remember, the product improvements that Jack talked about earlier in the call really are designed to help us grow the base of people who use the service through any time frame, whether it's one like what we went through in March as people flocked to the service to learn more about COVID-19 or in any other environment. So I wouldn't want to predict, though, how that plays out from an events perspective either because it's hard to predict when the events will happen and it's hard to predict how people behave around them. But we'll just keep improving the service so that we can help as many of them as possible.  
On the DR side, these are such big advertising markets. If you think about DR as the largest piece of the digital ads market that is faster growing than the brand side, there are so many dollars at play that we tend to think a lot less about competing with specific platforms and a lot more about the reasons that advertisers use Twitter. They come to launch a new product or service, whether it's ridesharing in a different environment or food delivery in this one. And they come to connect with what's happening, whether that's something like The Last Dance, which brings people to Twitter even in a shelter-in-place environment, or other events that can't happen in the environment like the one we find ourselves in today.

So that work remains the most important, and we are moving very, very fast on it."

Before they start, I just wanted to remind everyone of the format of our call. We published a shareholder letter on our Investor Relations website and with the SEC about an hour ago and hope everyone had a chance to read it. Because the letter has a lot of details, like last quarter, we'll keep our opening remarks brief and then dive right into your questions. We also take questions asked on Twitter, so please tweet us at @TwitterIR using the #TWTR.  
Also during this call, we will make forward-looking statements. Those are things like our operational plans and strategies, our expectations regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and our expectations regarding future expenses and the timing of those expenses. Our actual results could differ materially from those contemplated by our forward-looking statements for a number of reasons, including risks related to the impact of COVID-19 on market conditions and on our business. And you should not consider our reported results as an indication of future performance. 
We are making these forward-looking statements based on information available to us as of today, and we disclaim any duty to update them later unless required by law. Please take a look at our filings with the SEC, especially in the Risk Factors section in our 10-Q for the first quarter of 2020, which will be subsequently filed, and in our most recent 10-K for a discussion of the factors that could cause our results to differ.  
Also during this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. We have reconciled those to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in our shareholder letter. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for our GAAP results. And finally, this call in its entirety is being webcast from our Investor Relations website, and an audio replay will be available on Twitter and on our website in a few hours.

I want to start by thanking all the folks around the world who are currently on the front lines in our battle against COVID-19. We would not be able to do our work without the incredible sacrifices you're making to do yours. To everyone who's treating us, filling us, feeding us, caring for us and building for us, we see you and we appreciate you. Thank you. 
We're here to serve the public conversation because we believe it helps the world learn faster, solve common problems and shows us that we're all in this together. COVID-19 has proven this. For the first time in history, the entire world is focused on learning how to solve one global problem. People are turning to Twitter to stay informed, to share solutions and to ask for help and support one another. And we see it in the numbers.  
Average mDAU grew 24% year-over-year, which brings us to a total of 166 million, our highest reported growth rate to date. Our consistent focus on increasing relevance and making conversation more accessible and powerful continues to be right. The real power of Twitter is unlocked, though, through lists and interests, however, and we remain confident our work here will enable entirely new forms of participation for people all over the world.  
There has been a rapid and significant decrease in global advertising spend due to COVID-19, which is also reflected in our numbers. Total revenue was $808 million in Q1, up 3% year-over-year. As we've talked about on these calls before, our goal is to increase our revenue durability by building a world-class performance ads product, starting with MAP. In light of the environment and the increasing importance of our revenue product work, we've now made this our #1 priority so we can deliver the product as quickly as possible and accelerate our direct response road map. Development velocity and agility continues to be a focus for our Engineering team with a goal of doubling the rate at which we're able to ship features to our customers. 
COVID-19 also accelerated our efforts to decentralize our workforce as we've all been working from home since the 1st week of March. We've seen no significant decrease in productivity, which gives us a lot of optionality for the future.  
I've never been more sure of the value Twitter brings to people around the world. Folks trust us every day to carry some of the most important questions, ideas, commentary and critiques in the world. We acknowledge and appreciate our role in making this incredibly powerful service accessible and directly valuable to everyone. There's nothing else like it. 
Thank you. And now over to Ned."

Before we get into Q&A, I want to highlight a few things which are in the letter but merit mentioning at the outset of the call. 
We had a strong start to the quarter that was impacted by widespread economic disruption related to COVID-19 in March, leading to a significant decrease in global advertising spend. As we noted in the letter, ad revenue from March 11 to March 31 declined approximately 27% year-over-year. 
Jack mentioned our increased focus on DR. An improved MAP product and more direct response ad formats would increase our addressable market with more exposure to advertising demand that may be more resilient through an economic downturn while building on our strengths and helping brands launch something new and connect with what's happening.  
I'm also pleased to share that our ad server rebuild should be complete by the end of Q2. 
We've moved quickly to consider our expenses and slow our hiring ramp. We're continuing to grow our Engineering, Product, Design, Research and Trust & Safety teams while largely holding headcount at current levels on other functions as we continue to monitor the broader environment and our own operations. Lower headcount growth, decisions we've made to reduce nonlabor costs and savings from business activities such as travel and customer events that have been significantly curtailed, combined with future decisions we make as this very dynamic environment continues to unfold, are expected to result in full year 2020 total expense growth that will be considerably less than the 20% we expected at the beginning of the year. We currently expect Q2 expenses to be meaningfully below the year-over-year growth we observed in Q1, likely closer to a year-over-year percentage growth rate in the low teens.  
As people turn to brands, institutions and leaders for answers, we've also seen brands turn to Twitter as they've adapted their advertising to respect the current environment. We've seen brands like Verizon and Salesforce leverage our Live Brand Studio to raise awareness about their live streaming events, while Hyundai utilized Video Website Cards to drive awareness for their job loss protection program that offers deferred payments for new or current owners. We supported Xiaomi through our ArtHouse team and content creators to launch the Mi 10 phone series with the entire marketing execution done remotely and broadcast through live stream on Twitter. Coupled with our record mDAU growth, these handful of examples demonstrate why we're so passionate about continuing to invest in our most impactful work. We remain confident in the significant long-term growth opportunity for Twitter.  
With that, we're ready to take your questions. Operator?"

First, when we think about what it's been like to navigate through this unprecedented time, I think the best time frame to point you to would be that March 11 to March 31 time frame. That gives you a good sense for what it's been like for us. And I'd just also point out, in such a dynamic environment, for you or us to try to discern trends based on the tremendous change in advertiser behavior as the economy continues to evolve may not be prudent. 
So I'd just point you back to that March 11 to March 31 time frame. I should point out within that, that the U.S. was impacted a bit more and that other parts of the world, especially places in Asia where things had been impacted earlier by COVID-19, that they were less bad than they had been earlier in the quarter when you look at the March time frame.  
The second part of your question was around MAP and DR. There are no changes to our thinking there, where we'll work hard to accelerate our long-term road map, as Jack mentioned, making revenue product our number one priority. So our MAP work will continue throughout this year. We actually have recently launched a pilot where we have new -- parts of new MAP in the hands of advertisers, where they can work on launching a campaign with new formats. And we'll get some good feedback from that, and we hope that we can build upon that over the course of this year. 
Remember, we've said that the impact from our MAP work ought to be felt gradually over time as we test and roll things out and then we see MAP advertisers' models adjust. Remember, this is a multi tens of billions of dollar market to advertise, mobile games, video services, food delivery services and other things, and we believe that those models will be able to adjust quickly once we're able to roll out a product to people that has more performance than the one that we've got today. So we'll keep you updated on that as things unfold."

So as I said in my opening remarks, the -- our focus on relevance and our focus on making conversation much more accessible and more powerful continues to pay off. So the relevance work that we're doing within the timeline has been critical, and we're making really great strides in making that a whole lot more powerful, a whole lot more relevant as people come back to the service. And I think the biggest thing that will shift us from people who come to Twitter because they want to know what's happening and stay informed around COVID-19 is our work on interests, Topics and lists in particular. 
To me, this is like the biggest unlock for what makes someone really see the potential of Twitter. It just hasn't been that accessible in the past to people. People have had to find and follow all the accounts related to a particular topic or an interest. We should be doing that work for them. This also gives us much, much stronger signal to our revenue products and to our business. So a lot of the work that we're doing right now on that is to make lists a whole lot more powerful and to make following topics a lot easier. And as we perfect that experience and we make a great experience for people to go into, it's an obvious candidate to put right at onboarding so that you may come in to learn about what's happening with COVID-19, but you also see all the interests based on the signals we have about you, whether it be where you are or tweets that you like or engage with, so you can follow those topics directly that we can then suggest tweets and accounts for you. 
So our strategy remains true. And we're looking at everything that's going on in the service today, looking for any signs of new, emerging patterns, but they all come back to these interests and topics that we think are really durable and also really important to compete."

And so we'll keep you updated as it unfolds. Remember the impact ought to be felt gradually, as we've said on this call, and over time.  
But let me just step back more broadly and remind you of a few things about direct response. The first is this is an important area for us already today, whether it's through website, clicks or app download, ads. This is something that's been important to us for a long time and something where we've done a good job with Video Website Cards and Video App Cards in the past. But we know we can do better for advertisers not just with app installs but moving all the way down the funnel over time. And so that road map is something that we'll work hard to accelerate here to make sure that we can help advertisers launch new products and services and connect with what's happening not just from a brand and awareness perspective but all the way down the advertising funnel.  
Remember, we've said in the past that there's an awful lot of signal that we have today from how people use the service, and Jack mentioned some of the timeline-related or tweets-related benefits to that just now. But it also really helps on the advertising side, and we think that personalization continues to be more of an opportunity for us than a risk as we look ahead and think about how we can serve more direct response ads to people over time."

And the flip side of that is as sports start happening this fall, do you expect brand advertising on Twitter to pick up in tandem with that? 
And how are you kind of retooling the sales process to adapt to this current environment if most of the conversation on Twitter is around COVID-19, which makes sense right now? Is there a way to kind of tweak the ad sales approach to take advantage of the situation from like a messaging standpoint or anything like that?"

And so there's a ton of other stuff happening on Twitter. 
And we continue to see advertisers want to launch new products and services, whether it's that Xiaomi  example I gave earlier or tablets that have been launched and new video services that have been launched recently, or connecting with what's happening, whether it's a global concert that brings everybody to their sofa to watch and Pepsi is advertising around it or advertisers who we have helped pivot their campaigns, where before Intuit may have been advertising QuickBooks but now they're advertising their GoFundMe to help small businesses. Helping advertisers pivot has been a big part of the work of our commercial team, and we're so proud of all the efforts that they've done on video to quickly adapt and help their customers.  
When we look ahead to events that have been postponed or canceled, things that will happen down the road, it's hard to really parse out from those things how things will play out both because of the broader economic environment and because there's a lot that has to happen between now and then. But the work that we're doing to continue to help this increased audience and the people who'll be new to Twitter in the future, the work that we're doing to improve our ad formats can only help us more down the road with these events that come up, whether it's the Olympics next year or some of the other things that'll come back in the fall of this year."

So when we think about pulling forward, that's not really a term that we consider. 
Having said that, if we look at the way the March quarter played out, we did have DAU strength in January and February tied to the typical seasonality that we see and the ongoing product improvements that we've delivered. And then there really was a surge in March as people flocked to the service to learn more about COVID-19, as their behaviors changed and they came to Twitter to learn more about what was happening in the world and what people were talking about. That did level off towards the end of March. And so we think about -- the opportunity today is continuing to add people who are new to Twitter and help them make the service part of their daily lives and to continue to help those people who have recently found us or haven't used the service as frequently in the past and help them make Twitter a part of their daily lives. We still see lots of opportunity in both of those buckets."

So we wanted to make sure that we had a lot of optionality for -- we found a great engineer somewhere around the world that we could be a company that could help them be extremely creative and productive wherever they happen to be. We were able to flip the switch very quickly, and we saw no significant change in productivity as people start working from home every single day. 
So as we emerge out of the stay-at-home orders, I think it gives us a lot more optionality, gives our employees a lot more optionality. All of our infrastructure has been tuned for this, and we have a practice now within the company that is extremely effective. So it means that we have a lot more options to hire people wherever they happen to be, wherever they happen to feel they're most creative."

And really, what it comes down to is our focus on public conversation. And what has blocked us in the past is people just understanding the power of the service, and the power of the service is really incredible.  
One of the things that we've identified as lacking is this work that I mentioned earlier that people have to do to find and follow all the accounts that are related to their particular interest. So that's why interests and Topics are such a high priority for us. We also see the power of Twitter really being the conversation, being able to follow conversations, find conversations but also participate in them. And in the past, they were just far too inaccessible, far too buried and not something that I could easily grasp and get into. So a lot of our work recently to make conversations more organized much more intuitive is really paying off.  
And finally, there's a lot of work around making sure people feel comfortable in expressing themselves in Twitter. And here, I would point you to Fleets. This is an opportunity for people to share something that disappears in 24 hours. There's no likes, there's no retweets, there's no replies. And what -- the reason we built this is because it helps people who don't necessarily have something to say to the world but do have something to say to a group of friends or followers and don't necessarily want that content, that tweet to be around forever. They're just off-the-moment thoughts and something that they want to express but that should disappear. 
So we launched this in Brazil. We're seeing incredible feedback, both in terms of usage and also people telling us how much they like it, and we hope to roll that out as quickly as possible all around the world."

First, on where the work sits around MAP, we really feel like the bulk of the work is on our end. Advertisers want a performance product that's easy to use, where they can launch a campaign quickly and where they can have clear attribution for where success comes from and what they ought to pay for it. And so we really feel like a lot of the work is on our end. 
As we roll out that work through testing and adapting and improving it, we believe that the models that the advertisers use to buy app install ads ought to adapt on their own as we've seen them do in both directions in our business over time. That can play out favorably and it can hurt you when you're not performing. So we feel like a lot of this is in our control in a multi tens of billions of dollar growing market for app install ads.  
Your second part of your question was around some of the issues that we've talked about in the past around our revenue products. Let me remind you on the ad server work that we began talking about in 2019, that work ought to be completed in Q2. But we were pleased that the record Super Bowl traffic actually ran in many ways on the new ad server technology, and that will allow us to move faster. We'll have a more modular architecture that allows more people to work on the ad server at a time. And so we're really pleased and excited about the progress there and what that will allow us to do over time. 
When we think about how people use Twitter, we feel like there are tremendous direct response opportunities beyond the ones that we benefit from today, whether it's website clicks or app downloads. And it's up to us right now to do the work to come up with these great formats and to leverage the signal that we already have from how people use a service to help them find even more compelling ads than we do today."

So first, when we look at what we saw from March 11 to the 31st, which I think is the best time frame to look at if you want to think about what it has been like for us to navigate this very dynamic and unprecedented environment, I think you'd see a few things at play which remind you about some of the real strengths of our business. The first is we are a big beneficiary of events, both our customers' events when they're launching a new product or service and events that bring people to the service to learn about them and to be involved in a public conversation around them. And so I think we were impacted by both of those kinds of events being delayed or canceled in some cases.  
Secondly, if you look at the geographies, the U.S. was impacted more in that time frame than Asia. As an example, Asia saw more impact earlier in the quarter. And as things and the economies there began to come back a little bit, we did see some impact on -- from that in the March 11 to March 31 time frame.  
When we look at the verticals that advertise on Twitter most, remember, a lot of these are consumer packaged goods, tech and telco, media, financial services, companies who have large consumer businesses and where being out in front of their customers at the times that are important to them is really impactful. So we tend to have less advertising from things like travel or considered purchases than some others may. And as we work hard to improve our direct response offerings, we think that will help us even more with this group of advertisers as in a more constrained economic environment, they really want to be able to measure everything they're doing, assign attribution to it. These better ad formats that are further down the funnel, we think, will better position us to help them with that.  
Oh, your second question, sorry, OpEx for the year. So when we think about the decisions that we've made already, we feel really good about how we've adapted to this environment. We've reduced our headcount growth from what we had expected previously, continuing to focus on Engineering, Product, Design, Research and Trust & Safety. And there are a lot of other areas of the company where we will hold headcount relatively flat. Also, we've cut some of the nonlabor spend growth, things like travel and events that just can't happen in this environment, and then other things that are real decisions that we've made to prioritize and make sure that every dollar is most appropriately spent in a more constrained environment.  
When you ask what's temporary versus structural as we look out through the year, it's hard right now to really, in such a dynamic environment, assess exactly how things will play out over the rest of the year. We want to continue to be nimble and adapt to the environment while staying very insightful of the long-term opportunity that we see to continue to improve the product, to bring even more people to the service and to continue to improve our revenue products to help more advertisers. So as we balance those, we'll just have to talk more about it over the course of the year."

First, I think it's too early for us to predict what happens in terms of audience growth over the course of this year. Remember, the product improvements that Jack talked about earlier in the call really are designed to help us grow the base of people who use the service through any time frame, whether it's one like what we went through in March as people flocked to the service to learn more about COVID-19 or in any other environment. So I wouldn't want to predict, though, how that plays out from an events perspective either because it's hard to predict when the events will happen and it's hard to predict how people behave around them. But we'll just keep improving the service so that we can help as many of them as possible.  
On the DR side, these are such big advertising markets. If you think about DR as the largest piece of the digital ads market that is faster growing than the brand side, there are so many dollars at play that we tend to think a lot less about competing with specific platforms and a lot more about the reasons that advertisers use Twitter. They come to launch a new product or service, whether it's ridesharing in a different environment or food delivery in this one. And they come to connect with what's happening, whether that's something like The Last Dance, which brings people to Twitter even in a shelter-in-place environment, or other events that can't happen in the environment like the one we find ourselves in today. So we feel like there's still a tremendous opportunity for us to do more for advertisers with more performing, easier-to-launch ad formats and campaigns on the service."

So we were able to quickly flip a switch and everyone was able to do that without any loss in productivity. And we imagine that, that flexibility is going to be important as we look out for the next year to 18 months. We want to make sure that everyone has what they need to build wherever they happen to be, and a lot of our focus then really turns to our development velocity and agility.

I want to start by thanking all the folks around the world who are currently on the front lines in our battle against COVID-19. We would not be able to do our work without the incredible sacrifices you're making to do yours. To everyone who's treating us, filling us, feeding us, caring for us and building for us, we see you and we appreciate you. Thank you. 
We're here to serve the public conversation because we believe it helps the world learn faster, solve common problems and shows us that we're all in this together. COVID-19 has proven this. For the first time in history, the entire world is focused on learning how to solve one global problem. People are turning to Twitter to stay informed, to share solutions and to ask for help and support one another. And we see it in the numbers.  
Average mDAU grew 24% year-over-year, which brings us to a total of 166 million, our highest reported growth rate to date. Our consistent focus on increasing relevance and making conversation more accessible and powerful continues to be right. The real power of Twitter is unlocked, though, through lists and interests, however, and we remain confident our work here will enable entirely new forms of participation for people all over the world.  
There has been a rapid and significant decrease in global advertising spend due to COVID-19, which is also reflected in our numbers. Total revenue was $808 million in Q1, up 3% year-over-year. As we've talked about on these calls before, our goal is to increase our revenue durability by building a world-class performance ads product, starting with MAP. In light of the environment and the increasing importance of our revenue product work, we've now made this our #1 priority so we can deliver the product as quickly as possible and accelerate our direct response road map. Development velocity and agility continues to be a focus for our Engineering team with a goal of doubling the rate at which we're able to ship features to our customers. 
COVID-19 also accelerated our efforts to decentralize our workforce as we've all been working from home since the 1st week of March. We've seen no significant decrease in productivity, which gives us a lot of optionality for the future.  
I've never been more sure of the value Twitter brings to people around the world. Folks trust us every day to carry some of the most important questions, ideas, commentary and critiques in the world. We acknowledge and appreciate our role in making this incredibly powerful service accessible and directly valuable to everyone. There's nothing else like it. 
Thank you. And now over to Ned."

Before we get into Q&A, I want to highlight a few things which are in the letter but merit mentioning at the outset of the call. 
We had a strong start to the quarter that was impacted by widespread economic disruption related to COVID-19 in March, leading to a significant decrease in global advertising spend. As we noted in the letter, ad revenue from March 11 to March 31 declined approximately 27% year-over-year. 
Jack mentioned our increased focus on DR. An improved MAP product and more direct response ad formats would increase our addressable market with more exposure to advertising demand that may be more resilient through an economic downturn while building on our strengths and helping brands launch something new and connect with what's happening.  
I'm also pleased to share that our ad server rebuild should be complete by the end of Q2. 
We've moved quickly to consider our expenses and slow our hiring ramp. We're continuing to grow our Engineering, Product, Design, Research and Trust & Safety teams while largely holding headcount at current levels on other functions as we continue to monitor the broader environment and our own operations. Lower headcount growth, decisions we've made to reduce nonlabor costs and savings from business activities such as travel and customer events that have been significantly curtailed, combined with future decisions we make as this very dynamic environment continues to unfold, are expected to result in full year 2020 total expense growth that will be considerably less than the 20% we expected at the beginning of the year. We currently expect Q2 expenses to be meaningfully below the year-over-year growth we observed in Q1, likely closer to a year-over-year percentage growth rate in the low teens.  
As people turn to brands, institutions and leaders for answers, we've also seen brands turn to Twitter as they've adapted their advertising to respect the current environment. We've seen brands like Verizon and Salesforce leverage our Live Brand Studio to raise awareness about their live streaming events, while Hyundai utilized Video Website Cards to drive awareness for their job loss protection program that offers deferred payments for new or current owners. We supported Xiaomi through our ArtHouse team and content creators to launch the Mi 10 phone series with the entire marketing execution done remotely and broadcast through live stream on Twitter. Coupled with our record mDAU growth, these handful of examples demonstrate why we're so passionate about continuing to invest in our most impactful work. We remain confident in the significant long-term growth opportunity for Twitter.  
With that, we're ready to take your questions. Operator?"

And then more broadly on the topic of MAP and direct response, could you perhaps provide a framework or time line in terms of how much additional work is needed to finish up the changes to MAP, but perhaps more importantly, the process required to roll out other direct response formats? And how much activity on Twitter is users who are in market for products and services? If there's any possible way to frame that."

First, when we think about what it's been like to navigate through this unprecedented time, I think the best time frame to point you to would be that March 11 to March 31 time frame. That gives you a good sense for what it's been like for us. And I'd just also point out, in such a dynamic environment, for you or us to try to discern trends based on the tremendous change in advertiser behavior as the economy continues to evolve may not be prudent. 
So I'd just point you back to that March 11 to March 31 time frame. I should point out within that, that the U.S. was impacted a bit more and that other parts of the world, especially places in Asia where things had been impacted earlier by COVID-19, that they were less bad than they had been earlier in the quarter when you look at the March time frame.  
The second part of your question was around MAP and DR. There are no changes to our thinking there, where we'll work hard to accelerate our long-term road map, as Jack mentioned, making revenue product our number one priority. So our MAP work will continue throughout this year. We actually have recently launched a pilot where we have new -- parts of new MAP in the hands of advertisers, where they can work on launching a campaign with new formats. And we'll get some good feedback from that, and we hope that we can build upon that over the course of this year. 
Remember, we've said that the impact from our MAP work ought to be felt gradually over time as we test and roll things out and then we see MAP advertisers' models adjust. Remember, this is a multi tens of billions of dollar market to advertise, mobile games, video services, food delivery services and other things, and we believe that those models will be able to adjust quickly once we're able to roll out a product to people that has more performance than the one that we've got today. So we'll keep you updated on that as things unfold."

So as I said in my opening remarks, the -- our focus on relevance and our focus on making conversation much more accessible and more powerful continues to pay off. So the relevance work that we're doing within the timeline has been critical, and we're making really great strides in making that a whole lot more powerful, a whole lot more relevant as people come back to the service. And I think the biggest thing that will shift us from people who come to Twitter because they want to know what's happening and stay informed around COVID-19 is our work on interests, Topics and lists in particular. 
To me, this is like the biggest unlock for what makes someone really see the potential of Twitter. It just hasn't been that accessible in the past to people. People have had to find and follow all the accounts related to a particular topic or an interest. We should be doing that work for them. This also gives us much, much stronger signal to our revenue products and to our business. So a lot of the work that we're doing right now on that is to make lists a whole lot more powerful and to make following topics a lot easier. And as we perfect that experience and we make a great experience for people to go into, it's an obvious candidate to put right at onboarding so that you may come in to learn about what's happening with COVID-19, but you also see all the interests based on the signals we have about you, whether it be where you are or tweets that you like or engage with, so you can follow those topics directly that we can then suggest tweets and accounts for you. 
So our strategy remains true. And we're looking at everything that's going on in the service today, looking for any signs of new, emerging patterns, but they all come back to these interests and topics that we think are really durable and also really important to compete."

And so we'll keep you updated as it unfolds. Remember the impact ought to be felt gradually, as we've said on this call, and over time.  
But let me just step back more broadly and remind you of a few things about direct response. The first is this is an important area for us already today, whether it's through website, clicks or app download, ads. This is something that's been important to us for a long time and something where we've done a good job with Video Website Cards and Video App Cards in the past. But we know we can do better for advertisers not just with app installs but moving all the way down the funnel over time. And so that road map is something that we'll work hard to accelerate here to make sure that we can help advertisers launch new products and services and connect with what's happening not just from a brand and awareness perspective but all the way down the advertising funnel.  
Remember, we've said in the past that there's an awful lot of signal that we have today from how people use the service, and Jack mentioned some of the timeline-related or tweets-related benefits to that just now. But it also really helps on the advertising side, and we think that personalization continues to be more of an opportunity for us than a risk as we look ahead and think about how we can serve more direct response ads to people over time."

And the flip side of that is as sports start happening this fall, do you expect brand advertising on Twitter to pick up in tandem with that? 
And how are you kind of retooling the sales process to adapt to this current environment if most of the conversation on Twitter is around COVID-19, which makes sense right now? Is there a way to kind of tweak the ad sales approach to take advantage of the situation from like a messaging standpoint or anything like that?"

Thanks, Ross. First, let me start where you ended there. Although a lot of people are coming to Twitter around COVID-19 to learn more, and we're working hard to point them to trusted sources, be it the CDC or the relevant agency in their part of the world, to verify trusted sources to make sure that we're removing misinformation as quickly as we can, there's so much more happening on Twitter right now, whether it's the conversation around The Last Dance and allowing people to feel like they're in the room with their friends and the colleagues who they can't be in the room with today, the NFL draft or other things in other parts of the world that bring people together where they're looking for that connection and conversation. And so there's a ton of other stuff happening on Twitter. 
And we continue to see advertisers want to launch new products and services, whether it's that Xiaomi  example I gave earlier or tablets that have been launched and new video services that have been launched recently, or connecting with what's happening, whether it's a global concert that brings everybody to their sofa to watch and Pepsi is advertising around it or advertisers who we have helped pivot their campaigns, where before Intuit may have been advertising QuickBooks but now they're advertising their GoFundMe to help small businesses. Helping advertisers pivot has been a big part of the work of our commercial team, and we're so proud of all the efforts that they've done on video to quickly adapt and help their customers.  
When we look ahead to events that have been postponed or canceled, things that will happen down the road, it's hard to really parse out from those things how things will play out both because of the broader economic environment and because there's a lot that has to happen between now and then. But the work that we're doing to continue to help this increased audience and the people who'll be new to Twitter in the future, the work that we're doing to improve our ad formats can only help us more down the road with these events that come up, whether it's the Olympics next year or some of the other things that'll come back in the fall of this year."

So when we think about pulling forward, that's not really a term that we consider. 
Having said that, if we look at the way the March quarter played out, we did have DAU strength in January and February tied to the typical seasonality that we see and the ongoing product improvements that we've delivered. And then there really was a surge in March as people flocked to the service to learn more about COVID-19, as their behaviors changed and they came to Twitter to learn more about what was happening in the world and what people were talking about. That did level off towards the end of March. And so we think about -- the opportunity today is continuing to add people who are new to Twitter and help them make the service part of their daily lives and to continue to help those people who have recently found us or haven't used the service as frequently in the past and help them make Twitter a part of their daily lives.

And really, what it comes down to is our focus on public conversation. And what has blocked us in the past is people just understanding the power of the service, and the power of the service is really incredible.  
One of the things that we've identified as lacking is this work that I mentioned earlier that people have to do to find and follow all the accounts that are related to their particular interest. So that's why interests and Topics are such a high priority for us. We also see the power of Twitter really being the conversation, being able to follow conversations, find conversations but also participate in them. And in the past, they were just far too inaccessible, far too buried and not something that I could easily grasp and get into. So a lot of our work recently to make conversations more organized much more intuitive is really paying off.  
And finally, there's a lot of work around making sure people feel comfortable in expressing themselves in Twitter. And here, I would point you to Fleets. This is an opportunity for people to share something that disappears in 24 hours. There's no likes, there's no retweets, there's no replies. And what -- the reason we built this is because it helps people who don't necessarily have something to say to the world but do have something to say to a group of friends or followers and don't necessarily want that content, that tweet to be around forever. They're just off-the-moment thoughts and something that they want to express but that should disappear. 
So we launched this in Brazil. We're seeing incredible feedback, both in terms of usage and also people telling us how much they like it, and we hope to roll that out as quickly as possible all around the world."

And then a second one in MAP would just be how much of the past challenges with the formats are  kind of ad server related versus maybe challenges just related to the format of Twitter as a lean-forward product?

First, on where the work sits around MAP, we really feel like the bulk of the work is on our end. Advertisers want a performance product that's easy to use, where they can launch a campaign quickly and where they can have clear attribution for where success comes from and what they ought to pay for it. And so we really feel like a lot of the work is on our end. 
As we roll out that work through testing and adapting and improving it, we believe that the models that the advertisers use to buy app install ads ought to adapt on their own as we've seen them do in both directions in our business over time. That can play out favorably and it can hurt you when you're not performing. So we feel like a lot of this is in our control in a multi tens of billions of dollar growing market for app install ads.  
Your second part of your question was around some of the issues that we've talked about in the past around our revenue products. Let me remind you on the ad server work that we began talking about in 2019, that work ought to be completed in Q2. But we were pleased that the record Super Bowl traffic actually ran in many ways on the new ad server technology, and that will allow us to move faster. We'll have a more modular architecture that allows more people to work on the ad server at a time. And so we're really pleased and excited about the progress there and what that will allow us to do over time. 
When we think about how people use Twitter, we feel like there are tremendous direct response opportunities beyond the ones that we benefit from today, whether it's website clicks or app downloads. And it's up to us right now to do the work to come up with these great formats and to leverage the signal that we already have from how people use a service to help them find even more compelling ads than we do today."

So first, when we look at what we saw from March 11 to the 31st, which I think is the best time frame to look at if you want to think about what it has been like for us to navigate this very dynamic and unprecedented environment, I think you'd see a few things at play which remind you about some of the real strengths of our business. The first is we are a big beneficiary of events, both our customers' events when they're launching a new product or service and events that bring people to the service to learn about them and to be involved in a public conversation around them. And so I think we were impacted by both of those kinds of events being delayed or canceled in some cases.  
Secondly, if you look at the geographies, the U.S. was impacted more in that time frame than Asia. As an example, Asia saw more impact earlier in the quarter. And as things and the economies there began to come back a little bit, we did see some impact on -- from that in the March 11 to March 31 time frame.  
When we look at the verticals that advertise on Twitter most, remember, a lot of these are consumer packaged goods, tech and telco, media, financial services, companies who have large consumer businesses and where being out in front of their customers at the times that are important to them is really impactful. So we tend to have less advertising from things like travel or considered purchases than some others may. And as we work hard to improve our direct response offerings, we think that will help us even more with this group of advertisers as in a more constrained economic environment, they really want to be able to measure everything they're doing, assign attribution to it. These better ad formats that are further down the funnel, we think, will better position us to help them with that.  
Oh, your second question, sorry, OpEx for the year. So when we think about the decisions that we've made already, we feel really good about how we've adapted to this environment. We've reduced our headcount growth from what we had expected previously, continuing to focus on Engineering, Product, Design, Research and Trust & Safety. And there are a lot of other areas of the company where we will hold headcount relatively flat. Also, we've cut some of the nonlabor spend growth, things like travel and events that just can't happen in this environment, and then other things that are real decisions that we've made to prioritize and make sure that every dollar is most appropriately spent in a more constrained environment.  
When you ask what's temporary versus structural as we look out through the year, it's hard right now to really, in such a dynamic environment, assess exactly how things will play out over the rest of the year. We want to continue to be nimble and adapt to the environment while staying very insightful of the long-term opportunity that we see to continue to improve the product, to bring even more people to the service and to continue to improve our revenue products to help more advertisers. So as we balance those, we'll just have to talk more about it over the course of the year."

First, I think it's too early for us to predict what happens in terms of audience growth over the course of this year. Remember, the product improvements that Jack talked about earlier in the call really are designed to help us grow the base of people who use the service through any time frame, whether it's one like what we went through in March as people flocked to the service to learn more about COVID-19 or in any other environment. So I wouldn't want to predict, though, how that plays out from an events perspective either because it's hard to predict when the events will happen and it's hard to predict how people behave around them. But we'll just keep improving the service so that we can help as many of them as possible.  
On the DR side, these are such big advertising markets. If you think about DR as the largest piece of the digital ads market that is faster growing than the brand side, there are so many dollars at play that we tend to think a lot less about competing with specific platforms and a lot more about the reasons that advertisers use Twitter. They come to launch a new product or service, whether it's ridesharing in a different environment or food delivery in this one. And they come to connect with what's happening, whether that's something like The Last Dance, which brings people to Twitter even in a shelter-in-place environment, or other events that can't happen in the environment like the one we find ourselves in today. So we feel like there's still a tremendous opportunity for us to do more for advertisers with more performing, easier-to-launch ad formats and campaigns on the service."

I want to start by thanking all the folks around the world who are currently on the front lines in our battle against COVID-19. We would not be able to do our work without the incredible sacrifices you're making to do yours. To everyone who's treating us, filling us, feeding us, caring for us and building for us, we see you and we appreciate you. Thank you. 
We're here to serve the public conversation because we believe it helps the world learn faster, solve common problems and shows us that we're all in this together. COVID-19 has proven this. For the first time in history, the entire world is focused on learning how to solve one global problem. People are turning to Twitter to stay informed, to share solutions and to ask for help and support one another. And we see it in the numbers.  
Average mDAU grew 24% year-over-year, which brings us to a total of 166 million, our highest reported growth rate to date. Our consistent focus on increasing relevance and making conversation more accessible and powerful continues to be right. The real power of Twitter is unlocked, though, through lists and interests, however, and we remain confident our work here will enable entirely new forms of participation for people all over the world.  
There has been a rapid and significant decrease in global advertising spend due to COVID-19, which is also reflected in our numbers. Total revenue was $808 million in Q1, up 3% year-over-year. As we've talked about on these calls before, our goal is to increase our revenue durability by building a world-class performance ads product, starting with MAP. In light of the environment and the increasing importance of our revenue product work, we've now made this our #1 priority so we can deliver the product as quickly as possible and accelerate our direct response road map. Development velocity and agility continues to be a focus for our Engineering team with a goal of doubling the rate at which we're able to ship features to our customers. 
COVID-19 also accelerated our efforts to decentralize our workforce as we've all been working from home since the 1st week of March. We've seen no significant decrease in productivity, which gives us a lot of optionality for the future.  
I've never been more sure of the value Twitter brings to people around the world. Folks trust us every day to carry some of the most important questions, ideas, commentary and critiques in the world. We acknowledge and appreciate our role in making this incredibly powerful service accessible and directly valuable to everyone. There's nothing else like it. 
Thank you. And now over to Ned."

Before we get into Q&A, I want to highlight a few things which are in the letter but merit mentioning at the outset of the call. 
We had a strong start to the quarter that was impacted by widespread economic disruption related to COVID-19 in March, leading to a significant decrease in global advertising spend. As we noted in the letter, ad revenue from March 11 to March 31 declined approximately 27% year-over-year. 
Jack mentioned our increased focus on DR. An improved MAP product and more direct response ad formats would increase our addressable market with more exposure to advertising demand that may be more resilient through an economic downturn while building on our strengths and helping brands launch something new and connect with what's happening.  
I'm also pleased to share that our ad server rebuild should be complete by the end of Q2. 
We've moved quickly to consider our expenses and slow our hiring ramp. We're continuing to grow our Engineering, Product, Design, Research and Trust & Safety teams while largely holding headcount at current levels on other functions as we continue to monitor the broader environment and our own operations. Lower headcount growth, decisions we've made to reduce nonlabor costs and savings from business activities such as travel and customer events that have been significantly curtailed, combined with future decisions we make as this very dynamic environment continues to unfold, are expected to result in full year 2020 total expense growth that will be considerably less than the 20% we expected at the beginning of the year. We currently expect Q2 expenses to be meaningfully below the year-over-year growth we observed in Q1, likely closer to a year-over-year percentage growth rate in the low teens.  
As people turn to brands, institutions and leaders for answers, we've also seen brands turn to Twitter as they've adapted their advertising to respect the current environment. We've seen brands like Verizon and Salesforce leverage our Live Brand Studio to raise awareness about their live streaming events, while Hyundai utilized Video Website Cards to drive awareness for their job loss protection program that offers deferred payments for new or current owners. We supported Xiaomi through our ArtHouse team and content creators to launch the Mi 10 phone series with the entire marketing execution done remotely and broadcast through live stream on Twitter. Coupled with our record mDAU growth, these handful of examples demonstrate why we're so passionate about continuing to invest in our most impactful work. We remain confident in the significant long-term growth opportunity for Twitter.  
With that, we're ready to take your questions. Operator?"

First, when we think about what it's been like to navigate through this unprecedented time, I think the best time frame to point you to would be that March 11 to March 31 time frame. That gives you a good sense for what it's been like for us. And I'd just also point out, in such a dynamic environment, for you or us to try to discern trends based on the tremendous change in advertiser behavior as the economy continues to evolve may not be prudent. 
So I'd just point you back to that March 11 to March 31 time frame. I should point out within that, that the U.S. was impacted a bit more and that other parts of the world, especially places in Asia where things had been impacted earlier by COVID-19, that they were less bad than they had been earlier in the quarter when you look at the March time frame.  
The second part of your question was around MAP and DR. There are no changes to our thinking there, where we'll work hard to accelerate our long-term road map, as Jack mentioned, making revenue product our number one priority. So our MAP work will continue throughout this year. We actually have recently launched a pilot where we have new -- parts of new MAP in the hands of advertisers, where they can work on launching a campaign with new formats. And we'll get some good feedback from that, and we hope that we can build upon that over the course of this year. 
Remember, we've said that the impact from our MAP work ought to be felt gradually over time as we test and roll things out and then we see MAP advertisers' models adjust. Remember, this is a multi tens of billions of dollar market to advertise, mobile games, video services, food delivery services and other things, and we believe that those models will be able to adjust quickly once we're able to roll out a product to people that has more performance than the one that we've got today. So we'll keep you updated on that as things unfold."

So as I said in my opening remarks, the -- our focus on relevance and our focus on making conversation much more accessible and more powerful continues to pay off. So the relevance work that we're doing within the timeline has been critical, and we're making really great strides in making that a whole lot more powerful, a whole lot more relevant as people come back to the service. And I think the biggest thing that will shift us from people who come to Twitter because they want to know what's happening and stay informed around COVID-19 is our work on interests, Topics and lists in particular. 
To me, this is like the biggest unlock for what makes someone really see the potential of Twitter. It just hasn't been that accessible in the past to people. People have had to find and follow all the accounts related to a particular topic or an interest. We should be doing that work for them. This also gives us much, much stronger signal to our revenue products and to our business. So a lot of the work that we're doing right now on that is to make lists a whole lot more powerful and to make following topics a lot easier. And as we perfect that experience and we make a great experience for people to go into, it's an obvious candidate to put right at onboarding so that you may come in to learn about what's happening with COVID-19, but you also see all the interests based on the signals we have about you, whether it be where you are or tweets that you like or engage with, so you can follow those topics directly that we can then suggest tweets and accounts for you. 
So our strategy remains true. And we're looking at everything that's going on in the service today, looking for any signs of new, emerging patterns, but they all come back to these interests and topics that we think are really durable and also really important to compete."

And so we'll keep you updated as it unfolds. Remember the impact ought to be felt gradually, as we've said on this call, and over time.  
But let me just step back more broadly and remind you of a few things about direct response. The first is this is an important area for us already today, whether it's through website, clicks or app download, ads. This is something that's been important to us for a long time and something where we've done a good job with Video Website Cards and Video App Cards in the past. But we know we can do better for advertisers not just with app installs but moving all the way down the funnel over time. And so that road map is something that we'll work hard to accelerate here to make sure that we can help advertisers launch new products and services and connect with what's happening not just from a brand and awareness perspective but all the way down the advertising funnel.  
Remember, we've said in the past that there's an awful lot of signal that we have today from how people use the service, and Jack mentioned some of the timeline-related or tweets-related benefits to that just now. But it also really helps on the advertising side, and we think that personalization continues to be more of an opportunity for us than a risk as we look ahead and think about how we can serve more direct response ads to people over time."

And the flip side of that is as sports start happening this fall, do you expect brand advertising on Twitter to pick up in tandem with that? 
And how are you kind of retooling the sales process to adapt to this current environment if most of the conversation on Twitter is around COVID-19, which makes sense right now? Is there a way to kind of tweak the ad sales approach to take advantage of the situation from like a messaging standpoint or anything like that?"

Thanks, Ross. First, let me start where you ended there. Although a lot of people are coming to Twitter around COVID-19 to learn more, and we're working hard to point them to trusted sources, be it the CDC or the relevant agency in their part of the world, to verify trusted sources to make sure that we're removing misinformation as quickly as we can, there's so much more happening on Twitter right now, whether it's the conversation around The Last Dance and allowing people to feel like they're in the room with their friends and the colleagues who they can't be in the room with today, the NFL draft or other things in other parts of the world that bring people together where they're looking for that connection and conversation. And so there's a ton of other stuff happening on Twitter. 
And we continue to see advertisers want to launch new products and services, whether it's that Xiaomi  example I gave earlier or tablets that have been launched and new video services that have been launched recently, or connecting with what's happening, whether it's a global concert that brings everybody to their sofa to watch and Pepsi is advertising around it or advertisers who we have helped pivot their campaigns, where before Intuit may have been advertising QuickBooks but now they're advertising their GoFundMe to help small businesses. Helping advertisers pivot has been a big part of the work of our commercial team, and we're so proud of all the efforts that they've done on video to quickly adapt and help their customers.  
When we look ahead to events that have been postponed or canceled, things that will happen down the road, it's hard to really parse out from those things how things will play out both because of the broader economic environment and because there's a lot that has to happen between now and then. But the work that we're doing to continue to help this increased audience and the people who'll be new to Twitter in the future, the work that we're doing to improve our ad formats can only help us more down the road with these events that come up, whether it's the Olympics next year or some of the other things that'll come back in the fall of this year."

So when we think about pulling forward, that's not really a term that we consider. 
Having said that, if we look at the way the March quarter played out, we did have DAU strength in January and February tied to the typical seasonality that we see and the ongoing product improvements that we've delivered. And then there really was a surge in March as people flocked to the service to learn more about COVID-19, as their behaviors changed and they came to Twitter to learn more about what was happening in the world and what people were talking about. That did level off towards the end of March. And so we think about -- the opportunity today is continuing to add people who are new to Twitter and help them make the service part of their daily lives and to continue to help those people who have recently found us or haven't used the service as frequently in the past and help them make Twitter a part of their daily lives.

And really, what it comes down to is our focus on public conversation. And what has blocked us in the past is people just understanding the power of the service, and the power of the service is really incredible.  
One of the things that we've identified as lacking is this work that I mentioned earlier that people have to do to find and follow all the accounts that are related to their particular interest. So that's why interests and Topics are such a high priority for us. We also see the power of Twitter really being the conversation, being able to follow conversations, find conversations but also participate in them. And in the past, they were just far too inaccessible, far too buried and not something that I could easily grasp and get into. So a lot of our work recently to make conversations more organized much more intuitive is really paying off.  
And finally, there's a lot of work around making sure people feel comfortable in expressing themselves in Twitter. And here, I would point you to Fleets. This is an opportunity for people to share something that disappears in 24 hours. There's no likes, there's no retweets, there's no replies. And what -- the reason we built this is because it helps people who don't necessarily have something to say to the world but do have something to say to a group of friends or followers and don't necessarily want that content, that tweet to be around forever. They're just off-the-moment thoughts and something that they want to express but that should disappear. 
So we launched this in Brazil. We're seeing incredible feedback, both in terms of usage and also people telling us how much they like it, and we hope to roll that out as quickly as possible all around the world."

So we feel like a lot of this is in our control in a multi tens of billions of dollar growing market for app install ads.  
Your second part of your question was around some of the issues that we've talked about in the past around our revenue products. Let me remind you on the ad server work that we began talking about in 2019, that work ought to be completed in Q2. But we were pleased that the record Super Bowl traffic actually ran in many ways on the new ad server technology, and that will allow us to move faster. We'll have a more modular architecture that allows more people to work on the ad server at a time. And so we're really pleased and excited about the progress there and what that will allow us to do over time. 
When we think about how people use Twitter, we feel like there are tremendous direct response opportunities beyond the ones that we benefit from today, whether it's website clicks or app downloads. And it's up to us right now to do the work to come up with these great formats and to leverage the signal that we already have from how people use a service to help them find even more compelling ads than we do today."

So first, when we look at what we saw from March 11 to the 31st, which I think is the best time frame to look at if you want to think about what it has been like for us to navigate this very dynamic and unprecedented environment, I think yo",560,"Thanks, Brian. So first, when we look at what we saw from March 11 to the 31st, which I think is the best time frame to look at if you want to think about what it has been like for us to navigate this very dynamic and unprecedented environment, I think you'd see a few things at play which remind you about some of the real strengths of our business. The first is we are a big beneficiary of events, both our customers' events when they're launching a new product or service and events that bring people to the service to learn about them and to be involved in a public conversation around them. And so I think we were impacted by both of those kinds of events being delayed or canceled in some cases.  
Secondly, if you look at the geographies, the U.S. was impacted more in that time frame than Asia. As an example, Asia saw more impact earlier in the quarter. And as things and the economies there began to come back a little bit, we did see some impact on -- from that in the March 11 to March 31 time frame.  
When we look at the verticals that advertise on Twitter most, remember, a lot of these are consumer packaged goods, tech and telco, media, financial services, companies who have large consumer businesses and where being out in front of their customers at the times that are important to them is really impactful. So we tend to have less advertising from things like travel or considered purchases than some others may. And as we work hard to improve our direct response offerings, we think that will help us even more with this group of advertisers as in a more constrained economic environment, they really want to be able to measure everything they're doing, assign attribution to it. These better ad formats that are further down the funnel, we think, will better position us to help them with that.  
Oh, your second question, sorry, OpEx for the year. So when we think about the decisions that we've made already, we feel really good about how we've adapted to this environment. We've reduced our headcount growth from what we had expected previously, continuing to focus on Engineering, Product, Design, Research and Trust & Safety. And there are a lot of other areas of the company where we will hold headcount relatively flat. Also, we've cut some of the nonlabor spend growth, things like travel and events that just can't happen in this environment, and then other things that are real decisions that we've made to prioritize and make sure that every dollar is most appropriately spent in a more constrained environment.  
When you ask what's temporary versus structural as we look out through the year, it's hard right now to really, in such a dynamic environment, assess exactly how things will play out over the rest of the year. We want to continue to be nimble and adapt to the environment while staying very insightful of the long-term opportunity that we see to continue to improve the product, to bring even more people to the service and to continue to improve our revenue products to help more advertisers. So as we balance those, we'll just have to talk more about it over the course of the year."

First, I think it's too early for us to predict what happens in terms of audience growth over the course of this year. Remember, the product improvements that Jack talked about earlier in the call really are designed to help us grow the base of people who use the service through any time frame, whether it's one like what we went through in March as people flocked to the service to learn more about COVID-19 or in any other environment. So I wouldn't want to predict, though, how that plays out from an events perspective either because it's hard to predict when the events will happen and it's hard to predict how people behave around them. But we'll just keep improving the service so that we can help as many of them as possible.  
On the DR side, these are such big advertising markets. If you think about DR as the largest piece of the digital ads market that is faster growing than the brand side, there are so many dollars at play that we tend to think a lot less about competing with specific platforms and a lot more about the reasons that advertisers use Twitter. They come to launch a new product or service, whether it's ridesharing in a different environment or food delivery in this one. And they come to connect with what's happening, whether that's something like The Last Dance, which brings people to Twitter even in a shelter-in-place environment, or other events that can't happen in the environment like the one we find ourselves in today. So we feel like there's still a tremendous opportunity for us to do more for advertisers with more performing, easier-to-launch ad formats and campaigns on the service."

So we were able to quickly flip a switch and everyone was able to do that without any loss in productivity. And we imagine that, that flexibility is going to be important as we look out for the next year to 18 months. We want to make sure that everyone has what they need to build wherever they happen to be, and a lot of our focus then really turns to our development velocity and agility.

A few comments from me and Ned before we take your questions. 
Last week was a really tough week for all of us at Twitter, and we feel terrible about the security incident that negatively affected the people we serve and their trust in us. Security doesn't have an endpoint. It's a constant iteration to stay steps ahead of adversaries. We fell behind both in our protections against social engineering of our employees and restrictions on our internal tools. And for that, I apologize on behalf of our company. We moved quickly to lock down and fix and sought to be transparent and frequent in our updates to the public. We will continue to go above and beyond here as we continue to secure our systems and work with external firms and law enforcement. 
I'll now turn to our results from the quarter. We saw tremendous growth in audience and engagement, growing mDAU to $186 million, a 34% year-over-year increase, our highest reported growth rate. People continue to come to Twitter to learn about and participate in conversations focused on systemic racism and Black Lives Matter, COVID-19, and the reopening and reclosing of economies all around the world. At the same time, we grew the number of topics people can follow to more than 4,000, including public health information, sports, music and local news, enabling you to follow cities like St. Louis and New Orleans. And now over 50 million people follow topics, which we continue to believe is the best way to experience the power of Twitter with very little effort required. 
Total revenue was $683 million in Q2, down 19% year-over-year. While we continue to see headwinds from lower global advertising demand due to COVID and civil unrest, we've made strong progress on our top revenue product priorities, and we saw improvement in advertiser demand over the course of the quarter. And we passed a major milestone as we completed our ad server rebuild to support faster product development, increase our stability and help scale our advertising business. We also made progress on our direct response road map by improving measurement, prediction and our ad formats portfolio. 
We acquired CrossInstall, a team of 60 people, to help accelerate our direct response initiatives. And as you all saw from our job postings and we'll see from future experiments, we're in the early stages of exploring other potential revenue opportunities to complement our advertising business. 
Lastly, I want to thank our teams for their incredible dedication and effort during this time. While it's trying for all of us, we continue to see the strength of our service, the incredible potential of our business and the importance of our purpose to serve the public conversation. We aim to build the public conversation layer of the Internet and are reminded daily why it's so critical to get it right and accessible to all.

Thanks, Jack. 
Last quarter, we noted that in Q1, widespread economic disruption and a significant decrease in global ad spend as a result of the pandemic led to a 27% decline in year-over-year ads revenue in the 3 weeks of March -- in the last 3 weeks of March. We saw a gradual moderate recovery relative to March levels throughout most of Q2, with the exception of late May to mid-June when many brands slowed or paused spend in reaction to U.S. civil unrest. There was a lot happening in June. But if you look at the last 3 weeks of the quarter, we were down 15%, a significant improvement from the [indiscernible] in the last 3 weeks of March, and demand gradually improved once brands returned after the protest subsided. 
Stepping back, there are real bright spots. Certain markets in Asia were actually up year-over-year in Q2. We saw substantive signs of improvement around the globe, and we're even better positioned to deliver for advertisers when the live events and product launches that bring many people and advertisers to Twitter return. I know if I'm still late tonight, I'll be watching the opening night Giants-Dodgers game and following along on Twitter. 
Brands have found innovative ways to join in on the conversation and connect with their customers despite the pandemic. For example, PlayStation leveraged an 89% increase in video game conversation on Twitter to build interest and awareness for the PS5. Their successful takeover campaign with a Branded Emoji, a Promoted Trend Spotlight and a First View resulted in PlayStation being the top global trend with over 1 million mentions over 2 days and a 4x higher engagement rate than the benchmark. We continue to amplify conversations around live events. 
In Q2, we held virtual watch parties for The Last Dance, the Global Citizen livestream of The Together at Home concert for the WHO and numerous movie and product launches as people and partners pivoted to seek virtual connections when physical connections were not possible. These have been valuable for our audience as well as content and advertising partners. 
Let me also cover a couple of modeling things where you may have questions. You may have also noted a large noncash loss related to a valuation allowance for a deferred tax asset. This reverses a gain that we took last year. It's related to our ability to use some of our international deferred tax assets in the near future. We're confident that when the current operating environment turns around, we'll eventually be able to use these deferred tax assets. 
Total costs and expenses grew 5% to $807 million. This was lower than we expected. I want to be clear that this is not the go-forward expense growth rate you should expect as we're adapting to this operating environment and intend to hire more people and invest more to improve our revenue products and grow our audience. We expect expenses in Q3 to grow 10% or more and to grow CapEx, but the environment remains uncertain. 
With that, we're ready to take your questions. Operator?"

We're bringing more and more of that relevance to search, to explore and, most importantly, for the future topics.

We have over 4,000 topics to follow, including local topics, and this includes local news. And that just opens an entirely new view of what Twitter has to offer to complement why people come to Twitter in the first place, especially during these times, to find out around COVID or Black Lives Matter and civil unrest happening around the world. So our goal here in terms of engagement is people may come in for one reason. We want to show them everything else Twitter has to offer, and we're seeing that in the numbers as well. And I think topics will continue to play a massive role, but the investment of relevance at its core is critical.

So that 5% reflects both decisions that we've made to be thoughtful about where we invest but also a more constrained hiring environment, where we're still adjusting to hiring and onboarding people in this environment where some of the events and things where we like to be spending money aren't necessarily happening. So as the economy opens up but also to the extent it doesn't, we are getting better at hiring and onboarding people in this environment. So we do want to be investing further. 
And we're confident that when Twitter does have a more profitable business, it's on a higher revenue because we've invested to continue to grow our audience and to continue to improve our revenue products and not because we've cut our way to a more profitable business. 
In terms of engagement, I'd just add I think you're talking about the ad engagements, which were up 3% year-over-year. And remember, that ad engagement number is a combination of a bunch of different types of ad formats where the thresholds to be called an engagement might be different for some, it's a click; for others, it's a view. And in an environment like the one we're in today, this is a powerful reminder that direct response tends to perform better than brand. And direct response ads typically have a higher threshold to be an engagement. And so you may show as many of them as you had in the past, as many ads as you had in the past, but you may have a lower ad engagement number because there are fewer brand ads and there are more MAP ads or website click ads in their place. That's why you saw better performance from us in some of the Asia markets, where MAP tends to do better. It's why we had really successful campaigns like Dragon Blood for Rakuten in Japan and other things that involve MAP or app install ads."

So the -- as I said in my opening remarks, the milestone that we passed of rebuilding our ad server was pretty critical for us. We're really happy to put that work behind us. As we've been talking about rebuilding that ad server allows us specifically to experiment a lot more and, thus, increase our development of [indiscernible] because we can launch new products, get feedback from advertisers of all of them very quickly, refine them and then get them to market. So everything has really been dependent upon that, including our experiments with direct response, starting with MAP. As you mentioned, we have finished our first pilot of MAP, and we're about to embark on our second. And we work very closely with our advertising customers to make sure that we are taking their feedback, that we're building something that is durable and excellent in the market and constantly iterating and evolving. A lot of this is really just a function of being able to move fast based on feedback and the performance we're seeing in the market. 
In regards to just general direct response and the road map, we've been focusing on improving measurement, we've been focused on improving prediction, and we're updating formats for advertisers. Prediction, we ran a series of experiments with app card improvements. Super early, but we're seeing some great results there, improving our prediction models, already improving click installs for MAP advertisers. And also updating our formats, we launched a video card in beta, which has 2 to 6 swipeable images and videos. And we like the early results with the CTR of 60% and greater than 30% installs impressions versus a single image control. 
And more importantly, our acquisition of CrossInstall is 60 people. We have been focused on direct response and MAP map for some time. So we hope to really accelerate our work and the quality of our work through that. 
No change in timing on MAP. We're learning from the fly."

We think there's a world where commerce is complementary. You can imagine work around helping people manage payrolls as well that we believe is complementary. So that's what we're looking for. We have a small team who is exploring our options. Obviously, we're hiring for those teams. But given the work that we've done now and finished on our ad server, given the progression of our road map on MAP and given the increased speed we're moving at in terms of our development velocity, we're now at a place where we can explore other ideas. And you will likely see some tests this year. 
And as we build anything, we want to work with the people that we're serving and make sure that we have a phenomenal experience before we share it. But right now, our #1 priority is making sure that our MAP road map is strong and moving fast, and that brings us to a greater performance road map as well."

So if you look at the trajectory over the course of Q2, you can imagine, April looked a lot like March as the world was largely sheltering in place. And the live events and product launches and other things that really resonate on Twitter for people and advertisers were really put to a stop. In May, we did see a gradual improvement. And June is really a couple of different time frames. There's the beginning of the month which was dominated by the Black Lives Matters protest in the United States when many brands chose to pause. And then there's the second part of the month. And so we gave that last 3 week time frame and mentioned that it was down 15% in terms of ad revenue year-over-year. But even within that time frame, we did see gradual recovery. It's hard to discern a straight line from a short time frame like that when there are so many things that are moving right now in the world. 
But we do feel like with sports coming back, whether it's baseball tonight or basketball next week or the EPL, which is already moving golf, which came back already, these are terrific both audience opportunities for us as there's great conversation around these things on Twitter but also sponsorship and advertising and content opportunities as the highlights for those events are terrific opportunities to bring content owners, advertisers and the people who watch them together on Twitter. So we feel really good about in a time like this when, unfortunately, people can't always be live at these events, our ability to be the stadium for a lot of these events and bring people together, have them talk about what's happening, and you'll see some innovative stuff from us that we're really excited about."

And so we intend for that to be the case here, but we're still working through all the details on the security issue, and we'll just keep people posted, as we have, on Twitter over the last couple of weeks as our work has unfolded. 
The second part of your question about lower quick-through rates. So this, just like the ad engagements that we talked about earlier, has a lot to do with the mix shift where our direct response road map is so important for so many reasons, and this is a really good example as to why, where you will see less brand advertising in an environment like this, more direct response advertising. And we're working really hard to make those formats even better than they are today to improve relevance. But people are still buying our app install ads, they're still buying website click ads on Twitter, and sometimes they buy more of them than they were before. And so those ads often have a higher threshold to be an engagement or to be a click than the brand ads do. And so you end up seeing similar amounts of ads, but the click-through rates or ad engagement rates would be lower. So this is really just about that mix shift. And that's why we saw some stronger performance in some of the markets that are more DR heavy like APAC than we did in the United States. I hope that helps."

I'll start on the engagement related question, and then I'll turn to Jack on the SMB opportunity. So first, if you just think about the trajectory in the first half of the year, we saw a surge in usage in March as people's habits change as they were sheltering in place all around the world but also as there was news that they really wanted to learn more about -- around COVID-19. And  then if you look at Q2, we really held on to that significantly increased base people over the course of the quarter. They continue to come to Twitter to find out not just about COVID-19. We had 150 million people come to our COVID-19 resources as we work hard to make sure that the right information was there and that we're pointing people towards trusted sources wherever they were in the world. And so we're really pleased that we're able to hold that base. 
And if we think about what drove this, a lot of it is the events and behaviors around the world, but it also was the product improvements because if we hadn't work hard to improve relevance on the home time line, of the notifications, of our COVID-19 resources, people wouldn't have continued to come back to Twitter. And if we step back from the events that brought people to the service, we're confident that we still would have had a good quarter from a DAU perspectiveif it hadn't been for all of these events, but it's really hard to parse these things out. 
When we think about all the great product work that we talked about, that has accumulated and that will continue with only 4,000 topics and get 50 million people following a topic already, we feel like there's lots of work in front of us that we can do to continue to grow the base of people who've been using the service. When we look at engagement, remember, we still think that mDAU is going to be the best way to look at engagement because we want to be a daily resource for people. And so I'd point you to that generally. But when we look at other metrics,and just think through things, we continue to feel good about what we see from an engagement perspective and how people are using the service, who are new to it versus those who have used it less frequently but are coming back again."

On topics, we've been really pleased with how having access the topics impacts people's ability to find what they're looking for on Twitter. When you remove the hard work for people of finding the accounts that they should follow when they care about a sports team or a company or a political topic and you bring all of the conversations together for them, you can really improve their experience. We've been experimenting with including it in the onboarding process. We feel like this will be a big unlock in the onboarding process when we get it right. And the fact that 50 million people have already embraced this as we roll it out to more languages, as we roll out to more topics, as we refine the quality of the topics and the suites in the topics, we feel like there's lots of room for us to continue to improve here. 
The same is true for lists, where people can scroll and have different time lines tied to the different areas of interest that they may have. And Jack had mentioned over a year ago now that we felt like there was years of work for us on topics and interest as we orient the service around these things, and we still feel like there's lots of room in front of us. 
The second part of your question was around how we think about the signal that we have. So we've mentioned in the past that we feel like the opportunity to provide a more personalized experience to people on Twitter is it's really an opportunity for us more than it is a risk. And that may be different than you hear about from other people, and that's partly because of the approach that we've taken over time. And it also might be about some of the things where we see opportunity where you've seen us recently take action. So some examples of this are, in the last couple of weeks, many of you may have seen a prompt or we asked if you were comfortable if we showed you personalized ads if you weren't seeing them, this is an example where we went back to people who are existing accounts and ask them for their permission to show them -- give them a more personalized experience. We feel like there's a lot of signal on Twitter which we can better leverage than we do today to give people more personalized ads. And you see this when somebody is looking into a topic or event, we know an awful lot about them which we can better leverage than we do today. And some of that bears itself out when we provide better measurement to our MAP advertisers, as Jack talked about earlier, where we find that when we get people access to third-party measurement, which we did this past quarter, that they tend to spend more on Twitter than they otherwise would have. And so lots of opportunity there. And we're going to keep working on this in the coming quarters."

When things paused in March and April, advertisers really started to go back and think about how they wanted to show up in this more challenging time and also how they want to show up and return. Content owners started to think about when things did come back, if there weren't fans in the stands, where they were going to recreate the stadium experience and how they were going to bring people into the events in a way that could be fulfilling for everybody from the fans to the players. And people launching movies thought about how, whether it's Trolls or Hamilton, they were going to get people excited through a virtual watch party in a way where they could still give people a good experience and monetize their really valuable content. And so as people pivoted and got creative, we feel like we were a really big part of what they were able to do. PlayStation launching the PS5 is another great example of it; Salesforce with work.com. And when these things happen and they have people have fewer choices, we found that Twitter was a big beneficiary of that. 
However, in an environment when there's more subdued economic activity, it just doesn't add up to as much advertising, and it perhaps comes in at different pricing than you've seen in other periods. When we look ahead and we think about events coming back, hopefully, that would be great for so many reasons, of course. But when it does happen, we hope that we can, with a larger audience, with better revenue products, be an even more important part of those experiences. But I'd come back to the economic activity more because I feel like there's so much that happened this past quarter and how people adjusted to this environment. We've been an important part of that, that when things come back, we're going to try hard to hold on to what we gain as well as what we're really good at in helping these content partners before."

First, on the regions, I mentioned that we saw certain markets in APAC that were up year-over-year. This is a combination of things from the comps from last year, from the particular ad campaigns that we saw as there were some big mobile game launches in Asia where we were really able to help advertisers. I mentioned that one for Tencent called Dragon Blood in Japan as an example. But there definitely were other ones in other markets as well. And also that these are more MAP and website, click, heavy markets relative to the U.S. And so that helped our growth there as well. 
The trends over the course of the quarter, I think it would -- if you look at different regions, I don't think it would surprise you.

Just when you step back from the activity you see from advertisers in the conversation that's going on around them right now, we feel really good about the way that we continue to show up with the people use a service with advertisers, with content partners, with human rights groups. When we talk to them about the principles that we use to guide our work, about our policies, about how we choose to be transparent and consistent in how we apply our policies all over the world and to any person in particular. And we feel like the way we show up over time will help them guide their decisions, which is way more important than any 1 month of activity that we may see. 
Your second question was about DR and can we get to where we need to be from a measurement perspective. We think we can, Justin. That's why we're working hard to come out with better formats and a better experience for advertisers. But this quarter is a great example where you saw a lot of under-the-hood work I mentioned. The improved measurement capabilities as a great example, advertisers expect third-party measurement in order to be able to weigh the success of their campaign on one platform versus another. And this was a gap for us. And when we provide it to people, as you would expect, they spend more on Twitter. And so as we roll that out more broadly, as we continue to improve our ad ranking and prediction models, we're confident that we'll be able to deliver even better for these advertisers and that, that will show up over time. But we feel like there's so much great signal, some of which we use today, but other things that we don't yet use around people, how people are using the service but also as we get permission from them, to make sure that we're using the signal they give us in the best way possible, we think there's still lots of opportunity in front of us."

A few comments from me and Ned before we take your questions.  
Last week was a really tough week for all of us at Twitter, and we feel terrible about the security incident that negatively affected the people we serve and their trust in us. Security doesn't have an end point. It's a constant iteration to stay steps ahead of adversaries. We fell behind, both in our protections against social engineering of our employees and restrictions on our internal tools. And for that, I apologize on behalf of our company. 
We moved quickly to lock down and fix and sought to be transparent and frequent in our updates to the public. We will continue to go above and beyond here as we continue to secure our systems and work with external firms and law enforcement.  
I'll now turn to our results from the quarter. We saw tremendous growth in audience and engagement, growing mDAU to 186 million, a 34% year-over-year increase, our highest reported growth rate. People continue to come to Twitter to learn about and participate in conversations focused on systemic racism and Black Lives Matter, COVID-19, and the reopening and reclosing of economies all around the world. At the same time, we grew the number of topics people can follow to more than 4,000, including public health information, sports, music and local news, enabling you to follow cities like St. Louis and New Orleans. And now over 50 million people follow Topics, which we continue to believe is the best way to experience the power of Twitter with very little effort required.  
Total revenue was $683 million in Q2, down 19% year-over-year. While we continue to see headwinds from lower global advertising demand due to COVID and civil unrest, we've made strong progress on our top revenue product priorities, and we saw improvement in advertiser demand over the course of the quarter. And we passed a major milestone as we completed our ad server rebuild to support faster product development, increase our stability and help scale our advertising business. We also made progress on our direct response road map by improving measurement, prediction and our ad formats portfolio.  
We acquired CrossInstall, a team of 60 people, to help accelerate our direct response initiatives. And as you all saw from our job postings and we'll see from future experiments, we're in the early stages of exploring other potential revenue opportunities to complement our advertising business.  
Lastly, I want to thank our teams for their incredible dedication and effort during this time. While it's trying for all of us, we continue to see the strength of our service, the incredible potential of our business and the importance of our purpose to serve the public conversation. We aim to build the public conversation layer of the Internet and are reminded daily why it's so critical to get it right and accessible to all.

Thanks, Jack. Before we get into Q&A, I want to highlight a few things. Last quarter, we noted that in Q1, widespread economic disruption and a significant decrease in global ad spend as a result of the pandemic led to a 27% decline in year-over-year ads revenue in the 3 weeks of March -- in the last 3 weeks of March. We saw a gradual moderate recovery relative to March levels throughout most of Q2, with the exception of late May to mid-June when many brands slowed or paused spend in reaction to U.S. civil unrest. There was a lot happening in June. But if you look at the last 3 weeks of the quarter, we were down 15%, a significant improvement from the [indiscernible] in the last 3 weeks of March, and demand gradually improved once brands returned after the protests subsided. 
Stepping back, there are real bright spots. Certain markets in Asia were actually up year-over-year in Q2. We saw substantive signs of improvement around the globe, and we're even better positioned to deliver for advertisers when the live events and product launches that bring many people and advertisers to Twitter return. I know if I'm still awake tonight, I'll be watching the opening night Giants-Dodgers game and following along on Twitter.  
Brands have found innovative ways to join in on the conversation and connect with their customers despite the pandemic. For example, PlayStation leveraged an 89% increase in video game conversation on Twitter to build interest and awareness for the PS5. Their successful takeover campaign with a Branded Emoji, a Promoted Trend Spotlight and a First View resulted in PlayStation being the top global trend with over 1 million mentions over 2 days and a 4x higher engagement rate than the benchmark. 
We continue to amplify conversations around live events. In Q2, we held virtual watch parties for The Last Dance, the Global Citizen livestream of The Together at Home concert for the WHO and numerous movie and product launches as people and partners pivoted to seek virtual connections when physical connections were not possible. These have been valuable for our audience as well as content and advertising partners.  
Let me also cover a couple of modeling things where you may have questions. You may have also noted a large noncash loss related to a valuation allowance for a deferred tax asset. This reverses a gain that we took last year. It's related to our ability to use some of our international deferred tax assets in the near future. We're confident that when the current operating environment turns around, we'll eventually be able to use these deferred tax assets.  
Total costs and expenses grew 5% to $807 million. This was lower than we expected. I want to be clear that this is not the go-forward expense growth rate you should expect as we're adapting to this operating environment and intend to hire more people and invest more to improve our revenue products and grow our audience. We expect expenses in Q3 to grow 10% or more and to grow CapEx, but the environment remains uncertain.  
With that, we're ready to take your questions. Operator?"

But given the security and the hack issues last quarter, just to talk about whether the spend you have, the 5% to 10% next quarter is enough to handle what's obviously very important to your platform. 
And then secondly, could you just talk about the level of engagement you're seeing? That user growth was really impressive. It's hard for us maybe externally to track what's happening to engagement. The impression growth was very limited, but that's probably an ads issue. So just talk about whether you really are -- how can we tell that engagement is really growing as well as user growth?"

We continue to invest in constant refinements specifically around relevance. We've talked for some time about the relevance of the time line and notifications. We're bringing more and more of that relevance to Search, to Explore and, most importantly for the future, Topics. So as I mentioned in the opening remarks, there's a really powerful experience around following Topics on Twitter. And we notably saw over 50 million accounts now follow Topics. We have over 4,000 topics to follow, including local topics, and this includes local news. And that just opens an entirely new view of what Twitter has to offer to complement why people come to Twitter in the first place, especially during these times, to find out around COVID or Black Lives Matter and civil unrest happening around the world. So our goal here in terms of engagement is people may come in for one reason. We want to show them everything else Twitter has to offer, and we're seeing that in the numbers as well and I think Topics will continue to play a massive role. But the investment of relevance at its core is critical. And that's not just for our consumer product but also for our advertising stack as well and specifically around how we think about MAP going forward.  
I'll let Ned talk about how we think about the investment."

Mark, a couple of things to just add there on investment and how we want to move forward. We mentioned in the letter and in my opening remarks that we'd like to grow expenses faster than we did in Q2. So that 5% reflects both decisions that we've made to be thoughtful about where we invest but also a more constrained hiring environment, where we're still adjusting to hiring and onboarding people in this environment where some of the events and things where we'd like to be spending money aren't necessarily happening. So as the economy opens up but also to the extent it doesn't, we are getting better at hiring and onboarding people in this environment. So we do want to be investing further.  
And we're confident that when Twitter does have a more profitable business, it's on a higher revenue because we've invested to continue to grow our audience and to continue to improve our revenue products and not because we've cut our way to a more profitable business.  
In terms of engagement, I'd just add I think you're talking about the ad engagements, which were up 3% year-over-year. And remember, that ad engagement number is a combination of a bunch of different types of ad formats where the thresholds to be called an engagement might be different. For some, it's a click; for others, it's a view. And in an environment like the one we're in today, this is a powerful reminder that direct response tends to perform better than brand. And direct response ads typically have a higher threshold to be an engagement. And so you may show as many of them as you had in the past, as many ads as you had in the past, but you may have a lower ad engagement number because there are fewer brand ads and there are more MAP ads or website click ads in their place. That's why you saw better performance from us in some of the Asia markets, where MAP tends to do better. It's why we had really successful campaigns like Dragon Blood for Rakuten (sic) [ Tencent ] in Japan and other things that involve MAP or app install ads."

So the -- as I said in my opening remarks, the milestone that we passed of rebuilding our ad server was pretty critical for us. We're really happy to put that work behind us. As we've been talking about, rebuilding that ad server allows us specifically to experiment a lot more and, thus, increase our development, obviously, because we can launch new products, get feedback from advertisers, evolve them very quickly, refine them and then get them to market. So everything has really been dependent upon that, including our experiments with direct response, starting with MAP. 
As you mentioned, we have finished our first pilot of MAP, and we're about to embark on our second. And we work very closely with our advertising customers to make sure that we are taking their feedback, that we're building something that is durable and excellent in the market, in constant iterating and evolving. A lot of this is really just a function of being able to move fast based on feedback and the performance we're seeing in the market.  
In regards to just general direct response and the road map, we've been focusing on improving measurement, we've been focused on improving prediction, and we're updating formats for advertisers. Prediction, we ran a series of experiments with App Card improvements. Super early, but we're seeing some great results there, improving our prediction models, already improving click installs for MAP advertisers. And also updating our formats, we launched a Video Carousel Card in beta, which has 2 to 6 swipeable images and videos. And we like the early results with the CTR of 60% and greater than 30% installs, impressions versus a single image control. 
And more importantly, our acquisition of CrossInstall is 60 people, who have been focused on direct response and MAP for some time. So we hope to really accelerate our work and the quality of our work through that. No change in timing on MAP. We're learning from the fly."

And this is a start, and we're in the very, very early phases of exploring. As you mentioned, there have been a number of ideas over the years. We have focused the majority of our attention on increasing revenue durability, meaning that we have multiple lines of revenue to pull from. But most importantly, we want to make sure that any new line of revenue is complementary to our advertising business. We do think there's a world where subscription is complementary. We think there's a world where commerce is complementary. You can imagine work around helping people manage payrolls as well, that we believe is complementary. 
So that's what we're looking for. We have a small team who is exploring our options. Obviously, we're hiring for those teams. But given the work that we've done now and finished on our ad server, given the progression of our road map on MAP and given the increased speed we're moving at in terms of our development velocity, we're now at a place where we can explore other ideas. And you will likely see some tests this year.  
And as we build anything, we want to work with the people that we're serving and make sure that we have a phenomenal experience before we share it. But right now, our #1 priority is making sure that our MAP road map is strong and moving fast, and that brings us to a greater performance road map as well."

So if you look at the trajectory over the course of Q2, you can imagine, April looked a lot like March as the world was largely sheltering in place. And the live events and product launches and other things that really resonate on Twitter for people and advertisers were really put to a stop. In May, we did see a gradual improvement. And June is really a couple of different time frames: There's the beginning of the month, which was dominated by the Black Lives Matters protest in the United States, when many brands chose to pause. And then there's the second part of the month. And so we gave that last 3 week time frame and mentioned that it was down 15% in terms of ad revenue year-over-year. But even within that time frame, we did see gradual recovery. It's hard to discern a straight line from a short time frame like that when there are so many things that are moving right now in the world.  
But we do feel like with sports coming back, whether it's baseball tonight or basketball next week or the EPL, which is already moving golf, which came back already, these are terrific, both audience opportunities for us as there's great conversation around these things on Twitter, but also sponsorship and advertising and content opportunities as the highlights for those events are terrific opportunities to bring content owners, advertisers and the people who watch them together on Twitter. So we feel really good about -- in a time like this when, unfortunately, people can't always be live at these events, our ability to be the stadium for a lot of these events and bring people together, have them talk about what's happening, and you'll see some innovative stuff from us that we're really excited about."

Or is that not sort of relevant to your advertisers? Is it different, the hacking versus the advertiser growth in July? 
Then the second one, in the note, you talked about lower click-through rates throughout the quarter. Maybe talk to us about what drove the click-through rates lower. And what do you have to really innovate on to make that go higher?"

And so we intend for that to be the case here, but we're still working through all the details on the security issue, and we'll just keep people posted, as we have, on Twitter over the last couple of weeks as our work has unfolded. 
The second part of your question about lower quick-through rates. So this, just like the ad engagements that we talked about earlier, has a lot to do with the mix shift where our direct response road map is so important for so many reasons, and this is a really good example as to why, where you will see less brand advertising in an environment like this, more direct response advertising. And we're working really hard to make those formats even better than they are today to improve relevance. But people are still buying our MAP, our app install ads, they're still buying website click ads on Twitter, and sometimes they're buying more of them than they were before. And so those ads often have a higher threshold to be an engagement or to be a click than the brand ads do. And so you end up seeing similar amounts of ads, but the click-through rates or ad engagement rates would be lower. So this is really just about that mix shift. And that's why we saw some stronger performance in some of the markets that are more DR heavy like APAC than we did in the United States. Hope that helps."

I'll start on the engagement-related question, and then I'll turn to Jack on the SMB opportunity. So first, if you just think about the trajectory in the first half of the year, we saw a surge in usage in March as people's habits changed as they were sheltering in place all around the world, but also as there was news that they really wanted to learn more about around COVID-19. 
And then if you look at Q2, we really held on to that significantly increased base people over the course of the quarter. They continue to come to Twitter to find out not just about COVID-19. We had 150 million people come to our COVID-19 resources as we worked hard to make sure that the right information was there and that we're pointing people towards trusted sources wherever they were in the world. And so we're really pleased that we're able to hold that base. 
And if we think about what drove this, a lot of it is the events and behaviors around the world, but it also was the product improvements. Because if we hadn't work hard to improve relevance on the Home time line, of the notifications, of our COVID-19 resources, people wouldn't have continued to come back to Twitter. And if we step back from the events that brought people to the service, we're confident that we still would have had a good quarter from a DAU perspective if it hadn't been for all of these events, but it's really hard to parse these things out. 
When we think about all the great product work that we talked about, that has accumulated and that will continue with only 4,000 topics and get 50 million people following a topic already, we feel like there's lots of work in front of us that we can do to continue to grow the base of people who've been using the service. When we look at engagement, remember, we still think that mDAU is going to be the best way to look at engagement because we want to be a daily resource for people. And so I'd point you to that generally. But when we look at other metrics and just think through things, we continue to feel good about what we see from an engagement perspective in how people are using the service, who are new to it versus those who have used it less frequently but are coming back again."

On Topics, we've been really pleased with how having access to Topics impacts people's ability to find what they're looking for on Twitter. When you remove the hard work for people of finding the accounts that they should follow when they care about a sports team or a company or a political topic and you bring all of the conversations together for them, you can really improve their experience. We've been experimenting with including it in the onboarding process. We feel like this will be a big unlock in the onboarding process when we get it right. And the fact that 50 million people have already embraced this as we roll it out to more languages, as we roll out to more topics, as we refine the quality of the topics and the tweets in the topics, we feel like there's lots of room for us to continue to improve here. 
The same is true for Lists, where people can scroll and have different time lines tied to the different areas of interest that they may have. And Jack had mentioned over a year ago now that we felt like there was years of work for us on topics and interest as we orient the service around these things, and we still feel like there's lots of room in front of us. 
The second part of your question was around how we think about the signal that we have. So we've mentioned in the past that we feel like the opportunity to provide a more personalized experience to people on Twitter is -- it's really an opportunity for us more than it is a risk. And that may be different than you hear about from other people, and that's partly because of the approach that we've taken over time. And it also might be about some of the things where we see opportunity where you've seen us recently take action. So some examples of this are, in the last couple of weeks, many of you may have seen a prompt or we asked if you were comfortable if we showed you personalized ads. If you weren't seeing them, this is an example where we went back to people who are -- existing accounts and asked them for their permission to show them -- give them a more personalized experience. We feel like there's a lot of signal on Twitter, which we can better leverage than we do today to give people more personalized ads. And you see this when somebody is looking into a topic or event. We know an awful lot about them which we can better leverage than we do today. And some of that bears itself out when we provide better measurement to our MAP advertisers, as Jack talked about earlier, where we find that when we get people access to third-party measurement, which we did this past quarter, that they tend to spend more on Twitter than they otherwise would have. And so lots of opportunity there. And we're going to keep working on this in the coming quarters."

And then two, for Ned, obviously, sports is coming back, which is great. I think you had mentioned that there were several categories, obviously, that it's sort of been problematic, that hurt you. I'm thinking like feature films not being released in theaters.

When things paused in March and April, advertisers really started to go back and think about how they wanted to show up in this more challenging time and also how they wanted to show up when it returned. Content owners started to think about when things did come back, if there weren't fans in the stands, where they were going to recreate the stadium experience and how they were going to bring people into the events in a way that could be fulfilling for everybody, from the fans to the players. And people launching movies thought about how, whether it's Trolls or Hamilton, they were going to get people excited through a virtual watch party in a way where they could still give people a good experience and monetize their really valuable content. 
And so as people pivoted and got creative, we feel like we were a really big part of what they were able to do. PlayStation launching the PS5 is another great example of it; Salesforce with Work.com. And when these things happen and they have people have fewer choices, we found that Twitter was a big beneficiary of that. 
However, in an environment when there's more subdued economic activity, it just doesn't add up to as much advertising, and it perhaps comes in at different pricing than you've seen in other periods. When we look ahead and we think about events coming back, hopefully -- that would be great for so many reasons, of course. But when it does happen, we hope that we can, with a larger audience, with better revenue products, be an even more important part of those experiences. But I'd come back to the economic activity more because I feel like there's so much that happened this past quarter and how people adjusted to this environment. We've been an important part of that, that when things come back, we're going to try hard to hold on to what we gained as well as what we're really good at in helping these content partners before."

First, on the regions, I mentioned that we saw certain markets in APAC that were up year-over-year. This is a combination of things from the comps from last year, from the particular ad campaigns that we saw as there were some big mobile game launches in Asia where we were really able to help advertisers. I mentioned the one for Tencent called Dragon Blood in Japan as an example. But there definitely were other ones in other markets as well. And also that these are more MAP and website click-heavy markets relative to the U.S., and so that helped our growth there as well. 
The trends over the course of the quarter, I think it would -- if you looked at different regions, I don't think it would surprise you. It's tied partly to when economies gradually reopened, but it's also tied to those campaigns and to where certain types of ad formats were stronger, such as MAP, as I mentioned, in Asia as an example."

Nothing different on what we're seeing in July. Just when you step back from the activity you see from advertisers and the conversation that's going on around them right now, we feel really good about the way that we continue to show up with the people who use our service, with advertisers, with content partners, with human rights groups. When we talk to them about the principles that we use to guide our work, about our policies, about how we choose to be transparent and consistent in how we apply our policies all over the world and to any person in particular. And we feel like the way we show up over time will help them guide their decisions, which is way more important than any 1 month of activity that we may see. 
Your second question was about DR, and can we get to where we need to be from a measurement perspective. We think we can, Justin. That's why we're working hard to come out with better formats and a better experience for advertisers. But this quarter is a great example where you saw a lot of under-the-hood work I mentioned, the improved measurement capabilities as a great example. Advertisers expect third-party measurement in order to be able to weigh the success of their campaign on one platform versus another. And this was a gap for us. And when we provide it to people, as you would expect, they spend more on Twitter. And so as we roll that out more broadly, as we continue to improve our ad ranking and prediction models, we're confident that we'll be able to deliver even better for these advertisers and that, that will show up over time. But we feel like there's so much great signal, some of which we use today, but other things that we don't yet use around people, how people are using the service but also as we get permission from them, to make sure that we're using the signal they give us in the best ways possible. We think there's still lots of opportunity in front of us. 
All right. Thanks for joining us, everyone. We appreciate your interest in Twitter, and we look forward to speaking to you next quarter when we report earnings for Q3 on October 29 after the market closes. Until then, we'll see you on Twitter."

A few comments from me and Ned before we take your questions.  
Last week was a really tough week for all of us at Twitter, and we feel terrible about the security incident that negatively affected the people we serve and their trust in us. Security doesn't have an end point. It's a constant iteration to stay steps ahead of adversaries. We fell behind, both in our protections against social engineering of our employees and restrictions on our internal tools. And for that, I apologize on behalf of our company. 
We moved quickly to lock down and fix and sought to be transparent and frequent in our updates to the public. We will continue to go above and beyond here as we continue to secure our systems and work with external firms and law enforcement.  
I'll now turn to our results from the quarter. We saw tremendous growth in audience and engagement, growing mDAU to 186 million, a 34% year-over-year increase, our highest reported growth rate. People continue to come to Twitter to learn about and participate in conversations focused on systemic racism and Black Lives Matter, COVID-19, and the reopening and reclosing of economies all around the world. At the same time, we grew the number of topics people can follow to more than 4,000, including public health information, sports, music and local news, enabling you to follow cities like St. Louis and New Orleans. And now over 50 million people follow Topics, which we continue to believe is the best way to experience the power of Twitter with very little effort required.  
Total revenue was $683 million in Q2, down 19% year-over-year. While we continue to see headwinds from lower global advertising demand due to COVID and civil unrest, we've made strong progress on our top revenue product priorities, and we saw improvement in advertiser demand over the course of the quarter. And we passed a major milestone as we completed our ad server rebuild to support faster product development, increase our stability and help scale our advertising business. We also made progress on our direct response road map by improving measurement, prediction and our ad formats portfolio.  
We acquired CrossInstall, a team of 60 people, to help accelerate our direct response initiatives. And as you all saw from our job postings and we'll see from future experiments, we're in the early stages of exploring other potential revenue opportunities to complement our advertising business.  
Lastly, I want to thank our teams for their incredible dedication and effort during this time. While it's trying for all of us, we continue to see the strength of our service, the incredible potential of our business and the importance of our purpose to serve the public conversation. We aim to build the public conversation layer of the Internet and are reminded daily why it's so critical to get it right and accessible to all.

Thanks, Jack. Before we get into Q&A, I want to highlight a few things. Last quarter, we noted that in Q1, widespread economic disruption and a significant decrease in global ad spend as a result of the pandemic led to a 27% decline in year-over-year ads revenue in the 3 weeks of March -- in the last 3 weeks of March. We saw a gradual moderate recovery relative to March levels throughout most of Q2, with the exception of late May to mid-June when many brands slowed or paused spend in reaction to U.S. civil unrest. There was a lot happening in June. But if you look at the last 3 weeks of the quarter, we were down 15%, a significant improvement from the [indiscernible] in the last 3 weeks of March, and demand gradually improved once brands returned after the protests subsided. 
Stepping back, there are real bright spots. Certain markets in Asia were actually up year-over-year in Q2. We saw substantive signs of improvement around the globe, and we're even better positioned to deliver for advertisers when the live events and product launches that bring many people and advertisers to Twitter return. I know if I'm still awake tonight, I'll be watching the opening night Giants-Dodgers game and following along on Twitter.  
Brands have found innovative ways to join in on the conversation and connect with their customers despite the pandemic. For example, PlayStation leveraged an 89% increase in video game conversation on Twitter to build interest and awareness for the PS5. Their successful takeover campaign with a Branded Emoji, a Promoted Trend Spotlight and a First View resulted in PlayStation being the top global trend with over 1 million mentions over 2 days and a 4x higher engagement rate than the benchmark. 
We continue to amplify conversations around live events. In Q2, we held virtual watch parties for The Last Dance, the Global Citizen livestream of The Together at Home concert for the WHO and numerous movie and product launches as people and partners pivoted to seek virtual connections when physical connections were not possible. These have been valuable for our audience as well as content and advertising partners.  
Let me also cover a couple of modeling things where you may have questions. You may have also noted a large noncash loss related to a valuation allowance for a deferred tax asset. This reverses a gain that we took last year. It's related to our ability to use some of our international deferred tax assets in the near future. We're confident that when the current operating environment turns around, we'll eventually be able to use these deferred tax assets.  
Total costs and expenses grew 5% to $807 million. This was lower than we expected. I want to be clear that this is not the go-forward expense growth rate you should expect as we're adapting to this operating environment and intend to hire more people and invest more to improve our revenue products and grow our audience. We expect expenses in Q3 to grow 10% or more and to grow CapEx, but the environment remains uncertain.  
With that, we're ready to take your questions. Operator?"

But given the security and the hack issues last quarter, just to talk about whether the spend you have, the 5% to 10% next quarter is enough to handle what's obviously very important to your platform. 
And then secondly, could you just talk about the level of engagement you're seeing? That user growth was really impressive. It's hard for us maybe externally to track what's happening to engagement. The impression growth was very limited, but that's probably an ads issue. So just talk about whether you really are -- how can we tell that engagement is really growing as well as user growth?"

We continue to invest in constant refinements specifically around relevance. We've talked for some time about the relevance of the time line and notifications. We're bringing more and more of that relevance to Search, to Explore and, most importantly for the future, Topics. So as I mentioned in the opening remarks, there's a really powerful experience around following Topics on Twitter. And we notably saw over 50 million accounts now follow Topics. We have over 4,000 topics to follow, including local topics, and this includes local news. And that just opens an entirely new view of what Twitter has to offer to complement why people come to Twitter in the first place, especially during these times, to find out around COVID or Black Lives Matter and civil unrest happening around the world. So our goal here in terms of engagement is people may come in for one reason. We want to show them everything else Twitter has to offer, and we're seeing that in the numbers as well and I think Topics will continue to play a massive role. But the investment of relevance at its core is critical. And that's not just for our consumer product but also for our advertising stack as well and specifically around how we think about MAP going forward.  
I'll let Ned talk about how we think about the investment."

Mark, a couple of things to just add there on investment and how we want to move forward. We mentioned in the letter and in my opening remarks that we'd like to grow expenses faster than we did in Q2. So that 5% reflects both decisions that we've made to be thoughtful about where we invest but also a more constrained hiring environment, where we're still adjusting to hiring and onboarding people in this environment where some of the events and things where we'd like to be spending money aren't necessarily happening. So as the economy opens up but also to the extent it doesn't, we are getting better at hiring and onboarding people in this environment. So we do want to be investing further.  
And we're confident that when Twitter does have a more profitable business, it's on a higher revenue because we've invested to continue to grow our audience and to continue to improve our revenue products and not because we've cut our way to a more profitable business.  
In terms of engagement, I'd just add I think you're talking about the ad engagements, which were up 3% year-over-year. And remember, that ad engagement number is a combination of a bunch of different types of ad formats where the thresholds to be called an engagement might be different. For some, it's a click; for others, it's a view. And in an environment like the one we're in today, this is a powerful reminder that direct response tends to perform better than brand. And direct response ads typically have a higher threshold to be an engagement. And so you may show as many of them as you had in the past, as many ads as you had in the past, but you may have a lower ad engagement number because there are fewer brand ads and there are more MAP ads or website click ads in their place. That's why you saw better performance from us in some of the Asia markets, where MAP tends to do better. It's why we had really successful campaigns like Dragon Blood for Rakuten (sic) [ Tencent ] in Japan and other things that involve MAP or app install ads."

So the -- as I said in my opening remarks, the milestone that we passed of rebuilding our ad server was pretty critical for us. We're really happy to put that work behind us. As we've been talking about, rebuilding that ad server allows us specifically to experiment a lot more and, thus, increase our development velocity because we can launch new products, get feedback from advertisers, evolve them very quickly, refine them and then get them to market. So everything has really been dependent upon that, including our experiments with direct response, starting with MAP. 
As you mentioned, we have finished our first pilot of MAP, and we're about to embark on our second. And we work very closely with our advertising customers to make sure that we are taking their feedback, that we're building something that is durable and excellent in the market, in constant iterating and evolving. A lot of this is really just a function of being able to move fast based on feedback and the performance we're seeing in the market.  
In regards to just general direct response and the road map, we've been focusing on improving measurement, we've been focused on improving prediction, and we're updating formats for advertisers. Prediction, we ran a series of experiments with App Card improvements. Super early, but we're seeing some great results there, improving our prediction models, already improving click installs for MAP advertisers. And also updating our formats, we launched a Video Carousel Card in beta, which has 2 to 6 swipeable images and videos. And we like the early results with the CTR of 60% and greater than 30% installs, impressions versus a single image control. 
And more importantly, our acquisition of CrossInstall is 60 people, who have been focused on direct response and MAP for some time. So we hope to really accelerate our work and the quality of our work through that. No change in timing on MAP. We're learning from the fly."

So that's what we're looking for. We have a small team who is exploring our options. Obviously, we're hiring for those teams.

And the live events and product launches and other things that really resonate on Twitter for people and advertisers were really put to a stop. In May, we did see a gradual improvement. And June is really a couple of different time frames: There's the beginning of the month, which was dominated by the Black Lives Matters protest in the United States, when many brands chose to pause. And then there's the second part of the month. And so we gave that last 3 week time frame and mentioned that it was down 15% in terms of ad revenue year-over-year. But even within that time frame, we did see gradual recovery. It's hard to discern a straight line from a short time frame like that when there are so many things that are moving right now in the world.

So the first one, yes, I appreciate the color, Ned, from what you're seeing in the last part of June. I guess the question is, with the difficult July and kind of the unfortunate hack that you've had, has that had an impact at all on the cadence in July? Or is that not sort of relevant to your advertisers? Is it different, the hacking versus the advertiser growth in July? 
Then the second one, in the note, you talked about lower click-through rates throughout the quarter. Maybe talk to us about what drove the click-through rates lower. And what do you have to really innovate on to make that go higher?"

And so we intend for that to be the case here, but we're still working through all the details on the security issue, and we'll just keep people posted, as we have, on Twitter over the last couple of weeks as our work has unfolded. 
The second part of your question about lower quick-through rates. So this, just like the ad engagements that we talked about earlier, has a lot to do with the mix shift where our direct response road map is so important for so many reasons, and this is a really good example as to why, where you will see less brand advertising in an environment like this, more direct response advertising. And we're working really hard to make those formats even better than they are today to improve relevance. But people are still buying our MAP, our app install ads, they're still buying website click ads on Twitter, and sometimes they're buying more of them than they were before. And so those ads often have a higher threshold to be an engagement or to be a click than the brand ads do. And so you end up seeing similar amounts of ads, but the click-through rates or ad engagement rates would be lower. So this is really just about that mix shift. And that's why we saw some stronger performance in some of the markets that are more DR heavy like APAC than we did in the United States. Hope that helps."

I'll start on the engagement-related question, and then I'll turn to Jack on the SMB opportunity. So first, if you just think about the trajectory in the first half of the year, we saw a surge in usage in March as people's habits changed as they were sheltering in place all around the world, but also as there was news that they really wanted to learn more about around COVID-19. 
And then if you look at Q2, we really held on to that significantly increased base people over the course of the quarter. They continue to come to Twitter to find out not just about COVID-19. We had 150 million people come to our COVID-19 resources as we worked hard to make sure that the right information was there and that we're pointing people towards trusted sources wherever they were in the world. And so we're really pleased that we're able to hold that base. 
And if we think about what drove this, a lot of it is the events and behaviors around the world, but it also was the product improvements. Because if we hadn't work hard to improve relevance on the Home time line, of the notifications, of our COVID-19 resources, people wouldn't have continued to come back to Twitter. And if we step back from the events that brought people to the service, we're confident that we still would have had a good quarter from a DAU perspective if it hadn't been for all of these events, but it's really hard to parse these things out. 
When we think about all the great product work that we talked about, that has accumulated and that will continue with only 4,000 topics and get 50 million people following a topic already, we feel like there's lots of work in front of us that we can do to continue to grow the base of people who've been using the service. When we look at engagement, remember, we still think that mDAU is going to be the best way to look at engagement because we want to be a daily resource for people. And so I'd point you to that generally. But when we look at other metrics and just think through things, we continue to feel good about what we see from an engagement perspective in how people are using the service, who are new to it versus those who have used it less frequently but are coming back again."

But generally, the more intuitive we make our revenue products, the more self-serve we make them, the easier it is for them to access and participate. 
Our self-serve channel for small and midsized businesses is relatively small right now, but we've had success in identifying and growing advertising dollars with many SMB advertisers. And we've been really encouraged by the growth we saw in Q2, though it is still pretty early, but we definitely believe in this opportunity and definitely going to invest forward in it."

On Topics, we've been really pleased with how having access to Topics impacts people's ability to find what they're looking for on Twitter. When you remove the hard work for people of finding the accounts that they should follow when they care about a sports team or a company or a political topic and you bring all of the conversations together for them, you can really improve their experience. We've been experimenting with including it in the onboarding process. We feel like this will be a big unlock in the onboarding process when we get it right. And the fact that 50 million people have already embraced this as we roll it out to more languages, as we roll out to more topics, as we refine the quality of the topics and the tweets in the topics, we feel like there's lots of room for us to continue to improve here. 
The same is true for Lists, where people can scroll and have different time lines tied to the different areas of interest that they may have. And Jack had mentioned over a year ago now that we felt like there was years of work for us on topics and interest as we orient the service around these things, and we still feel like there's lots of room in front of us. 
The second part of your question was around how we think about the signal that we have. So we've mentioned in the past that we feel like the opportunity to provide a more personalized experience to people on Twitter is -- it's really an opportunity for us more than it is a risk. And that may be different than you hear about from other people, and that's partly because of the approach that we've taken over time. And it also might be about some of the things where we see opportunity where you've seen us recently take action. So some examples of this are, in the last couple of weeks, many of you may have seen a prompt or we asked if you were comfortable if we showed you personalized ads. If you weren't seeing them, this is an example where we went back to people who are -- existing accounts and asked them for their permission to show them -- give them a more personalized experience. We feel like there's a lot of signal on Twitter, which we can better leverage than we do today to give people more personalized ads. And you see this when somebody is looking into a topic or event. We know an awful lot about them which we can better leverage than we do today. And some of that bears itself out when we provide better measurement to our MAP advertisers, as Jack talked about earlier, where we find that when we get people access to third-party measurement, which we did this past quarter, that they tend to spend more on Twitter than they otherwise would have. And so lots of opportunity there. And we're going to keep working on this in the coming quarters."

Is it winning you -- I don't want to say points. But I mean what's the conversation like in terms of what you've done versus what peers have done from political advertising and et cetera? 
And then two, for Ned, obviously, sports is coming back, which is great. I think you had mentioned that there were several categories, obviously, that it's sort of been problematic, that hurt you. I'm thinking like feature films not being released in theaters. But like what are the other missing categories or troubled categories that are still weighing on the growth as you think forward into Q3 and even into Q4 that we should be thinking about in terms of the timing of when they'd come back?

So we want to make sure that we are showing our commitment of service to the public conversation by our actions. And advertisers are definitely taking note as we talk with direct advertisers, as we talk with industry associations like ANA and WFA. We're hearing this resonate. And people are taking note of our differences and also, at the same time, seeing a lot of the opportunity on Twitter as we advance our road map.

When things paused in March and April, advertisers really started to go back and think about how they wanted to show up in this more challenging time and also how they wanted to show up when it returned. Content owners started to think about when things did come back, if there weren't fans in the stands, where they were going to recreate the stadium experience and how they were going to bring people into the events in a way that could be fulfilling for everybody, from the fans to the players. And people launching movies thought about how, whether it's Trolls or Hamilton, they were going to get people excited through a virtual watch party in a way where they could still give people a good experience and monetize their really valuable content. 
And so as people pivoted and got creative, we feel like we were a really big part of what they were able to do. PlayStation launching the PS5 is another great example of it; Salesforce with Work.com. And when these things happen and they have people have fewer choices, we found that Twitter was a big beneficiary of that. 
However, in an environment when there's more subdued economic activity, it just doesn't add up to as much advertising, and it perhaps comes in at different pricing than you've seen in other periods. When we look ahead and we think about events coming back, hopefully -- that would be great for so many reasons, of course. But when it does happen, we hope that we can, with a larger audience, with better revenue products, be an even more important part of those experiences. But I'd come back to the economic activity more because I feel like there's so much that happened this past quarter and how people adjusted to this environment. We've been an important part of that, that when things come back, we're going to try hard to hold on to what we gained as well as what we're really good at in helping these content partners before."

First, on the regions, I mentioned that we saw certain markets in APAC that were up year-over-year. This is a combination of things from the comps from last year, from the particular ad campaigns that we saw as there were some big mobile game launches in Asia where we were really able to help advertisers. I mentioned the one for Tencent called Dragon Blood in Japan as an example. But there definitely were other ones in other markets as well. And also that these are more MAP and website click-heavy markets relative to the U.S., and so that helped our growth there as well. 
The trends over the course of the quarter, I think it would -- if you looked at different regions, I don't think it would surprise you.

Your second question was about DR, and can we get to where we need to be from a measurement perspective. We think we can, Justin. That's why we're working hard to come out with better formats and a better experience for advertisers. But this quarter is a great example where you saw a lot of under-the-hood work I mentioned, the improved measurement capabilities as a great example. Advertisers expect third-party measurement in order to be able to weigh the success of their campaign on one platform versus another. And this was a gap for us. And when we provide it to people, as you would expect, they spend more on Twitter. And so as we roll that out more broadly, as we continue to improve our ad ranking and prediction models, we're confident that we'll be able to deliver even better for these advertisers and that, that will show up over time.

We also take questions asked on Twitter, so please tweet us at @TwitterIR using the $TWTR. 
During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, including about our business outlook and strategies. These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including the risk factors in our most recent 10-Q and upcoming 10-Q to be filed with the SEC. 
Also during this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. We have reconciled those to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in our shareholder letter. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for our GAAP results. And finally, this call in its entirety is being webcast from our Investor Relations website, and an audio replay will be available on Twitter and on our website in a few hours.

A few comments from me and Ned before we take your questions. 
Last week was a really tough week for all of us at Twitter, and we feel terrible about the security incident that negatively affected the people we serve and their trust in us. Security doesn't have an end point. It's a constant iteration to stay steps ahead of adversaries. We fell behind, both in our protections against social engineering of our employees and restrictions on our internal tools. And for that, I apologize on behalf of our company. 
We moved quickly to lock down and fix and sought to be transparent and frequent in our updates to the public. We will continue to go above and beyond here as we continue to secure our systems and work with external firms and law enforcement. 
I'll now turn to our results from the quarter. We saw tremendous growth in audience and engagement, growing mDAU to 186 million, a 34% year-over-year increase, our highest reported growth rate. People continue to come to Twitter to learn about and participate in conversations focused on systemic racism and Black Lives Matter, COVID-19, and the reopening and reclosing of economies all around the world. At the same time, we grew the number of topics people can follow to more than 4,000, including public health information, sports, music and local news, enabling you to follow cities like St. Louis and New Orleans. And now over 50 million people follow Topics, which we continue to believe is the best way to experience the power of Twitter with very little effort required. 
Total revenue was $683 million in Q2, down 19% year-over-year. While we continue to see headwinds from lower global advertising demand due to COVID and civil unrest, we've made strong progress on our top revenue product priorities, and we saw improvement in advertiser demand over the course of the quarter. And we passed a major milestone as we completed our ad server rebuild to support faster product development, increase our stability and help scale our advertising business. We also made progress on our direct response road map by improving measurement, prediction and our ad formats portfolio. 
We acquired CrossInstall, a team of 60 people, to help accelerate our direct response initiatives. And as you all saw from our job postings and we'll see from future experiments, we're in the early stages of exploring other potential revenue opportunities to complement our advertising business. 
Lastly, I want to thank our teams for their incredible dedication and effort during this time. While it's trying for all of us, we continue to see the strength of our service, the incredible potential of our business and the importance of our purpose to serve the public conversation. We aim to build the public conversation layer of the Internet and are reminded daily why it's so critical to get it right and accessible to all.

Thanks, Jack. Before we get into Q&A, I want to highlight a few things. Last quarter, we noted that in Q1, widespread economic disruption and a significant decrease in global ad spend as a result of the pandemic led to a 27% decline in year-over-year ads revenue in the 3 weeks of March -- in the last 3 weeks of March. We saw a gradual moderate recovery relative to March levels throughout most of Q2, with the exception of late May to mid-June when many brands slowed or paused spend in reaction to U.S. civil unrest. There was a lot happening in June. But if you look at the last 3 weeks of the quarter, we were down 15%, a significant improvement from the [indiscernible] in the last 3 weeks of March, and demand gradually improved once brands returned after the protests subsided. 
Stepping back, there are real bright spots. Certain markets in Asia were actually up year-over-year in Q2. We saw substantive signs of improvement around the globe, and we're even better positioned to deliver for advertisers when the live events and product launches that bring many people and advertisers to Twitter return. I know if I'm still awake tonight, I'll be watching the opening night Giants-Dodgers game and following along on Twitter. 
Brands have found innovative ways to join in on the conversation and connect with their customers despite the pandemic. For example, PlayStation leveraged an 89% increase in video game conversation on Twitter to build interest and awareness for the PS5. Their successful takeover campaign with a Branded Emoji, a Promoted Trend Spotlight and a First View resulted in PlayStation being the top global trend with over 1 million mentions over 2 days and a 4x higher engagement rate than the benchmark. 
We continue to amplify conversations around live events. In Q2, we held virtual watch parties for The Last Dance, the Global Citizen livestream of The Together at Home concert for the WHO and numerous movie and product launches as people and partners pivoted to seek virtual connections when physical connections were not possible. These have been valuable for our audience as well as content and advertising partners. 
Let me also cover a couple of modeling things where you may have questions. You may have also noted a large noncash loss related to a valuation allowance for a deferred tax asset. This reverses a gain that we took last year. It's related to our ability to use some of our international deferred tax assets in the near future. We're confident that when the current operating environment turns around, we'll eventually be able to use these deferred tax assets. 
Total costs and expenses grew 5% to $807 million. This was lower than we expected. I want to be clear that this is not the go-forward expense growth rate you should expect as we're adapting to this operating environment and intend to hire more people and invest more to improve our revenue products and grow our audience. We expect expenses in Q3 to grow 10% or more and to grow CapEx, but the environment remains uncertain. 
With that, we're ready to take your questions. Operator?"

Jack, could you talk about whether you feel like -- and Ned, whether you feel like you're investing enough? I know you don't throw money at problems. But given the security and the hack issues last quarter, just to talk about whether the spend you have, the 5% to 10% next quarter is enough to handle what's obviously very important to your platform. 
And then secondly, could you just talk about the level of engagement you're seeing? That user growth was really impressive. It's hard for us maybe externally to track what's happening to engagement. The impression growth was very limited, but that's probably an ads issue. So just talk about whether you really are -- how can we tell that engagement is really growing as well as user growth?"

We continue to invest in constant refinements specifically around relevance. We've talked for some time about the relevance of the time line and notifications. We're bringing more and more of that relevance to Search, to Explore and, most importantly for the future, Topics. So as I mentioned in the opening remarks, there's a really powerful experience around following Topics on Twitter. And we notably saw over 50 million accounts now follow Topics. We have over 4,000 topics to follow, including local topics, and this includes local news. And that just opens an entirely new view of what Twitter has to offer to complement why people come to Twitter in the first place, especially during these times, to find out around COVID or Black Lives Matter and civil unrest happening around the world. So our goal here in terms of engagement is people may come in for one reason. We want to show them everything else Twitter has to offer, and we're seeing that in the numbers as well and I think Topics will continue to play a massive role. But the investment of relevance at its core is critical. And that's not just for our consumer product but also for our advertising stack as well and specifically around how we think about MAP going forward. 
I'll let Ned talk about how we think about the investment."

Mark, a couple of things to just add there on investment and how we want to move forward. We mentioned in the letter and in my opening remarks that we'd like to grow expenses faster than we did in Q2. So that 5% reflects both decisions that we've made to be thoughtful about where we invest but also a more constrained hiring environment, where we're still adjusting to hiring and onboarding people in this environment where some of the events and things where we'd like to be spending money aren't necessarily happening. So as the economy opens up but also to the extent it doesn't, we are getting better at hiring and onboarding people in this environment. So we do want to be investing further. 
And we're confident that when Twitter does have a more profitable business, it's on a higher revenue because we've invested to continue to grow our audience and to continue to improve our revenue products and not because we've cut our way to a more profitable business. 
In terms of engagement, I'd just add I think you're talking about the ad engagements, which were up 3% year-over-year. And remember, that ad engagement number is a combination of a bunch of different types of ad formats where the thresholds to be called an engagement might be different. For some, it's a click; for others, it's a view. And in an environment like the one we're in today, this is a powerful reminder that direct response tends to perform better than brand. And direct response ads typically have a higher threshold to be an engagement. And so you may show as many of them as you had in the past, as many ads as you had in the past, but you may have a lower ad engagement number because there are fewer brand ads and there are more MAP ads or website click ads in their place. That's why you saw better performance from us in some of the Asia markets, where MAP tends to do better. It's why we had really successful campaigns like Dragon Blood for Rakuten (sic) [ Tencent ] in Japan and other things that involve MAP or app install ads."

So the -- as I said in my opening remarks, the milestone that we passed of rebuilding our ad server was pretty critical for us. We're really happy to put that work behind us. As we've been talking about, rebuilding that ad server allows us specifically to experiment a lot more and, thus, increase our development velocity because we can launch new products, get feedback from advertisers, evolve them very quickly, refine them and then get them to market. So everything has really been dependent upon that, including our experiments with direct response, starting with MAP. 
As you mentioned, we have finished our first pilot of MAP, and we're about to embark on our second. And we work very closely with our advertising customers to make sure that we are taking their feedback, that we're building something that is durable and excellent in the market, in constant iterating and evolving. A lot of this is really just a function of being able to move fast based on feedback and the performance we're seeing in the market. 
In regards to just general direct response and the road map, we've been focusing on improving measurement, we've been focused on improving prediction, and we're updating formats for advertisers. Prediction, we ran a series of experiments with App Card improvements. Super early, but we're seeing some great results there, improving our prediction models, already improving click installs for MAP advertisers. And also updating our formats, we launched a Video Carousel Card in beta, which has 2 to 6 swipeable images and videos. And we like the early results with the CTR of 60% and greater than 30% installs, impressions versus a single image control. 
And more importantly, our acquisition of CrossInstall is 60 people, who have been focused on direct response and MAP for some time. So we hope to really accelerate our work and the quality of our work through that. No change in timing on MAP. We're learning from the fly."

We think there's a world where commerce is complementary. You can imagine work around helping people manage payrolls as well, that we believe is complementary. 
So that's what we're looking for. We have a small team who is exploring our options. Obviously, we're hiring for those teams. But given the work that we've done now and finished on our ad server, given the progression of our road map on MAP and given the increased speed we're moving at in terms of our development velocity, we're now at a place where we can explore other ideas. And you will likely see some tests this year. 
And as we build anything, we want to work with the people that we're serving and make sure that we have a phenomenal experience before we share it.

So if you look at the trajectory over the course of Q2, you can imagine, April looked a lot like March as the world was largely sheltering in place. And the live events and product launches and other things that really resonate on Twitter for people and advertisers were really put to a stop. In May, we did see a gradual improvement. And June is really a couple of different time frames: There's the beginning of the month, which was dominated by the Black Lives Matters protest in the United States, when many brands chose to pause. And then there's the second part of the month. And so we gave that last 3 week time frame and mentioned that it was down 15% in terms of ad revenue year-over-year. But even within that time frame, we did see gradual recovery. It's hard to discern a straight line from a short time frame like that when there are so many things that are moving right now in the world. 
But we do feel like with sports coming back, whether it's baseball tonight or basketball next week or the EPL, which is already moving golf, which came back already, these are terrific, both audience opportunities for us as there's great conversation around these things on Twitter, but also sponsorship and advertising and content opportunities as the highlights for those events are terrific opportunities to bring content owners, advertisers and the people who watch them together on Twitter.

And so we intend for that to be the case here, but we're still working through all the details on the security issue, and we'll just keep people posted, as we have, on Twitter over the last couple of weeks as our work has unfolded. 
The second part of your question about lower quick-through rates. So this, just like the ad engagements that we talked about earlier, has a lot to do with the mix shift where our direct response road map is so important for so many reasons, and this is a really good example as to why, where you will see less brand advertising in an environment like this, more direct response advertising. And we're working really hard to make those formats even better than they are today to improve relevance. But people are still buying our MAP, our app install ads, they're still buying website click ads on Twitter, and sometimes they're buying more of them than they were before. And so those ads often have a higher threshold to be an engagement or to be a click than the brand ads do. And so you end up seeing similar amounts of ads, but the click-through rates or ad engagement rates would be lower. So this is really just about that mix shift. And that's why we saw some stronger performance in some of the markets that are more DR heavy like APAC than we did in the United States. Hope that helps."

And then if you look at Q2, we really held on to that significantly increased base people over the course of the quarter. They continue to come to Twitter to find out not just about COVID-19. We had 150 million people come to our COVID-19 resources as we worked hard to make sure that the right information was there and that we're pointing people towards trusted sources wherever they were in the world. And so we're really pleased that we're able to hold that base. 
And if we think about what drove this, a lot of it is the events and behaviors around the world, but it also was the product improvements. Because if we hadn't work hard to improve relevance on the Home time line, of the notifications, of our COVID-19 resources, people wouldn't have continued to come back to Twitter. And if we step back from the events that brought people to the service, we're confident that we still would have had a good quarter from a DAU perspective if it hadn't been for all of these events, but it's really hard to parse these things out. 
When we think about all the great product work that we talked about, that has accumulated and that will continue with only 4,000 topics and get 50 million people following a topic already, we feel like there's lots of work in front of us that we can do to continue to grow the base of people who've been using the service. When we look at engagement, remember, we still think that mDAU is going to be the best way to look at engagement because we want to be a daily resource for people. And so I'd point you to that generally. But when we look at other metrics and just think through things, we continue to feel good about what we see from an engagement perspective in how people are using the service, who are new to it versus those who have used it less frequently but are coming back again."

We think this is a huge opportunity for our platform, and it definitely has a lot of dimensions to it. As I pointed out earlier in the call and in my opening remarks, it's critical functionality that we have Topics around locations, for instance. Obviously, small businesses are more tied to locations, and any signal we have around that will help them. But generally, the more intuitive we make our revenue products, the more self-serve we make them, the easier it is for them to access and participate. 
Our self-serve channel for small and midsized businesses is relatively small right now, but we've had success in identifying and growing advertising dollars with many SMB advertisers. And we've been really encouraged by the growth we saw in Q2, though it is still pretty early, but we definitely believe in this opportunity and definitely going to invest forward in it."

On Topics, we've been really pleased with how having access to Topics impacts people's ability to find what they're looking for on Twitter. When you remove the hard work for people of finding the accounts that they should follow when they care about a sports team or a company or a political topic and you bring all of the conversations together for them, you can really improve their experience. We've been experimenting with including it in the onboarding process. We feel like this will be a big unlock in the onboarding process when we get it right. And the fact that 50 million people have already embraced this as we roll it out to more languages, as we roll out to more topics, as we refine the quality of the topics and the tweets in the topics, we feel like there's lots of room for us to continue to improve here. 
The same is true for Lists, where people can scroll and have different time lines tied to the different areas of interest that they may have. And Jack had mentioned over a year ago now that we felt like there was years of work for us on topics and interest as we orient the service around these things, and we still feel like there's lots of room in front of us. 
The second part of your question was around how we think about the signal that we have. So we've mentioned in the past that we feel like the opportunity to provide a more personalized experience to people on Twitter is -- it's really an opportunity for us more than it is a risk. And that may be different than you hear about from other people, and that's partly because of the approach that we've taken over time. And it also might be about some of the things where we see opportunity where you've seen us recently take action. So some examples of this are, in the last couple of weeks, many of you may have seen a prompt or we asked if you were comfortable if we showed you personalized ads. If you weren't seeing them, this is an example where we went back to people who are -- existing accounts and asked them for their permission to show them -- give them a more personalized experience. We feel like there's a lot of signal on Twitter, which we can better leverage than we do today to give people more personalized ads. And you see this when somebody is looking into a topic or event. We know an awful lot about them which we can better leverage than we do today. And some of that bears itself out when we provide better measurement to our MAP advertisers, as Jack talked about earlier, where we find that when we get people access to third-party measurement, which we did this past quarter, that they tend to spend more on Twitter than they otherwise would have. And so lots of opportunity there. And we're going to keep working on this in the coming quarters."

Is it winning you -- I don't want to say points. But I mean what's the conversation like in terms of what you've done versus what peers have done from political advertising and et cetera? 
And then two, for Ned, obviously, sports is coming back, which is great. I think you had mentioned that there were several categories, obviously, that it's sort of been problematic, that hurt you. I'm thinking like feature films not being released in theaters. But like what are the other missing categories or troubled categories that are still weighing on the growth as you think forward into Q3 and even into Q4 that we should be thinking about in terms of the timing of when they'd come back?

So we want to make sure that we are showing our commitment of service to the public conversation by our actions. And advertisers are definitely taking note as we talk with direct advertisers, as we talk with industry associations like ANA and WFA. We're hearing this resonate. And people are taking note of our differences and also, at the same time, seeing a lot of the opportunity on Twitter as we advance our road map. 
So we're going to continue to focus on our principles. We're going to continue to focus on taking the actions that we believe is important to maintain health. And we hope that others follow as well and that the industry sees that this work is important, and it's overdue, and it is meaningful."

When things paused in March and April, advertisers really started to go back and think about how they wanted to show up in this more challenging time and also how they wanted to show up when it returned. Content owners started to think about when things did come back, if there weren't fans in the stands, where they were going to recreate the stadium experience and how they were going to bring people into the events in a way that could be fulfilling for everybody, from the fans to the players. And people launching movies thought about how, whether it's Trolls or Hamilton, they were going to get people excited through a virtual watch party in a way where they could still give people a good experience and monetize their really valuable content. 
And so as people pivoted and got creative, we feel like we were a really big part of what they were able to do. PlayStation launching the PS5 is another great example of it; Salesforce with Work.com. And when these things happen and they have people have fewer choices, we found that Twitter was a big beneficiary of that. 
However, in an environment when there's more subdued economic activity, it just doesn't add up to as much advertising, and it perhaps comes in at different pricing than you've seen in other periods. When we look ahead and we think about events coming back, hopefully -- that would be great for so many reasons, of course. But when it does happen, we hope that we can, with a larger audience, with better revenue products, be an even more important part of those experiences. But I'd come back to the economic activity more because I feel like there's so much that happened this past quarter and how people adjusted to this environment. We've been an important part of that, that when things come back, we're going to try hard to hold on to what we gained as well as what we're really good at in helping these content partners before."

This is a combination of things from the comps from last year, from the particular ad campaigns that we saw as there were some big mobile game launches in Asia where we were really able to help advertisers. I mentioned the one for Tencent called Dragon Blood in Japan as an example. But there definitely were other ones in other markets as well. And also that these are more MAP and website click-heavy markets relative to the U.S., and so that helped our growth there as well. 
The trends over the course of the quarter, I think it would -- if you looked at different regions, I don't think it would surprise you.

Your second question was about DR, and can we get to where we need to be from a measurement perspective. We think we can, Justin. That's why we're working hard to come out with better formats and a better experience for advertisers. But this quarter is a great example where you saw a lot of under-the-hood work I mentioned, the improved measurement capabilities as a great example. Advertisers expect third-party measurement in order to be able to weigh the success of their campaign on one platform versus another. And this was a gap for us. And when we provide it to people, as you would expect, they spend more on Twitter. And so as we roll that out more broadly, as we continue to improve our ad ranking and prediction models, we're confident that we'll be able to deliver even better for these advertisers and that, that will show up over time.

A few comments from me and Ned before we take your questions. 
Last week was a really tough week for all of us at Twitter, and we feel terrible about the security incident that negatively affected the people we serve and their trust in us. Security doesn't have an end point. It's a constant iteration to stay steps ahead of adversaries. We fell behind, both in our protections against social engineering of our employees and restrictions on our internal tools. And for that, I apologize on behalf of our company. 
We moved quickly to lock down and fix and sought to be transparent and frequent in our updates to the public. We will continue to go above and beyond here as we continue to secure our systems and work with external firms and law enforcement. 
I'll now turn to our results from the quarter. We saw tremendous growth in audience and engagement, growing mDAU to 186 million, a 34% year-over-year increase, our highest reported growth rate. People continue to come to Twitter to learn about and participate in conversations focused on systemic racism and Black Lives Matter, COVID-19, and the reopening and reclosing of economies all around the world. At the same time, we grew the number of topics people can follow to more than 4,000, including public health information, sports, music and local news, enabling you to follow cities like St. Louis and New Orleans. And now over 50 million people follow Topics, which we continue to believe is the best way to experience the power of Twitter with very little effort required. 
Total revenue was $683 million in Q2, down 19% year-over-year. While we continue to see headwinds from lower global advertising demand due to COVID and civil unrest, we've made strong progress on our top revenue product priorities, and we saw improvement in advertiser demand over the course of the quarter. And we passed a major milestone as we completed our ad server rebuild to support faster product development, increase our stability and help scale our advertising business. We also made progress on our direct response road map by improving measurement, prediction and our ad formats portfolio. 
We acquired CrossInstall, a team of 60 people, to help accelerate our direct response initiatives. And as you all saw from our job postings and we'll see from future experiments, we're in the early stages of exploring other potential revenue opportunities to complement our advertising business. 
Lastly, I want to thank our teams for their incredible dedication and effort during this time. While it's trying for all of us, we continue to see the strength of our service, the incredible potential of our business and the importance of our purpose to serve the public conversation. We aim to build the public conversation layer of the Internet and are reminded daily why it's so critical to get it right and accessible to all.

Stepping back, there are real bright spots. Certain markets in Asia were actually up year-over-year in Q2. We saw substantive signs of improvement around the globe, and we're even better positioned to deliver for advertisers when the live events and product launches that bring many people and advertisers to Twitter return. I know if I'm still awake tonight, I'll be watching the opening night Giants-Dodgers game and following along on Twitter. 
Brands have found innovative ways to join in on the conversation and connect with their customers despite the pandemic. For example, PlayStation leveraged an 89% increase in video game conversation on Twitter to build interest and awareness for the PS5. Their successful takeover campaign with a Branded Emoji, a Promoted Trend Spotlight and a First View resulted in PlayStation being the top global trend with over 1 million mentions over 2 days and a 4x higher engagement rate than the benchmark. 
We continue to amplify conversations around live events. In Q2, we held virtual watch parties for The Last Dance, the Global Citizen livestream of The Together at Home concert for the WHO and numerous movie and product launches as people and partners pivoted to seek virtual connections when physical connections were not possible. These have been valuable for our audience as well as content and advertising partners. 
Let me also cover a couple of modeling things where you may have questions. You may have also noted a large noncash loss related to a valuation allowance for a deferred tax asset. This reverses a gain that we took last year. It's related to our ability to use some of our international deferred tax assets in the near future. We're confident that when the current operating environment turns around, we'll eventually be able to use these deferred tax assets. 
Total costs and expenses grew 5% to $807 million. This was lower than we expected. I want to be clear that this is not the go-forward expense growth rate you should expect as we're adapting to this operating environment and intend to hire more people and invest more to improve our revenue products and grow our audience. We expect expenses in Q3 to grow 10% or more and to grow CapEx, but the environment remains uncertain. 
With that, we're ready to take your questions. Operator?"

But given the security and the hack issues last quarter, just to talk about whether the spend you have, the 5% to 10% next quarter is enough to handle what's obviously very important to your platform. 
And then secondly, could you just talk about the level of engagement you're seeing? That user growth was really impressive. It's hard for us maybe externally to track what's happening to engagement. The impression growth was very limited, but that's probably an ads issue. So just talk about whether you really are -- how can we tell that engagement is really growing as well as user growth?"

We continue to invest in constant refinements specifically around relevance. We've talked for some time about the relevance of the time line and notifications. We're bringing more and more of that relevance to Search, to Explore and, most importantly for the future, Topics. So as I mentioned in the opening remarks, there's a really powerful experience around following Topics on Twitter. And we notably saw over 50 million accounts now follow Topics. We have over 4,000 topics to follow, including local topics, and this includes local news. And that just opens an entirely new view of what Twitter has to offer to complement why people come to Twitter in the first place, especially during these times, to find out around COVID or Black Lives Matter and civil unrest happening around the world. So our goal here in terms of engagement is people may come in for one reason. We want to show them everything else Twitter has to offer, and we're seeing that in the numbers as well and I think Topics will continue to play a massive role. But the investment of relevance at its core is critical. And that's not just for our consumer product but also for our advertising stack as well and specifically around how we think about MAP going forward. 
I'll let Ned talk about how we think about the investment."

Mark, a couple of things to just add there on investment and how we want to move forward. We mentioned in the letter and in my opening remarks that we'd like to grow expenses faster than we did in Q2. So that 5% reflects both decisions that we've made to be thoughtful about where we invest but also a more constrained hiring environment, where we're still adjusting to hiring and onboarding people in this environment where some of the events and things where we'd like to be spending money aren't necessarily happening. So as the economy opens up but also to the extent it doesn't, we are getting better at hiring and onboarding people in this environment. So we do want to be investing further. 
And we're confident that when Twitter does have a more profitable business, it's on a higher revenue because we've invested to continue to grow our audience and to continue to improve our revenue products and not because we've cut our way to a more profitable business. 
In terms of engagement, I'd just add I think you're talking about the ad engagements, which were up 3% year-over-year. And remember, that ad engagement number is a combination of a bunch of different types of ad formats where the thresholds to be called an engagement might be different. For some, it's a click; for others, it's a view. And in an environment like the one we're in today, this is a powerful reminder that direct response tends to perform better than brand. And direct response ads typically have a higher threshold to be an engagement. And so you may show as many of them as you had in the past, as many ads as you had in the past, but you may have a lower ad engagement number because there are fewer brand ads and there are more MAP ads or website click ads in their place. That's why you saw better performance from us in some of the Asia markets, where MAP tends to do better. It's why we had really successful campaigns like Dragon Blood for Rakuten (sic) [ Tencent ] in Japan and other things that involve MAP or app install ads."

So the -- as I said in my opening remarks, the milestone that we passed of rebuilding our ad server was pretty critical for us. We're really happy to put that work behind us. As we've been talking about, rebuilding that ad server allows us specifically to experiment a lot more and, thus, increase our development velocity because we can launch new products, get feedback from advertisers, evolve them very quickly, refine them and then get them to market. So everything has really been dependent upon that, including our experiments with direct response, starting with MAP. 
As you mentioned, we have finished our first pilot of MAP, and we're about to embark on our second. And we work very closely with our advertising customers to make sure that we are taking their feedback, that we're building something that is durable and excellent in the market, in constant iterating and evolving. A lot of this is really just a function of being able to move fast based on feedback and the performance we're seeing in the market. 
In regards to just general direct response and the road map, we've been focusing on improving measurement, we've been focused on improving prediction, and we're updating formats for advertisers. Prediction, we ran a series of experiments with App Card improvements. Super early, but we're seeing some great results there, improving our prediction models, already improving click installs for MAP advertisers. And also updating our formats, we launched a Video Carousel Card in beta, which has 2 to 6 swipeable images and videos. And we like the early results with the CTR of 60% and greater than 30% installs, impressions versus a single image control. 
And more importantly, our acquisition of CrossInstall is 60 people, who have been focused on direct response and MAP for some time. So we hope to really accelerate our work and the quality of our work through that. No change in timing on MAP. We're learning from the fly."

But most importantly, we want to make sure that any new line of revenue is complementary to our advertising business. We do think there's a world where subscription is complementary. We think there's a world where commerce is complementary. You can imagine work around helping people manage payrolls as well, that we believe is complementary. 
So that's what we're looking for. We have a small team who is exploring our options. Obviously, we're hiring for those teams. But given the work that we've done now and finished on our ad server, given the progression of our road map on MAP and given the increased speed we're moving at in terms of our development velocity, we're now at a place where we can explore other ideas. And you will likely see some tests this year. 
And as we build anything, we want to work with the people that we're serving and make sure that we have a phenomenal experience before we share it. But right now, our #1 priority is making sure that our MAP road map is strong and moving fast, and that brings us to a greater performance road map as well."

So if you look at the trajectory over the course of Q2, you can imagine, April looked a lot like March as the world was largely sheltering in place. And the live events and product launches and other things that really resonate on Twitter for people and advertisers were really put to a stop. In May, we did see a gradual improvement. And June is really a couple of different time frames: There's the beginning of the month, which was dominated by the Black Lives Matters protest in the United States, when many brands chose to pause. And then there's the second part of the month. And so we gave that last 3 week time frame and mentioned that it was down 15% in terms of ad revenue year-over-year. But even within that time frame, we did see gradual recovery. It's hard to discern a straight line from a short time frame like that when there are so many things that are moving right now in the world. 
But we do feel like with sports coming back, whether it's baseball tonight or basketball next week or the EPL, which is already moving golf, which came back already, these are terrific, both audience opportunities for us as there's great conversation around these things on Twitter, but also sponsorship and advertising and content opportunities as the highlights for those events are terrific opportunities to bring content owners, advertisers and the people who watch them together on Twitter.

And so we intend for that to be the case here, but we're still working through all the details on the security issue, and we'll just keep people posted, as we have, on Twitter over the last couple of weeks as our work has unfolded. 
The second part of your question about lower quick-through rates. So this, just like the ad engagements that we talked about earlier, has a lot to do with the mix shift where our direct response road map is so important for so many reasons, and this is a really good example as to why, where you will see less brand advertising in an environment like this, more direct response advertising. And we're working really hard to make those formats even better than they are today to improve relevance. But people are still buying our MAP, our app install ads, they're still buying website click ads on Twitter, and sometimes they're buying more of them than they were before. And so those ads often have a higher threshold to be an engagement or to be a click than the brand ads do. And so you end up seeing similar amounts of ads, but the click-through rates or ad engagement rates would be lower. So this is really just about that mix shift. And that's why we saw some stronger performance in some of the markets that are more DR heavy like APAC than we did in the United States. Hope that helps."

So first, if you just think about the trajectory in the first half of the year, we saw a surge in usage in March as people's habits changed as they were sheltering in place all around the world, but also as there was news that they really wanted to learn more about around COVID-19. 
And then if you look at Q2, we really held on to that significantly increased base people over the course of the quarter. They continue to come to Twitter to find out not just about COVID-19. We had 150 million people come to our COVID-19 resources as we worked hard to make sure that the right information was there and that we're pointing people towards trusted sources wherever they were in the world. And so we're really pleased that we're able to hold that base. 
And if we think about what drove this, a lot of it is the events and behaviors around the world, but it also was the product improvements. Because if we hadn't work hard to improve relevance on the Home time line, of the notifications, of our COVID-19 resources, people wouldn't have continued to come back to Twitter. And if we step back from the events that brought people to the service, we're confident that we still would have had a good quarter from a DAU perspective if it hadn't been for all of these events, but it's really hard to parse these things out. 
When we think about all the great product work that we talked about, that has accumulated and that will continue with only 4,000 topics and get 50 million people following a topic already, we feel like there's lots of work in front of us that we can do to continue to grow the base of people who've been using the service. When we look at engagement, remember, we still think that mDAU is going to be the best way to look at engagement because we want to be a daily resource for people. And so I'd point you to that generally.

On Topics, we've been really pleased with how having access to Topics impacts people's ability to find what they're looking for on Twitter. When you remove the hard work for people of finding the accounts that they should follow when they care about a sports team or a company or a political topic and you bring all of the conversations together for them, you can really improve their experience. We've been experimenting with including it in the onboarding process. We feel like this will be a big unlock in the onboarding process when we get it right. And the fact that 50 million people have already embraced this as we roll it out to more languages, as we roll out to more topics, as we refine the quality of the topics and the tweets in the topics, we feel like there's lots of room for us to continue to improve here. 
The same is true for Lists, where people can scroll and have different time lines tied to the different areas of interest that they may have. And Jack had mentioned over a year ago now that we felt like there was years of work for us on topics and interest as we orient the service around these things, and we still feel like there's lots of room in front of us. 
The second part of your question was around how we think about the signal that we have. So we've mentioned in the past that we feel like the opportunity to provide a more personalized experience to people on Twitter is -- it's really an opportunity for us more than it is a risk. And that may be different than you hear about from other people, and that's partly because of the approach that we've taken over time. And it also might be about some of the things where we see opportunity where you've seen us recently take action. So some examples of this are, in the last couple of weeks, many of you may have seen a prompt or we asked if you were comfortable if we showed you personalized ads. If you weren't seeing them, this is an example where we went back to people who are -- existing accounts and asked them for their permission to show them -- give them a more personalized experience. We feel like there's a lot of signal on Twitter, which we can better leverage than we do today to give people more personalized ads. And you see this when somebody is looking into a topic or event. We know an awful lot about them which we can better leverage than we do today. And some of that bears itself out when we provide better measurement to our MAP advertisers, as Jack talked about earlier, where we find that when we get people access to third-party measurement, which we did this past quarter, that they tend to spend more on Twitter than they otherwise would have. And so lots of opportunity there. And we're going to keep working on this in the coming quarters."

Is it winning you -- I don't want to say points. But I mean what's the conversation like in terms of what you've done versus what peers have done from political advertising and et cetera? 
And then two, for Ned, obviously, sports is coming back, which is great. I think you had mentioned that there were several categories, obviously, that it's sort of been problematic, that hurt you. I'm thinking like feature films not being released in theaters. But like what are the other missing categories or troubled categories that are still weighing on the growth as you think forward into Q3 and even into Q4 that we should be thinking about in terms of the timing of when they'd come back? Those are the 2 major questions."

We were the first to ban political ads with the principle of political reach should be earned and not paid for. We're the first to enforce our policies on high-profile tweets from world leaders. And this week, we took down a number of accounts belonging to groups or campaigns associated with QAnon as we found coordinated attacks by those accounts. So we want to make sure that we are showing our commitment of service to the public conversation by our actions. And advertisers are definitely taking note as we talk with direct advertisers, as we talk with industry associations like ANA and WFA. We're hearing this resonate. And people are taking note of our differences and also, at the same time, seeing a lot of the opportunity on Twitter as we advance our road map. 
So we're going to continue to focus on our principles. We're going to continue to focus on taking the actions that we believe is important to maintain health. And we hope that others follow as well and that the industry sees that this work is important, and it's overdue, and it is meaningful."

When things paused in March and April, advertisers really started to go back and think about how they wanted to show up in this more challenging time and also how they wanted to show up when it returned. Content owners started to think about when things did come back, if there weren't fans in the stands, where they were going to recreate the stadium experience and how they were going to bring people into the events in a way that could be fulfilling for everybody, from the fans to the players. And people launching movies thought about how, whether it's Trolls or Hamilton, they were going to get people excited through a virtual watch party in a way where they could still give people a good experience and monetize their really valuable content. 
And so as people pivoted and got creative, we feel like we were a really big part of what they were able to do. PlayStation launching the PS5 is another great example of it; Salesforce with Work.com. And when these things happen and they have people have fewer choices, we found that Twitter was a big beneficiary of that. 
However, in an environment when there's more subdued economic activity, it just doesn't add up to as much advertising, and it perhaps comes in at different pricing than you've seen in other periods. When we look ahead and we think about events coming back, hopefully -- that would be great for so many reasons, of course. But when it does happen, we hope that we can, with a larger audience, with better revenue products, be an even more important part of those experiences. But I'd come back to the economic activity more because I feel like there's so much that happened this past quarter and how people adjusted to this environment. We've been an important part of that, that when things come back, we're going to try hard to hold on to what we gained as well as what we're really good at in helping these content partners before."

First, on the regions, I mentioned that we saw certain markets in APAC that were up year-over-year. This is a combination of things from the comps from last year, from the particular ad campaigns that we saw as there were some big mobile game launches in Asia where we were really able to help advertisers. I mentioned the one for Tencent called Dragon Blood in Japan as an example. But there definitely were other ones in other markets as well. And also that these are more MAP and website click-heavy markets relative to the U.S., and so that helped our growth there as well. 
The trends over the course of the quarter, I think it would -- if you looked at different regions, I don't think it would surprise you.

Just when you step back from the activity you see from advertisers and the conversation that's going on around them right now, we feel really good about the way that we continue to show up with the people who use our service, with advertisers, with content partners, with human rights groups.

Your second question was about DR, and can we get to where we need to be from a measurement perspective. We think we can, Justin. That's why we're working hard to come out with better formats and a better experience for advertisers. But this quarter is a great example where you saw a lot of under-the-hood work I mentioned, the improved measurement capabilities as a great example. Advertisers expect third-party measurement in order to be able to weigh the success of their campaign on one platform versus another. And this was a gap for us. And when we provide it to people, as you would expect, they spend more on Twitter. And so as we roll that out more broadly, as we continue to improve our ad ranking and prediction models, we're confident that we'll be able to deliver even better for these advertisers and that, that will show up over time. But we feel like there's so much great signal, some of which we use today, but other things that we don't yet use around people, how people are using the service but also as we get permission from them, to make sure that we're using the signal they give us in the best ways possible.

As you can see from our results, our hard work positions Twitter to deliver significant revenue improvement in Q3. We saw strength throughout the quarter, as advertisers around the world significantly increased their investment on Twitter, seeking to engage our much larger audience around their turn of events and increased or delayed product launches. Our revenue product improvements are driving better ROI as businesses accelerate their digital spend and the online delivery of products and services. 
In the last 3 weeks of Q3, ad revenue was up 19% year-over-year with fairly consistent daily growth rates during that period. That's a significant improvement from the 15% year-over-year decrease that we saw in the last 3 weeks of Q2 and perhaps a good demonstration of how we can perform when so many events and product launches, not all of which typically fall in that window, are driving more people and advertisers to Twitter. 
As you know, we made revenue durability our highest priority this year, and we're beginning to see the early results. With the ad server rebuild complete, we're moving faster and delivering more. We made progress on our brand and direct response products in Q3 with updated ad formats, improved measurement and better prediction. We also continue to iterate on our revamped MAP offering and have decided to delay general availability into 2021 when we can integrate expected new industry standard mobile privacy requirements. 
Audience and engagement trends were also positive in Q3. There are 42 million more mDAU than there were at this time last year. Remember, we saw a tremendous spike towards the tail end of Q1 due to COVID. Ongoing impacts from product improvements have allowed us to retain more of those new and reactivated accounts than we have in previous periods, resulting in 29% year-over-year increase in mDAU in Q3, which is up 1 million sequentially. To see such a big surge in March and to deliver value to these people on a daily basis, such that we are retaining them better, gives us increased confidence in our consumer product efforts and in our road map. 
As we look ahead to Q4, there's a lot to navigate and much of it is unique to 2020. On the positive side, October looks a lot like September, with events and product launches coming back. And we're benefiting from all of the hard work we've done to make Twitter a must buy for advertisers looking to launch new products and services and to connect with what's happening. The strength and timing of the holiday shopping season is also likely to play out differently this year than it has historically, with the buying season that may be accelerated and even more digital in terms of advertising and delivery of goods and services than ever before. 
As we approach the U.S. election, however, it's hard to predict how advertiser behavior can play out. In Q2, many brands slowed or paused spend in reaction to U.S. civil unrest, only to increase spend relatively quickly thereafter in an effort to catch up. As we look ahead, the periods surrounding the U.S. election is somewhat uncertain, but we have no reason to believe that September's revenue trends can't continue or even improve outside of the election-related window. 
We remain confident that our larger audience, coupled with ongoing revenue product improvements, new events and product launches and the tendency of advertisers to respond positively to the choices we've made as we've grown the service can drive great outcomes over time. 
Given improving business conditions, we also intend to continue investing in our most important work, and we expect total GAAP cost and expenses to grow closer to 20% year-over-year in Q4. Remember that was our intention for the full year before the pandemic. We expect stock-based compensation to be relatively flat sequentially, and we expect CapEx to remain over $250 million in Q4 as a result of our ongoing data center buildout. 
We want to thank everyone at Twitter for their incredible dedication and resilience. We continue to see the value of our service, the incredible potential of our business and the importance of our purpose to serve the public conversation. 
Finally, as I'm sure you all saw, we announced our Analyst Day to be held on February 25, 2021. This is our first Analyst Day in many years, and we look forward to discussing our work in more detail. Don't worry, it will all be virtual.

DR is the larger and faster-growing part of the digital advertising TAM. And although we've got website clicks and app install ads today, and that actually grew faster this quarter than overall ad, albeit against easier comps. We know that there is work for us to do to move all the way down the funnel to give advertisers, to just reach their customers and sell something to them on Twitter. And we want to stay focused on getting all the way through that road map over time. 
When we think about the opportunities for Twitter, remember, we've talked in the past a bunch about where we feel like there's a lot of signal that we historically haven't leveraged that we have opportunity to put to use for the benefit of people on Twitter and for advertisers. You noticed that we reprompted people over the summer to help them understand the benefits of personalization. The onboarding flow is different than it has been historically to help people understand the benefits of it. And some of the changes coming to the industry may very well level the playing field around personalization and the way the device IDs get to be used on iOS devices as a start in -- when Apple rolls it out early in the year. 
When -- to the second part of your question, on how much of the strength came from other things. It's hard to unpack different components of our strength from Q3. When we step back from that, we think, larger audience, better revenue products, the events and product launches that brought people and advertisers to Twitter. But also, I think, to your point, the decisions that we make, how we make them, how we communicate them, we think, are making it easier and easier for advertisers to choose Twitter with their next dollar than to put it somewhere else."

So advertisers [indiscernible] Twitter and, in general, continues to be really strong. And we think about the ad load, it's not a term that you hear us talk about a lot because we still feel more demand constrained than supply constrained, both as we continue to improve our revenue products and deliver better relevance, better ad formats as we think about parts of the surface area of Twitter that we haven't historically monetized as well and the opportunity to do a better job of that. 
We worked hard this quarter and had some success around reducing click leakage and getting more impressions for advertisers around the really popular first view advertising formats. And so a lot of the stuff has driven success for advertisers but doesn't play out with more ad load, it just plays out with better usage of what people are seeing today. So that will move around from one season to another, from one geography to another, but we still feel more demand constrained than supply constrained. 
The first part of your question was around the ad server rebuild. And we feel really good about the work that we finished there and how we can benefit from it in 2 different ways. The first is that we're able to bring the people who are working on some of that and take them to other teams. An example is the small and medium-sized business work that we've long talked about but haven't been able to prioritize yet. And we now have people working on the opportunity to help small businesses reach their customers in a more compelling way on Twitter than we have historically. Second is that we're just able to test more things at the same time and move faster as a result. Our teams don't need to ask other teams to pause in order to see their tests go through, where we're able to continue to attract and retain great engineers because they're able to work on new technology."

So we've long said that there's a signal that we're not leveraging the way that we can. It couldn't be that somebody is in an event or topic specific time line, and we can show them an ad that's relevant to that event that we may not have known enough about to do that if they were in their own timeline or we may not have been able to help the advertiser understand that this is a great place to reach their customer because we didn't have the event specific time line. And we didn't have 70 million accounts following a topic that pointed them to those time lines. 
So we feel like there's a lot that we historically just haven't used that has been there. And then there's also a more signal that we have access to today because of reprompting people to help them understand the benefit of personalization because of the way that the onboarding flow works now, where people understand the benefits of it with more people who can see personalized ads, there just is more data available to us, and that helps us refine our models and find similarities so that we can show compelling ads to people as well.

I guess kind of just the high-level question of like what do you need to do to get to 50 million to 100 million mDAUs in the U.S.? Is it product changes? Is it education of consumers? Like how do you close that gap? Because it just seems like there's so many people that touch your service on a monthly basis. But don't use it every day.

One of the things that we're excited about and that we saw during the COVID quarantines and also during the election is now that we do have topics to follow, people are coming for one reason and staying because they find relevant topics that are interesting to them. 
As we continue to expand those as we continue to prompt those earlier in the experience such as onboarding, I think that helps us dramatically. And I think it just further shows like all the conversations that are possible on Twitter. So it's really a question of like how do we show up more of the breadth, how do we give people to very niche interest in Topics, which tend to do extremely well.

We had fairly consistent daily growth",586,"Deepa, good questions there. So first, let me talk about the fourth quarter. Remember, we were up 19% year-over-year in ads in the last 3 weeks of Q3, and we grew our ads revenue 44% sequentially in the third quarter. We had fairly consistent daily growth rates during that last 3 weeks of the quarter, which gives you a sense for how we can operate and deliver for advertisers when events and topics are coming back when we've got a larger audience and where we're making it easy for advertisers to put their next dollar to work on Twitter as opposed to somewhere else. 
Let me just talk about Q4, where, remember, October looks a lot like September in terms of events coming back and things that are sometimes delayed from previous periods. Product launches coming back, some of which were delayed and others in which were planned, but where you've also got this secular shift where more of it is happening online, both the advertising because of what's happening on linear TV and because people aren't in stadiums and the delivery of goods and services. And so all of that I think, plays out to our benefit, and I think is why October has a similar setup at September. 
November is a little harder to predict because of the election. But I think what we learned in November around the Black Lives Matter movement in the United States is that when advertisers do choose to pause or slow down because there's a more important discussion happening on our service that when they come back, they often spend through that budget that they had set aside for Twitter because their objectives and their reach goals haven't changed. And then you got December where you've got probably holiday buying season that could play out earlier and different and more digital than they have in the past, which also hopefully creates a good setup for Twitter as well. So we'll work hard to deliver against all those opportunities, recognizing that November is a little harder to predict than the other periods are. 
And the second part of your question around COVID we want to focus really hard on the things that we can control. And what we can do around our coat and to the extent people find themselves or economies closing down a little more is we want to make sure that people can find what they're looking for on Twitter, whether it's here on COVID or something else. We want to continue our focus on topics and health because when we do that, just like that group of people that came to us in March when the world largely went to shelter in place, we proved that we could retain that cohort better than we had previous ones. And so we feel good about that as an indicator of what we might be able to do, should things play out in the future where we're in the unfortunate situation where economies are shutting down again. 
And in terms of advertiser sentiment, I think advertisers have learned a lot since March. They've thought about how they want to show up and adapt quickly to this environment. And there are a lot of things about the fourth quarter that are really important to them, and we expect them to continue to show up through any environment. But the way that they choose to do that and exactly how they do it, we all have to wait and see."

As much as we would all like to see that happen every quarter, and then maybe what some of you have had modeled, it also may not be how things play out as a pretty unique time in the world. The great news is that we're doing a better job of retaining those new and reactivated accounts due to the ongoing product improvements that Jack went through earlier. 
On the sequential increase, as I said, we'd all like to have that kind of surge all the time, but it's just not going to happen every quarter. We continue to have a healthy top of funnel in the third quarter. We're pleased with the ad backs that we're getting. And as the conversation around the pandemic, around topics and events or on politics and other things come and go, these numbers are going to vary. But we remain focused on the learning and validation of our strategy that's demonstrated by that better retention of that group that came to us in March. 
Let's talk about Q4 for a second. So Heath, as we look ahead, the fourth quarter is typically seasonally slower for us in terms of mDAU. But remember, with the increased activity around the U.S. election, which does not happen than midterm is, and you think about all the great product work that we've done to make sure that we can help people when they do come to Twitter.

But the second is that Apple has delayed the IDFA changes that they're going to make to iOS 14 into Q1. And we need to wait and hear from them the specifics and think about how we want to adjust and advertisers and other ad platforms and others that are on the ecosystem will have to [indiscernible]. And so it's too early to predict what we hear from them, how we choose to react to it, how the rest of the ecosystem does, but that will be a key component of how this all plays out. 
I do want to take a step back to our MAP and remind you that although we'll have to wait until next year for the revamped version of the product, we continue to make improvement consistently here that we feel really good about. I want to call it a couple of them. One is that remember, we took away third-party measurement in the third quarter of last year for MAP advertisers. We now have hundreds of advertisers who have it and with third-party measurement, they're spending 30% more. So we're not waiting for this fully revamped version to roll out important features. We are doing other improvements such as the Carousel data that we've got of that MAP format. And some other things that we feel really good about underneath the surface that are driving results around MAP and causing advertisers to still invest more with us while we're waiting for that revamp product to come out sometime next year. 
Your second question around Q4 and the work we've done, we feel really good about the work we've done to help advertisers deliver in what should be a Q4 holiday season, unlike others that we've seen historically. And I went through a little bit in detail earlier, but I know there's a lot going on today, but I won't belabor the point here."

These are both engagement opportunities for us, to bring an audience together that otherwise wouldn't be able to interact. They are opportunities for our content partners and their significant advertising opportunities as well. 
A lot of these things both have pre-roll in front of them.

As you can see from our results, our hard work positioned Twitter to deliver significant revenue improvement in Q3. We saw strength throughout the quarter, as advertisers around the world significantly increased the",755,"Thanks, Jack. Good afternoon, everyone. As you can see from our results, our hard work positioned Twitter to deliver significant revenue improvement in Q3. We saw strength throughout the quarter, as advertisers around the world significantly increased their investment on Twitter, seeking to engage our much larger audience around their turn of events and increased or delayed product launches. Our revenue product improvements are driving better ROI as businesses accelerate their digital spend and the online delivery of products and services.  
In the last 3 weeks of Q3, ad revenue was up 19% year-over-year with fairly consistent daily growth rates during that period. That's a significant improvement from the 15% year-over-year decrease that we saw in the last 3 weeks of Q2 and perhaps a good demonstration of how we can perform when so many events and product launches, not all of which typically fall in that window, are driving more people and advertisers to Twitter.  
As you know, we made revenue durability our highest priority this year, and we're beginning to see the early results. With the ad server rebuild complete, we're moving faster and delivering more. We made progress on our brand and direct response products in Q3 with updated ad formats, improved measurement and better prediction. We also continue to iterate on our revamped MAP offering and have decided to delay general availability into 2021 when we can integrate expected new industry standard mobile privacy requirements.  
Audience and engagement trends were also positive in Q3. There are 42 million more mDAU than there were at this time last year. Remember, we saw a tremendous spike towards the tail end of Q1 due to COVID. Ongoing impacts from product improvements have allowed us to retain more of those new and reactivated accounts than we have in previous periods, resulting in 29% year-over-year increase in mDAU in Q3, which is up 1 million sequentially. To see such a big surge in March and to deliver value to these people on a daily basis, such that we are retaining them better, gives us increased confidence in our consumer product efforts and in our road map.  
As we look ahead to Q4, there's a lot to navigate, and much of it is unique to 2020. On the positive side, October looks a lot like September, with events and product launches coming back. And we're benefiting from all of the hard work we've done to make Twitter a must buy for advertisers looking to launch new products and services and to connect with what's happening. The strength and timing of the holiday shopping season is also likely to play out differently this year than it has historically, with the buying season that may be accelerated and even more digital in terms of advertising and delivery of goods and services than ever before.  
As we approach the U.S. election, however, it's hard to predict how advertiser behavior can play out. In Q2, many brands slowed or paused spend in reaction to U.S. civil unrest, only to increase spend relatively quickly thereafter in an effort to catch up. As we look ahead, the periods surrounding the U.S. election is somewhat uncertain, but we have no reason to believe that September's revenue trends can't continue or even improve outside of the election-related window.  
We remain confident that our larger audience, coupled with ongoing revenue product improvements, new events and product launches and the tendency of advertisers to respond positively to the choices we've made as we've grown the service, can drive great outcomes over time.  
Given improving business conditions, we also intend to continue investing in our most important work, and we expect total GAAP cost and expenses to grow closer to 20% year-over-year in Q4. Remember that was our intention for the full year before the pandemic. We expect stock-based compensation to be relatively flat sequentially, and we expect CapEx to remain over $250 million in Q4 as a result of our ongoing data center build-out.  
We want to thank everyone at Twitter for their incredible dedication and resilience. We continue to see the value of our service, the incredible potential of our business and the importance of our purpose to serve the public conversation.  
Finally, as I'm sure you all saw, we announced our Analyst Day to be held on February 25, 2021. This is our first Analyst Day in many years, and we look forward to discussing our work in more detail. Don't worry, it will all be virtual.

And it sounds like from your commentary, you feel pretty good about the outlook, absent the election and other kind of idiosyncrasies with the holiday.

So when we think about the work we've been doing on our direct response road map, it's important to step back and understand how important it is. DR is the larger and faster-growing part of the digital advertising TAM. And although we've got website clicks and app install ads today, and that actually grew faster this quarter than overall ad, albeit against easier comps. But we know that there is work for us to do to move all the way down the funnel to give advertisers to just reach their customers and sell something to them on Twitter. And we want to stay focused on getting all the way through that road map over time.  
When we think about the opportunities for Twitter, remember, we've talked in the past a bunch about where we feel like there's a lot of signal that we historically haven't leveraged that we have opportunity to put to use for the benefit of people on Twitter and for advertisers. You noticed that we reprompted people over the summer to help them understand the benefits of personalization. The onboarding flow is different than it has been historically to help people understand the benefits of it. And some of the changes coming to the industry may very well level the playing field around personalization and the way the device IDs get to be used on iOS devices as a start in -- when Apple rolls it out early in the year.  
When -- to the second part of your question on how much of the strength came from other things. It's hard to unpack different components of our strength from Q3. When we step back from that, we think larger audience, better revenue products, the events and product launches that brought people and advertisers to Twitter but also, I think, to your point, the decisions that we make, how we make them, how we communicate them, we think, are making it easier and easier for advertisers to choose Twitter with their next dollar than to put it somewhere else."

So advertisers spending at Twitter and, in general, continues to be really strong. And when we think about the ad load, it's not a term that you hear us talk about a lot because we still feel more demand constrained than supply constrained, both as we continue to improve our revenue products and deliver better relevance, better ad formats, as we think about parts of the surface area of Twitter that we haven't historically monetized as well and the opportunity to do a better job of that.  
We worked hard this quarter and had some success around reducing click leakage and getting more impressions for advertisers around the really popular first view advertising formats. And so a lot of the stuff has driven success for advertisers but doesn't play out with more ad load, it just plays out with better usage of what people are seeing today. So that will move around from one season to another, from one geography to another, but we still feel more demand constrained than supply constrained.  
The first part of your question was around the ad server rebuild. And we feel really good about the work that we finished there and how we can benefit from it in 2 different ways. The first is that we're able to bring the people who are working on some of that and take them to other teams. An example is the small and medium-sized business work that we've long talked about but haven't been able to prioritize yet. And we now have people working on the opportunity to help small businesses reach their customers in a more compelling way on Twitter than we have historically. 
Second is that we're just able to test more things at the same time and move faster as a result. Our teams don't need to ask other teams to pause in order to see their tests go through. We're able to continue to attract and retain great engineers because they're able to work on new technology."

So we've long said that there's a signal that we're not leveraging the way that we can. It couldn't be that somebody is in an event or topic-specific time line, and we can show them an ad that's relevant to that event that we may not have known enough about to do that if they were in their own timeline or we may not have been able to help the advertiser understand that this is a great place to reach their customer because we didn't have the event-specific time line. And we didn't have 70 million accounts following a topic that pointed them to those time lines. 
So we feel like there's a lot that we historically just haven't used that has been there.

As Ned said, we saw 70 million accounts followed Topics, which is up 40% quarter-over-quarter. And we now have over 5,000 topics and interest, which is over -- which is up 25% quarter-over-quarter. 
All this gives us much stronger signal because it's much more direct intent. So not only does it help the experience for the individual, but also it should give a stronger signal into our business as well, but it provides a greater surface area for us to really improve so much about our offering."

I'm sure that DAUs versus MAUss is probably still less than half. 
I guess kind of just the high-level question of like what do you need to do to get to 50 million to 100 million mDAUs in the U.S.? Like is it product changes? Is it education of consumers? Like how do you close that gap? Because it just seems like there's so many people that touch your service on a monthly basis. But don't use it every day. And obviously, it all feeds into a larger revenue opportunity, but I'm just curious like how you get that -- those user growth.

One of the things that we're excited about and that we saw during the COVID quarantines and also during the election is now that we do have topics to follow, people are coming for one reason and staying because they find relevant topics that are interesting to them. 
As we continue to expand those, as we continue to prompt those earlier in the experience such as onboarding, I think that helps us dramatically. And I think it just further shows like all the conversations that are possible on Twitter. So it's really a question of like how do we show more of the breadth and how do we get people to very niche interest in Topics, which tend to do extremely well, and how do we bring it earlier in the customer experience."

When we are still making the experience of finding Topics that are better, when we're still making the Topics better and better, both the quantity of them and then the quality of the tweets that you see. 
So for example, today, there are 65 cashtags that one can follow. Those really weren't out there just a couple of months ago, and we're watching how people interact with those, the dollar sign ticker, so that we could make the experience even better on those 65 and roll it out to more. 
If you and I both follow a topic like NFL, because we're -- we have different follow graphs, we'd probably see different things because we follow the topic with you on the East Coast and me on the West Coast. And so these are great examples. 
 
But I do think that there's a lot of opportunity, and those are great examples of what we can do to take that number.

Remember, we were up 19% year-over-year in ads in the last 3 weeks of Q3, and we grew our ads revenue 44% sequentially in the third quarter. We had fairly consistent daily growth rates during that last 3 weeks of the quarter, which gives you a sense for how we can operate and deliver for advertisers when events and topics are coming back, when we've got a larger audience and when we're making it easy for advertisers to put their next dollar to work on Twitter as opposed to somewhere else. 
Let me just talk about Q4, where, remember, October looks a lot like September in terms of events coming back and things that are sometimes delayed from previous periods. Product launches coming back, some of which were delayed and others in which were planned, but where you've also got this secular shift where more of it is happening online, both the advertising because of what's happening on linear TV and because people aren't in stadiums and the delivery of goods and services. And so all of that, I think, plays out to our benefit, and I think is why October has a similar setup at September. 
November is a little harder to predict because of the election. But I think what we learned in November around the Black Lives Matter movement in the United States is that when advertisers do choose to pause or slow down because there's a more important discussion happening on our service but that when they come back, they often spend through that budget that they had set aside for Twitter because their objectives and their reach goals haven't changed. 
And then you got December where you've got probably a holiday buying season that could play out earlier and different and more digital than they have in the past, which also hopefully creates a good setup for Twitter as well. So we'll work hard to deliver against all those opportunities, recognizing that November is a little harder to predict than the other periods are. 
And the second part of your question around COVID. We want to focus really hard on the things that we can control. And what we can do around COVID and to the extent people find themselves or economies closing down a little more is we want to make sure that people can find what they're looking for on Twitter, whether it's around COVID or something else. We want to continue our focus on topics and health because when we do that, just like that group of people that came to us in March when the world largely went to shelter in place, we proved that we could retain that cohort better than we had previous ones. And so we feel good about that as an indicator of what we might be able to do should things play out in the future where we're in the unfortunate situation where economies are shutting down again. 
And in terms of advertiser sentiment, I think advertisers have learned a lot since March. They've thought about how they want to show up and adapt quickly to this environment. And there are a lot of things about the fourth quarter that are really important to them, and we expect them to continue to show up through any environment. But the way that they choose to do that and exactly how they do it, we all have to wait and see."

You also pointed out one thing we said in the letter, which is that many of these considerations that have caused us to not repurchase shares yet have eased.

We think about our needs over time. We think about the dilution from share issuance to employees and a handful of other things.

As much as we would all like to see that happen every quarter, and then maybe what some of you had modeled, it also may not be how things play out as a pretty unique time in the world. The great news is that we're doing a better job of retaining those new and reactivated accounts due to the ongoing product improvements that Jack went through earlier. 
On the sequential increase, as I said, we'd all like to have that kind of surge all the time, but it's just not going to happen every quarter. We continue to have a healthy top of funnel in the third quarter. We're pleased with the ad backs that we're getting. And as the conversation around the pandemic, around topics and events, around politics and other things come and go, these numbers are going to vary. But we remain focused on the learning and validation of our strategy that's demonstrated by that better retention of that group that came to us in March. 
Let's talk about Q4 for a second. So Heath, as we look ahead, the fourth quarter is typically seasonally slower for us in terms of mDAU. But remember, with the increased activity around the U.S. election, which does not happen than midterm is, and you think about all the great product work that we've done to make sure that we can help people when they do come to Twitter.

I do want to take a step back on MAP and remind you that although we'll have to wait until next year for the revamped version of the product, we continue to make improvement consistently here that we feel really good about. 
I want to call out a couple of them. One is that, remember, we took away third-party measurement in the third quarter of last year for MAP advertisers. We now have hundreds of advertisers who have it. And with third-party measurement, they're spending 30% more. So we're not waiting for this fully revamped version to roll out important features. We are doing other improvements such as the Carousel data that we've got off that MAP format and some other things that we feel really good about underneath the surface that are driving results around MAP and causing advertisers to still invest more with us while we're waiting for that revamped product to come out sometime next year. 
Your second question around Q4 and the work we've done, we feel really good about the work we've done to help advertisers deliver in what should be a Q4 holiday season, unlike others that we've seen historically.

These have been great opportunities for us with all the leagues as they come back and look for ways to engage their fans. But it's also true for movie launches, where you see watch parties on Twitter or when a new series starts on an over-the-top video service, and they do a watch party. These are both engagement opportunities for us to bring an audience together that otherwise wouldn't be able to interact. They are opportunities for our content partners and they're significant advertising opportunities as well. 
A lot of these things both have pre-roll in front of them. But they also create ad opportunities around the time line, around the specific events, where -- when we know more about what somebody cares about, when advertisers have the opportunity to connect directly with that customer around an event or topic that's bringing into Twitter, those are terrific advertising opportunities as well."

As you can see from our results, our hard work positioned Twitter to deliver significant revenue improvement in Q3.

As you can see from our results, our hard work positioned Twitter to deliver significant revenue improvement in Q3. We saw strength throughout the quarter, as advertisers around the world significantly increased their investment on Twitter, seeking to engage our much larger audience around their turn of events and increased or delayed product launches. Our revenue product improvements are driving better ROI as businesses accelerate their digital spend and the online delivery of products and services.  
In the last 3 weeks of Q3, ad revenue was up 19% year-over-year with fairly consistent daily growth rates during that period. That's a significant improvement from the 15% year-over-year decrease that we saw in the last 3 weeks of Q2 and perhaps a good demonstration of how we can perform when so many events and product launches, not all of which typically fall in that window, are driving more people and advertisers to Twitter.  
As you know, we made revenue durability our highest priority this year, and we're beginning to see the early results. With the ad server rebuild complete, we're moving faster and delivering more. We made progress on our brand and direct response products in Q3 with updated ad formats, improved measurement and better prediction. We also continue to iterate on our revamped MAP offering and have decided to delay general availability into 2021 when we can integrate expected new industry standard mobile privacy requirements.  
Audience and engagement trends were also positive in Q3. There are 42 million more mDAU than there were at this time last year. Remember, we saw a tremendous spike towards the tail end of Q1 due to COVID. Ongoing impacts from product improvements have allowed us to retain more of those new and reactivated accounts than we have in previous periods, resulting in 29% year-over-year increase in mDAU in Q3, which is up 1 million sequentially. To see such a big surge in March and to deliver value to these people on a daily basis, such that we are retaining them better, gives us increased confidence in our consumer product efforts and in our road map.  
As we look ahead to Q4, there's a lot to navigate, and much of it is unique to 2020. On the positive side, October looks a lot like September, with events and product launches coming back. And we're benefiting from all of the hard work we've done to make Twitter a must buy for advertisers looking to launch new products and services and to connect with what's happening. The strength and timing of the holiday shopping season is also likely to play out differently this year than it has historically, with the buying season that may be accelerated and even more digital in terms of advertising and delivery of goods and services than ever before.  
As we approach the U.S. election, however, it's hard to predict how advertiser behavior can play out. In Q2, many brands slowed or paused spend in reaction to U.S. civil unrest, only to increase spend relatively quickly thereafter in an effort to catch up. As we look ahead, the periods surrounding the U.S. election is somewhat uncertain, but we have no reason to believe that September's revenue trends can't continue or even improve outside of the election-related window.  
We remain confident that our larger audience, coupled with ongoing revenue product improvements, new events and product launches and the tendency of advertisers to respond positively to the choices we've made as we've grown the service, can drive great outcomes over time.  
Given improving business conditions, we also intend to continue investing in our most important work, and we expect total GAAP cost and expenses to grow closer to 20% year-over-year in Q4. Remember that was our intention for the full year before the pandemic. We expect stock-based compensation to be relatively flat sequentially, and we expect CapEx to remain over $250 million in Q4 as a result of our ongoing data center build-out.  
We want to thank everyone at Twitter for their incredible dedication and resilience. We continue to see the value of our service, the incredible potential of our business and the importance of our purpose to serve the public conversation.  
Finally, as I'm sure you all saw, we announced our Analyst Day to be held on February 25, 2021. This is our first Analyst Day in many years, and we look forward to discussing our work in more detail. Don't worry, it will all be virtual.

And then I guess the second one would just be, can you give us any sense of how much of the strength in the quarter may have come from the boycott elsewhere? And it sounds like from your commentary, you feel pretty good about the outlook, absent the election and other kind of idiosyncrasies with the holiday. But any sense for how much of that is perhaps a boycott or what -- how much spending is coming from new versus existing advertisers?"

So when we think about the work we've been doing on our direct response road map, it's important to step back and understand how important it is. DR is the larger and faster-growing part of the digital advertising TAM. And although we've got website clicks and app install ads today, and that actually grew faster this quarter than overall ad, albeit against easier comps. But we know that there is work for us to do to move all the way down the funnel to give advertisers to just reach their customers and sell something to them on Twitter. And we want to stay focused on getting all the way through that road map over time.  
When we think about the opportunities for Twitter, remember, we've talked in the past a bunch about where we feel like there's a lot of signal that we historically haven't leveraged that we have opportunity to put to use for the benefit of people on Twitter and for advertisers. You noticed that we reprompted people over the summer to help them understand the benefits of personalization. The onboarding flow is different than it has been historically to help people understand the benefits of it. And some of the changes coming to the industry may very well level the playing field around personalization and the way the device IDs get to be used on iOS devices as a start in -- when Apple rolls it out early in the year.  
When -- to the second part of your question on how much of the strength came from other things. It's hard to unpack different components of our strength from Q3. When we step back from that, we think larger audience, better revenue products, the events and product launches that brought people and advertisers to Twitter but also, I think, to your point, the decisions that we make, how we make them, how we communicate them, we think, are making it easier and easier for advertisers to choose Twitter with their next dollar than to put it somewhere else."

So advertisers spending at Twitter and, in general, continues to be really strong. And when we think about the ad load, it's not a term that you hear us talk about a lot because we still feel more demand constrained than supply constrained, both as we continue to improve our revenue products and deliver better relevance, better ad formats, as we think about parts of the surface area of Twitter that we haven't historically monetized as well and the opportunity to do a better job of that.  
We worked hard this quarter and had some success around reducing click leakage and getting more impressions for advertisers around the really popular first view advertising formats. And so a lot of the stuff has driven success for advertisers but doesn't play out with more ad load, it just plays out with better usage of what people are seeing today. So that will move around from one season to another, from one geography to another, but we still feel more demand constrained than supply constrained.  
The first part of your question was around the ad server rebuild. And we feel really good about the work that we finished there and how we can benefit from it in 2 different ways. The first is that we're able to bring the people who are working on some of that and take them to other teams. An example is the small and medium-sized business work that we've long talked about but haven't been able to prioritize yet. And we now have people working on the opportunity to help small businesses reach their customers in a more compelling way on Twitter than we have historically. 
Second is that we're just able to test more things at the same time and move faster as a result. Our teams don't need to ask other teams to pause in order to see their tests go through. We're able to continue to attract and retain great engineers because they're able to work on new technology."

So we've long said that there's a signal that we're not leveraging the way that we can. It couldn't be that somebody is in an event or topic-specific time line, and we can show them an ad that's relevant to that event that we may not have known enough about to do that if they were in their own timeline or we may not have been able to help the advertiser understand that this is a great place to reach their customer because we didn't have the event-specific time line. And we didn't have 70 million accounts following a topic that pointed them to those time lines. 
So we feel like there's a lot that we historically just haven't used that has been there. And then there's also a more signal that we have access to today because of reprompting people to help them understand the benefit of personalization because of the way that the onboarding flow works now, where people understand the benefits of it with more people who can see personalized ads. There just is more data available to us, and that helps us refine our models and find similarities so that we can show compelling ads to people as well.

I'm sure that DAUs versus MAUss is probably still less than half. 
I guess kind of just the high-level question of like what do you need to do to get to 50 million to 100 million mDAUs in the U.S.? Like is it product changes? Is it education of consumers? Like how do you close that gap? Because it just seems like there's so many people that touch your service on a monthly basis. But don't use it every day. And obviously, it all feeds into a larger revenue opportunity, but I'm just curious like how you get that -- those user growth.

And I think we have an opportunity to show people a much broader aspect of Twitter than just what they see with news and politics. One of the things that we're excited about and that we saw during the COVID quarantines and also during the election is now that we do have topics to follow, people are coming for one reason and staying because they find relevant topics that are interesting to them. 
As we continue to expand those, as we continue to prompt those earlier in the experience such as onboarding, I think that helps us dramatically. And I think it just further shows like all the conversations that are possible on Twitter. So it's really a question of like how do we show more of the breadth and how do we get people to very niche interest in Topics, which tend to do extremely well, and how do we bring it earlier in the customer experience."

When we are still making the experience of finding Topics that are better, when we're still making the Topics better and better, both the quantity of them and then the quality of the tweets that you see. 
So for example, today, there are 65 cashtags that one can follow. Those really weren't out there just a couple of months ago, and we're watching how people interact with those, the dollar sign ticker, so that we could make the experience even better on those 65 and roll it out to more. 
If you and I both follow a topic like NFL, because we're -- we have different follow graphs, we'd probably see different things because we follow the topic with you on the East Coast and me on the West Coast. And so these are great examples. 
 
But I do think that there's a lot of opportunity, and those are great examples of what we can do to take that number.

Or is the record in brand advertising likely to continue to gain steam? 
And then the second question is somewhat related, COVID-related uncertainty still persists and many markets are actually getting worse. Clearly, there was -- the impact on ad budgets were pretty significant in late 1Q and early 2Q. But do you think there is still opportunity for correlation with ad spend if COVID trends continue to get worse?"

We had fairly consistent daily growt",586,"Deepak, good questions there. So first, let me talk about the fourth quarter. Remember, we were up 19% year-over-year in ads in the last 3 weeks of Q3, and we grew our ads revenue 44% sequentially in the third quarter. We had fairly consistent daily growth rates during that last 3 weeks of the quarter, which gives you a sense for how we can operate and deliver for advertisers when events and topics are coming back, when we've got a larger audience and when we're making it easy for advertisers to put their next dollar to work on Twitter as opposed to somewhere else. 
Let me just talk about Q4, where, remember, October looks a lot like September in terms of events coming back and things that are sometimes delayed from previous periods. Product launches coming back, some of which were delayed and others in which were planned, but where you've also got this secular shift where more of it is happening online, both the advertising because of what's happening on linear TV and because people aren't in stadiums and the delivery of goods and services. And so all of that, I think, plays out to our benefit, and I think is why October has a similar setup at September. 
November is a little harder to predict because of the election. But I think what we learned in November around the Black Lives Matter movement in the United States is that when advertisers do choose to pause or slow down because there's a more important discussion happening on our service but that when they come back, they often spend through that budget that they had set aside for Twitter because their objectives and their reach goals haven't changed. 
And then you got December where you've got probably a holiday buying season that could play out earlier and different and more digital than they have in the past, which also hopefully creates a good setup for Twitter as well. So we'll work hard to deliver against all those opportunities, recognizing that November is a little harder to predict than the other periods are. 
And the second part of your question around COVID. We want to focus really hard on the things that we can control. And what we can do around COVID and to the extent people find themselves or economies closing down a little more is we want to make sure that people can find what they're looking for on Twitter, whether it's around COVID or something else. We want to continue our focus on topics and health because when we do that, just like that group of people that came to us in March when the world largely went to shelter in place, we proved that we could retain that cohort better than we had previous ones. And so we feel good about that as an indicator of what we might be able to do should things play out in the future where we're in the unfortunate situation where economies are shutting down again. 
And in terms of advertiser sentiment, I think advertisers have learned a lot since March. They've thought about how they want to show up and adapt quickly to this environment. And there are a lot of things about the fourth quarter that are really important to them, and we expect them to continue to show up through any environment. But the way that they choose to do that and exactly how they do it, we all have to wait and see."

These are things that people come to Twitter for and where we work hard with these partners to differentiate ourselves given the public conversation that happens on the service. 
And I don't -- the innovation may change from one period to another, but the partnership doesn't nor do these secular shifts to people buying more things online and advertising more online because they want to meet their customers where they are, whether they're on their sofa or they're able to get back to a stadium one day soon."

You also pointed out one thing we said in the letter, which is that many of these considerations that have caused us to not repurchase shares yet have eased. When we think about buying back our stock, we consider our share price, we consider our capital structure and what the right amount of cash is on the balance sheet. We think about our needs over time. We think about the dilution from share issuance to employees and a handful of other things. And when we do that, it just hasn't made sense to start to buy back yet. And our plan is to talk in the quarter after we began our share repurchase.

It was broad-based, with double-digit growth in all of our top 10 markets. We grew DAU 20% year-over-year in the United States and 32% internationally. Remember, we saw a huge surge in audience towards the end of Q1 due to COVID. And that was a lot of new and reactivated accounts. 
As much as we would all like to see that happen every quarter, and then maybe what some of you had modeled, it also may not be how things play out as a pretty unique time in the world. The great news is that we're doing a better job of retaining those new and reactivated accounts due to the ongoing product improvements that Jack went through earlier. 
On the sequential increase, as I said, we'd all like to have that kind of surge all the time, but it's just not going to happen every quarter. We continue to have a healthy top of funnel in the third quarter. We're pleased with the ad backs that we're getting. And as the conversation around the pandemic, around topics and events, around politics and other things come and go, these numbers are going to vary. But we remain focused on the learning and validation of our strategy that's demonstrated by that better retention of that group that came to us in March. 
Let's talk about Q4 for a second. So Heath, as we look ahead, the fourth quarter is typically seasonally slower for us in terms of mDAU. But remember, with the increased activity around the U.S. election, which does not happen than midterm is, and you think about all the great product work that we've done to make sure that we can help people when they do come to Twitter. And we feel like those are things that have the potential to benefit us in terms of mDAU growth in Q4 and beyond."

But the second is that Apple has delayed the IDFA changes that they're going to make to iOS 14 into Q1. And we need to wait and hear from them the specifics and think about how we want to adjust and advertisers and other ad platforms and others that are on the ecosystem will have to do the same. And so it's too early to predict what we hear from them, how we choose to react to it, how the rest of the ecosystem does, but that will be a key component of how this all plays out. 
I do want to take a step back on MAP and remind you that although we'll have to wait until next year for the revamped version of the product, we continue to make improvement consistently here that we feel really good about. 
I want to call out a couple of them. One is that, remember, we took away third-party measurement in the third quarter of last year for MAP advertisers. We now have hundreds of advertisers who have it. And with third-party measurement, they're spending 30% more. So we're not waiting for this fully revamped version to roll out important features. We are doing other improvements such as the Carousel data that we've got off that MAP format and some other things that we feel really good about underneath the surface that are driving results around MAP and causing advertisers to still invest more with us while we're waiting for that revamped product to come out sometime next year. 
Your second question around Q4 and the work we've done, we feel really good about the work we've done to help advertisers deliver in what should be a Q4 holiday season, unlike others that we've seen historically. And I went through a little bit in detail earlier, but I know there's a lot going on today. But I won't belabor the point here."

As you can see from our results, our hard work positioned Twitter to deliver significant revenue improvement in Q3. We saw strength throughout the quarter, as advertisers around the world significantly increased the",755,"Thanks, Jack. Good afternoon, everyone. As you can see from our results, our hard work positioned Twitter to deliver significant revenue improvement in Q3. We saw strength throughout the quarter, as advertisers around the world significantly increased their investment on Twitter, seeking to engage our much larger audience around their turn of events and increased or delayed product launches. Our revenue product improvements are driving better ROI as businesses accelerate their digital spend and the online delivery of products and services.  
In the last 3 weeks of Q3, ad revenue was up 19% year-over-year with fairly consistent daily growth rates during that period. That's a significant improvement from the 15% year-over-year decrease that we saw in the last 3 weeks of Q2 and perhaps a good demonstration of how we can perform when so many events and product launches, not all of which typically fall in that window, are driving more people and advertisers to Twitter.  
As you know, we made revenue durability our highest priority this year and we're beginning to see the early results. With the ad server rebuild complete, we're moving faster and delivering more. We made progress on our brand and direct response products in Q3 with updated ad formats, improved measurement and better prediction. We also continue to iterate on our revamped MAP offering and have decided to delay general availability into 2021 when we can integrate expected new industry standard mobile privacy requirements.  
Audience and engagement trends were also positive in Q3. There are 42 million more mDAU than there were at this time last year. Remember, we saw a tremendous spike towards the tail end of Q1 due to COVID. Ongoing impacts from product improvements have allowed us to retain more of those new and reactivated accounts than we have in previous periods, resulting in 29% year-over-year increase in mDAU in Q3, which is up 1 million sequentially. To see such a big surge in March and to deliver value to these people on a daily basis, such that we are retaining them better, gives us increased confidence in our consumer product efforts and in our road map.  
As we look ahead to Q4, there's a lot to navigate and much of it is unique to 2020. On the positive side, October looks a lot like September, with events and product launches coming back. And we're benefiting from all of the hard work we've done to make Twitter a must buy for advertisers looking to launch new products and services and to connect with what's happening. The strength and timing of the holiday shopping season is also likely to play out differently this year than it has historically, with the buying season that may be accelerated and even more digital in terms of advertising and delivery of goods and services than ever before.  
As we approach the U.S. election, however, it's hard to predict how advertiser behavior can play out. In Q2, many brands slowed or paused spend in reaction to U.S. civil unrest, only to increase spend relatively quickly thereafter in an effort to catch up. As we look ahead, the periods surrounding the U.S. election is somewhat uncertain, but we have no reason to believe that September's revenue trends can't continue or even improve outside of the election-related window.  
We remain confident that our larger audience, coupled with ongoing revenue product improvements, new events and product launches and the tendency of advertisers to respond positively to the choices we've made as we've grown the service, can drive great outcomes over time.  
Given improving business conditions, we also intend to continue investing in our most important work, and we expect total GAAP cost and expenses to grow closer to 20% year-over-year in Q4. Remember that was our intention for the full year before the pandemic. We expect stock-based compensation to be relatively flat sequentially, and we expect CapEx to remain over $250 million in Q4 as a result of our ongoing data center build-out.  
We want to thank everyone at Twitter for their incredible dedication and resilience. We continue to see the value of our service, the incredible potential of our business and the importance of our purpose to serve the public conversation.  
Finally, as I'm sure you all saw, we announced our Analyst Day to be held on February 25, 2021. This is our first Analyst Day in many years, and we look forward to discussing our work in more detail. Don't worry, it will all be virtual.

And then I guess the second one would just be, can you give us any sense of how much of the strength in the quarter may have come from the boycott elsewhere? And it sounds like from your commentary, you feel pretty good about the outlook, absent the election and other kind of idiosyncrasies with the holiday. But any sense for how much of that is perhaps a boycott or what -- how much spending is coming from new versus existing advertisers?"

So when we think about the work we've been doing on our direct response road map, it's important to step back and understand how important it is. DR is the larger and faster-growing part of the digital advertising TAM. And although we've got website clicks and app install ads today, and that actually grew faster this quarter than overall ad, albeit against easier comps. But we know that there is work for us to do to move all the way down the funnel to give advertisers to just reach their customers and sell something to them on Twitter. And we want to stay focused on getting all the way through that road map over time.  
When we think about the opportunities for Twitter, remember, we've talked in the past a bunch about where we feel like there's a lot of signal that we historically haven't leveraged that we have opportunity to put to use for the benefit of people on Twitter and for advertisers. You noticed that we reprompted people over the summer to help them understand the benefits of personalization. The onboarding flow is different than it has been historically to help people understand the benefits of it. And some of the changes coming to the industry may very well level the playing field around personalization and the way the device IDs get to be used on iOS devices as a start in -- when Apple rolls it out early in the year.  
When -- to the second part of your question on how much of the strength came from other things. It's hard to unpack different components of our strength from Q3. When we step back from that, we think larger audience, better revenue products, the events and product launches that brought people and advertisers to Twitter but also, I think, to your point, the decisions that we make, how we make them, how we communicate them, we think, are making it easier and easier for advertisers to choose Twitter with their next dollar than to put it somewhere else."

So advertisers spending at Twitter and, in general, continues to be really strong. And when we think about the ad load, it's not a term that you hear us talk about a lot because we still feel more demand constrained than supply constrained, both as we continue to improve our revenue products and deliver better relevance, better ad formats, as we think about parts of the surface area of Twitter that we haven't historically monetized as well and the opportunity to do a better job of that.  
We worked hard this quarter and had some success around reducing click leakage and getting more impressions for advertisers around the really popular first view advertising formats. And so a lot of the stuff has driven success for advertisers but doesn't play out with more ad load, it just plays out with better usage of what people are seeing today. So that will move around from one season to another, from one geography to another, but we still feel more demand constrained than supply constrained.  
The first part of your question was around the ad server rebuild. And we feel really good about the work that we finished there and how we can benefit from it in 2 different ways. The first is that we're able to bring the people who are working on some of that and take them to other teams. An example is the small and medium-sized business work that we've long talked about but haven't been able to prioritize yet. And we now have people working on the opportunity to help small businesses reach their customers in a more compelling way on Twitter than we have historically. 
Second is that we're just able to test more things at the same time and move faster as a result. Our teams don't need to ask other teams to pause in order to see their tests go through. We're able to continue to attract and retain great engineers because they're able to work on new technology."

So we've long said that there's a signal that we're not leveraging the way that we can. It couldn't be that somebody is in an event or topic-specific time line, and we can show them an ad that's relevant to that event that we may not have known enough about to do that if they were in their own timeline or we may not have been able to help the advertiser understand that this is a great place to reach their customer because we didn't have the event-specific time line. And we didn't have 70 million accounts following a topic that pointed them to those time lines. 
So we feel like there's a lot that we historically just haven't used that has been there. And then there's also a more signal that we have access to today because of reprompting people to help them understand the benefit of personalization because of the way that the onboarding flow works now, where people understand the benefits of it with more people who can see personalized ads. There just is more data available to us, and that helps us refine our models and find similarities so that we can show compelling ads to people as well.

I'm sure that DAUs versus MAUss is probably still less than half. 
I guess kind of just the high-level question of like what do you need to do to get to 50 million to 100 million mDAUs in the U.S.? Like is it product changes? Is it education of consumers? Like how do you close that gap? Because it just seems like there's so many people that touch your service on a monthly basis. But don't use it every day.

One of the things that we're excited about and that we saw during the COVID quarantines and also during the election is now that we do have topics to follow, people are coming for one reason and staying because they find relevant topics that are interesting to them. 
As we continue to expand those, as we continue to prompt those earlier in the experience such as onboarding, I think that helps us dramatically. And I think it just further shows like all the conversations that are possible on Twitter. So it's really a question of like how do we show more of the breadth and how do we get people to very niche interest in Topics, which tend to do extremely well and how do we bring it earlier in the customer experience."

When we are still making the experience of finding Topics that are better, when we're still making the Topics better and better, both the quantity of them and then the quality of the tweets that you see. 
So for example, today, there are 65 cashtags that one can follow. Those really weren't out there just a couple of months ago, and we're watching how people interact with those, the dollar sign ticker, so that we could make the experience even better on those 65 and roll it out to more. 
If you and I both follow a topic like NFL, because we're -- we have different follow graphs, we'd probably see different things because we follow the topic with you on the East Coast and me on the West Coast. And so these are great examples. 
 
But I do think that there's a lot of opportunity and those are great examples of what we can do to take that number.

Remember, we were up 19% year-over-year in ads in the last 3 weeks of Q3, and we grew our ads revenue 44% sequentially in the third quarter. We had fairly consistent daily growth rates during that last 3 weeks of the quarter, which gives you a sense for how we can operate and deliver for advertisers when events and topics are coming back, when we've got a larger audience and when we're making it easy for advertisers to put their next dollar to work on Twitter as opposed to somewhere else. 
Let me just talk about Q4, where, remember, October looks a lot like September in terms of events coming back and things that are sometimes delayed from previous periods. Product launches coming back, some of which were delayed and others in which were planned, but where you've also got this secular shift where more of it is happening online, both the advertising because of what's happening on linear TV and because people aren't in stadiums and the delivery of goods and services. And so all of that, I think, plays out to our benefit, and I think is why October has a similar setup at September. 
November is a little harder to predict because of the election. But I think what we learned in November around the Black Lives Matter movement in the United States is that when advertisers do choose to pause or slow down because there's a more important discussion happening on our service but that when they come back, they often spend through that budget that they had set aside for Twitter because their objectives and their reach goals haven't changed. 
And then you got December where you've got probably a holiday buying season that could play out earlier and different and more digital than they have in the past, which also hopefully creates a good setup for Twitter as well. So we'll work hard to deliver against all those opportunities, recognizing that November is a little harder to predict than the other periods are. 
And the second part of your question around COVID. We want to focus really hard on the things that we can control. And what we can do around COVID and to the extent people find themselves or economies closing down a little more is we want to make sure that people can find what they're looking for on Twitter, whether it's around COVID or something else. We want to continue our focus on topics and health because when we do that, just like that group of people that came to us in March when the world largely went to shelter in place, we proved that we could retain that cohort better than we had previous ones. And so we feel good about that as an indicator of what we might be able to do should things play out in the future where we're in the unfortunate situation where economies are shutting down again. 
And in terms of advertiser sentiment, I think advertisers have learned a lot since March. They've thought about how they want to show up and adapt quickly to this environment. And there are a lot of things about the fourth quarter that are really important to them and we expect them to continue to show up through any environment. But the way that they choose to do that and exactly how they do it, we all have to wait and see."

These are things that people come to Twitter for and where we work hard with these partners to differentiate ourselves given the public conversation that happens on the service. 
And I don't -- the innovation may change from one period to another, but the partnership doesn't nor do these secular shifts to people buying more things online and advertising more online because they want to meet their customers where they are, whether they're on their sofa or they're able to get back to a stadium one day soon."

So we think about a lot of factors when it comes to capital allocation and when to begin that share repurchase. And as you noted in the letter, we talked about how we have not purchased any shares yet and that the reason -- the principal reason for that has been that there's been a lot of uncertainty in the broader environment around us, and we want to make sure that we have the capital to continue to grow our team and invest in our business through any environment, whether that's through continuing to bring technology and talent to the company through acquisitions or through investing in servers for our new data center or other things. 
You also pointed out one thing we said in the letter, which is that many of these considerations that have caused us to not repurchase shares yet have eased. When we think about buying back our stock, we consider our share price, we consider our capital structure and what the right amount of cash is on the balance sheet. We think about our needs over time. We think about the dilution from share issuance to employees and a handful of other things. And when we do that, it just hasn't made sense to start to buy back yet. And our plan is to talk in the quarter after we began our share repurchase. You'll hear about it on an earnings call, in the letter and in the filings and we'll just keep you posted as we go."

It was broad-based, with double-digit growth in all of our top 10 markets. We grew DAU 20% year-over-year in the United States and 32% internationally. Remember, we saw a huge surge in audience towards the end of Q1 due to COVID. And that was a lot of new and reactivated accounts. 
As much as we would all like to see that happen every quarter, and then maybe what some of you had modeled, it also may not be how things play out as a pretty unique time in the world. The great news is that we're doing a better job of retaining those new and reactivated accounts due to the ongoing product improvements that Jack went through earlier. 
On the sequential increase, as I said, we'd all like to have that kind of surge all the time, but it's just not going to happen every quarter. We continue to have a healthy top of funnel in the third quarter. We're pleased with the ad backs that we're getting. And as the conversation around the pandemic, around topics and events, around politics and other things come and go, these numbers are going to vary. But we remain focused on the learning and validation of our strategy that's demonstrated by that better retention of that group that came to us in March. 
Let's talk about Q4 for a second. So Heath, as we look ahead, the fourth quarter is typically seasonally slower for us in terms of mDAU. But remember, with the increased activity around the U.S. election, which does not happen than midterm is, and you think about all the great product work that we've done to make sure that we can help people when they do come to Twitter. And we feel like those are things that have the potential to benefit us in terms of mDAU growth in Q4 and beyond."

So remember, we've decided to delay into 2021 for a couple of reasons. The first is the learnings that we had from the pilots that we've done this year and that there's work that we just don't to want to iterate on. But the second is that Apple has delayed the IDFA changes that they're going to make to iOS 14 into Q1. And we need to wait and hear from them the specifics and think about how we want to adjust and advertisers and other ad platforms and others that are on the ecosystem will have to do the same. And so it's too early to predict what we hear from them, how we choose to react to it, how the rest of the ecosystem does, but that will be a key component of how this all plays out. 
I do want to take a step back on MAP and remind you that although we'll have to wait until next year for the revamped version of the product, we continue to make improvement consistently here that we feel really good about. 
I want to call out a couple of them. One is that, remember, we took away third-party measurement in the third quarter of last year for MAP advertisers. We now have hundreds of advertisers who have it. And with third-party measurement, they're spending 30% more. So we're not waiting for this fully revamped version to roll out important features. We are doing other improvements such as the Carousel data that we've got off that MAP format and some other things that we feel really good about underneath the surface that are driving results around MAP and causing advertisers to still invest more with us while we're waiting for that revamped product to come out sometime next year. 
Your second question around Q4 and the work we've done, we feel really good about the work we've done to help advertisers deliver in what should be a Q4 holiday season, unlike others that we've seen historically. And I went through a little bit in detail earlier, but I know there's a lot going on today. But I won't belabor the point here."

These have been great opportunities for us with all the leagues as they come back and look for ways to engage their fans. But it's also true for movie launches, where you see watch parties on Twitter or when a new series starts on an over-the-top video service, and they do a watch party. These are both engagement opportunities for us to bring an audience together that otherwise wouldn't be able to interact. They are opportunities for our content partners and they're significant advertising opportunities as well. 
A lot of these things both have pre-roll in front of them.
