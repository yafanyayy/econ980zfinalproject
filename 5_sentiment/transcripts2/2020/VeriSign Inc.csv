36216,649776595,1902122,"VeriSign, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Feb 06, 2020",2020-02-06,"Earnings Calls","VeriSign, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, David. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report another solid quarter for VeriSign that caps off not only a solid year, but also a strong decade in which we focused on our core business, expanded the domain name base and returned value to o",640,"Thanks, David. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report another solid quarter for VeriSign that caps off not only a solid year, but also a strong decade in which we focused on our core business, expanded the domain name base and returned value to our shareholders. In 2019, we marked more than 22 years of uninterrupted availability for the VeriSign DNS for .com and .net. 2019 was also a strong year for the .com and .net domain name base as we processed a record 40.3 million registrations and concluded the year with 158.8 million names. Finally, 2019 was characterized by solid financial performance with revenues of $1.232 billion and free cash flow of $714 million. 
On January 3, VeriSign and ICANN announced a proposed agreement to amend the .com registry agreement and a new proposed framework for working together on initiatives related to the security, stability and resiliency of the domain name system in the form of a binding letter of intent between the 2 organizations. Together, these agreements fulfill commitments that ICANN and VeriSign made in 2016 when the .com registry agreement was previously amended. The new proposed amendment updates the .com registry agreement to reflect certain changes under Amendment 35 to the cooperative agreement with the U.S. Department of Commerce, including the pricing changes. 
According to the terms of the proposed letter of intent, VeriSign will have a onetime commitment to provide $4 million per year over 5 years beginning on January 1, 2021, for ICANN to support activities to preserve and enhance the security, stability and resiliency of the DNS and the Internet. We believe that the activities funded by this commitment will benefit the entire Internet community. 
ICANN's public comment period for these 2 documents closes February 14. The steps that follow the comment periods closing, according to ICANN's website, are that ICANN staff will prepare a report of the public comments by March 6, 2020, and then ICANN will submit the report to its Board of Directors. 
Now I'll discuss fourth quarter operational highlights. At the end of December, the domain name base in .com and .net totaled 158.8 million consisting of 145.4 million names for .com and 13.4 million names for .net, with a year-over-year growth rate of 3.9%. During the fourth quarter, we processed 10.3 million new registrations, and the domain name base increased by 1.46 million names. Although renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the fourth quarter of 2019 will be approximately 73.7%. This preliminary rate compares to 74.3% achieved in the fourth quarter of 2018 and 72.2% in the fourth quarter of 2017. 
Looking forward to 2020, we expect the domain name base growth rate of between 2% and 4%. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 1 million shares of common stock for $195 million. During the full year 2019, we repurchased 3.9 million shares for $738 million. Effective today, the Board of Directors increased the amount of VeriSign common stock authorized for share repurchase by approximately 743 million to a total of 1 billion authorized and available under the share repurchase program, which has no expiration. 
Our financial position remains strong with $1.218 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases. 
Lastly, regarding .web, as we mentioned last quarter, a hearing on VeriSign and NDCs request to participate in the arbitration process was held last year. We expected a ruling on our request in 2019, but we have been told by the panel that it now hopes to issue its ruling this month. 
And now I'd like to turn the call over to George."
36216,649776595,1902122,"VeriSign, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Feb 06, 2020",2020-02-06,"Earnings Calls","VeriSign, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the company generated revenue of $1.232 billion, up 1.4% from 2018 and delivered GAAP operating income of $806 million, up 5% from $767 million a year ago. As a reminder, rev",680,"Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the company generated revenue of $1.232 billion, up 1.4% from 2018 and delivered GAAP operating income of $806 million, up 5% from $767 million a year ago. As a reminder, revenue growth during 2019 was partially offset by lower revenue from our divested security services business as most customers' contracts transition to the buyer during the year. 
For the full year 2019, revenue from U.S. customers was 63% of total, with 37% coming from foreign customers. Fourth quarter revenue came to $311 million, up 1% year-over-year. GAAP operating expense totaled $112 million compared to $103 million last quarter and $113 million in the fourth quarter a year ago. 
The quarter-over-quarter increase in operating expense is primarily a result of increased investment in our business, including increased sales and marketing programs as well as investments in our operational infrastructure and security capabilities. 
Fourth quarter operating income totaled $199 million compared with $194 million in the same quarter of 2018. The operating margin in the quarter came to 63.9% compared to 63.1% in the same quarter a year ago. Net income totaled $148 million compared to $182 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $1.26 in the fourth quarter this year compared to $1.5 for the same quarter last year. With the year-over-year comparative results, remember that 2018 results include the gain of our -- on the sale of our security services business, which increased fourth quarter 2018 GAAP net income by $52 million and earnings per share by $0.43. 
Related to non-GAAP results, fourth quarter 2019 non-GAAP operating expense, which excludes $12 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $100 million and was higher sequentially for the reasons I discussed earlier and slightly lower than fourth quarter 2018 levels. 
Non-GAAP operating margin for the fourth quarter was 67.9%. Non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $154 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.31. Finally, the full year 2019 non-GAAP operating margin was 69.6%. 
As a reminder, beginning with the first quarter of 2020 results, we will no longer be presenting or discussing non-GAAP metrics with the exception of free cash flow and adjusted EBITDA. As of December 31, 2019, the company maintained total assets of $1.854 billion and total liabilities of $3.344 billion. Assets included $1.218 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. 
Operating cash flow for the fourth quarter was $194 million, and free cash flow was $185 million compared with $219 million and $211 million, respectively, for the fourth quarter of last year. The year-over-year difference was primarily related to higher cash taxes in the fourth quarter of 2019 and a lower working capital benefit. 
I will now discuss full year 2020 guidance, which is now based solely on GAAP metrics. Revenue is expected to be in the range of $1.250 billion to $1.265 billion. This revenue range forecast reflects a growth rate slightly below the expected domain name base growth rate of between 2% and 4% as 2020 revenue no longer reflects any residual revenue from the security services business, which in 2019 was about $10 million. 
GAAP operating margin, which includes stock-based compensation, is expected to be between 64.5% and 65.5%. This guidance range reflects our expectation of incremental investment in our operational infrastructure and security capabilities during 2020. 
Interest expense and nonoperating income net is expected to be an expense of between $68 million and $75 million. This range reflects both lower nonoperating income from the transition services agreement, which will cease during the first quarter and lower expected interest income on cash balances. Capital expenditures are expected to be between $45 million and $55 million. 
The GAAP effective tax rate is expected to be between 18% and 21%. We expect the cash tax rate for 2020 to also be within the same range. 
In summary, VeriSign continued to demonstrate solid financial performance during 2019, and we look forward to continuing strong execution in 2020. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."

There are a lot of scheduled investments that we make. But as you know, the cyber security threat environment is dynamic and ever changing. If there are new threats, if there are new technologies, new products that strengthen our infrastructure and our core mission, we're not going to hesitate to make those investments.

Good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report another solid quarter for VeriSign that caps off not only a solid year, but also a strong decade in which we focused on our core business, expanded the domain name base and returned value to our shareholders. In 2019, we marked more than 22 years of uninterrupted availability for the VeriSign DNS for .com and .net. 2019 was also a strong year for the .com and .net domain name base as we processed a record 40.3 million registrations and concluded the year with 158.8 million names. Finally, 2019 was characterized by solid financial performance with revenues of $1.232 billion and free cash flow of $714 million. 
On January 3, VeriSign and ICANN announced a proposed agreement to amend the .com Registry Agreement and a new proposed framework for working together on initiatives related to the security, stability and resiliency of the domain name system in the form of a binding letter of intent between the 2 organizations. Together, these agreements fulfill commitments that ICANN and VeriSign made in 2016 when the .com Registry Agreement was previously amended. The new proposed amendment updates the .com Registry Agreement to reflect certain changes under Amendment 35 to the Cooperative Agreement with the U.S. Department of Commerce, including the pricing changes. 
According to the terms of the proposed letter of intent, VeriSign will have a onetime commitment to provide $4 million per year over 5 years beginning on January 1, 2021, for ICANN to support activities to preserve and enhance the security, stability and resiliency of the DNS and the Internet. We believe that the activities funded by this commitment will benefit the entire Internet community. 
ICANN's public comment period for these 2 documents closes February 14. The steps that follow the comment period's closing, according to ICANN's website, are that ICANN staff will prepare a report of the public comments by March 6, 2020, and then ICANN will submit the report to its Board of Directors. 
Now I'll discuss fourth quarter operational highlights. At the end of December, the domain name base in .com and .net totaled 158.8 million consisting of 145.4 million names for .com and 13.4 million names for .net, with a year-over-year growth rate of 3.9%. During the fourth quarter, we processed 10.3 million new registrations, and the domain name base increased by 1.46 million names. Although renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the fourth quarter of 2019 will be approximately 73.7%. This preliminary rate compares to 74.3% achieved in the fourth quarter of 2018 and 72.2% in the fourth quarter of 2017. 
Looking forward to 2020, we expect the domain name base growth rate of between 2% and 4%. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 1 million shares of common stock for $195 million. During the full year 2019, we repurchased 3.9 million shares for $738 million. Effective today, the Board of Directors increased the amount of VeriSign common stock authorized for share repurchase by approximately $743 million to a total of $1 billion authorized and available under the share repurchase program, which has no expiration. 
Our financial position remains strong with $1.218 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases. 
Lastly, regarding .web, as we mentioned last quarter, a hearing on VeriSign and NDC's request to participate in the arbitration process was held last year. We expected a ruling on our request in 2019, but we have been told by the panel that it now hopes to issue its ruling this month. 
And now I'd like to turn the call over to George."
36216,649776595,1902200,"VeriSign, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Feb 06, 2020",2020-02-06,"Earnings Calls","VeriSign, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the company generated revenue of $1.232 billion, up 1.4% from 2018; and delivered GAAP operating income of $806 million, up 5% from $767 million a year ago. As a reminder, re",679,"Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the company generated revenue of $1.232 billion, up 1.4% from 2018; and delivered GAAP operating income of $806 million, up 5% from $767 million a year ago. As a reminder, revenue growth during 2019 was partially offset by lower revenue from our divested Security Services business as most customers' contracts transitioned to the buyer during the year. 
For the full year 2019, revenue from U.S. customers was 63% of total, with 37% coming from foreign customers. Fourth quarter revenue came to $311 million, up 1% year-over-year. GAAP operating expense totaled $112 million compared to $103 million last quarter and $113 million in the fourth quarter a year ago. 
The quarter-over-quarter increase in operating expense is primarily a result of increased investment in our business, including increased sales and marketing programs as well as investments in our operational infrastructure and security capabilities. 
Fourth quarter operating income totaled $199 million compared with $194 million in the same quarter of 2018. The operating margin in the quarter came to 63.9% compared to 63.1% in the same quarter a year ago. Net income totaled $148 million compared to $182 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $1.26 in the fourth quarter this year compared to $1.5 for the same quarter last year. For the year-over-year comparative results, remember that 2018 results included the gain of our -- on the sale of our Security Services business, which increased fourth quarter 2018 GAAP net income by $52 million and earnings per share by $0.43. 
Related to non-GAAP results, fourth quarter 2019 non-GAAP operating expense, which excludes $12 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $100 million and was higher sequentially for the reasons I discussed earlier and slightly lower than fourth quarter 2018 levels. 
Non-GAAP operating margin for the fourth quarter was 67.9%. Non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $154 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.31. Finally, the full year 2019 non-GAAP operating margin was 69.6%. 
As a reminder, beginning with the first quarter of 2020 results, we will no longer be presenting nor discussing non-GAAP metrics, with the exception of free cash flow and adjusted EBITDA. As of December 31, 2019, the company maintained total assets of $1.854 billion and total liabilities of $3.344 billion. Assets included $1.218 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. 
Operating cash flow for the fourth quarter was $194 million, and free cash flow was $185 million compared with $219 million and $211 million, respectively, for the fourth quarter last year. The year-over-year difference was primarily related to higher cash taxes in the fourth quarter of 2019 and a lower working capital benefit. 
I will now discuss full year 2020 guidance, which is now based solely on GAAP metrics. Revenue is expected to be in the range of $1.250 billion to $1.265 billion. This revenue range forecast reflects a growth rate slightly below the expected domain name base growth rate of between 2% and 4% as 2020 revenue no longer reflects any residual revenue from the Security Services business, which in 2019 was about $10 million. 
GAAP operating margin, which includes stock-based compensation, is expected to be between 64.5% and 65.5%. This guidance range reflects our expectation of incremental investment in our operational infrastructure and security capabilities during 2020. 
Interest expense and nonoperating income net is expected to be an expense of between $68 million and $75 million. This range reflects both lower nonoperating income from the transition services agreement, which will cease during the first quarter, and lower expected interest income on cash balances. Capital expenditures are expected to be between $45 million and $55 million. 
The GAAP effective tax rate is expected to be between 18% and 21%. We expect the cash tax rate for 2020 to also be within the same range. 
In summary, VeriSign continue to demonstrate sound financial performance during 2019, and we look forward to continuing strong execution in 2020. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."

And so the funding in the LOI is specifically targeted in that broad security, stability and resiliency area in ICANN's core mission."

We had more names being sold last year in the Asia Pacific and China region that are becoming a slightly larger proportion of the base, and so they are having a slight impact there. But other than that, we're not seeing huge variances. Again, I would just remind you, if you look back over the last couple of years, the company's renewal rate has been around 72% and has recently increased up into the 74% range. And while it is down year-over-year by about 60 basis points, it's still, in general, improving as the base ages.

And the other thing I'll just comment on is, also, what happens sometimes from year-to-year is you have new companies becoming registrars, and they tend to pop up in new markets. And we have sometimes consolidation in a market where one registrar may acquire some business from another registrar. So -- but those 3 regions performed well for us in the quarter."

Good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report another solid quarter for VeriSign that caps off not only a solid year, but also a strong decade in which we focused on our core business, expanded the domain name base and returned value to our shareholders. In 2019, we marked more than 22 years of uninterrupted availability for the VeriSign DNS for .com and .net. 2019 was also a strong year for the .com and .net domain name base as we processed a record 40.3 million registrations and concluded the year with 158.8 million names. Finally, 2019 was characterized by solid financial performance with revenues of $1.232 billion and free cash flow of $714 million. 
On January 3, VeriSign and ICANN announced a proposed agreement to amend the .com Registry Agreement and a new proposed framework for working together on initiatives related to the security, stability and resiliency of the domain name system in the form of a binding letter of intent between the 2 organizations. Together, these agreements fulfill commitments that ICANN and VeriSign made in 2016 when the .com Registry Agreement was previously amended. The new proposed amendment updates the .com Registry Agreement to reflect certain changes under Amendment 35 to the Cooperative Agreement with the U.S. Department of Commerce, including the pricing changes. 
According to the terms of the proposed letter of intent, VeriSign will have a onetime commitment to provide $4 million per year over 5 years beginning on January 1, 2021, for ICANN to support activities to preserve and enhance the security, stability and resiliency of the DNS and the Internet. We believe that the activities funded by this commitment will benefit the entire Internet community. 
ICANN's public comment period for these 2 documents closes February 14. The steps that follow the comment period's closing, according to ICANN's website, are that ICANN staff will prepare a report of the public comments by March 6, 2020, and then ICANN will submit the report to its Board of Directors. 
Now I'll discuss fourth quarter operational highlights. At the end of December, the domain name base in .com and .net totaled 158.8 million consisting of 145.4 million names for .com and 13.4 million names for .net, with a year-over-year growth rate of 3.9%. During the fourth quarter, we processed 10.3 million new registrations, and the domain name base increased by 1.46 million names. Although renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the fourth quarter of 2019 will be approximately 73.7%. This preliminary rate compares to 74.3% achieved in the fourth quarter of 2018 and 72.2% in the fourth quarter of 2017. 
Looking forward to 2020, we expect the domain name base growth rate of between 2% and 4%. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 1 million shares of common stock for $195 million. During the full year 2019, we repurchased 3.9 million shares for $738 million. Effective today, the Board of Directors increased the amount of VeriSign common stock authorized for share repurchase by approximately $743 million to a total of $1 billion authorized and available under the share repurchase program, which has no expiration. 
Our financial position remains strong with $1.218 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases. 
Lastly, regarding .web, as we mentioned last quarter, a hearing on VeriSign and NDC's request to participate in the arbitration process was held last year. We expected a ruling on our request in 2019, but we have been told by the panel that it now hopes to issue its ruling this month. 
And now I'd like to turn the call over to George."
36216,649776595,1906466,"VeriSign, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Feb 06, 2020",2020-02-06,"Earnings Calls","VeriSign, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the company generated revenue of $1.232 billion, up 1.4% from 2018; and delivered GAAP operating income of $806 million, up 5% from $767 million a year ago. As a reminder, re",679,"Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the company generated revenue of $1.232 billion, up 1.4% from 2018; and delivered GAAP operating income of $806 million, up 5% from $767 million a year ago. As a reminder, revenue growth during 2019 was partially offset by lower revenue from our divested Security Services business as most customers' contracts transitioned to the buyer during the year. 
For the full year 2019, revenue from U.S. customers was 63% of total, with 37% coming from foreign customers. Fourth quarter revenue came to $311 million, up 1% year-over-year. GAAP operating expense totaled $112 million compared to $103 million last quarter and $113 million in the fourth quarter a year ago. 
The quarter-over-quarter increase in operating expense is primarily a result of increased investment in our business, including increased sales and marketing programs as well as investments in our operational infrastructure and security capabilities. 
Fourth quarter operating income totaled $199 million compared with $194 million in the same quarter of 2018. The operating margin in the quarter came to 63.9% compared to 63.1% in the same quarter a year ago. Net income totaled $148 million compared to $182 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $1.26 in the fourth quarter this year compared to $1.5 for the same quarter last year. For the year-over-year comparative results, remember that 2018 results included the gain of our -- on the sale of our Security Services business, which increased fourth quarter 2018 GAAP net income by $52 million and earnings per share by $0.43. 
Related to non-GAAP results, fourth quarter 2019 non-GAAP operating expense, which excludes $12 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $100 million and was higher sequentially for the reasons I discussed earlier and slightly lower than fourth quarter 2018 levels. 
Non-GAAP operating margin for the fourth quarter was 67.9%. Non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $154 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.31. Finally, the full year 2019 non-GAAP operating margin was 69.6%. 
As a reminder, beginning with the first quarter of 2020 results, we will no longer be presenting nor discussing non-GAAP metrics, with the exception of free cash flow and adjusted EBITDA. As of December 31, 2019, the company maintained total assets of $1.854 billion and total liabilities of $3.344 billion. Assets included $1.218 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. 
Operating cash flow for the fourth quarter was $194 million, and free cash flow was $185 million compared with $219 million and $211 million, respectively, for the fourth quarter last year. The year-over-year difference was primarily related to higher cash taxes in the fourth quarter of 2019 and a lower working capital benefit. 
I will now discuss full year 2020 guidance, which is now based solely on GAAP metrics. Revenue is expected to be in the range of $1.250 billion to $1.265 billion. This revenue range forecast reflects a growth rate slightly below the expected domain name base growth rate of between 2% and 4% as 2020 revenue no longer reflects any residual revenue from the Security Services business, which in 2019 was about $10 million. 
GAAP operating margin, which includes stock-based compensation, is expected to be between 64.5% and 65.5%. This guidance range reflects our expectation of incremental investment in our operational infrastructure and security capabilities during 2020. 
Interest expense and nonoperating income net is expected to be an expense of between $68 million and $75 million. This range reflects both lower nonoperating income from the transition services agreement, which will cease during the first quarter, and lower expected interest income on cash balances. Capital expenditures are expected to be between $45 million and $55 million. 
The GAAP effective tax rate is expected to be between 18% and 21%. We expect the cash tax rate for 2020 to also be within the same range. 
In summary, VeriSign continue to demonstrate sound financial performance during 2019, and we look forward to continuing strong execution in 2020. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."

But other than that, we're not seeing huge variances. Again, I would just remind you, if you look back over the last couple of years, the company's renewal rate has been around 72% and has recently increased up into the 74% range.

And the other thing I'll just comment on is, also what happens sometimes from year-to-year is you have new companies becoming registrars, and they tend to pop up in new markets. And we have sometimes consolidation in a market where one registrar may acquire some business from another registrar. So -- but those 3 regions performed well for us in the quarter."

Good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report another solid quarter for VeriSign that caps off not only a solid year, but also a strong decade in which we focused on our core business, expanded the domain name base and returned value to our shareholders. In 2019, we marked more than 22 years of uninterrupted availability for the VeriSign DNS for .com and .net. 2019 was also a strong year for the .com and .net domain name base as we processed a record 40.3 million registrations and concluded the year with 158.8 million names. Finally, 2019 was characterized by solid financial performance with revenues of $1.232 billion and free cash flow of $714 million. 
On January 3, VeriSign and ICANN announced a proposed agreement to amend the .com Registry Agreement and a new proposed framework for working together on initiatives related to the security, stability and resiliency of the domain name system in the form of a binding letter of intent between the 2 organizations. Together, these agreements fulfill commitments that ICANN and VeriSign made in 2016 when the .com Registry Agreement was previously amended. The new proposed amendment updates the .com Registry Agreement to reflect certain changes under Amendment 35 to the Cooperative Agreement with the U.S. Department of Commerce, including the pricing changes. 
According to the terms of the proposed letter of intent, VeriSign will have a onetime commitment to provide $4 million per year over 5 years beginning on January 1, 2021, for ICANN to support activities to preserve and enhance the security, stability and resiliency of the DNS and the Internet. We believe that the activities funded by this commitment will benefit the entire Internet community. 
ICANN's public comment period for these 2 documents closes February 14. The steps that follow the comment period's closing, according to ICANN's website, are that ICANN staff will prepare a report of the public comments by March 6, 2020, and then ICANN will submit the report to its Board of Directors. 
Now I'll discuss fourth quarter operational highlights. At the end of December, the domain name base in .com and .net totaled 158.8 million consisting of 145.4 million names for .com and 13.4 million names for .net, with a year-over-year growth rate of 3.9%. During the fourth quarter, we processed 10.3 million new registrations, and the domain name base increased by 1.46 million names. Although renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the fourth quarter of 2019 will be approximately 73.7%. This preliminary rate compares to 74.3% achieved in the fourth quarter of 2018 and 72.2% in the fourth quarter of 2017. 
Looking forward to 2020, we expect the domain name base growth rate of between 2% and 4%. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 1 million shares of common stock for $195 million. During the full year 2019, we repurchased 3.9 million shares for $738 million. Effective today, the Board of Directors increased the amount of VeriSign common stock authorized for share repurchase by approximately $743 million to a total of $1 billion authorized and available under the share repurchase program, which has no expiration. 
Our financial position remains strong with $1.218 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases. 
Lastly, regarding .web, as we mentioned last quarter, a hearing on VeriSign and NDC's request to participate in the arbitration process was held last year. We expected a ruling on our request in 2019, but we have been told by the panel that it now hopes to issue its ruling this month. 
And now I'd like to turn the call over to George."
36216,649776595,1906772,"VeriSign, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Feb 06, 2020",2020-02-06,"Earnings Calls","VeriSign, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the company generated revenue of $1.232 billion, up 1.4% from 2018; and delivered GAAP operating income of $806 million, up 5% from $767 million a year ago. As a reminder, re",679,"Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the company generated revenue of $1.232 billion, up 1.4% from 2018; and delivered GAAP operating income of $806 million, up 5% from $767 million a year ago. As a reminder, revenue growth during 2019 was partially offset by lower revenue from our divested Security Services business as most customers' contracts transitioned to the buyer during the year. 
For the full year 2019, revenue from U.S. customers was 63% of total, with 37% coming from foreign customers. Fourth quarter revenue came to $311 million, up 1% year-over-year. GAAP operating expense totaled $112 million compared to $103 million last quarter and $113 million in the fourth quarter a year ago. 
The quarter-over-quarter increase in operating expense is primarily a result of increased investment in our business, including increased sales and marketing programs as well as investments in our operational infrastructure and security capabilities. 
Fourth quarter operating income totaled $199 million compared with $194 million in the same quarter of 2018. The operating margin in the quarter came to 63.9% compared to 63.1% in the same quarter a year ago. Net income totaled $148 million compared to $182 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $1.26 in the fourth quarter this year compared to $1.5 for the same quarter last year. For the year-over-year comparative results, remember that 2018 results included the gain of our -- on the sale of our Security Services business, which increased fourth quarter 2018 GAAP net income by $52 million and earnings per share by $0.43. 
Related to non-GAAP results, fourth quarter 2019 non-GAAP operating expense, which excludes $12 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $100 million and was higher sequentially for the reasons I discussed earlier and slightly lower than fourth quarter 2018 levels. 
Non-GAAP operating margin for the fourth quarter was 67.9%. Non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $154 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.31. Finally, the full year 2019 non-GAAP operating margin was 69.6%. 
As a reminder, beginning with the first quarter of 2020 results, we will no longer be presenting nor discussing non-GAAP metrics, with the exception of free cash flow and adjusted EBITDA. As of December 31, 2019, the company maintained total assets of $1.854 billion and total liabilities of $3.344 billion. Assets included $1.218 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. 
Operating cash flow for the fourth quarter was $194 million, and free cash flow was $185 million compared with $219 million and $211 million, respectively, for the fourth quarter last year. The year-over-year difference was primarily related to higher cash taxes in the fourth quarter of 2019 and a lower working capital benefit. 
I will now discuss full year 2020 guidance, which is now based solely on GAAP metrics. Revenue is expected to be in the range of $1.250 billion to $1.265 billion. This revenue range forecast reflects a growth rate slightly below the expected domain name base growth rate of between 2% and 4% as 2020 revenue no longer reflects any residual revenue from the Security Services business, which in 2019 was about $10 million. 
GAAP operating margin, which includes stock-based compensation, is expected to be between 64.5% and 65.5%. This guidance range reflects our expectation of incremental investment in our operational infrastructure and security capabilities during 2020. 
Interest expense and nonoperating income net is expected to be an expense of between $68 million and $75 million. This range reflects both lower nonoperating income from the transition services agreement, which will cease during the first quarter, and lower expected interest income on cash balances. Capital expenditures are expected to be between $45 million and $55 million. 
The GAAP effective tax rate is expected to be between 18% and 21%. We expect the cash tax rate for 2020 to also be within the same range. 
In summary, VeriSign continue to demonstrate sound financial performance during 2019, and we look forward to continuing strong execution in 2020. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."

And the other thing I'll just comment on is, also, what happens sometimes from year-to-year is you have new companies becoming registrars, and they tend to pop up in new markets. And we have sometimes consolidation in a market where one registrar may acquire some business from another registrar. So -- but those 3 regions performed well for us in the quarter."

Good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report another solid quarter for VeriSign that caps off not only a solid year, but also a strong decade in which we focused on our core business, expanded the domain name base and returned value to our shareholders. In 2019, we marked more than 22 years of uninterrupted availability for the VeriSign DNS for .com and .net. 2019 was also a strong year for the .com and .net domain name base as we processed a record 40.3 million registrations and concluded the year with 158.8 million names. Finally, 2019 was characterized by solid financial performance with revenues of $1.232 billion and free cash flow of $714 million. 
On January 3, VeriSign and ICANN announced a proposed agreement to amend the .com Registry Agreement and a new proposed framework for working together on initiatives related to the security, stability and resiliency of the domain name system in the form of a binding letter of intent between the 2 organizations. Together, these agreements fulfill commitments that ICANN and VeriSign made in 2016 when the .com Registry Agreement was previously amended. The new proposed amendment updates the .com Registry Agreement to reflect certain changes under Amendment 35 to the Cooperative Agreement with the U.S. Department of Commerce, including the pricing changes. 
According to the terms of the proposed letter of intent, VeriSign will have a onetime commitment to provide $4 million per year over 5 years beginning on January 1, 2021, for ICANN to support activities to preserve and enhance the security, stability and resiliency of the DNS and the Internet. We believe that the activities funded by this commitment will benefit the entire Internet community. 
ICANN's public comment period for these 2 documents closes February 14. The steps that follow the comment period's closing, according to ICANN's website, are that ICANN staff will prepare a report of the public comments by March 6, 2020, and then ICANN will submit the report to its Board of Directors. 
Now I'll discuss fourth quarter operational highlights. At the end of December, the domain name base in .com and .net totaled 158.8 million consisting of 145.4 million names for .com and 13.4 million names for .net, with a year-over-year growth rate of 3.9%. During the fourth quarter, we processed 10.3 million new registrations, and the domain name base increased by 1.46 million names. Although renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the fourth quarter of 2019 will be approximately 73.7%. This preliminary rate compares to 74.3% achieved in the fourth quarter of 2018 and 72.2% in the fourth quarter of 2017. 
Looking forward to 2020, we expect the domain name base growth rate of between 2% and 4%. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 1 million shares of common stock for $195 million. During the full year 2019, we repurchased 3.9 million shares for $738 million. Effective today, the Board of Directors increased the amount of VeriSign common stock authorized for share repurchase by approximately $743 million to a total of $1 billion authorized and available under the share repurchase program, which has no expiration. 
Our financial position remains strong with $1.218 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases. 
Lastly, regarding .web, as we mentioned last quarter, a hearing on VeriSign and NDC's request to participate in the arbitration process was held last year. We expected a ruling on our request in 2019, but we have been told by the panel that it now hopes to issue its ruling this month. 
And now I'd like to turn the call over to George."
36216,649776595,1906775,"VeriSign, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Feb 06, 2020",2020-02-06,"Earnings Calls","VeriSign, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the company generated revenue of $1.232 billion, up 1.4% from 2018; and delivered GAAP operating income of $806 million, up 5% from $767 million a year ago. As a reminder, re",679,"Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the company generated revenue of $1.232 billion, up 1.4% from 2018; and delivered GAAP operating income of $806 million, up 5% from $767 million a year ago. As a reminder, revenue growth during 2019 was partially offset by lower revenue from our divested Security Services business as most customers' contracts transitioned to the buyer during the year. 
For the full year 2019, revenue from U.S. customers was 63% of total, with 37% coming from foreign customers. Fourth quarter revenue came to $311 million, up 1% year-over-year. GAAP operating expense totaled $112 million compared to $103 million last quarter and $113 million in the fourth quarter a year ago. 
The quarter-over-quarter increase in operating expense is primarily a result of increased investment in our business, including increased sales and marketing programs as well as investments in our operational infrastructure and security capabilities. 
Fourth quarter operating income totaled $199 million compared with $194 million in the same quarter of 2018. The operating margin in the quarter came to 63.9% compared to 63.1% in the same quarter a year ago. Net income totaled $148 million compared to $182 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $1.26 in the fourth quarter this year compared to $1.5 for the same quarter last year. For the year-over-year comparative results, remember that 2018 results included the gain of our -- on the sale of our Security Services business, which increased fourth quarter 2018 GAAP net income by $52 million and earnings per share by $0.43. 
Related to non-GAAP results, fourth quarter 2019 non-GAAP operating expense, which excludes $12 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $100 million and was higher sequentially for the reasons I discussed earlier and slightly lower than fourth quarter 2018 levels. 
Non-GAAP operating margin for the fourth quarter was 67.9%. Non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $154 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.31. Finally, the full year 2019 non-GAAP operating margin was 69.6%. 
As a reminder, beginning with the first quarter of 2020 results, we will no longer be presenting nor discussing non-GAAP metrics, with the exception of free cash flow and adjusted EBITDA. As of December 31, 2019, the company maintained total assets of $1.854 billion and total liabilities of $3.344 billion. Assets included $1.218 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. 
Operating cash flow for the fourth quarter was $194 million, and free cash flow was $185 million compared with $219 million and $211 million, respectively, for the fourth quarter last year. The year-over-year difference was primarily related to higher cash taxes in the fourth quarter of 2019 and a lower working capital benefit. 
I will now discuss full year 2020 guidance, which is now based solely on GAAP metrics. Revenue is expected to be in the range of $1.250 billion to $1.265 billion. This revenue range forecast reflects a growth rate slightly below the expected domain name base growth rate of between 2% and 4% as 2020 revenue no longer reflects any residual revenue from the Security Services business, which in 2019 was about $10 million. 
GAAP operating margin, which includes stock-based compensation, is expected to be between 64.5% and 65.5%. This guidance range reflects our expectation of incremental investment in our operational infrastructure and security capabilities during 2020. 
Interest expense and nonoperating income net is expected to be an expense of between $68 million and $75 million. This range reflects both lower nonoperating income from the transition services agreement, which will cease during the first quarter, and lower expected interest income on cash balances. Capital expenditures are expected to be between $45 million and $55 million. 
The GAAP effective tax rate is expected to be between 18% and 21%. We expect the cash tax rate for 2020 to also be within the same range. 
In summary, VeriSign continue to demonstrate sound financial performance during 2019, and we look forward to continuing strong execution in 2020. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."

I'm pleased to report another solid quarter for VeriSign that caps off not only a solid year, but also a strong decade in which we focused on our core business, expanded the domain name base and returned value to o",640,"Thanks, David. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report another solid quarter for VeriSign that caps off not only a solid year, but also a strong decade in which we focused on our core business, expanded the domain name base and returned value to our shareholders. In 2019, we marked more than 22 years of uninterrupted availability for the VeriSign DNS for .com and .net. 2019 was also a strong year for the .com and .net domain name base as we processed a record 40.3 million registrations and concluded the year with 158.8 million names. Finally, 2019 was characterized by solid financial performance with revenues of $1.232 billion and free cash flow of $714 million. 
On January 3, VeriSign and ICANN announced a proposed agreement to amend the .com Registry Agreement and a new proposed framework for working together on initiatives related to the security, stability and resiliency of the domain name system in the form of a binding letter of intent between the 2 organizations. Together, these agreements fulfill commitments that ICANN and VeriSign made in 2016 when the .com Registry Agreement was previously amended. The new proposed amendment updates the .com Registry Agreement to reflect certain changes under Amendment 35 to the Cooperative Agreement with the U.S. Department of Commerce, including the pricing changes. 
According to the terms of the proposed letter of intent, VeriSign will have a onetime commitment to provide $4 million per year over 5 years beginning on January 1, 2021, for ICANN to support activities to preserve and enhance the security, stability and resiliency of the DNS and the Internet. We believe that the activities funded by this commitment will benefit the entire Internet community. 
ICANN's public comment period for these 2 documents closes February 14. The steps that follow the comment period's closing, according to ICANN's website, are that ICANN staff will prepare a report of the public comments by March 6, 2020, and then ICANN will submit the report to its Board of Directors. 
Now I'll discuss fourth quarter operational highlights. At the end of December, the domain name base in .com and .net totaled 158.8 million consisting of 145.4 million names for .com and 13.4 million names for .net, with a year-over-year growth rate of 3.9%. During the fourth quarter, we processed 10.3 million new registrations, and the domain name base increased by 1.46 million names. Although renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the fourth quarter of 2019 will be approximately 73.7%. This preliminary rate compares to 74.3% achieved in the fourth quarter of 2018 and 72.2% in the fourth quarter of 2017. 
Looking forward to 2020, we expect the domain name base growth rate of between 2% and 4%. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 1 million shares of common stock for $195 million. During the full year 2019, we repurchased 3.9 million shares for $738 million. Effective today, the Board of Directors increased the amount of VeriSign common stock authorized for share repurchase by approximately $743 million to a total of $1 billion authorized and available under the share repurchase program, which has no expiration. 
Our financial position remains strong with $1.218 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases. 
Lastly, regarding .web, as we mentioned last quarter, a hearing on VeriSign and NDC's request to participate in the arbitration process was held last year. We expected a ruling on our request in 2019, but we have been told by the panel that it now hopes to issue its ruling this month. 
And now I'd like to turn the call over to George."
36216,649776595,1934535,"VeriSign, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Feb 06, 2020",2020-02-06,"Earnings Calls","VeriSign, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the company generated revenue of $1.232 billion, up 1.4% from 2018; and delivered GAAP operating income of $806 million, up 5% from $767 million a year ago. As a reminder, re",679,"Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the company generated revenue of $1.232 billion, up 1.4% from 2018; and delivered GAAP operating income of $806 million, up 5% from $767 million a year ago. As a reminder, revenue growth during 2019 was partially offset by lower revenue from our divested Security Services business as most customers' contracts transitioned to the buyer during the year. 
For the full year 2019, revenue from U.S. customers was 63% of total, with 37% coming from foreign customers. Fourth quarter revenue came to $311 million, up 1% year-over-year. GAAP operating expense totaled $112 million compared to $103 million last quarter and $113 million in the fourth quarter a year ago. 
The quarter-over-quarter increase in operating expense is primarily a result of increased investment in our business, including increased sales and marketing programs as well as investments in our operational infrastructure and security capabilities. 
Fourth quarter operating income totaled $199 million compared with $194 million in the same quarter of 2018. The operating margin in the quarter came to 63.9% compared to 63.1% in the same quarter a year ago. Net income totaled $148 million compared to $182 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $1.26 in the fourth quarter this year compared to $1.5 for the same quarter last year. For the year-over-year comparative results, remember that 2018 results included the gain of our -- on the sale of our Security Services business, which increased fourth quarter 2018 GAAP net income by $52 million and earnings per share by $0.43. 
Related to non-GAAP results, fourth quarter 2019 non-GAAP operating expense, which excludes $12 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $100 million and was higher sequentially for the reasons I discussed earlier and slightly lower than fourth quarter 2018 levels. 
Non-GAAP operating margin for the fourth quarter was 67.9%. Non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $154 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.31. Finally, the full year 2019 non-GAAP operating margin was 69.6%. 
As a reminder, beginning with the first quarter of 2020 results, we will no longer be presenting nor discussing non-GAAP metrics, with the exception of free cash flow and adjusted EBITDA. As of December 31, 2019, the company maintained total assets of $1.854 billion and total liabilities of $3.344 billion. Assets included $1.218 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. 
Operating cash flow for the fourth quarter was $194 million, and free cash flow was $185 million compared with $219 million and $211 million, respectively, for the fourth quarter last year. The year-over-year difference was primarily related to higher cash taxes in the fourth quarter of 2019 and a lower working capital benefit. 
I will now discuss full year 2020 guidance, which is now based solely on GAAP metrics. Revenue is expected to be in the range of $1.250 billion to $1.265 billion. This revenue range forecast reflects a growth rate slightly below the expected domain name base growth rate of between 2% and 4% as 2020 revenue no longer reflects any residual revenue from the Security Services business, which in 2019 was about $10 million. 
GAAP operating margin, which includes stock-based compensation, is expected to be between 64.5% and 65.5%. This guidance range reflects our expectation of incremental investment in our operational infrastructure and security capabilities during 2020. 
Interest expense and nonoperating income net is expected to be an expense of between $68 million and $75 million. This range reflects both lower nonoperating income from the transition services agreement, which will cease during the first quarter, and lower expected interest income on cash balances. Capital expenditures are expected to be between $45 million and $55 million. 
The GAAP effective tax rate is expected to be between 18% and 21%. We expect the cash tax rate for 2020 to also be within the same range. 
In summary, VeriSign continue to demonstrate sound financial performance during 2019, and we look forward to continuing strong execution in 2020. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."

And the other thing I'll just comment on is, also, what happens sometimes from year-to-year is you have new companies becoming registrars, and they tend to pop up in new markets. And we have sometimes consolidation in a market where one registrar may acquire some business from another registrar. So -- but those 3 regions performed well for us in the quarter."

As people work to address the global challenges posed by COVID-19, we are focused on protecting our people, managing our operations, supporting our local communities and helping small businesses through our general partners. While the issues posed by COVID-19 are unprecedented, they fall within our standard preparation for disruption caused by local, regional and global events. The company's readiness plans, which are routinely exercised include the ability to maintain critical Internet infrastructure with most employees working remotely. We are prepared to continue to operate all of our services, including registry services for .com and .net and our route operations at the rigorous standards of performance governed by ICANN, even in the demanding environment created by COVID-19. 
Additionally, to help our local communities, as announced in March, we made an initial $2 million donation during the first quarter to first responders and medical personnel in the Northern Virginia area, the United Ways Worldwide COVID-19 Community Response and Recovery Fund and the -- and Americas Fund. Additions to protect our people, manage our operations, help communities and help small business through our channel partners can be found in our company blog, which is available at verisign.com. 
Now I'd like to address updates and first quarter results. I'm able to report another solid quarter for VeriSign in which we focused on our core business, expanded the domain name base and delivered consistent financial results. On March 27, we announced that VeriSign and ICANN entered into the third amendment to the .com registry agreement and a separate binding letter of intent, which formalized a new framework for ICANN and VeriSign to work together on initiatives related to the security ability and resiliency domain system. We are pleased with the outcome of the process and remain confident that these agreements will serve the public interest by providing pricing certainty and by helping the securities stability and resiliency in .com and the critical Internet functions it supports globally. 
In addition, we announced that in light of the global disruption caused by COVID-19, we have registry fees for all TLDs, including .com and .net through the end of [indiscernible] 
As we stated last quarter, regarding the letter of intent, onetime commitment to provide $4 million per year over 5 years beginning on January 1, 2021, for ICANN to support activities to preserve and enhance the security, stability and resiliency of the DNS and the Internet. We believe that the activities funded by this commitment will benefit the entire Internet community. 
Also, as an update, in February, Todd Strubbe was promoted from Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer to President and Chief Operating Officer, further strengthening our senior management team. 
Relating to first quarter operational highlights. At the end of March, the domain name base in .com and .net totaled 160.7 million consisting of 147.3 million names for.com and 13.4 million names for .net, with a year-over-year growth rate of 3.8%. During the first quarter, we processed 10 million new registrations, and the domain name base increased by 1.83 million names. Although our renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the first quarter of 2020 will be approximately 75.4%. This preliminary rate compares to 75.0% achieved in the first quarter of 2019 and 73.8% in the fourth quarter of 2019. 
By the way, our press release that we just released this afternoon has a typo. And in the sentence that I just read, in the press release, it says in the fourth quarter of 2020 instead of the fourth quarter of 2019, when it mentions the 73.8% renewal rate. So the fourth -- the first quarter -- sorry, the fourth quarter of 2019 renewal rate was 73.8% and the typo as fourth quarter of 2020. That's getting ahead of yourself, I suppose. So I just wanted to point out that typo. 
So back to the business. For 2020, we now expect a domain name base growth rate of between 2% and 3.75%. Recognizing the uncertainty presented by COVID-19, this updated range reflects a more cautious view of domain name base growth for the balance of the year. 
During the first quarter, we continued our share repurchase program that resulted in 1.3 million shares of common stock repurchased for $245 million. At March 31, 2020, $826 million remain available and authorized under the current share repurchase program, which has no expiration. Our financial and liquidity position remains strong with $1.139 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. We continually evaluate the overall liquidity and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases. 
And now I'd like to turn the call over to George."

For the quarter ended March 31, 2020, the company generated revenue of $313 million, up 2% from the same quarter in 2019 and delivered operating income of $206 million, up 3% from $200 million in the same quar",1254,"Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. For the quarter ended March 31, 2020, the company generated revenue of $313 million, up 2% from the same quarter in 2019 and delivered operating income of $206 million, up 3% from $200 million in the same quarter a year ago. Operating expense totaled $106 million, flat with the first quarter a year ago and lower from $112 million last quarter. The sequential decrease in operating expense is primarily a result of a decrease in sales and marketing expenses in the quarter, partially offset by the $2 million in donations that Jim mentioned earlier. 
The operating margin in the quarter came to 66% compared to 65.4% in the same quarter a year ago. Net income totaled $334 million compared to $163 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $2.86 in the first quarter this year compared to $1.35 for the same quarter last year. As noted in our earnings release, net income for the quarter included the recognition of $168 million of previously unrecognized income tax benefits. This income tax benefit increased diluted earnings per share by $1.44. 
As of March 31, 2020, the company maintained total assets of $1.754 billion and total liabilities of $3.163 billion. Assets included $1.139 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Operating cash flow for the first quarter was $180 million, and free cash flow was $169 million compared with $187 million and $178 million, respectively, for the first quarter last year. 
I will now discuss full year 2020 guidance. Revenue is still expected to be in the range of $1.250 billion to $1.265 billion. This revenue range forecast reflects the updated domain name base growth rate of between 2% and 3.75% that Jim mentioned earlier. The operating margin, which includes stock-based compensation, is still expected to be between 64.5% and 65.5%. This guidance range reflects our expectation of incremental and continued investment in our operational infrastructure, security capabilities and sales and marketing expense during the remainder of 2020. 
Interest expense and nonoperating income net is now expected to be an expense of between $80 million and $85 million. This updated range reflects lower expected interest income on cash balances due to decreased interest rates. Capital expenditures are still expected to be between $45 million and $55 million. We now expect our full year effective tax rate to be a benefit of between 2% and 5%, which reflects the $168 million income tax benefit recognized in the first quarter. For the balance of 2020, we expect tax expense as a percent of pretax income of between 19% and 22%. Cash taxes for 2020 will not be impacted by the remeasurement of our accrual for uncertain tax positions discussed earlier and are expected to still be in the range of 18% to 21% of pretax income. 
In summary, VeriSign continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the quarter, and we look forward to continuing our focused execution for the balance of 2020 during this period 
[Audio Gap] 
now more than ever. Protecting unconditionally the infrastructure that operates registry services for.com and net as well as our root operations remains job one. The company's readiness plans, which are routinely exercised, include the ability to maintain critical Internet infrastructure with most employees working remotely. VeriSign maintains multiple redundant operation centers as well as hundreds of service locations distributed worldwide across 6 continents. 
VeriSign's diverse DNS infrastructure is not dependent on a single type of technology, vendor or power source at a given location, and VeriSign technical teams across the globe are able to perform key functions from multiple locations. 
We are prepared to continue to operate all of our services, including registry services for .com and .net and our route operations at the rigorous standards of performance governed by ICANN even in the demanding environment created by COVID-19. 
In respect to our supply chain, we're monitoring these issues and are taking action were to ensure that we continue to have everything necessary for the ongoing operation of our infrastructure. It is important to remember that our infrastructure is not dependent on a single type of technology, vendor or power source at a given location. 
With regards to our customers, these are clearly uncertain times for businesses and the economy. As we discussed in our blog post, we're taking actions to help small business through our channel partners. In order to support individuals and small businesses affected by this crisis, VeriSign is freezing registry prices for all of our TLDs, including common net, through the end of 2020. In addition, from April 2 until June 1, VeriSign is waiving what is known as the restore fee for .com and .net domain names. Typically, when a domain name registration is deleted by a registrar, there is a period of time during which the person who registered the name can pay a one-time restore fee to get it back before the name goes back into general availability. This helps protect registrants who may have left their domain names lapse accidentally at an inopportune time. 
As it relates to demand for .com and .net domain names, you see in today's results that we saw a good demand for new registrations during the first quarter as well as an improved preliminary renewal rate. That being said, as I stated earlier, recognizing the uncertainty over the duration and economic impact of the COVID-19 crisis, the updated guidance range reflects a more cautious view of domain name base growth for the rest of the year. As a reminder, you can track the performance of the domain name base with daily updates on our website. 
Finally, regarding capital allocation, recognizing that these are unprecedented times, and that is a period of market uncertainty for at least the next quarter, our capital return will be more in line with historical amounts. 
Second question I'll ask and address. With amendment to finalized, when can you take price increases for .com? Amendment 3 for the Com Registry agreement reflects certain changes agreed to under Amendment 35 to the cooperative agreement with the U.S. Department of Commerce, including the pricing changes which allow limited .com price increases in each of the last 4 years of every 6-year period. The first period began on October 26, 2018. Therefore, October 26, 2020, was the earliest date that VeriSign could have taken a price increase. That said, as we announced in March, VeriSign is freezing its registry prices for all of our top-level domains, including .com and .net, through the end of 2020 in order to support individuals and small businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Also, as a reminder, the common net registry agreements require VeriSign to provide 6 months notice of any price increase. 
Now the third and last question I'd like to answer before we take yours. Are there any updates on the stats of .web? As mentioned on our last call, we were waiting a ruling on whether VeriSign could participate in the arbitration called an independent review process under ICANN's rules. As announced in our 10-K in February, the arbitration panel permitted VeriSign and new .co to participate in aspects of the independent review process. We do not have further updates at this time. 
Now we'll open the call for your questions. As a reminder, due to the remote nature of participants, we will do our best to respond to each question, and we appreciate your patience if we experience technical issues. Operator, we're ready for the first question."

And as we talked about before, that's a normal function that we've seen previously as the base stages. As we look at the domain name based performance itself, clearly here in the first quarter, as Jim mentioned, we had what was a good Q1. New units were up 2.1% from a year ago and delivered $1.8 million. As you mentioned, we're keeping an eye on the domain name base and demand for the rest of the year. In the quarter, we saw good strength from the United States registrars. And I would say the China market was a little softer, but the strength from the U.S. registrars really outpace that and overcompensated for that helping the domain a base to continue to grow here in Q1."

As people work to address the global challenges posed by COVID-19, we are focused on protecting our people, managing our operations, supporting our local communities and helping small businesses through our general partners. While the issues posed by COVID-19 are unprecedented, they fall within our standard preparation for disruption caused by local, regional and global events. The company's readiness plans, which are routinely exercised, include the ability to maintain critical Internet infrastructure with most employees working remotely. We are prepared to continue to operate all of our services, including registry services for .com and .net and our route operations at the rigorous standards of performance governed by ICANN even in the demanding environment created by COVID-19.  
Additionally, to help our local communities, as announced in March, we made an initial $2 million donation during the first quarter to first responders and medical personnel in the Northern Virginia area, the United Way's Worldwide COVID-19 Community Response and Recovery Fund and Semper Fi & America's Fund. Additional efforts to protect our people, manage our operations, help communities and help small business through our channel partners can be found in our company blog, which is available at verisign.com.  
Now I'd like to address updates and first quarter results. I'm able to report another solid quarter for VeriSign in which we focused on our core business, expanded the domain name base and delivered consistent financial results. 
On March 27, we announced that VeriSign and ICANN entered into the third amendment to the .com registry agreement and a separate binding letter of intent, which formalized a new framework for ICANN and VeriSign to work together on initiatives related to the security ability and resiliency in the domain system. We are pleased with the outcome of the process and remain confident that these agreements will serve the public interest by providing pricing certainty and by helping to hold the security, stability and resiliency in .com and the critical Internet functions it supports globally.  
In addition, we announced that in light of the global disruption caused by COVID-19, we have registry fees for all TLDs, including .com and .net, through the end of 2020. 
As we stated last quarter, regarding the letter of intent, one-time commitment to provide $4 million per year over 5 years beginning on January 1, 2021, for ICANN to support activities to preserve and enhance the security, stability and resiliency of the DNS and the Internet. We believe that the activities funded by this commitment will benefit the entire Internet community.  
Also, as an update, in February, Todd Strubbe was promoted from Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer to President and Chief Operating Officer, further strengthening our senior management team.  
Relating to first quarter operational highlights. At the end of March, the domain name base in .com and .net totaled 160.7 million consisting of 147.3 million names for .com and 13.4 million names for .net with a year-over-year growth rate of 3.8%. During the first quarter, we processed 10 million new registrations, and the domain name base increased by 1.83 million names. Although our renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the first quarter of 2020 will be approximately 75.4%. This preliminary rate compares to 75.0% achieved in the first quarter of 2019 and 73.8% in the fourth quarter of 2019.  
By the way, our press release that we just released this afternoon has a typo. And in the sentence that I just read, in the press release, it says in the fourth quarter of 2020 instead of the fourth quarter of 2019 when it mentions the 73.8% renewal rate. So the fourth -- the first quarter -- sorry, the fourth quarter of 2019 renewal rate was 73.8%. And the typo, it says fourth quarter of 2020. That's getting ahead of yourself, I suppose. So I just wanted to point out that typo.  
So back to the business. For 2020, we now expect a domain name base growth rate of between 2% and 3.75%. Recognizing the uncertainty presented by COVID-19, this updated range reflects a more cautious view of domain name base growth for the balance of the year. 
During the first quarter, we continued our share repurchase program that resulted in 1.3 million shares of common stock repurchased for $245 million. At March 31, 2020, $826 million remain available and authorized under the current share repurchase program, which has no expiration. Our financial and liquidity position remains strong with $1.139 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. We continually evaluate the overall liquidity and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases.  
And now I'd like to turn the call over to George."

For the quarter ended March 31, 2020, the company generated revenue of $313 million, up 2% from the same quarter in 2019, and delivered operating income of $206 million, up 3% from $200 million in the same q",517,"Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. 
For the quarter ended March 31, 2020, the company generated revenue of $313 million, up 2% from the same quarter in 2019, and delivered operating income of $206 million, up 3% from $200 million in the same quarter a year ago. Operating expense totaled $106 million, flat with the first quarter a year ago and lower from $112 million last quarter. The sequential decrease in operating expense is primarily a result of a decrease in sales and marketing expenses in the quarter, partially offset by the $2 million in donations that Jim mentioned earlier.  
The operating margin in the quarter came to 66% compared to 65.4% in the same quarter a year ago. Net income totaled $334 million compared to $163 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $2.86 in the first quarter this year compared to $1.35 for the same quarter last year. As noted in our earnings release, net income for the quarter included the recognition of $168 million of previously unrecognized income tax benefits. This income tax benefit increased diluted earnings per share by $1.44.  
As of March 31, 2020, the company maintained total assets of $1.754 billion and total liabilities of $3.163 billion. Assets included $1.139 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Operating cash flow for the first quarter was $180 million, and free cash flow was $169 million compared with $187 million and $178 million, respectively, for the first quarter last year.  
I will now discuss full year 2020 guidance. Revenue is still expected to be in the range of $1.250 billion to $1.265 billion. This revenue range forecast reflects the updated domain name base growth rate of between 2% and 3.75% that Jim mentioned earlier. The operating margin, which includes stock-based compensation, is still expected to be between 64.5% and 65.5%. This guidance range reflects our expectation of incremental and continued investment in our operational infrastructure, security capabilities and sales and marketing expense during the remainder of 2020.  
Interest expense and nonoperating income net is now expected to be an expense of between $80 million and $85 million. This updated range reflects lower expected interest income on cash balances due to decreased interest rates. Capital expenditures are still expected to be between $45 million and $55 million. We now expect our full year effective tax rate to be a benefit of between 2% and 5%, which reflects the $168 million income tax benefit recognized in the first quarter. For the balance of 2020, we expect tax expense as a percent of pretax income of between 19% and 22%. Cash taxes for 2020 will not be impacted by the remeasurement of our accrual for uncertain tax positions discussed earlier and are expected to still be in the range of 18% to 21% of pretax income.  
In summary, VeriSign continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the quarter, and we look forward to continuing our focused execution for the balance of 2020 during this period of market uncertainty. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."

We a",909,"Thank you, George.
Before moving to the question-and-portion of this call, I would like to acknowledge and efforts of critical staff, not only here at VeriSign but everwhere, of the hard work and commitment they are demonstrating during this crisis. We appreciate the training, skill and dedicated effort of our team, which remains focused on operating our critical infrastructure. I hope everyone remains well and continues to stay safe. 
Given that participants are dialing in remotely for this call, we would like to walk through a few questions which we know are on your mind before we open the call for your additional questions.
The first question I'll ask and then answer is, could you provide more information then on COVID-19's impacts to your business in terms of your infrastructure, supply chain, customers, demand for .com and .net and capital allocation? The answer is that we recognize that VeriSign operates critically within that infrastructure that's relied on now more than ever. Protecting unconditionally the infrastructure that operates registry services for.com and net as well as our root operations remains job one. The company's readiness plans, which are routinely exercised, include the ability to maintain critical Internet infrastructure with most employees working remotely. VeriSign maintains multiple redundant operation centers as well as hundreds of service locations distributed worldwide across 6 continents.  
VeriSign's diverse DNS infrastructure is not dependent on a single type of technology, vendor or power source at a given location, and VeriSign technical teams across the globe are able to perform key functions from multiple locations.  
We are prepared to continue to operate all of our services, including registry services for .com and .net and our route operations at the rigorous standards of performance governed by ICANN even in the demanding environment created by COVID-19.  
In respect to our supply chain, we're monitoring these issues and are taking action where appropriate to ensure that we continue to have everything necessary for the ongoing operation of our infrastructure. It is important to remember that our infrastructure is not dependent on a single type of technology, vendor or power source at a given location. 
With regards to our customers, these are clearly uncertain times for businesses and the economy. As we discussed in our blog post, we're taking actions to help small business through our channel partners. In order to support individuals and small businesses affected by this crisis, VeriSign is freezing registry prices for all of our TLDs, including common net, through the end of 2020. In addition, from April 2 until June 1, VeriSign is waiving what is known as the restore fee for .com and .net domain names. Typically, when a domain name registration is deleted by a registrar, there is a period of time during which the person who registered the name can pay a one-time restore fee to get it back before the name goes back into general availability. This helps protect registrants who may have left their domain names lapse accidentally at an inopportune time. 
As it relates to demand for .com and .net domain names, you see in today's results that we saw a good demand for new registrations during the first quarter as well as an improved preliminary renewal rate. That being said, as I stated earlier, recognizing the uncertainty over the duration and economic impact of the COVID-19 crisis, the updated guidance range reflects a more cautious view of domain name base growth for the rest of the year. As a reminder, you can track the performance of the domain name base with daily updates on our website. 
Finally, regarding capital allocation, recognizing that these are unprecedented times, and that is a period of market uncertainty for at least the next quarter, our capital return will be more in line with historical amounts. 
Second question I'll ask and address. With amendment 3 finalized, when can you take price increases for .com? Amendment 3 for the COM Registry Agreement reflects certain changes agreed to under Amendment 35 to the cooperative agreement with the U.S. Department of Commerce, including the pricing changes, which allow limited .com price increases in each of the last 4 years of every 6-year period. The first period began on October 26, 2018. Therefore, October 26, 2020, was the earliest date that VeriSign could have taken a price increase. That said, as we announced in March, VeriSign is freezing its registry prices for all of our top-level domains, including .com and .net, through the end of 2020 in order to support individuals and small businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Also, as a reminder, the com and net registry agreements require VeriSign to provide 6 months notice of any price increase. 
Now the third and last question I'd like to answer before we take yours. Are there any updates on the stats of .web? As mentioned on our last call, we were awaiting a ruling on whether VeriSign could participate in the arbitration called an independent review process under ICANN's rules. As announced in our 10-K in February, the arbitration panel permitted VeriSign and new .co to participate in aspects of the independent review process. We do not have further updates at this time. 
Now we'll open the call for your questions. As a reminder, due to the remote nature of participants, we will do our best to respond to each question, and we appreciate your patience if we experience technical issues. Operator, we're ready for the first question."

You've taken most of mine, but I did want to just flush out the strong renewal rates, which were very strong, and maybe get a bit more color on what you guys are seeing in terms of domain activity. I mean, the slight tweak down of the revised range is fairly modest. And just curious what you guys are seeing and how that plays into your forecasting about any residual effects on SMBs from COVID-19?"

And as we talked about before, that's a normal function that we've seen previously as the base stages. As we look at the domain name base performance itself, clearly here in the first quarter, as Jim mentioned, we had what actually was a good Q1. New units were up 2.1% from a year ago and delivered $1.8 million. As you mentioned, we're keeping an eye on the domain name base and demand for the rest of the year. In the quarter, we saw good strength from the United States registrars. And I would say the China market was a little softer, but the strength from the U.S. registrars really outpaced that and overcompensated for that, helping the domain name base to continue to grow here in Q1."

As people work to address the global challenges posed by COVID-19, we are focused on protecting our people, managing our operations, supporting our local communities and helping small businesses through our general partners. While the issues posed by COVID-19 are unprecedented, they fall within our standard preparation for disruption caused by local, regional and global events. The company's readiness plans, which are routinely exercised, include the ability to maintain critical Internet infrastructure with most employees working remotely. We are prepared to continue to operate all of our services, including registry services for .com and .net and our route operations at the rigorous standards of performance governed by ICANN even in the demanding environment created by COVID-19. 
Additionally, to help our local communities, as announced in March, we made an initial $2 million donation during the first quarter to first responders and medical personnel in the Northern Virginia area, the United Way's Worldwide COVID-19 Community Response and Recovery Fund and Semper Fi & America's Fund. Additional efforts to protect our people, manage our operations, help communities and help small business through our channel partners can be found in our company blog, which is available at verisign.com. 
Now I'd like to address updates and first quarter results. I'm able to report another solid quarter for VeriSign in which we focused on our core business, expanded the domain name base and delivered consistent financial results. 
On March 27, we announced that VeriSign and ICANN entered into the third amendment to the .com registry agreement and a separate binding letter of intent, which formalized a new framework for ICANN and VeriSign to work together on initiatives related to the security ability and resiliency in the domain system. We are pleased with the outcome of the process and remain confident that these agreements will serve the public interest by providing pricing certainty and by helping to hold the security, stability and resiliency in .com and the critical Internet functions it supports globally. 
In addition, we announced that in light of the global disruption caused by COVID-19, we have registry fees for all TLDs, including .com and .net, through the end of 2020. 
As we stated last quarter, regarding the letter of intent, onetime commitment to provide $4 million per year over 5 years beginning on January 1, 2021, for ICANN to support activities to preserve and enhance the security, stability and resiliency of the DNS and the Internet. We believe that the activities funded by this commitment will benefit the entire Internet community. 
Also, as an update, in February, Todd Strubbe was promoted from Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer to President and Chief Operating Officer, further strengthening our senior management team. 
Relating to first quarter operational highlights. At the end of March, the domain name base in .com and .net totaled 160.7 million consisting of 147.3 million names for .com and 13.4 million names for .net with a year-over-year growth rate of 3.8%. During the first quarter, we processed 10 million new registrations, and the domain name base increased by 1.83 million names. Although our renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the first quarter of 2020 will be approximately 75.4%. This preliminary rate compares to 75.0% achieved in the first quarter of 2019 and 73.8% in the fourth quarter of 2019. 
By the way, our press release that we just released this afternoon has a typo. And in the sentence that I just read, in the press release, it says in the fourth quarter of 2020 instead of the fourth quarter of 2019 when it mentions the 73.8% renewal rate. So the fourth -- the first quarter -- sorry, the fourth quarter of 2019 renewal rate was 73.8%. And the typo, it says fourth quarter of 2020. That's getting ahead of yourself, I suppose. So I just wanted to point out that typo. 
So back to the business. For 2020, we now expect a domain name base growth rate of between 2% and 3.75%. Recognizing the uncertainty presented by COVID-19, this updated range reflects a more cautious view of domain name base growth for the balance of the year. 
During the first quarter, we continued our share repurchase program that resulted in 1.3 million shares of common stock repurchased for $245 million. At March 31, 2020, $826 million remain available and authorized under the current share repurchase program, which has no expiration. Our financial and liquidity position remains strong with $1.139 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. We continually evaluate the overall liquidity and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases. 
And now I'd like to turn the call over to George."

For the quarter ended March 31, 2020, the company generated revenue of $313 million, up 2% from the same quarter in 2019, and delivered operating income of $206 million, up 3% from $200 million in the same q",517,"Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. 
For the quarter ended March 31, 2020, the company generated revenue of $313 million, up 2% from the same quarter in 2019, and delivered operating income of $206 million, up 3% from $200 million in the same quarter a year ago. Operating expense totaled $106 million, flat with the first quarter a year ago and lower from $112 million last quarter. The sequential decrease in operating expense is primarily a result of a decrease in sales and marketing expenses in the quarter partially offset by the $2 million in donations that Jim mentioned earlier. 
The operating margin in the quarter came to 66% compared to 65.4% in the same quarter a year ago. Net income totaled $334 million compared to $163 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $2.86 in the first quarter this year compared to $1.35 for the same quarter last year. As noted in our earnings release, net income for the quarter included the recognition of $168 million of previously unrecognized income tax benefits. This income tax benefit increased diluted earnings per share by $1.44. 
As of March 31, 2020, the company maintained total assets of $1.754 billion and total liabilities of $3.163 billion. Assets included $1.139 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Operating cash flow for the first quarter was $180 million, and free cash flow was $169 million compared with $187 million and $178 million, respectively, for the first quarter last year. 
I will now discuss full year 2020 guidance. Revenue is still expected to be in the range of $1.250 billion to $1.265 billion. This revenue range forecast reflects the updated domain name base growth rate of between 2% and 3.75% that Jim mentioned earlier. The operating margin, which includes stock-based compensation, is still expected to be between 64.5% and 65.5%. This guidance range reflects our expectation of incremental and continued investment in our operational infrastructure, security capabilities and sales and marketing expense during the remainder of 2020. 
Interest expense and nonoperating income net is now expected to be an expense of between $80 million and $85 million. This updated range reflects lower expected interest income on cash balances due to decreased interest rates. Capital expenditures are still expected to be between $45 million and $55 million. We now expect our full year effective tax rate to be a benefit of between 2% and 5%, which reflects the $168 million income tax benefit recognized in the first quarter. For the balance of 2020, we expect tax expense as a percent of pretax income of between 19% and 22%. Cash taxes for 2020 will not be impacted by the remeasurement of our accrual for uncertain tax positions discussed earlier and are expected to still be in the range of 18% to 21% of pretax income. 
In summary, VeriSign continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the quarter, and we look forward to continuing our focused execution for the balance of 2020 during this period of market uncertainty. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."

Before moving to the question-and-portion of this call, I would like to acknowledge and efforts of critical staff, not only here at VeriSign but everywhere, of the hard work and commitment they are demonstrating during this crisis. We appreciate the training, skill and dedicated effort of our team, which remains focused on operating our critical infrastructure. I hope everyone remains well and continues to stay safe. 
Given that participants are dialing in remotely for this call, we would like to walk through a few questions which we know are on your mind before we open the call for your additional questions.
The first question I'll ask and then answer is, could you provide more information then on COVID-19's impacts to your business in terms of your infrastructure, supply chain, customers, demand for .com and .net and capital allocation? The answer is that we recognize that VeriSign operates critically within that infrastructure that's relied on now more than ever. Protecting unconditionally the infrastructure that operates registry services for.com and net as well as our root operations remains job one. The company's readiness plans, which are routinely exercised, include the ability to maintain critical Internet infrastructure with most employees working remotely. VeriSign maintains multiple redundant operation centers as well as hundreds of service locations distributed worldwide across 6 continents. 
VeriSign's diverse DNS infrastructure is not dependent on a single type of technology, vendor or power source at a given location, and VeriSign technical teams across the globe are able to perform key functions from multiple locations. 
We are prepared to continue to operate all of our services, including registry services for .com and .net and our route operations at the rigorous standards of performance governed by ICANN even in the demanding environment created by COVID-19. 
In respect to our supply chain, we're monitoring these issues and are taking action where appropriate to ensure that we continue to have everything necessary for the ongoing operation of our infrastructure. It is important to remember that our infrastructure is not dependent on a single type of technology, vendor or power source at a given location. 
With regards to our customers, these are clearly uncertain times for businesses and the economy. As we discussed in our blog post, we're taking actions to help small business through our channel partners. In order to support individuals and small businesses affected by this crisis, VeriSign is freezing registry prices for all of our TLDs, including common net, through the end of 2020. In addition, from April 2 until June 1, VeriSign is waiving what is known as the restore fee for .com and .net domain names. Typically, when a domain name registration is deleted by a registrar, there is a period of time during which the person who registered the name can pay a onetime restore fee to get it back before the name goes back into general availability. This helps protect registrants who may have left their domain names lapse accidentally at an inopportune time. 
As it relates to demand for .com and .net domain names, you see in today's results that we saw a good demand for new registrations during the first quarter as well as an improved preliminary renewal rate. That being said, as I stated earlier, recognizing the uncertainty over the duration and economic impact of the COVID-19 crisis, the updated guidance range reflects a more cautious view of domain name base growth for the rest of the year. As a reminder, you can track the performance of the domain name base with daily updates on our website. 
Finally, regarding capital allocation, recognizing that these are unprecedented times, and that is a period of market uncertainty for at least the next quarter, our capital return will be more in line with historical amounts. 
Second question I'll ask and address. With amendment 3 finalized, when can you take price increases for .com? Amendment 3 for the COM Registry Agreement reflects certain changes agreed to under Amendment 35 to the cooperative agreement with the U.S. Department of Commerce, including the pricing changes, which allow limited .com price increases in each of the last 4 years of every 6-year period. The first period began on October 26, 2018. Therefore, October 26, 2020, was the earliest date that VeriSign could have taken a price increase. That said, as we announced in March, VeriSign is freezing its registry prices for all of our top-level domains, including .com and .net, through the end of 2020 in order to support individuals and small businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Also, as a reminder, the com and net registry agreements require VeriSign to provide 6 months notice of any price increase. 
Now the third and last question I'd like to answer before we take yours. Are there any updates on the stats of .web? As mentioned on our last call, we were awaiting a ruling on whether VeriSign could participate in the arbitration called an independent review process under ICANN's rules. As announced in our 10-K in February, the arbitration panel permitted VeriSign and new .co to participate in aspects of the independent review process. We do not have further updates at this time. 
Now we'll open the call for your questions. As a reminder, due to the remote nature of participants, we will do our best to respond to each question, and we appreciate your patience if we experience technical issues. Operator, we're ready for the first question."

Jim, you guys are already a model of efficiency, but, yes, answering your own questions takes it to a new level. You've taken most of mine, but I did want to just flush out the strong renewal rates, which were very strong, and maybe get a bit more color on what you guys are seeing in terms of domain activity. I mean, the slight tweak down of the revised range is fairly modest. And just curious what you guys are seeing and how that plays into your forecasting about any residual effects on SMBs from COVID-19?"

And as we talked about before, that's a normal function that we've seen previously as the base stages. As we look at the domain name base performance itself, clearly here in the first quarter, as Jim mentioned, we had what actually was a good Q1. New units were up 2.1% from a year ago and delivered $1.8 million. As you mentioned, we're keeping an eye on the domain name base and demand for the rest of the year. In the quarter, we saw good strength from the United States registrars. And I would say the China market was a little softer, but the strength from the U.S. registrars really outpaced that and overcompensated for that, helping the domain name base to continue to grow here in Q1."

Pricing year is defined as October 26 to October 25. This time frame is consistent with Amendment 35 to the cooperative agreement that established the start of the 6-year period as of October 26, 2018.

As people work to address the global challenges posed by COVID-19, we are focused on protecting our people, managing our operations, supporting our local communities and helping small businesses through our general partners. While the issues posed by COVID-19 are unprecedented, they fall within our standard preparation for disruption caused by local, regional and global events. The company's readiness plans, which are routinely exercised, include the ability to maintain critical Internet infrastructure with most employees working remotely. We are prepared to continue to operate all of our services, including registry services for .com and .net and our route operations at the rigorous standards of performance governed by ICANN even in the demanding environment created by COVID-19. 
Additionally, to help our local communities, as announced in March, we made an initial $2 million donation during the first quarter to first responders and medical personnel in the Northern Virginia area, the United Way's Worldwide COVID-19 Community Response and Recovery Fund and Semper Fi & America's Fund. Additional efforts to protect our people, manage our operations, help communities and help small business through our channel partners can be found in our company blog, which is available at verisign.com. 
Now I'd like to address updates and first quarter results. I'm able to report another solid quarter for VeriSign in which we focused on our core business, expanded the domain name base and delivered consistent financial results. 
On March 27, we announced that VeriSign and ICANN entered into the third amendment to the .com registry agreement and a separate binding letter of intent, which formalized a new framework for ICANN and VeriSign to work together on initiatives related to the security ability and resiliency in the domain system. We are pleased with the outcome of the process and remain confident that these agreements will serve the public interest by providing pricing certainty and by helping to hold the security, stability and resiliency in .com and the critical Internet functions it supports globally. 
In addition, we announced that in light of the global disruption caused by COVID-19, we have registry fees for all TLDs, including .com and .net, through the end of 2020. 
As we stated last quarter, regarding the letter of intent, onetime commitment to provide $4 million per year over 5 years beginning on January 1, 2021, for ICANN to support activities to preserve and enhance the security, stability and resiliency of the DNS and the Internet. We believe that the activities funded by this commitment will benefit the entire Internet community. 
Also, as an update, in February, Todd Strubbe was promoted from Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer to President and Chief Operating Officer, further strengthening our senior management team. 
Relating to first quarter operational highlights. At the end of March, the domain name base in .com and .net totaled 160.7 million consisting of 147.3 million names for .com and 13.4 million names for .net with a year-over-year growth rate of 3.8%. During the first quarter, we processed 10 million new registrations, and the domain name base increased by 1.83 million names. Although our renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the first quarter of 2020 will be approximately 75.4%. This preliminary rate compares to 75.0% achieved in the first quarter of 2019 and 73.8% in the fourth quarter of 2019. 
By the way, our press release that we just released this afternoon has a typo. And in the sentence that I just read, in the press release, it says in the fourth quarter of 2020 instead of the fourth quarter of 2019 when it mentions the 73.8% renewal rate. So the fourth -- the first quarter -- sorry, the fourth quarter of 2019 renewal rate was 73.8%. And the typo, it says fourth quarter of 2020. That's getting ahead of yourself, I suppose. So I just wanted to point out that typo. 
So back to the business. For 2020, we now expect a domain name base growth rate of between 2% and 3.75%. Recognizing the uncertainty presented by COVID-19, this updated range reflects a more cautious view of domain name base growth for the balance of the year. 
During the first quarter, we continued our share repurchase program that resulted in 1.3 million shares of common stock repurchased for $245 million. At March 31, 2020, $826 million remain available and authorized under the current share repurchase program, which has no expiration. Our financial and liquidity position remains strong with $1.139 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. We continually evaluate the overall liquidity and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases. 
And now I'd like to turn the call over to George."

For the quarter ended March 31, 2020, the company generated revenue of $313 million, up 2% from the same quarter in 2019, and delivered operating income of $206 million, up 3% from $200 million in the same q",517,"Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. 
For the quarter ended March 31, 2020, the company generated revenue of $313 million, up 2% from the same quarter in 2019, and delivered operating income of $206 million, up 3% from $200 million in the same quarter a year ago. Operating expense totaled $106 million, flat with the first quarter a year ago and lower from $112 million last quarter. The sequential decrease in operating expense is primarily a result of a decrease in sales and marketing expenses in the quarter partially offset by the $2 million in donations that Jim mentioned earlier. 
The operating margin in the quarter came to 66% compared to 65.4% in the same quarter a year ago. Net income totaled $334 million compared to $163 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $2.86 in the first quarter this year compared to $1.35 for the same quarter last year. As noted in our earnings release, net income for the quarter included the recognition of $168 million of previously unrecognized income tax benefits. This income tax benefit increased diluted earnings per share by $1.44. 
As of March 31, 2020, the company maintained total assets of $1.754 billion and total liabilities of $3.163 billion. Assets included $1.139 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Operating cash flow for the first quarter was $180 million, and free cash flow was $169 million compared with $187 million and $178 million, respectively, for the first quarter last year. 
I will now discuss full year 2020 guidance. Revenue is still expected to be in the range of $1.250 billion to $1.265 billion. This revenue range forecast reflects the updated domain name base growth rate of between 2% and 3.75% that Jim mentioned earlier. The operating margin, which includes stock-based compensation, is still expected to be between 64.5% and 65.5%. This guidance range reflects our expectation of incremental and continued investment in our operational infrastructure, security capabilities and sales and marketing expense during the remainder of 2020. 
Interest expense and nonoperating income net is now expected to be an expense of between $80 million and $85 million. This updated range reflects lower expected interest income on cash balances due to decreased interest rates. Capital expenditures are still expected to be between $45 million and $55 million. We now expect our full year effective tax rate to be a benefit of between 2% and 5%, which reflects the $168 million income tax benefit recognized in the first quarter. For the balance of 2020, we expect tax expense as a percent of pretax income of between 19% and 22%. Cash taxes for 2020 will not be impacted by the remeasurement of our accrual for uncertain tax positions discussed earlier and are expected to still be in the range of 18% to 21% of pretax income. 
In summary, VeriSign continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the quarter, and we look forward to continuing our focused execution for the balance of 2020 during this period of market uncertainty. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."

Before moving to the question-and-portion of this call, I would like to acknowledge and efforts of critical staff, not only here at VeriSign but everywhere, of the hard work and commitment they are demonstrating during this crisis. We a",909,"Thank you, George. Before moving to the question-and-portion of this call, I would like to acknowledge and efforts of critical staff, not only here at VeriSign but everywhere, of the hard work and commitment they are demonstrating during this crisis. We appreciate the training, skill and dedicated effort of our team, which remains focused on operating our critical infrastructure. I hope everyone remains well and continues to stay safe. 
Given that participants are dialing in remotely for this call, we would like to walk through a few questions which we know are on your mind before we open the call for your additional questions.
The first question I'll ask and then answer is, could you provide more information then on COVID-19's impacts to your business in terms of your infrastructure, supply chain, customers, demand for .com and .net and capital allocation? The answer is that we recognize that VeriSign operates critically within that infrastructure that's relied on now more than ever. Protecting unconditionally the infrastructure that operates registry services for.com and net as well as our root operations remains job one. The company's readiness plans, which are routinely exercised, include the ability to maintain critical Internet infrastructure with most employees working remotely. VeriSign maintains multiple redundant operation centers as well as hundreds of service locations distributed worldwide across 6 continents. 
VeriSign's diverse DNS infrastructure is not dependent on a single type of technology, vendor or power source at a given location, and VeriSign technical teams across the globe are able to perform key functions from multiple locations. 
We are prepared to continue to operate all of our services, including registry services for .com and .net and our route operations at the rigorous standards of performance governed by ICANN even in the demanding environment created by COVID-19. 
In respect to our supply chain, we're monitoring these issues and are taking action where appropriate to ensure that we continue to have everything necessary for the ongoing operation of our infrastructure. It is important to remember that our infrastructure is not dependent on a single type of technology, vendor or power source at a given location. 
With regards to our customers, these are clearly uncertain times for businesses and the economy. As we discussed in our blog post, we're taking actions to help small business through our channel partners. In order to support individuals and small businesses affected by this crisis, VeriSign is freezing registry prices for all of our TLDs, including common net, through the end of 2020. In addition, from April 2 until June 1, VeriSign is waiving what is known as the restore fee for .com and .net domain names. Typically, when a domain name registration is deleted by a registrar, there is a period of time during which the person who registered the name can pay a onetime restore fee to get it back before the name goes back into general availability. This helps protect registrants who may have left their domain names lapse accidentally at an inopportune time. 
As it relates to demand for .com and .net domain names, you see in today's results that we saw a good demand for new registrations during the first quarter as well as an improved preliminary renewal rate. That being said, as I stated earlier, recognizing the uncertainty over the duration and economic impact of the COVID-19 crisis, the updated guidance range reflects a more cautious view of domain name base growth for the rest of the year. As a reminder, you can track the performance of the domain name base with daily updates on our website. 
Finally, regarding capital allocation, recognizing that these are unprecedented times, and that is a period of market uncertainty for at least the next quarter, our capital return will be more in line with historical amounts. 
Second question I'll ask and address. With amendment 3 finalized, when can you take price increases for .com? Amendment 3 for the COM Registry Agreement reflects certain changes agreed to under Amendment 35 to the cooperative agreement with the U.S. Department of Commerce, including the pricing changes, which allow limited .com price increases in each of the last 4 years of every 6-year period. The first period began on October 26, 2018. Therefore, October 26, 2020, was the earliest date that VeriSign could have taken a price increase. That said, as we announced in March, VeriSign is freezing its registry prices for all of our top-level domains, including .com and .net, through the end of 2020 in order to support individuals and small businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Also, as a reminder, the com and net registry agreements require VeriSign to provide 6 months notice of any price increase. 
Now the third and last question I'd like to answer before we take yours. Are there any updates on the stats of .web? As mentioned on our last call, we were awaiting a ruling on whether VeriSign could participate in the arbitration called an independent review process under ICANN's rules. As announced in our 10-K in February, the arbitration panel permitted VeriSign and new .co to participate in aspects of the independent review process. We do not have further updates at this time. 
Now we'll open the call for your questions. As a reminder, due to the remote nature of participants, we will do our best to respond to each question, and we appreciate your patience if we experience technical issues. Operator, we're ready for the first question."

Jim, you guys are already a model of efficiency, but, yes, answering your own questions takes it to a new level. You've taken most of mine, but I did want to just flush out the strong renewal rates, which were very strong, and maybe get a bit more color on what you guys are seeing in terms of domain activity. I mean the slight tweak down of the revised range is fairly modest. And just curious what you guys are seeing and how that plays into your forecasting about any residual effects on SMBs from COVID-19?"

When we take a deeper look, we see the previously renewed rate really being the driver of that. So we're seeing people who have renewed names previously continue to hold on to those names. And as we talked about before, that's a normal function that we've seen previously as the base stages. As we look at the domain name base performance itself, clearly here in the first quarter, as Jim mentioned, we had what actually was a good Q1. New units were up 2.1% from a year ago and delivered $1.8 million. As you mentioned, we're keeping an eye on the domain name base and demand for the rest of the year. In the quarter, we saw good strength from the United States registrars. And I would say the China market was a little softer, but the strength from the U.S. registrars really outpaced that and overcompensated for that, helping the domain name base to continue to grow here in Q1."

As people work to address the global challenges posed by COVID-19, we are focused on protecting our people, managing our operations, supporting our local communities and helping small businesses through our g",809,"Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. 
As people work to address the global challenges posed by COVID-19, we are focused on protecting our people, managing our operations, supporting our local communities and helping small businesses through our general partners. While the issues posed by COVID-19 are unprecedented, they fall within our standard preparation for disruption caused by local, regional and global events. The company's readiness plans, which are routinely exercised, include the ability to maintain critical Internet infrastructure with most employees working remotely. We are prepared to continue to operate all of our services, including registry services for .com and .net and our route operations at the rigorous standards of performance governed by ICANN even in the demanding environment created by COVID-19. 
Additionally, to help our local communities, as announced in March, we made an initial $2 million donation during the first quarter to first responders and medical personnel in the Northern Virginia area, the United Way's Worldwide COVID-19 Community Response and Recovery Fund and Semper Fi & America's Fund. Additional efforts to protect our people, manage our operations, help communities and help small business through our channel partners can be found in our company blog, which is available at verisign.com. 
Now I'd like to address updates and first quarter results. I'm able to report another solid quarter for VeriSign in which we focused on our core business, expanded the domain name base and delivered consistent financial results. 
On March 27, we announced that VeriSign and ICANN entered into the third amendment to the .com registry agreement and a separate binding letter of intent, which formalized a new framework for ICANN and VeriSign to work together on initiatives related to the security ability and resiliency in the domain system. We are pleased with the outcome of the process and remain confident that these agreements will serve the public interest by providing pricing certainty and by helping to hold the security, stability and resiliency in .com and the critical Internet functions it supports globally. 
In addition, we announced that in light of the global disruption caused by COVID-19, we have registry fees for all TLDs, including .com and .net, through the end of 2020. 
As we stated last quarter, regarding the letter of intent, onetime commitment to provide $4 million per year over 5 years beginning on January 1, 2021, for ICANN to support activities to preserve and enhance the security, stability and resiliency of the DNS and the Internet. We believe that the activities funded by this commitment will benefit the entire Internet community. 
Also, as an update, in February, Todd Strubbe was promoted from Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer to President and Chief Operating Officer, further strengthening our senior management team. 
Relating to first quarter operational highlights. At the end of March, the domain name base in .com and .net totaled 160.7 million consisting of 147.3 million names for .com and 13.4 million names for .net with a year-over-year growth rate of 3.8%. During the first quarter, we processed 10 million new registrations, and the domain name base increased by 1.83 million names. Although our renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the first quarter of 2020 will be approximately 75.4%. This preliminary rate compares to 75.0% achieved in the first quarter of 2019 and 73.8% in the fourth quarter of 2019. 
By the way, our press release that we just released this afternoon has a typo. And in the sentence that I just read, in the press release, it says in the fourth quarter of 2020 instead of the fourth quarter of 2019 when it mentions the 73.8% renewal rate. So the fourth -- the first quarter -- sorry, the fourth quarter of 2019 renewal rate was 73.8%. And the typo, it says fourth quarter of 2020. That's getting ahead of yourself, I suppose. So I just wanted to point out that typo. 
So back to the business. For 2020, we now expect a domain name base growth rate of between 2% and 3.75%. Recognizing the uncertainty presented by COVID-19, this updated range reflects a more cautious view of domain name base growth for the balance of the year. 
During the first quarter, we continued our share repurchase program that resulted in 1.3 million shares of common stock repurchased for $245 million. At March 31, 2020, $826 million remain available and authorized under the current share repurchase program, which has no expiration. Our financial and liquidity position remains strong with $1.139 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. We continually evaluate the overall liquidity and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases. 
And now I'd like to turn the call over to George."

For the quarter ended March 31, 2020, the company generated revenue of $313 million, up 2% from the same quarter in 2019, and delivered operating income of $206 million, up 3% from $200 million in the same q",517,"Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. 
For the quarter ended March 31, 2020, the company generated revenue of $313 million, up 2% from the same quarter in 2019, and delivered operating income of $206 million, up 3% from $200 million in the same quarter a year ago. Operating expense totaled $106 million, flat with the first quarter a year ago and lower from $112 million last quarter. The sequential decrease in operating expense is primarily a result of a decrease in sales and marketing expenses in the quarter partially offset by the $2 million in donations that Jim mentioned earlier. 
The operating margin in the quarter came to 66% compared to 65.4% in the same quarter a year ago. Net income totaled $334 million compared to $163 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $2.86 in the first quarter this year compared to $1.35 for the same quarter last year. As noted in our earnings release, net income for the quarter included the recognition of $168 million of previously unrecognized income tax benefits. This income tax benefit increased diluted earnings per share by $1.44. 
As of March 31, 2020, the company maintained total assets of $1.754 billion and total liabilities of $3.163 billion. Assets included $1.139 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Operating cash flow for the first quarter was $180 million, and free cash flow was $169 million compared with $187 million and $178 million, respectively, for the first quarter last year. 
I will now discuss full year 2020 guidance. Revenue is still expected to be in the range of $1.250 billion to $1.265 billion. This revenue range forecast reflects the updated domain name base growth rate of between 2% and 3.75% that Jim mentioned earlier. The operating margin, which includes stock-based compensation, is still expected to be between 64.5% and 65.5%. This guidance range reflects our expectation of incremental and continued investment in our operational infrastructure, security capabilities and sales and marketing expense during the remainder of 2020. 
Interest expense and nonoperating income net is now expected to be an expense of between $80 million and $85 million. This updated range reflects lower expected interest income on cash balances due to decreased interest rates. Capital expenditures are still expected to be between $45 million and $55 million. We now expect our full year effective tax rate to be a benefit of between 2% and 5%, which reflects the $168 million income tax benefit recognized in the first quarter. For the balance of 2020, we expect tax expense as a percent of pretax income of between 19% and 22%. Cash taxes for 2020 will not be impacted by the remeasurement of our accrual for uncertain tax positions discussed earlier and are expected to still be in the range of 18% to 21% of pretax income. 
In summary, VeriSign continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the quarter, and we look forward to continuing our focused execution for the balance of 2020 during this period of market uncertainty. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."

Before moving to the question-and-portion of this call, I would like to acknowledge and efforts of critical staff, not only here at VeriSign but everywhere, of the hard work and commitment they are demonstrating during this crisis. We a",909,"Thank you, George. Before moving to the question-and-portion of this call, I would like to acknowledge and efforts of critical staff, not only here at VeriSign but everywhere, of the hard work and commitment they are demonstrating during this crisis. We appreciate the training, skill and dedicated effort of our team, which remains focused on operating our critical infrastructure. I hope everyone remains well and continues to stay safe. 
Given that participants are dialing in remotely for this call, we would like to walk through a few questions which we know are on your mind before we open the call for your additional questions.
The first question I'll ask and then answer is, could you provide more information then on COVID-19's impacts to your business in terms of your infrastructure, supply chain, customers, demand for .com and .net and capital allocation? The answer is that we recognize that VeriSign operates critically within that infrastructure that's relied on now more than ever. Protecting unconditionally the infrastructure that operates registry services for.com and net as well as our root operations remains job one. The company's readiness plans, which are routinely exercised, include the ability to maintain critical Internet infrastructure with most employees working remotely. VeriSign maintains multiple redundant operation centers as well as hundreds of service locations distributed worldwide across 6 continents. 
VeriSign's diverse DNS infrastructure is not dependent on a single type of technology, vendor or power source at a given location, and VeriSign technical teams across the globe are able to perform key functions from multiple locations. 
We are prepared to continue to operate all of our services, including registry services for .com and .net and our route operations at the rigorous standards of performance governed by ICANN even in the demanding environment created by COVID-19. 
In respect to our supply chain, we're monitoring these issues and are taking action where appropriate to ensure that we continue to have everything necessary for the ongoing operation of our infrastructure. It is important to remember that our infrastructure is not dependent on a single type of technology, vendor or power source at a given location. 
With regards to our customers, these are clearly uncertain times for businesses and the economy. As we discussed in our blog post, we're taking actions to help small business through our channel partners. In order to support individuals and small businesses affected by this crisis, VeriSign is freezing registry prices for all of our TLDs, including common net, through the end of 2020. In addition, from April 2 until June 1, VeriSign is waiving what is known as the restore fee for .com and .net domain names. Typically, when a domain name registration is deleted by a registrar, there is a period of time during which the person who registered the name can pay a onetime restore fee to get it back before the name goes back into general availability. This helps protect registrants who may have left their domain names lapse accidentally at an inopportune time. 
As it relates to demand for .com and .net domain names, you see in today's results that we saw a good demand for new registrations during the first quarter as well as an improved preliminary renewal rate. That being said, as I stated earlier, recognizing the uncertainty over the duration and economic impact of the COVID-19 crisis, the updated guidance range reflects a more cautious view of domain name base growth for the rest of the year. As a reminder, you can track the performance of the domain name base with daily updates on our website. 
Finally, regarding capital allocation, recognizing that these are unprecedented times, and that is a period of market uncertainty for at least the next quarter, our capital return will be more in line with historical amounts. 
Second question I'll ask and address. With amendment 3 finalized, when can you take price increases for .com? Amendment 3 for the COM Registry Agreement reflects certain changes agreed to under Amendment 35 to the cooperative agreement with the U.S. Department of Commerce, including the pricing changes, which allow limited .com price increases in each of the last 4 years of every 6-year period. The first period began on October 26, 2018. Therefore, October 26, 2020, was the earliest date that VeriSign could have taken a price increase. That said, as we announced in March, VeriSign is freezing its registry prices for all of our top-level domains, including .com and .net, through the end of 2020 in order to support individuals and small businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Also, as a reminder, the com and net registry agreements require VeriSign to provide 6 months notice of any price increase. 
Now the third and last question I'd like to answer before we take yours. Are there any updates on the stats of .web? As mentioned on our last call, we were awaiting a ruling on whether VeriSign could participate in the arbitration called an independent review process under ICANN's rules. As announced in our 10-K in February, the arbitration panel permitted VeriSign and new .co to participate in aspects of the independent review process. We do not have further updates at this time. 
Now we'll open the call for your questions. As a reminder, due to the remote nature of participants, we will do our best to respond to each question, and we appreciate your patience if we experience technical issues. Operator, we're ready for the first question."

Jim, you guys are already a model of efficiency, but, yes, answering your own questions takes it to a new level. You've taken most of mine, but I did want to just flush out the strong renewal rates, which were very strong, and maybe get a bit more color on what you guys are seeing in terms of domain activity.

When we take a deeper look, we see the previously renewed rate really being the driver of that. So we're seeing people who have renewed names previously continue to hold on to those names. And as we talked about before, that's a normal function that we've seen previously as the base stages. As we look at the domain name base performance itself, clearly here in the first quarter, as Jim mentioned, we had what actually was a good Q1. New units were up 2.1% from a year ago and delivered $1.8 million. As you mentioned, we're keeping an eye on the domain name base and demand for the rest of the year. In the quarter, we saw good strength from the United States registrars. And I would say the China market was a little softer, but the strength from the U.S. registrars really outpaced that and overcompensated for that, helping the domain name base to continue to grow here in Q1."

36216,674635675,2044825,"VeriSign, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Jul 23, 2020",2020-07-23,"Earnings Calls","VeriSign, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. With the increased demand for and reliance on Internet services during the COVID-19 crisis, the secure and reliable operation of our infrastructure becomes even more important. Our focus remains on our mission,",511,"Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. With the increased demand for and reliance on Internet services during the COVID-19 crisis, the secure and reliable operation of our infrastructure becomes even more important. Our focus remains on our mission, which is to ensure the availability of our critical infrastructure. We have been and are prepared to continue operating all of our services, including registry services for .com and .net, and our REIT operations at the rigorous standards of performance and availability governed by ICANN, with most of our employees continuing to work remotely. Our focus on mission is emphasized by the fact that the company last week marked 23 years of 100% availability of the .com and .net domain name resolution system. This achievement is a result of the dedication and expertise of our team and of our specialized infrastructure. 
Also, as part of our response to the COVID-19 crisis, we announced in March a freeze of the wholesale prices in all of our TLDS, including .com through the end of 2020. And today, given the current environment, we are further extending that price freeze for the wholesale prices in all of our TLDs through March 31, 2021. Additionally, we are also extending the waiver of the wholesale restore fee for expired domain names through the end of 2020. 
Now I will address our quarterly results. Q2 of 2020 was another consistent quarter for VeriSign, in which we focused on our core business, expanded the domain name base and delivered solid financial results. Regarding second quarter operational highlights, at the end of June, the domain name base in .com and .net totaled $162.1 million, consisting of 148.7 million names for .com and 13.4 million names for .net, with a year-over-year growth rate of 3.8%. During the second quarter, we processed 11.1 million new registrations, and the domain name base increased by 1.41 million names. Although renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the second quarter of 2020 will be approximately 72.8%. This preliminary rate compares to 74.2% achieved in the second quarter of 2019 and 75.4% last quarter. 
For 2020, we now expect a domain name base growth rate of between 2.75% and 4%. This updated range, which recognizes the ongoing uncertainty presented by COVID-19 reflects the strength we have seen in new registrations and our expectation for domain name base growth for the balance of the year. During the second quarter, we continued our share repurchase program that resulted in 730,000 shares of common stock repurchased for $150 million. At June 30, 2020, $676 million remained available and authorized under the current share repurchase program, which has no expiration. 
Our financial and liquidity position remains stable with $1.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. We continually evaluate the overall liquidity and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to George."

For the quarter ended June 30, 2020, the company generated revenue of $314 million, up 2.6% from the same quarter in 2019 and delivered operating income of $207 million, up 2.5% from $202 million in the same quar",478,"Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. For the quarter ended June 30, 2020, the company generated revenue of $314 million, up 2.6% from the same quarter in 2019 and delivered operating income of $207 million, up 2.5% from $202 million in the same quarter a year ago. Operating expense totaled $108 million, up from $105 million in the second quarter a year ago and up from $106 million last quarter. The sequential increase in operating expense is primarily a result of increased sales and marketing spend during the quarter. 
The operating margin in the quarter came to 65.8% compared to 65.9% in the same quarter a year ago. Net income totaled $152 million compared to $148 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $1.32 in the second quarter this year compared to $1.24 for the same quarter last year. Operating cash flow for the second quarter was $215 million, and free cash flow was $204 million compared with the $165 million and $154 million, respectively, from the second quarter last year. Operating cash flow in the second quarter benefited from lower cash tax payments due to the permitted deferral of approximately $50 million in U.S. federal tax payments until the third quarter of 2020. Additionally, the deferred revenue balance increased during the quarter as a result of the strength in new registrations. 
I will now discuss full year 2020 guidance. Revenue is now expected to be in the range of $1.255 billion to $1.265 billion. This revenue range forecast reflects the updated domain name base growth of between 2.75% and 4% that Jim mentioned earlier. Operating margin, which includes stock-based compensation, is still expected to be between 64.5% and 65.5%. This guidance range reflects our expectation of incremental and continued investment in our operational infrastructure, security capabilities and sales and marketing expense during the remainder of 2020. 
Interest expense and nonoperating income net is now expected to be an expense of between $75 million to $80 million. This updated range reflects the additional $5 million gain recognized during the second quarter related to the sale of our security services business. Capital expenditures are still expected to be between $45 million and $55 million. We still expect our full year effective tax rate to be a benefit of between 2% and 5%, which reflects the $168 million income tax benefit recognized in the first quarter. 
For the balance of 2020, we still expect tax expense as a percent of pretax income of between 19% and 22%. Cash taxes for 2020 are now expected to be in the range of 18% to 20% of pretax income. In summary, VeriSign continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the second quarter, and we look forward to continuing our focused execution in the second half of 2020. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."

I'd like to say again that our priorities are our mission of ensuring the availability of our critical infrastructure and the safety of our people. Internet usage has increased during the pandemic and reliance on online services even more so. For many people who are working from home and isolating at home, online services are critical, and more businesses and individuals that never depend on Internet infrastructure for their livelihood. Our record of .com and .net DNS availability speaks volumes about our commitment to our mission. I'd like to acknowledge the team here at VeriSign for their hard work in maintaining our uptime record even during the pandemic. 
Given that participants are dialing in remotely for this call, I would like to walk through a few questions, which we believe are on your mind before we open the call for your additional questions. The first question: With today's announced extension of the price freeze, how should we think about the limited pricing flexibility you have for .com? 
First, as a reminder, the wholesale price for .com domain names has been unchanged at $7.85 for 8 years since 2012. Also, as a reminder, our wholesale prices for .com are governed by our registry agreement with ICANN. The retail price that the end user actually pays for a domain name is set by the retail channel, which is the registrars who have no regulation of their pricing. Additionally, there's an unregulated secondary market for domain names. With that background, under Amendment 3 to the .com registry agreement, VeriSign is now permitted to raise the wholesale price of .com domain names by up to 7% in each of the final 4 years of every 6-year period. Within the current 6-year period, the first year in which we may increase the wholesale price ends on October 25, 2021. And we expect to effectuate a .com wholesale price increase before that October 21 date -- 2021 date. 
The second question: are there any updates on the status of .web? Answer: as we noted last quarter, a final hearing is currently scheduled to begin on August 3 in the independent review process, or IRP, that affiliates initiated in November 2018. That hearing is scheduled to take place by a videoconferencing. As a reminder, VeriSign is not a party in these IRP proceedings, but was granted the right to participate in certain limited aspects. Also, as a reminder, an IRP under ICANN's bylaws is for the purpose of ensuring that ICANN follow its own policies and procedures when making decisions. Our expectation is that following the resolution of the IRP, the ICANN Board will make a final decision on the delegation of the .web TLD. 
Question 3: can you help me better understand what is impacting the increase in new registrations and the lower preliminary quarterly renewal rate for the second quarter. Most of the strength in new registrations comes -- came from registrars in North America. While we don't have the same visibility that retailers do, based on feedback from our retailers, they are seeing increased demand from small businesses getting online. This strength was partially offset by slower activity from registrars in China. As it relates to the preliminary quarterly renewal rate, the year-over-year decrease is primarily related to a lower overall first time renewal rate. Year-over-year, the overall previous renewal rate remained relatively consistent. 
Question 4. Are there any updates to the donations you announced earlier this year? Yes, there are. During the first quarter, we made an initial $2 million donation to organizations assisting those impacted by COVID-19 locally and nationally. During the second quarter, we made a cash contribution of $1 million to the equal justice initiative in support of their work. We are actively working on an expansion to our VeriSign Cares program beyond the $3 million the company donated during the first half of the year again, with a focus on providing assistance to those impacted during the COVID-19 crisis. I'm sure you have questions, and I can only say that these additional efforts should be further along by the time we talk to you again next quarter. 
And now we'll open the call for your questions. Operator, we're ready for the first question."

As far as the China gross adds, they were similar to the gross add levels we had last quarter there, but they were down from year ago levels. As far as renewal rates, Jim mentioned they were down about 1.4% in total year-over-year. And we saw that decline primarily manifests itself in lower first time renewal rates, and they were down also in most markets that we keep an eye on. And as Jim also mentioned, we're a thin registry. We talked to before. We don't have direct visibility into the end user. So it's a little more difficult for us to understand economic impact per se. But in general, gross adds were very strong this quarter. Our net adds were good. They were 1.4 million, was very similar to, if not slightly above third quarter -- I'm sorry, second quarter of 2019 when they totaled 1.3 million."

And the registrant has a chance to get the name back then before it goes into general availability. So it's those names we're talking about. It's already been deleted by the registrar. And so this restore fee is in addition to the standard registration and renewal fee associated with the domain name renewal. And we don't disclose our wholesale or store fee, which is charged to the registrar, and of course, they determine what the actual retail restore fee is.

With the increased demand for and reliance on Internet services during the COVID-19 crisis, the secure and reliable operation of our infrastructure becomes even more important. Our focus remains on our mission, which is to ensure the availability of our critical infrastructure. We have been and are prepared to continue operating all of our services, including registry services for .com and .net, and our route operations at the rigorous standards of performance and availability governed by ICANN, with most of our employees continuing to work remotely. Our focus on mission is emphasized by the fact that the company last week marked 23 years of 100% availability of the .com and .net domain name resolution system. This achievement is a result of the dedication and expertise of our team and our specialized infrastructure.
Also, as part of our response to the COVID-19 crisis, we announced in March a freeze of the wholesale prices in all of our TLDs, including .com through the end of 2020. Today, given the current environment, we are further extending that price freeze for the wholesale prices in all of our TLDs through March 31, 2021. Additionally, we are also extending the waiver of the wholesale restore fee for expired domain names through the end of 2020.
Now I will address our quarterly results. Q2 of 2020 was another consistent quarter for VeriSign, in which we focused on our core business, expanded the domain name base and delivered solid financial results. Regarding second quarter operational highlights, at the end of June, the domain name base in .com and .net totaled 162.1 million, consisting of 148.7 million names for .com and 13.4 million names for .net, with a year-over-year growth rate of 3.8%. During the second quarter, we processed 11.1 million new registrations, and the domain name base increased by 1.41 million names. Although renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the second quarter of 2020 will be approximately 72.8%. This preliminary rate compares to 74.2% achieved in the second quarter of 2019 and 75.4% last quarter. For 2020, we now expect a domain name base growth rate of between 2.75% and 4%. This updated range, which recognizes the ongoing uncertainty presented by COVID-19, reflects the strength we have seen in new registrations and our expectation for domain name base growth for the balance of the year.
During the second quarter, we continued our share repurchase program that resulted in 730,000 shares of common stock repurchased for $150 million. At June 30, 2020, $676 million remained available and authorized under the current share repurchase program, which has no expiration.
Our financial and liquidity position remains stable with $1.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. We continually evaluate the overall liquidity and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to George."

For the quarter ended June 30, 2020, the company generated revenue of $314 million, up 2.6% from the same quarter in 2019 and delivered operating income of $207 million, up 2.5% from $202 million in the same quar",479,"Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. For the quarter ended June 30, 2020, the company generated revenue of $314 million, up 2.6% from the same quarter in 2019 and delivered operating income of $207 million, up 2.5% from $202 million in the same quarter a year ago. Operating expense totaled $108 million, up from $105 million in the second quarter a year ago and up from $106 million last quarter. The sequential increase in operating expense is primarily a result of increased sales and marketing spend during the quarter.
The operating margin in the quarter came to 65.8% compared to 65.9% in the same quarter a year ago. Net income totaled $152 million compared to $148 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $1.32 in the second quarter this year compared to $1.24 for the same quarter last year.
Operating cash flow for the second quarter was $215 million, and free cash flow was $204 million compared with the $165 million and $154 million, respectively, from the second quarter last year. Operating cash flow in the second quarter benefited from the lower cash tax payments due to the permitted deferral of approximately $50 million in U.S. federal tax payments until the third quarter of 2020. Additionally, the deferred revenue balance increased during the quarter as a result of the strength in new registrations.
I will now discuss full year 2020 guidance. Revenue is now expected to be in the range of $1.255 billion to $1.265 billion. This revenue range forecast reflects the updated domain name base growth of between 2.75% and 4% that Jim mentioned earlier. Operating margin, which includes stock-based compensation, is still expected to be between 64.5% and 65.5%. This guidance range reflects our expectation of incremental and continued investment in our operational infrastructure, security capabilities, and sales and marketing expense during the remainder of 2020.
Interest expense and nonoperating income net is now expected to be an expense of between $75 million to $80 million. This updated range reflects the additional $5 million gain recognized during the second quarter related to the sale of our Security Services business. Capital expenditures are still expected to be between $45 million and $55 million.
We still expect our full year effective tax rate to be a benefit of between 2% and 5%, which reflects the $168 million income tax benefit recognized in the first quarter. For the balance of 2020, we still expect tax expense as a percent of pretax income of between 19% and 22%. Cash taxes for 2020 are now expected to be in the range of 18% to 20% of pretax income.
In summary, VeriSign continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the second quarter, and we look forward to continuing our focused execution in the second half of 2020.
Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."

I'd like to say again that our priorities are our mission of ensuring the availability of our critical infrastructure and the safety of our people. Internet usage has increased during the pandemic and reliance on online services even more so. For many people who are working from home and isolating at home, online services are critical, and more businesses and individuals that never depend on Internet infrastructure for their livelihood. Our record of .com and .net DNS availability speaks volumes about our commitment to our mission. I'd like to acknowledge the team here at VeriSign for their hard work in maintaining our uptime record even during the pandemic.
Given that participants are dialing in remotely for this call, I would like to walk through a few questions which we believe are on your mind before we open the call for your additional questions. The first question: With today's announced extension of the price freeze, how should we think about the limited pricing flexibility you have for .com?
First, as a reminder, the wholesale price for .com domain names has been unchanged at $7.85 for 8 years since 2012. Also, as a reminder, our wholesale prices for .com are governed by our registry agreement with ICANN. The retail price that the end user actually pays for a domain name is set by the retail channel, which is the registrars who have no regulation of their pricing. Additionally, there's an unregulated secondary market for domain names. With that background, under Amendment 3 to the .com Registry Agreement, VeriSign is now permitted to raise the wholesale price of .com domain names by up to 7% in each of the final 4 years of every 6-year period. Within the current 6-year period, the first year in which we may increase the wholesale price ends on October 25, 2021. And we expect to effectuate a .com wholesale price increase before that October 21 date -- 2021 date.
The second question: Are there any updates on the status of .web?
Answer: As we noted last quarter, a final hearing is currently scheduled to begin on August 3 in the independent review process, or IRP, that affiliates initiated in November 2018. That hearing is scheduled to take place by a videoconferencing. As a reminder, VeriSign is not a party in these IRP proceedings, but was granted the right to participate in certain limited aspects. Also, as a reminder, an IRP under ICANN's bylaws is for the purpose of ensuring that ICANN followed its own policies and procedures when making decisions. Our expectation is that following the resolution of the IRP, the ICANN Board will make a final decision on the delegation of the .web TLD.
Question 3: Can you help me better understand what is impacting the increase in new registrations and the lower preliminary quarterly renewal rate for the second quarter?
Most of the strength in new registrations comes -- came from registrars in North America. While we don't have the same visibility that retailers do, based on feedback from our retailers, they are seeing increased demand from small businesses getting online. This strength was partially offset by slower activity from registrars in China. As it relates to the preliminary quarterly renewal rate, the year-over-year decrease is primarily related to a lower overall first time renewal rate. Year-over-year, the overall previous renewal rate remained relatively consistent.
Question 4: Are there any updates to the donations you announced earlier this year?
Yes, there are. During the first quarter, we made an initial $2 million donation to organizations assisting those impacted by COVID-19 locally and nationally. During the second quarter, we made a cash contribution of $1 million to the Equal Justice Initiative in support of their work. We are actively working on an expansion to our VeriSign Cares program beyond the $3 million the company donated during the first half of the year, again, with a focus on providing assistance to those impacted during the COVID-19 crisis.
I'm sure you have questions, and I can only say that these additional efforts should be further along by the time we talk to you again next quarter.
And now we'll open the call for your questions. Operator, we're ready for the first question."

As far as renewal rates, Jim mentioned they were down about 1.4% in total year-over-year. And we saw that decline primarily manifests itself in lower first time renewal rates, and they were down also in most markets that we keep an eye on. And as Jim also mentioned, we're a thin registry. We talked to before. We don't have direct visibility into the end user. So it's a little more difficult for us to understand the economic impact per se. But in general, gross adds were very strong this quarter. Our net adds were good. They were 1.4 million.

There's a period of time after a registrar deletes a domain name. That's known as the redemption grace period. It's a 30-day period. And the registrant has a chance to get the name back then before it goes into general availability. So it's those names we're talking about that's already been deleted by the registrar. And so this restore fee is in addition to the standard registration and renewal fee associated with the domain name renewal. And we don't disclose our wholesale restore fee, which is charged to the registrar, and of course, they determine what the actual retail restore fee is. And we've seen many registrars pass on the waiver from a retail perspective. So anecdotally, we believe that small businesses and individuals are benefiting from our waiver."

With the increased demand for and reliance on Internet services during the COVID-19 crisis, the secure and reliable operation of our infrastructure becomes even more important. Our focus remains on our mission, which is to ensure the availability of our critical infrastructure. We have been and are prepared to continue operating all of our services, including registry services for .com and .net, and our route operations at the rigorous standards of performance and availability governed by ICANN, with most of our employees continuing to work remotely. Our focus on mission is emphasized by the fact that the company last week marked 23 years of 100% availability of the .com and .net domain name resolution system. This achievement is the result of the dedication and expertise of our team and of our specialized infrastructure.
Also, as part of our response to the COVID-19 crisis, we announced in March a freeze of the wholesale prices in all of our TLDs, including .com, through the end of 2020. Today, given the current environment, we are further extending that price freeze for the wholesale prices in all of our TLDs through March 31, 2021. Additionally, we are also extending the waiver of the wholesale restore fee for expired domain names through the end of 2020.
Now I will address our quarterly results. 
Q2 of 2020 was another consistent quarter for VeriSign in which we focused on our core business, expanded the domain name base and delivered solid financial results. Regarding second quarter operational highlights, at the end of June, the domain name base in .com and .net totaled 162.1 million, consisting of 148.7 million names for .com and 13.4 million names for .net, with a year-over-year growth rate of 3.8%. During the second quarter, we processed 11.1 million new registrations and the domain name base increased by 1.41 million names. Although renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the second quarter of 2020 will be approximately 72.8%. This preliminary rate compares to 74.2% achieved in the second quarter of 2019 and 75.4% last quarter. 
For 2020, we now expect a domain name base growth rate of between 2.75% and 4%. This updated range, which recognizes the ongoing uncertainty presented by COVID-19, reflects the strength we have seen in new registrations and our expectation for domain name base growth for the balance of the year.
During the second quarter, we continued our share repurchase program that resulted in 730,000 shares of common stock repurchased for $150 million. At June 30, 2020, $676 million remained available and authorized under the current share repurchase program, which has no expiration.
Our financial and liquidity position remains stable with $1.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. We continually evaluate the overall liquidity and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to George."

For the quarter ended June 30, 2020, the company generated revenue of $314 million, up 2.6% from the same quarter in 2019, and delivered operating income of $207 million, up 2.5% from $202 million in the same q",479,"Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. 
For the quarter ended June 30, 2020, the company generated revenue of $314 million, up 2.6% from the same quarter in 2019, and delivered operating income of $207 million, up 2.5% from $202 million in the same quarter a year ago. 
Operating expense totaled $108 million, up from $105 million in the second quarter a year ago and up from $106 million last quarter. The sequential increase in operating expense is primarily a result of increased sales and marketing spend during the quarter. The operating margin in the quarter came to 65.8% compared to 65.9% in the same quarter a year ago. 
Net income totaled $152 million compared to $148 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $1.32 in the second quarter this year compared to $1.24 for the same quarter last year.
Operating cash flow for the second quarter was $215 million and free cash flow was $204 million compared with the $165 million and $154 million, respectively, from the second quarter last year. Operating cash flow in the second quarter benefited from the lower cash tax payments due to the permitted deferral of approximately $50 million in U.S. federal tax payments until the third quarter of 2020. Additionally, the deferred revenue balance increased during the quarter as a result of the strength in new registrations.
I will now discuss full year 2020 guidance. 
Revenue is now expected to be in the range of $1.255 billion to $1.265 billion. This revenue range forecast reflects the updated domain name base growth of between 2.75% and 4% that Jim mentioned earlier. 
Operating margin, which includes stock-based compensation, is still expected to be between 64.5% and 65.5%. This guidance range reflects our expectation of incremental and continued investment in our operational infrastructure, security capabilities, and sales and marketing expense during the remainder of 2020.
Interest expense and nonoperating income net is now expected to be an expense of between $75 million to $80 million. This updated range reflects the additional $5 million gain recognized during the second quarter related to the sale of our Security Services business. 
Capital expenditures are still expected to be between $45 million and $55 million.
We still expect our full year effective tax rate to be a benefit of between 2% and 5%, which reflects the $168 million income tax benefit recognized in the first quarter. For the balance of 2020, we still expect tax expense as a percent of pretax income of between 19% and 22%. Cash taxes for 2020 are now expected to be in the range of 18% to 20% of pretax income.
In summary, VeriSign continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the second quarter, and we look forward to continuing our focused execution in the second half of 2020.
Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."
36216,674635675,2046671,"VeriSign, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Jul 23, 2020",2020-07-23,"Earnings Calls","VeriSign, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, George. I'd like to say again that our priorities are our mission of ensuring the availability of our critical infrastructure and the safety of our people.

I'd like to say again that our priorities are our mission of ensuring the availability of our critical infrastructure and the safety of our people. Internet usage has increased during the pandemic and reliance on online services even more so. For many people who are working from home and isolating at home, online services are critical, and more businesses and individuals that never depend on Internet infrastructure for their livelihood. Our record of .com and .net DNS availability speaks volumes about our commitment to our mission. I'd like to acknowledge the team here at VeriSign for their hard work in maintaining our uptime record even during the pandemic.
Given that participants are dialing in remotely for this call, I would like to walk through a few questions which we believe are on your mind before we open the call for your additional questions. 
The first question: With today's announced extension of the price freeze, how should we think about the limited pricing flexibility you have for .com?
First, as a reminder, the wholesale price for .com domain names has been unchanged at $7.85 for 8 years since 2012. Also, as a reminder, our wholesale prices for .com are governed by our registry agreement with ICANN. The retail price that the end user actually pays for a domain name is set by the retail channel, which is the registrars who have no regulation of their pricing. Additionally, there's an unregulated secondary market for domain names. With that background, under Amendment 3 to the .com Registry Agreement, VeriSign is now permitted to raise the wholesale price of .com domain names by up to 7% in each of the final 4 years of every 6-year period. Within the current 6-year period, the first year in which we may increase the wholesale price ends on October 25, 2021. And we expect to effectuate a .com wholesale price increase before that October 21 date -- 2021 date.
The second question: Are there any updates on the status of .web?
Answer: As we noted last quarter, a final hearing is currently scheduled to begin on August 3 in the independent review process, or IRP, that affiliates initiated in November 2018. That hearing is scheduled to take place via videoconferencing. As a reminder, VeriSign is not a party in these IRP proceedings but was granted the right to participate in certain limited aspects. Also, as a reminder, an IRP under ICANN's bylaws is for the purpose of ensuring that ICANN followed its own policies and procedures when making decisions. Our expectation is that following the resolution of the IRP, the ICANN Board will make a final decision on the delegation of the .web TLD.
Question 3: Can you help me better understand what is impacting the increase in new registrations and the lower preliminary quarterly renewal rate for the second quarter?
Most of the strength in new registrations came from registrars in North America. While we don't have the same visibility that retailers do, based on feedback from our retailers, they are seeing increased demand from small businesses getting online. This strength was partially offset by slower activity from registrars in China. As it relates to the preliminary quarterly renewal rate, the year-over-year decrease is primarily related to a lower overall first time renewal rate. Year-over-year, the overall previous renewal rate remained relatively consistent.
Question 4: Are there any updates to the donations you announced earlier this year?
Yes, there are. During the first quarter, we made an initial $2 million donation to organizations assisting those impacted by COVID-19 locally and nationally. During the second quarter, we made a cash contribution of $1 million to the Equal Justice Initiative in support of their work. We are actively working on an expansion to our VeriSign Cares program beyond the $3 million the company donated during the first half of the year, again, with a focus on providing assistance to those impacted during the COVID-19 crisis. I'm sure you have questions, and I can only say that these additional efforts should be further along by the time we talk to you again next quarter.
And now we'll open the call for your questions. Operator, we're ready for the first question."

As far as the China gross adds, they were similar to the gross add levels we had last quarter there, but they were down from year ago levels. As far as renewal rates, Jim mentioned they were down about 1.4% in total year-over-year. And we saw that decline, primarily, it manifests itself in lower first time renewal rates, and they were down also in most markets that we keep a track -- keep an eye on. And as Jim also mentioned, we're a thin registry. We talked to before. We don't have direct visibility into the end user. So it's a little more difficult for us to understand the economic impact per se. But in general, gross adds were very strong this quarter. Our net adds were good. They were 1.4 million.

And the registrant has a chance to get the name back then before it goes into general availability. So it's those names we're talking about that's already been deleted by the registrar. And so this restore fee is in addition to the standard registration and renewal fee associated with the domain name renewal. And we don't disclose our wholesale restore fee, which is charged to the registrar. And of course, they determine what the actual retail restore fee is.

With the increased demand for and reliance on Internet services during the COVID-19 crisis, the secure and reliable operation of our infrastructure becomes even more important.

With the increased demand for and reliance on Internet services during the COVID-19 crisis, the secure and reliable operation of our infrastructure becomes even more important. Our focus remains on our mission, which is to ensure the availability of our critical infrastructure. We have been and are prepared to continue operating all of our services, including registry services for .com and .net, and our route operations at the rigorous standards of performance and availability governed by ICANN, with most of our employees continuing to work remotely. Our focus on mission is emphasized by the fact that the company last week marked 23 years of 100% availability of the .com and .net domain name resolution system. This achievement is the result of the dedication and expertise of our team and of our specialized infrastructure.
Also, as part of our response to the COVID-19 crisis, we announced in March a freeze of the wholesale prices in all of our TLDs, including .com, through the end of 2020. Today, given the current environment, we are further extending that price freeze for the wholesale prices in all of our TLDs through March 31, 2021. Additionally, we are also extending the waiver of the wholesale restore fee for expired domain names through the end of 2020.
Now I will address our quarterly results. 
Q2 of 2020 was another consistent quarter for VeriSign in which we focused on our core business, expanded the domain name base and delivered solid financial results. Regarding second quarter operational highlights, at the end of June, the domain name base in .com and .net totaled 162.1 million, consisting of 148.7 million names for .com and 13.4 million names for .net, with a year-over-year growth rate of 3.8%. During the second quarter, we processed 11.1 million new registrations and the domain name base increased by 1.41 million names. Although renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the second quarter of 2020 will be approximately 72.8%. This preliminary rate compares to 74.2% achieved in the second quarter of 2019 and 75.4% last quarter. 
For 2020, we now expect a domain name base growth rate of between 2.75% and 4%. This updated range, which recognizes the ongoing uncertainty presented by COVID-19, reflects the strength we have seen in new registrations and our expectation for domain name base growth for the balance of the year.
During the second quarter, we continued our share repurchase program that resulted in 730,000 shares of common stock repurchased for $150 million. At June 30, 2020, $676 million remained available and authorized under the current share repurchase program, which has no expiration.
Our financial and liquidity position remains stable with $1.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. We continually evaluate the overall liquidity and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to George."

The sequential increase in operating expense is primarily a result of increased sales and marketing spend during the quarter. The operating margin in the quarter came to 65.8% compared to 65.9% in the same quarter a year ago. 
Net income totaled $152 million compared to $148 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $1.32 in the second quarter this year compared to $1.24 for the same quarter last year.
Operating cash flow for the second quarter was $215 million and free cash flow was $204 million compared with the $165 million and $154 million, respectively, from the second quarter last year. Operating cash flow in the second quarter benefited from the lower cash tax payments due to the permitted deferral of approximately $50 million in U.S. federal tax payments until the third quarter of 2020. Additionally, the deferred revenue balance increased during the quarter as a result of the strength in new registrations.
I will now discuss full year 2020 guidance. 
Revenue is now expected to be in the range of $1.255 billion to $1.265 billion. This revenue range forecast reflects the updated domain name base growth of between 2.75% and 4% that Jim mentioned earlier. 
Operating margin, which includes stock-based compensation, is still expected to be between 64.5% and 65.5%. This guidance range reflects our expectation of incremental and continued investment in our operational infrastructure, security capabilities, and sales and marketing expense during the remainder of 2020.
Interest expense and nonoperating income net is now expected to be an expense of between $75 million to $80 million. This updated range reflects the additional $5 million gain recognized during the second quarter related to the sale of our Security Services business. 
Capital expenditures are still expected to be between $45 million and $55 million.
We still expect our full year effective tax rate to be a benefit of between 2% and 5%, which reflects the $168 million income tax benefit recognized in the first quarter. For the balance of 2020, we still expect tax expense as a percent of pretax income of between 19% and 22%. Cash taxes for 2020 are now expected to be in the range of 18% to 20% of pretax income.
In summary, VeriSign continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the second quarter, and we look forward to continuing our focused execution in the second half of 2020.
Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."
36216,674635675,2048664,"VeriSign, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Jul 23, 2020",2020-07-23,"Earnings Calls","VeriSign, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, George. I'd like to say again that our priorities are our mission of ensuring the availability of our critical infrastructure and the safety of our people. Internet usage has increased during the pandemic and reliance on online services even",703,"Thank you, George. 
I'd like to say again that our priorities are our mission of ensuring the availability of our critical infrastructure and the safety of our people. Internet usage has increased during the pandemic and reliance on online services even more so. For many people who are working from home and isolating at home, online services are critical, and more businesses and individuals that never depend on Internet infrastructure for their livelihood. Our record of .com and .net DNS availability speaks volumes about our commitment to our mission. I'd like to acknowledge the team here at VeriSign for their hard work in maintaining our uptime record even during the pandemic.
Given that participants are dialing in remotely for this call, I would like to walk through a few questions which we believe are on your mind before we open the call for your additional questions. 
The first question: With today's announced extension of the price freeze, how should we think about the limited pricing flexibility you have for .com?
First, as a reminder, the wholesale price for .com domain names has been unchanged at $7.85 for 8 years since 2012. Also, as a reminder, our wholesale prices for .com are governed by our registry agreement with ICANN. The retail price that the end user actually pays for a domain name is set by the retail channel, which is the registrars who have no regulation of their pricing. Additionally, there's an unregulated secondary market for domain names. With that background, under Amendment 3 to the .com Registry Agreement, VeriSign is now permitted to raise the wholesale price of .com domain names by up to 7% in each of the final 4 years of every 6-year period. Within the current 6-year period, the first year in which we may increase the wholesale price ends on October 25, 2021. And we expect to effectuate a .com wholesale price increase before that October 21 date -- 2021 date.
The second question: Are there any updates on the status of .web?
Answer: As we noted last quarter, a final hearing is currently scheduled to begin on August 3 in the independent review process, or IRP, that affiliates initiated in November 2018. That hearing is scheduled to take place via videoconferencing. As a reminder, VeriSign is not a party in these IRP proceedings but was granted the right to participate in certain limited aspects. Also, as a reminder, an IRP under ICANN's bylaws is for the purpose of ensuring that ICANN followed its own policies and procedures when making decisions. Our expectation is that following the resolution of the IRP, the ICANN Board will make a final decision on the delegation of the .web TLD.
Question 3: Can you help me better understand what is impacting the increase in new registrations and the lower preliminary quarterly renewal rate for the second quarter?
Most of the strength in new registrations came from registrars in North America. While we don't have the same visibility that retailers do, based on feedback from our retailers, they are seeing increased demand from small businesses getting online. This strength was partially offset by slower activity from registrars in China. As it relates to the preliminary quarterly renewal rate, the year-over-year decrease is primarily related to a lower overall first-time renewal rate. Year-over-year, the overall previous renewal rate remained relatively consistent.
Question 4: Are there any updates to the donations you announced earlier this year?
Yes, there are. During the first quarter, we made an initial $2 million donation to organizations assisting those impacted by COVID-19 locally and nationally. During the second quarter, we made a cash contribution of $1 million to the Equal Justice Initiative in support of their work. We are actively working on an expansion to our VeriSign Cares program beyond the $3 million the company donated during the first half of the year, again, with a focus on providing assistance to those impacted during the COVID-19 crisis. I'm sure you have questions, and I can only say that these additional efforts should be further along by the time we talk to you again next quarter.
And now we'll open the call for your questions. Operator, we're ready for the first question."

As far as the China gross adds, they were similar to the gross add levels we had last quarter there, but they were down from year ago levels. As far as renewal rates, Jim mentioned they were down about 1.4% in total year-over-year. And we saw that decline, primarily, it manifests itself in lower first time renewal rates, and they were down also in most markets that we keep a track -- keep an eye on. And as Jim also mentioned, we're a thin registry. We talked to before. We don't have direct visibility into the end user. So it's a little more difficult for us to understand the economic impact per se. But in general, gross adds were very strong this quarter. Our net adds were good. They were 1.4 million. It was very similar to, if not slightly above, third quarter -- I'm sorry, second quarter of 2019 when they totaled 1.3 million."

There's a period of time after a registrar deletes a domain name. That's known as the redemption grace period. It's a 30-day period. And the registrant has a chance to get the name back then before it goes into general availability. So it's those names we're talking about that's already been deleted by the registrar. And so this restore fee is in addition to the standard registration and renewal fee associated with the domain name renewal. And we don't disclose our wholesale restore fee, which is charged to the registrar. And of course, they determine what the actual retail restore fee is. And we've seen many registrars pass on the waiver from a retail perspective. So anecdotally, we believe that small businesses and individuals are benefiting from our waiver."

Today, VeriSign reports [ $318  million ] in revenue for the quarter, up 3.1% from the same quarter a year ago. But before we dive deeper into our results, I wanted to speak just a bit about COVID-19 and how we're addressing it within VeriSign. With the increased demand                 online services during the COVID-19 pandemic, securing the life of                 our infrastructure has become even more important. Our focus remains on our mission, which is to ensure the availability of our critical internet infrastructure for the benefit of Internet users. 
We continue to operate our registry services for comp and net, and our REIT operations at the rigorous standards of performance and availability governed by our agreements with ICANN                 our employees continue to work remotely. 
Now I'll address our quarterly results. The third quarter of 2020 was another consistent quarter for VeriSign, in which we focused on our core business, expanded the domain name base and delivered solid financial results. 
Regarding third quarter operational highlights. At the end of September, the domain name basin .com and .net totaled $163.7 million, consisting of $150.3 million names for .com and $13.4 million names for .net. With a year-over-year growth rate of 4%. 
During the third quarter, we processed 10.9 million new registrations and the domain name base increased by 1.65 million names. Although renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the third quarter of 2020 will be approximately 73.4%. This preliminary rate compares to 73.7% achieved in the third quarter of 2019 and 72.8% last quarter. 
For 2020, we now expect a domain name base growth rate of between 3.5% and 4%. This updated range reflects the strength we have seen in new registrations and our expectations for domain name base growth for the remainder of the year, balanced with the ongoing uncertainty presented by COVID-19. 
During the third quarter, we continued our share repurchase program that resulted in 823,000 shares of common stock repurchase to $170 million. At quarter end, $506 million remained available and authorized under the current share repurchase program, which has no expiration date. 
Our financial and liquidity position remained stable with $1.15 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. We continually evaluate the overall liquidity and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases. And now I'd like to turn the call over to George."

As mentioned, for the quarter ended September 30, 2020, the company generated revenue of $318 million, up 3.1% year-over-year and delivered operating income of $207 million compared with $206 million in the same quarter a year ago. 
Operating expenses totaled $111 million, up from $103 million in the third quarter a year ago and up from $108 million last quarter. The increase in operating expense reflects our continued investments throughout the year in personnel to support our cybersecurity and infrastructure initiatives, among other factors. 
The operating margin in the quarter came to 65% compared to 66.7% in the same quarter a year ago. And 65.8% last quarter. 
Net income totaled $171 million compared to $154 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $1.49 in the third quarter this year compared to $1.30 for the same quarter last year. 
As noted in our earnings release, net income for the third quarter included a previously unrecognized income tax benefit of $24 million, which increased diluted earnings per share by $0.21 and resulted from the remeasurement of VeriSign's accrual for uncertain tax positions. 
Operating cash flow for the third quarter was $140 million and free cash flow was $125 million compared with $208 million and $197 million, respectively, for the third quarter last year. 
Operating cash flow and free cash flow in the third quarter were both lower mainly due to the permitted deferral of $52 million in U.S. federal tax payments until the third quarter, which we mentioned in our last quarter's call. I will now discuss updated full year 2020 guidance. 
Revenue is now expected to be in the range of $1.262 billion to $1.267 billion, this revenue range reflects the updated domain name base growth of between 3.5% and 4% that Jim mentioned earlier. 
The operating margin, which includes stock-based compensation, is now expected to be between 64.75% and 65.25%. This guidance range reflects our expectation of incremental and continued investments in our operational infrastructure and security capabilities as well as sales and marketing expenses during the fourth quarter of 2020. 
Interest expense and nonoperating income net is still expected to be an expense of between $75 million and $80 million. Capital expenditures are now expected to be between $45 million and $50 million. 
We now expect our full year effective tax rate to be a net benefit of between 6% and 9%, which reflects the $168 million and $24 million of previously unrecognized income tax benefits recorded in the first quarter and the third quarter, respectively. Cash taxes for 2020 are still expected to be in the range of 18% to 20% of pretax income. 
In summary, VeriSign continued to demonstrate sound finance performance during the third quarter and we look forward to continuing our focused execution for the remainder of 2020. Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."

I'd like to say again that our priorities continue to be our mission of ensuring the availability of our critical infrastructure and the safety of our people. Internet usage has increased during the pandemic and reliance on online services even more so. For many people who are working from home and isolating at home, online services are critical and more businesses and individuals that ever depend on Internet infrastructure for their livelihood. 
I'd like to acknowledge the team here at VeriSign for their hard work in maintaining our critical internet infrastructure even during a pandemic. We'd like to walk through 2 questions, which we believe are on your mind before we open the call for your additional questions. 
First question, are there any updates regarding your plans to use the limited pricing flexibility you have for .com? No update from what we said last quarter. We still expect to effectuate the dot-com wholesale price increase before October 25, 2021, and the prices for all of our TLDs are frozen through March 31, 2021. 
Second question. Are there any updates on the status of.web? As we noted last quarter, a final hearing was scheduled in August. The hearing took place in early August. The participants, including VeriSign, then submitted their post hearing briefs. A final decision from the panel may be issued later this year or early next year. As a reminder, VeriSign is not a party in these IRP proceedings but was granted the right to participate in certain limited aspects. Also, as a reminder, an IRP under ICANN's bylaws is for the purpose of ensuring that I can follow its own policies and procedures when making decisions. 
Our expectation is that following the resolution of the IRP, the ican Board will make a final decision on the delegation of the DoT Web TLD. And now we'll open the call for your questions. Operator, we're ready for the first question."

And you guys have consistently from that time when you took down the guide on domain growth have kind of ratcheted back up and came in at 4 this quarter, pretty impressive. So I just was wondering if you could maybe step back and talk a little bit about what you're seeing in the environment, a lot of new business starts and it would seem that, that would be offsetting some of the kind of macro concerns that they may be weighing on small businesses or maybe they're holding on to their websites? So would love to hear your thoughts there. And then I had a quick follow-up."

I'll just say that, as I mentioned in my remarks, obviously, people are making greater use of the Internet for a wide variety of reasons for their livelihood or in the pursuit of a livelihood and starting new businesses. Others may not be faring as well. There are a lot of complex reasons that people register, keep and delete domain names, and there's a complex sort of analysis that leads to where the increased growth resulted in the quarter. 
Overall, the numbers speak for themselves in that it was a solid quarter of additional growth. There's clearly additional Internet usage. There's clearly additional growth in the domain name space as a result of that. And it's quite clear as you see in our results and as you observed.

And the trends that we're seeing here in Q3 are very similar to last quarter in that we saw strength in registrations from North American registrars, EMEA registrars and APAC registers. 
New units from China-based registrars during the quarter were similar to Q2 level. However, they were down year-over-year. But overall, a very solid quarter, continuing to see good demand here in the third quarter. And I think, as Jim said, those are just secular trends that we're seeing with people seeing the value and the utility of having a website and getting a domain name to better service their customers and maximize their e-commerce objectives. And I think we're helping to support that, those small businesses in doing that. And those trends, at least so far this year had been good for us."

We've added about 30 or 36 heads since 36 heads since the beginning of the year. And a lot of those additional headcounts are people that we have focused on our cybersecurity and, I would say, software, network engineering functions. And those show up in our R&D and our G&A functions. And so at the end of the quarter, our headcount was about 908 employees, so that was up from 872 at the end of the year. 
So I mean the only only thing I'll say is, look, we've -- we came out of 2018 with a similar level of headcount. We had about 900 people. We've been as high as 1,000 employees in the business. 
If you step back and look at the prior years, we've been in a GAAP operating expense range of around $110 million, $112 million a quarter, clearly in 2020 here. In 2019 as we got out of -- we sold the VSS security business. We had some moving pieces as we were reorganizing the company. But -- and right now, we're at about $111 million for the quarter of GAAP operating expense here. 
So we've been in this range for a long period of time. And we're, as we always are, we're managing the expenses of the business to meet the needs of the business. And I think we've been doing that reasonably well over the past the 7 or 8 years, and we're going to continue to do that. 
But the -- to answer your question, it's really been this additional headcount that we've added in our security and stability initiative."

Sterling, I would just add, too, that there's always a baseline of funding that we make available and increase just simply because a huge aspect of what we do is cybersecurity, which is very difficult to predict, the threat environment is constantly involving. It's generally always intensifying and increasing and so there are constant investments we make in training, education, new highest people, technology, hardening our infrastructure, improving its resiliency that are ongoing. In addition, there are responses that we have to make to new threats that are anticipated. These just are routine and happen all the time, but the precise nature the precise response, and therefore, the price -- the precise budgetary aspect of the response is difficult to predict. What you're seeing is our best estimates based on a long history of experience of doing these kinds of things. 
In addition, we fund research and that research evolves. And we recently identified, for example, a huge number of queries that were out coming into the root servers, a massive spike in queries that were literally the result of unintentional activities with that browser behavior that we were able to actually highlight point out, and help rectify and eliminate a huge amount of volume that was hitting the -- all 13 of the REIT service. 
There's quite a bit of this research that we do and published. We've done work in name collisions. We do a lot of root instrumentation that helps manage and improve performance and security across across the net, we identified the names that are the source of botnets and other sorts of cyber attacks. We share those with different companies, government agencies. So the teams that are working on that are always evolving, growing, training, hiring additional folks. That's our primary mission. 
We address it in many broad ways, but it's our top priority. So it shouldn't be a surprise that at times, you're going to see increased spending on it. It's just the nature of the business that we're in. And that's our expertise, and that's our mission."

Today, VeriSign reports  $318  million in revenue for the quarter, up 3.1% from the same quarter a year ago. But before we dive deeper into our results, I wanted to speak just a bit about COVID-19 and how we're addressing it within VeriSign. With the increased demand for internet and online services during the COVID-19 pandemic, securing the [indiscernible] operation of our infrastructure has become even more important. Our focus remains on our mission, which is to ensure the availability of our critical internet infrastructure for the benefit of Internet users.  
We continue to operate our registry services for com and net, and our root operations at the rigorous standards of performance and availability governed by our agreements with ICANN, while most of our employees continue to work remotely.  
Now I'll address our quarterly results. The third quarter of 2020 was another consistent quarter for VeriSign, in which we focused on our core business, expanded the domain name base and delivered solid financial results.  
Regarding third quarter operational highlights. At the end of September, the domain name base and .com and .net totaled $163.7 million, consisting of $150.3 million names for .com and $13.4 million names for .net. With a year-over-year growth rate of 4%.  
During the third quarter, we processed 10.9 million new registrations and the domain name base increased by 1.65 million names. Although renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the third quarter of 2020 will be approximately 73.4%. This preliminary rate compares to 73.7% achieved in the third quarter of 2019 and 72.8% last quarter.  
For 2020, we now expect a domain name base growth rate of between 3.5% and 4%. This updated range reflects the strength we have seen in new registrations and our expectations for domain name base growth for the remainder of the year, balanced with the ongoing uncertainty presented by COVID-19.  
During the third quarter, we continued our share repurchase program that resulted in 823,000 shares of common stock repurchase to $170 million. At quarter end, $506 million remained available and authorized under the current share repurchase program, which has no expiration date.  
Our financial and liquidity position remained stable with $1.15 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. We continually evaluate the overall liquidity and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases. And now I'd like to turn the call over to George."

As mentioned, for the quarter ended September 30, 2020, the company generated revenue of $318 million, up 3.1% year-over-year and delivered operating income of $207 million compared with $206 million in the same quarter a year ago. 
Operating expenses totaled $111 million, up from $103 million in the third quarter a year ago and up from $108 million last quarter. The increase in operating expense reflects our continued investments throughout the year in personnel to support our cybersecurity and infrastructure initiatives, among other factors. 
The operating margin in the quarter came to 65% compared to 66.7% in the same quarter a year ago, and 65.8% last quarter. 
Net income totaled $171 million compared to $154 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $1.49 in the third quarter this year compared to $1.30 for the same quarter last year. 
As noted in our earnings release, net income for the third quarter included a previously unrecognized income tax benefit of $24 million, which increased diluted earnings per share by $0.21 and resulted from the remeasurement of VeriSign's accrual for uncertain tax positions. 
Operating cash flow for the third quarter was $140 million and free cash flow was $125 million compared with $208 million and $197 million, respectively, for the third quarter last year. 
Operating cash flow and free cash flow in the third quarter were both lower, mainly due to the permitted deferral of $52 million in U.S. federal tax payments until the third quarter, which we mentioned in our last quarter's call. I will now discuss updated full year 2020 guidance. 
Revenue is now expected to be in the range of $1.262 billion to $1.267 billion. This revenue range reflects the updated domain name base growth of between 3.5% and 4% that Jim mentioned earlier. 
The operating margin, which includes stock-based compensation, is now expected to be between 64.75% and 65.25%. This guidance range reflects our expectation of incremental and continued investments in our operational infrastructure and security capabilities as well as sales and marketing expenses during the fourth quarter of 2020. 
Interest expense and nonoperating income net is still expected to be an expense of between $75 million and $80 million. Capital expenditures are now expected to be between $45 million and $50 million. 
We now expect our full year effective tax rate to be a net benefit of between 6% and 9%, which reflects the $168 million and $24 million of previously unrecognized income tax benefits recorded in the first quarter and the third quarter, respectively. Cash taxes for 2020 are still expected to be in the range of 18% to 20% of pretax income. 
In summary, VeriSign continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the third quarter and we look forward to continuing our focused execution for the remainder of 2020. Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."

I'd like to say again that our priorities continue to be our mission of ensuring the availability of our critical infrastructure and the safety of our people. Internet usage has increased during the pandemic and reliance on online services even more so. For many people who are working from home and isolating at home, online services are critical and more businesses and individuals that ever depend on Internet infrastructure for their livelihood. 
I'd like to acknowledge the team here at VeriSign for their hard work in maintaining our critical internet infrastructure even during a pandemic. We'd like to walk through 2 questions, which we believe are on your mind before we open the call for your additional questions. 
First question, are there any updates regarding your plans to use the limited pricing flexibility you have for .com? No update from what we said last quarter. We still expect to effectuate the dot-com wholesale price increase before October 25, 2021, and the prices for all of our TLDs are frozen through March 31, 2021. 
Second question. Are there any updates on the status of .web? As we noted last quarter, a final hearing was scheduled in August. The hearing took place in early August. The participants, including VeriSign, then submitted their post hearing briefs. A final decision from the panel may be issued later this year or early next year. As a reminder, VeriSign is not a party in these IRP proceedings but was granted the right to participate in certain limited aspects. Also, as a reminder, an IRP under ICANN's bylaws is for the purpose of ensuring that ICANN followed its own policies and procedures when making decisions. 
Our expectation is that following the resolution of the IRP, the ICANN Board will make a final decision on the delegation of the DoT Web TLD. And now we'll open the call for your questions. Operator, we're ready for the first question."

So I just was wondering if you could maybe step back and talk a little bit about what you're seeing in the environment, a lot of new business starts and it would seem that, that would be offsetting some of the kind of macro concerns that they may be weighing on small businesses or maybe they're holding on to their websites?

Others may not be faring as well. There are a lot of complex reasons that people register, keep and delete domain names, and there's a complex sort of analysis that leads to where the increased growth resulted in the quarter. 
Overall, the numbers speak for themselves in that it was a solid quarter of additional growth. There's clearly additional Internet usage. There's clearly additional growth in the domain name space as a result of that. And it's quite clear as you see in our results and as you observed.

New units from China-based registrars during the quarter were similar to Q2 level. However, they were down year-over-year. But overall, a very solid quarter, continuing to see good demand here in the third quarter. And I think, as Jim said, those are just secular trends that we're seeing with people, seeing the value and the utility of having a website and getting a domain name to better service their customers and maximize their e-commerce objectives. And I think we're helping to support that, those small businesses in doing that. And those trends, at least so far this year have been good for us."

We've added about 30 or 36 heads since -- 36 heads since the beginning of the year. And a lot of those additional headcounts are people that we have focused on are cybersecurity and, I would say, software, network engineering functions. And those show up in our R&D and our G&A functions. And so at the end of the quarter, our headcount was about 908 employees, so that was up from 872 at the end of the year. 
So I mean the only other thing I'll say is, look, we've -- we came out of 2018 with a similar level of headcount. We had about 900 people. We've been as high as 1,000 employees in the business. 
If you step back and look at the prior years, we've been in a GAAP operating expense range of around $110 million, $112 million a quarter, clearly in 2020 here. In 2019 as we got out of -- we sold the VSS security business. We had some moving pieces as we were reorganizing the company. But -- and right now, we're at about $111 million for the quarter of GAAP operating expense here. 
So we've been in this range for a long period of time. And we're, as we always are, we're managing the expenses of the business to meet the needs of the business. And I think we've been doing that reasonably well over the past the 7 or 8 years, and we're going to continue to do that.

Sterling, I would just add too, that there's always a baseline of funding that we make available and increase just simply because a huge aspect of what we do is cybersecurity, which is very difficult to predict, the threat environment is constantly evolving. It's generally always intensifying and increasing and so there are constant investments we make in training, education, new hires, people, technology, hardening our infrastructure, improving its resiliency that are ongoing. In addition, there are responses that we have to make to new threats that are anticipated. These just are routine and happen all the time, but the precise nature, the precise response, and therefore, the price -- the precise budgetary aspect of the response is difficult to predict. What you're seeing is our best estimates based on a long history of experience of doing these kinds of things. 
In addition, we fund research and that research evolves. And we recently identified, for example, a huge number of queries that were out coming into the root servers, a massive spike in queries that were literally the result of unintentional activities with that browser behavior that we were able to actually highlight, point out, and help rectify and eliminate a huge amount of volume that was hitting the -- all 13 of the root servers. 
There's quite a bit of this research that we do and published. We've done work in name collisions. We do a lot of root instrumentation that helps manage and improve performance and security across the net, we identified the names that are the source of botnets and other sorts of cyber attacks. We share those with different companies, government agencies. So the teams that are working on that are always evolving, growing, training, hiring additional folks. That's our primary mission. 
We address it in many broad ways, but it's our top priority. So it shouldn't be a surprise that at times, you're going to see increased spending on it. It's just the nature of the business that we're in. And that's our expertise, and that's our mission."

Today, VeriSign reports  $318  million in revenue for the quarter, up 3.1% from the same quarter a year ago. But before we dive deeper into our results, I wanted to speak just a bit about COVID-19 and how we're addressing it within VeriSign. With the increased demand for internet and online services during the COVID-19 pandemic, the secure and reliable operation of our infrastructure has become even more important. Our focus remains on our mission, which is to ensure the availability of our critical internet infrastructure for the benefit of Internet users.  
We continue to operate our registry services for com and net, and our root operations at the rigorous standards of performance and availability governed by our agreements with ICANN, while most of our employees continue to work remotely.  
Now I'll address our quarterly results. The third quarter of 2020 was another consistent quarter for VeriSign, in which we focused on our core business, expanded the domain name base and delivered solid financial results.  
Regarding third quarter operational highlights. At the end of September, the domain name base and .com and .net totaled $163.7 million, consisting of $150.3 million names for .com and $13.4 million names for .net. With a year-over-year growth rate of 4%. 
During the third quarter, we processed 10.9 million new registrations and the domain name base increased by 1.65 million names. Although renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the third quarter of 2020 will be approximately 73.4%. This preliminary rate compares to 73.7% achieved in the third quarter of 2019 and 72.8% last quarter. 
For 2020, we now expect a domain name base growth rate of between 3.5% and 4%. This updated range reflects the strength we have seen in new registrations and our expectations for domain name base growth for the remainder of the year, balanced with the ongoing uncertainty presented by COVID-19.  
During the third quarter, we continued our share repurchase program that resulted in 823,000 shares of common stock repurchased for $170 million. At quarter end, $506 million remained available and authorized under the current share repurchase program, which has no expiration date.  
Our financial and liquidity position remained stable with $1.15 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. We continually evaluate the overall liquidity and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases. And now I'd like to turn the call over to George."

Operating expenses totaled $111 million, up from $103 million in the third quarter a year ago and up from $108 million last quarter. The increase in operating expense reflects our continued investments throughout the year in personnel to support our cybersecurity and infrastructure initiatives, among other factors.
The operating margin in the quarter came to 65% compared to 66.7% in the same quarter a year ago, and 65.8% last quarter.
Net income totaled $171 million compared to $154 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $1.49 in the third quarter this year compared to $1.30 for the same quarter last year.
As noted in our earnings release, net income for the third quarter included a previously unrecognized income tax benefit of $24 million, which increased diluted earnings per share by $0.21 and resulted from the remeasurement of VeriSign's accrual for uncertain tax positions.
Operating cash flow for the third quarter was $140 million and free cash flow was $125 million compared with $208 million and $197 million, respectively, for the third quarter last year.
Operating cash flow and free cash flow in the third quarter were both lower, mainly due to the permitted deferral of $52 million in U.S. federal tax payments until the third quarter, which we mentioned in our last quarter's call. I will now discuss updated full year 2020 guidance.
Revenue is now expected to be in the range of $1.262 billion to $1.267 billion. This revenue range reflects the updated domain name base growth of between 3.5% and 4% that Jim mentioned earlier.
The operating margin, which includes stock-based compensation, is now expected to be between 64.75% and 65.25%. This guidance range reflects our expectation of incremental and continued investments in our operational infrastructure and security capabilities as well as sales and marketing expenses during the fourth quarter of 2020.
Interest expense and nonoperating income net is still expected to be an expense of between $75 million and $80 million. Capital expenditures are now expected to be between $45 million and $50 million.
We now expect our full year effective tax rate to be a net benefit of between 6% and 9%, which reflects the $168 million and $24 million of previously unrecognized income tax benefits recorded in the first quarter and the third quarter, respectively. Cash taxes for 2020 are still expected to be in the range of 18% to 20% of pretax income.
In summary, VeriSign continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the third quarter and we look forward to continuing our focused execution for the remainder of 2020. Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."

I'd like to acknowledge the team here at VeriSign for their hard work in maintaining our critical internet infrastructure even during a pandemic. We'd like to walk through 2 questions, which we believe are on your mind before we open the call for your additional questions.
First question, are there any updates regarding your plans to use the limited pricing flexibility you have for .com? No update from what we said last quarter. We still expect to effectuate the dot-com wholesale price increase before October 25, 2021, and the prices for all of our TLDs are frozen through March 31, 2021.
Second question. Are there any updates on the status of .web? As we noted last quarter, a final hearing was scheduled in August. The hearing took place in early August. The participants, including VeriSign, then submitted their post hearing briefs. A final decision from the panel may be issued later this year or early next year. As a reminder, VeriSign is not a party in these IRP proceedings but was granted the right to participate in certain limited aspects. Also, as a reminder, an IRP under ICANN's bylaws is for the purpose of ensuring that ICANN followed its own policies and procedures when making decisions.
Our expectation is that following the resolution of the IRP, the ICANN Board will make a final decision on the delegation of the DoT Web TLD. And now we'll open the call for your questions. Operator, we're ready for the first question."

Others may not be faring as well. There are a lot of complex reasons that people register, keep and delete domain names, and there's a complex sort of analysis that leads to where the increased growth resulted in the quarter.
Overall, the numbers speak for themselves in that it was a solid quarter of additional growth. There's clearly additional Internet usage.

New units from China-based registrars during the quarter were similar to Q2 level. However, they were down year-over-year. But overall, a very solid quarter, continuing to see good demand here in the third quarter. And I think, as Jim said, those are just secular trends that we're seeing with people, seeing the value and the utility of having a website and getting a domain name to better service their customers and maximize their e-commerce objectives.

And our expectation, as I said, is that following that resolution, the ICANN board then -- the matter will be returned to ICANN for its process, which is to make a final decision on the delegation of the .web TLD. So that's the expectation. As in any litigation, it's really not proper to speculate on those outcomes, obviously, when something is pending. But we do know in the process, what's pending here, which is a decision by the panel. And they have the final hearing what's scheduled and it was held. And of course, as a participant, but not a litigant, so to speak, we were there at the table. So we're waiting. Hopefully, by the end of this year or early next year. We will hear from the panel. They will answer the allegations by the plaintiff affiliates against ICANN and then the matter should be handed to the ICANN Board for resolution on the .web issue. That's our expectation.

COM is a good brand, and its performance is strong. And registrants like the .com brand because it helps them get found.

And a lot of those additional headcounts are people that we have focused on are cybersecurity and, I would say, software, network engineering functions. And those show up in our R&D and our G&A functions. And so at the end of the quarter, our headcount was about 908 employees, so that was up from 872 at the end of the year.
So I mean the only other thing I'll say is, look, we've -- we came out of 2018 with a similar level of headcount. We had about 900 people. We've been as high as 1,000 employees in the business.
If you step back and look at the prior years, we've been in a GAAP operating expense range of around $110 million, $112 million a quarter, clearly in 2020 here. In 2019 as we got out of -- we sold the VSS security business. We had some moving pieces as we were reorganizing the company. But -- and right now, we're at about $111 million for the quarter of GAAP operating expense here.
So we've been in this range for a long period of time. And we're, as we always are, we're managing the expenses of the business to meet the needs of the business. And I think we've been doing that reasonably well over the past the 7 or 8 years, and we're going to continue to do that.

Sterling, I would just add too, that there's always a baseline of funding that we make available and increase just simply because a huge aspect of what we do is cybersecurity, which is very difficult to predict, the threat environment is constantly evolving. It's generally always intensifying and increasing and so there are constant investments we make in training, education, new hires, people, technology, hardening our infrastructure, improving its resiliency that are ongoing. In addition, there are responses that we have to make to new threats that are anticipated. These just are routine and happen all the time, but the precise nature, the precise response, and therefore, the price -- the precise budgetary aspect of the response is difficult to predict. What you're seeing is our best estimates based on a long history of experience of doing these kinds of things.
In addition, we fund research and that research evolves. And we recently identified, for example, a huge number of queries that were out coming into the root servers, a massive spike in queries that were literally the result of unintentional activities with that browser behavior that we were able to actually highlight, point out, and help rectify and eliminate a huge amount of volume that was hitting the -- all 13 of the root servers.
There's quite a bit of this research that we do and published. We've done work in name collisions. We do a lot of root instrumentation that helps manage and improve performance and security across the net, we identified the names that are the source of botnets and other sorts of cyberattacks. We share those with different companies, government agencies. So the teams that are working on that are always evolving, growing, training, hiring additional folks. That's our primary mission.
We address it in many broad ways, but it's our top priority. So it shouldn't be a surprise that at times, you're going to see increased spending on it. It's just the nature of the business that we're in. And that's our expertise, and that's our mission."

Today, VeriSign reports  $318  million in revenue for the quarter, up 3.1% from the same quarter a year ago. But before we dive deeper into our results, I wanted to speak just a bit about COVID-19 and how we're addressing it within VeriSign. With the increased demand for internet and online services during the COVID-19 pandemic, the secure and reliable operation of our infrastructure has become even more important. Our focus remains on our mission, which is to ensure the availability of our critical internet infrastructure for the benefit of Internet users.  
We continue to operate our registry services for com and net, and our root operations at the rigorous standards of performance and availability governed by our agreements with ICANN, while most of our employees continue to work remotely.  
Now I'll address our quarterly results. The third quarter of 2020 was another consistent quarter for VeriSign, in which we focused on our core business, expanded the domain name base and delivered solid financial results.  
Regarding third quarter operational highlights. At the end of September, the domain name base and .com and .net totaled $163.7 million, consisting of $150.3 million names for .com and $13.4 million names for .net. With a year-over-year growth rate of 4%. 
During the third quarter, we processed 10.9 million new registrations and the domain name base increased by 1.65 million names. Although renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the third quarter of 2020 will be approximately 73.4%. This preliminary rate compares to 73.7% achieved in the third quarter of 2019 and 72.8% last quarter. 
For 2020, we now expect a domain name base growth rate of between 3.5% and 4%. This updated range reflects the strength we have seen in new registrations and our expectations for domain name base growth for the remainder of the year, balanced with the ongoing uncertainty presented by COVID-19.  
During the third quarter, we continued our share repurchase program that resulted in 823,000 shares of common stock repurchased for $170 million. At quarter end, $506 million remained available and authorized under the current share repurchase program, which has no expiration date.  
Our financial and liquidity position remained stable with $1.15 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. We continually evaluate the overall liquidity and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases. And now I'd like to turn the call over to George."

Operating expenses totaled $111 million, up from $103 million in the third quarter a year ago and up from $108 million last quarter. The increase in operating expense reflects our continued investments throughout the year in personnel to support our cybersecurity and infrastructure initiatives, among other factors.
The operating margin in the quarter came to 65% compared to 66.7% in the same quarter a year ago, and 65.8% last quarter.
Net income totaled $171 million compared to $154 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $1.49 in the third quarter this year compared to $1.30 for the same quarter last year.
As noted in our earnings release, net income for the third quarter included a previously unrecognized income tax benefit of $24 million, which increased diluted earnings per share by $0.21 and resulted from the remeasurement of VeriSign's accrual for uncertain tax positions.
Operating cash flow for the third quarter was $140 million and free cash flow was $125 million compared with $208 million and $197 million, respectively, for the third quarter last year.
Operating cash flow and free cash flow in the third quarter were both lower, mainly due to the permitted deferral of $52 million in U.S. federal tax payments until the third quarter, which we mentioned in our last quarter's call. I will now discuss updated full year 2020 guidance.
Revenue is now expected to be in the range of $1.262 billion to $1.267 billion. This revenue range reflects the updated domain name base growth of between 3.5% and 4% that Jim mentioned earlier.
The operating margin, which includes stock-based compensation, is now expected to be between 64.75% and 65.25%. This guidance range reflects our expectation of incremental and continued investments in our operational infrastructure and security capabilities as well as sales and marketing expenses during the fourth quarter of 2020.
Interest expense and nonoperating income net is still expected to be an expense of between $75 million and $80 million. Capital expenditures are now expected to be between $45 million and $50 million.
We now expect our full year effective tax rate to be a net benefit of between 6% and 9%, which reflects the $168 million and $24 million of previously unrecognized income tax benefits recorded in the first quarter and the third quarter, respectively. Cash taxes for 2020 are still expected to be in the range of 18% to 20% of pretax income.
In summary, VeriSign continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the third quarter and we look forward to continuing our focused execution for the remainder of 2020. Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."

I'd like to say again that our priorities continue to be our mission of ensuring the availability of our critical infrastructure and the safety of our people. Internet usage has increased during the pandemic and reliance on online services even more so. For many people who are working from home and isolating at home, online services are critical and more businesses and individuals that ever depend on Internet infrastructure for their livelihood.
I'd like to acknowledge the team here at VeriSign for their hard work in maintaining our critical internet infrastructure even during a pandemic. We'd like to walk through 2 questions, which we believe are on your mind before we open the call for your additional questions.
First question, are there any updates regarding your plans to use the limited pricing flexibility you have for .com? No update from what we said last quarter. We still expect to effectuate the dot-com wholesale price increase before October 25, 2021, and the prices for all of our TLDs are frozen through March 31, 2021.
Second question. Are there any updates on the status of .web? As we noted last quarter, a final hearing was scheduled in August. The hearing took place in early August. The participants, including VeriSign, then submitted their post hearing briefs. A final decision from the panel may be issued later this year or early next year. As a reminder, VeriSign is not a party in these IRP proceedings but was granted the right to participate in certain limited aspects. Also, as a reminder, an IRP under ICANN's bylaws is for the purpose of ensuring that ICANN followed its own policies and procedures when making decisions.
Our expectation is that following the resolution of the IRP, the ICANN Board will make a final decision on the delegation of the DoT Web TLD. And now we'll open the call for your questions. Operator, we're ready for the first question."

And you guys have consistently from that time when you took down the guide on domain growth have kind of ratcheted back up and came in at 4 this quarter, pretty impressive. So I just was wondering if you could maybe step back and talk a little bit about what you're seeing in the environment, a lot of new business starts and it would seem that, that would be offsetting some of the kind of macro concerns that they may be weighing on small businesses or maybe they're holding on to their websites? I would love to hear your thoughts there. And then I had a quick follow-up."

Others may not be faring as well. There are a lot of complex reasons that people register, keep and delete domain names, and there's a complex sort of analysis that leads to where the increased growth resulted in the quarter.
Overall, the numbers speak for themselves in that it was a solid quarter of additional growth. There's clearly additional Internet usage. There's clearly additional growth in the domain name space as a result of that. And it's quite clear as you see in our results and as you observed.

New units from China-based registrars during the quarter were similar to Q2 level. However, they were down year-over-year. But overall, a very solid quarter, continuing to see good demand here in the third quarter. And I think, as Jim said, those are just secular trends that we're seeing with people, seeing the value and the utility of having a website and getting a domain name to better service their customers and maximize their e-commerce objectives. And I think we're helping to support that, those small businesses in doing that. And those trends, at least so far this year have been good for us."

So that's the expectation. As in any litigation, it's really not proper to speculate on those outcomes, obviously, when something is pending. But we do know in the process, what's pending here, which is a decision by the panel. And they have the final hearing what's scheduled and it was held. And of course, as a participant, but not a litigant, so to speak, we were there at the table. So we're waiting. Hopefully, by the end of this year or early next year. We will hear from the panel.

I can tell you, though, that the market does not consist only of.com and then new gTLDs or alternate TLDS, there's a large and thriving market of country code TLDs like .cn for China, .de for Germany. Many of those have been commercialized like .co from Colombia, .co is a commercialized TLD that many, many organizations and individuals have chosen to brand themselves on. And there are a large number of those. So the market is far broader than that.
COM is a good brand, and its performance is strong. And registrants like the .com brand because it helps them get found. But beyond that, without seeing what you're referring to, I really can't comment on it. I would just caution that very often, when I've seen people talk about the market, they haven't really considered how large that market is. I would also refer you to our domain name brief. I think there's a good survey of all of the TLDs there.
And I think if you look at that, you might get a slightly different picture. So I hope that's helpful."

So I mean the only other thing I'll say is, look, we've -- we came out of 2018 with a similar level of headcount. We had about 900 people. We've been as high as 1,000 employees in the business.
If you step back and look at the prior years, we've been in a GAAP operating expense range of around $110 million, $112 million a quarter, clearly in 2020 here. In 2019 as we got out of -- we sold the VSS security business. We had some moving pieces as we were reorganizing the company. But -- and right now, we're at about $111 million for the quarter of GAAP operating expense here.
So we've been in this range for a long period of time. And we're, as we always are, we're managing the expenses of the business to meet the needs of the business. And I think we've been doing that reasonably well over the past the 7 or 8 years, and we're going to continue to do that.

Sterling, I would just add too, that there's always a baseline of funding that we make available and increase just simply because a huge aspect of what we do is cybersecurity, which is very difficult to predict, the threat environment is constantly evolving. It's generally always intensifying and increasing and so there are constant investments we make in training, education, new hires, people, technology, hardening our infrastructure, improving its resiliency that are ongoing. In addition, there are responses that we have to make to new threats that are anticipated. These just are routine and happen all the time, but the precise nature, the precise response, and therefore, the price -- the precise budgetary aspect of the response is difficult to predict. What you're seeing is our best estimates based on a long history of experience of doing these kinds of things.
In addition, we fund research and that research evolves. And we recently identified, for example, a huge number of queries that were out coming into the root servers, a massive spike in queries that were literally the result of unintentional activities with that browser behavior that we were able to actually highlight, point out, and help rectify and eliminate a huge amount of volume that was hitting the -- all 13 of the root servers.
There's quite a bit of this research that we do and published. We've done work in name collisions. We do a lot of root instrumentation that helps manage and improve performance and security across the net, we identified the names that are the source of botnets and other sorts of cyberattacks. We share those with different companies, government agencies. So the teams that are working on that are always evolving, growing, training, hiring additional folks. That's our primary mission.
We address it in many broad ways, but it's our top priority. So it shouldn't be a surprise that at times, you're going to see increased spending on it. It's just the nature of the business that we're in. And that's our expertise, and that's our mission."
