Joining me on the call is Stefan Larsson, our President; Mike Shaffer, our Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer; and Dana Perlman, Treasurer and Senior Vice President of Business Development and Invest",3251,"Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Joining me on the call is Stefan Larsson, our President; Mike Shaffer, our Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer; and Dana Perlman, Treasurer and Senior Vice President of Business Development and Investor Relations. 
We're all working from home today. So I want to thank everyone for joining us on our fourth quarter call. I must comment that it is indeed strange to be sitting in my living room for this call and not in my conference room, but I suppose that is the new normal. And I hope everyone is safe and healthy this morning. 
We were extremely pleased to how we ended the year. We had a strong holiday season, with increasing momentum across Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein in the majority of the regions where we operate. We had a significant revenue beat of about $100 million and exceeded our earnings guidance on a non-GAAP basis despite the impact from the corona virus, which was not contemplated in our initial outlook. If you compare our fiscal year earnings per share results with our guidance of at least $9.45, we had a $0.31 beat out of earning -- out of our business outperformance from Calvin and Tommy and a $0.03 beat from lower interest and taxes. This was offset by a $0.25 hit for the corona inventory reserves that we booked that we recorded at the very end of the fourth quarter, which was not contemplated in our initial guidance. 
I believe the magnitude of our business outperformance, especially our sales outperformance, given the backdrop that we were dealing with in the fourth quarter, was truly impressive and speaks to the health of our brands and the momentum in the business that we saw in the fourth quarter. We were pleased to end the year with very clean inventories. Overall, our inventory position was down 7% year-over-year, which also was better than the guidance we talked about. 
Before I go into our financial results, I wanted to take a few moments to talk about the coronavirus, which I am sure is top of mind in everyone in the investment community. This is an unprecedented time, and it's a rapidly changing situation. And our hearts go out to all those impacted by the events that are unfolding. Our PVH people are demonstrating their passion and dedication to PVH, with most of our regions working remotely from home to continue to operate our business through this uncertain time. It has been inspiring to see our people rally together, and I truly believe that this demonstrates the power of PVH. 
The spread of the coronavirus is unfortunately having a major impact on our business, with temporary store closings felt across multiple continents, including store closures across Europe, the Americas and Australia. Our wholesale customers and licensees have been similarly impacted, which in turn negatively impacts PVH. Our digital sites and those of our key partners continue to service consumers, and we are seeing significant growth there. Depending on the market, we are seeing anywhere from 20% to over 50% growth online versus last year, which we are balancing with the health and safety of our workers in the distribution center, making sure goods get to consumers. As a reminder, our digital business in 2019 was up approximately 20% globally and now represents about 12% of our total revenues versus 10% in 2018. 
In China, we are seeing some encouraging early signs of recovery. All of our stores have reopened, but stores are operating with shorter hours, and approximately 95% of our franchisee stores are also open. We are seeing some rebound in sales with improvement week over week. And for the month of March, total business was down only about 35%, but digital sales are comping up closer to plus 40%. We know it clearly will take some time to return to normality and hope that our other regions will follow a similar path to normal business once the pandemic has passed. 
Before I go into our business review and forward-looking comments, I want to touch on a few topics given the current climate. The health of our balance sheet remains our core strength. We recently drew down about $750 million from our revolver, which gives us over $1.2 billion in cash and available borrowings. We ended the fourth quarter with a gross leverage ratio of 2.2x and a net leverage ratio of 1.9x. Cash preservation is a critical focus of area of us now. We suspended our stock repurchasing program and also suspended our cash dividend beginning in the first quarter of 2020. 
Cost-cutting measures have been implemented. We have taken a hard look at expenses and are reducing or canceling discretionary spending and variable expenses in many areas to navigate successfully and take the pressure off the business. This includes our marketing expenditures, although we continue to invest in our digital businesses as this is a critical channel for us to maintain our connection with our consumers and to transact globally with our consumers. As of now, store associates in the U.S., Canada and Europe continue to be paid through this week and next, and we are evaluating aiding any and all payroll opportunities and salary reductions, including looking at what different governments are offering as relief packages in each region. 
We took a hard look at capital expenditures and now expect to spend around $190 million in CapEx for 2020, about a 45% reduction from 2019, as we have canceled or delayed capital projects that are not business-critical at this time. On the supply side, our supply chain is one of our key competitive advantages, and we have strong relationships with long-term partners. That when we've been able to reduce our inventory commitments for the fall season, and we are redeploying some inventories, particularly core and core fashion from summer to fall; and consolidating some seasons, particularly holiday and spring, which will give us more time to make better decisions about making inventory commitments. 
As we operate in so many countries around the world, we have a task force headed up by Stefan Larsson, our President, reviewing all options, including government relief and support and different inventory programs that we would utilize in each region. We will take advantage of any government support that's available to us as it is appropriate. 
Lastly, as a reminder, in January, we announced our transaction to sell our Speedo business to Pentland, which is expected to close in April or this coming month for our business. And we will take advantage of that support of about $170 million that will come in as cash sometime in April. 
Before I go into our financial review, I just want to take a moment and reiterate my confidence in PVH and the strengths that we have that will enable us to navigate this crisis. Our brands are iconic with incredibly strong brand health across the board. We have great consumer brand loyalty, and we are taking this opportunity to deepen our connection with the consumers even further as we leverage our always-on digital approach. The diversification of our business is a true advantage, both from a regional and a brand point of view. And we have significant category and regional opportunities to further extend our brands after the pandemic subsides. While the near term is uncertain, I do believe that PVH will emerge from this even stronger given the strength of our brand, our people and our strong competitive balance sheet. 
Moving on to the business. We are pleased with the fourth quarter results, especially in light of the challenging and volatile global backdrop. Our revenues rose 6% on a constant currency basis, which significantly exceeded our previous guidance and exceeded it by about $100 million. I think that clearly demonstrates the momentum that we saw in the business, particularly in the December holiday season and in the January period, right before the coronavirus hit. 
Outperformance was principally driven by our international businesses, which represented about $75 million of the $100 million beat. Europe, in particular, was strong, but also China. 
In North America, we saw an outperformance against our plans of about $25 million in sales, and that was driven principally by our retail businesses, which comped significantly ahead of our initial plans. Our brand health in the region -- all regions is very strong for both Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein, and we feel we significantly outperformed our competition in the fourth quarter. Tommy continue to see an excellent response to its lifestyle offerings, which enabled us to continue to get -- gain share from regional and global competitors. Calvin Klein in Europe continued to see great trajectory of growth, and we remain confident in the long-term path to $2 billion in revenues, which would just about double our business from today, as we expanded both category offerings and capitalized on the consumer appetite for the brand. 
If we look to the current state of the business in Europe, obviously, the region today is quite challenged due to the coronavirus epidemic. Our stores remain temporarily closed as per government regulations and so are those of certain of our key wholesale partners. Before the COVID-19 outbreak, our strong order books were for both brands, plus 12% for spring; and for fall, were plus 12% for Tommy and over 20% increase for Calvin Klein. However, in light of the crisis, there will be some pressure from our partners, and we need to support them through this period and allow for some level of cancellations in order to move goods through and in order to get inventories back in line. We will continue to manage this situation in order to position our both Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger for long-term growth in Europe. 
Moving to North America. We had a great holiday season relative to our plans. Our wholesale business has performed quite well for both Tommy and Calvin, particularly on digital channels where we continue to grow our penetration. We remain a key account for our wholesale partners. Our brands are traffic drivers. 
In our North America retail business in North America, Calvin Klein posted an 800 basis point acceleration in comp stores relative to the third quarter, which we were very pleased with. Comps overall for the quarter came in at plus 4%. However, we saw traffic in sales under pressure during the fourth quarter due to lower visits from international tourists, especially as we got closer to the Lunar New Year period in January. This had a particular impact on our Tommy Hilfiger retail business, which has about 40% of its sales coming from tourists and led us to take deeper discounts and markdowns. 
Currently, in North America, there are clearly store closures for both our own stores and those of our wholesale partners. These temporary closures are pressuring our business, and we expect that we will have to deal with some pressure from order cancellations as we move forward. We're working with all of our retail partners to manage that and to manage the inventory flow. 
Finally, for our results in Asia. I'd like to highlight that China showed a significant improvement in the fourth quarter relative to third quarter trends, with Tommy Hilfiger's fourth quarter comps up double digits and Calvin Klein fourth quarter comps flat. But in January, we saw significant increases, particularly in China. Obviously, this trend reversed with the coronavirus outbreak, where we saw a significant drop in business in the fourth week of January and then moving to February. 
As I mentioned earlier, the majority of our stores in Asia are now open and we have seen a resurgence in business, which I will go into in more detail. Let me begin with talking about Tommy Hilfiger first. Tommy Hilfiger continued to experience momentum during the fourth quarter. Brand health remains strong as we continue to deliver differential product assortments and engaging consumer experiences. We had exciting partnerships, including our sponsorship of the 2020 Hakam Ski races in Australia, where Tommy Hilfiger did a full brand takeover. This was in addition to our new Capsule collections, including a joint Captain collection with Lewis Hamilton and Grammy award-winning singer and songwriter Herd. 
From a business position, Tommy increased its revenue an impressive 12% in the quarter and 13% on a constant currency basis, which significantly exceeded our revenue guidance by about $75 million. However, earnings declined 13% during the quarter, while earnings on Tommy Hilfiger business were up year-over-year during the quarter. This was offset by several factors, most notably the continued gross margin pressure in North America retail business to clear goods as well as the negative impact of additional inventory reserves that were unexpected at the time of -- that we gave items in anticipation of lower sales caused by the coronavirus. 
By segment, our international business continued to show strength, with revenues up 22% on a constant currency basis; and overall comp stores up 10% with comp store increases, particularly in Europe and China, which exceeded our guidance. Tommy's European business continued to outperform as it experienced double-digit revenue growth with strength across all channels of distribution in all the markets and product categories. We believe that our market-leading position is driven by our excellent product, our compelling price-value proposition and strong brand power, which is allowing us to take share from regional and global competitors. 
Our Asia business posted revenue growth during the fourth quarter. China was very strong for us, with comps up double digit. We also experienced strong momentum in our Japan business and had the benefit of the addition of revenues from the acquisitions of our Australia and Central and Southern European Tommy businesses. 
In North America, revenues declined only 2%, and margins were down -- but margins were down sharply. We continued to see very favorable trends at wholesale as our brand outperformed competition throughout holiday. However, results of our business -- retail business, which were planned, were extremely challenged as we continue to take heavy markdowns to end the year clean with inventory. 
Our global licensing business continued to be very favorable for us, particularly with G-III on our women's business, that continues to be an excellent partner for us and continue to exceed all of our sales plans for the Tommy Hilfiger women's business. 
Despite the current pandemic, we continue to having incredible confidence in the long-term opportunities for the Tommy Hilfiger brand from category and regional expansion opportunities and the ability to optimize our distribution network globally. 
Let me move to Calvin Klein now. We continue to expand experience brand heat during the fourth quarter. We deepened our connections with consumers by delivering compelling product, engaging brand experiences, and we're providing a platform for self-expression for our consumers. Importantly, we made significant progress to reposition and refocus the brand with an enhanced product focus. We recently launched CK Everyone, a clean fragrance; alongside the new CK1 underwear and jeans collection, marking our first-ever cross-category marketing launch that spans both fragrance and fashion. This was a global launch for us for the brand. 
We also debuted the spring Calvin Klein jeans and Calvin Klein underwear campaign, featuring new spring offerings and starring Justin Bieber, Le Zang, among other key talent people. 
Moving to the business. Overall, revenues decreased 2% or 1% on a constant currency basis. If you remove the jeans business, which was transferred to our G-III partner, business was up overall 1%, which beat our guidance by approximately $25 million. The only softness in business that we saw was in Asia in Hong Kong during the fourth quarter driven by the protest that continued, which had a major impact on that market's position -- sales position overall. By region, Calvin Klein international revenues increased 8% on a constant currency basis with comp stores increasing overall by 1%. And if you remove the Hong Kong business from that comp store number, comp stores increased ex Hong Kong by 5%. 
We continue to see excellent momentum in our European and our China business. Consumers responded well to our offerings for holiday, and performance was broad-based across our channels, markets and product categories. In Asia, we were pleased to see notable acceleration in China during the quarter. Our trends were quite favorable before the coronavirus escalated. 
Barring that, we made progress relating to our products and consumer engagement. And I think you can see that in the momentum we saw in sales, particularly in December and January, as we started to deliver new spring product. Our digital businesses continued to see excellent growth as the consumer is increasingly shopping online, and we added more online activation to drive overall engagement. Overall, we were very pleased with Asia's performance outside of Hong Kong, which continued to be impacted by the protest in the fourth quarter. 
In North America, revenues declined 11% largely driven by our decision to license the jeans business to G-III. Wholesale was a positive story for us, particularly our performance in the digital channels. Our retail business posted a sequential acceleration, with comps up 4% in the fourth quarter. We were quite pleased with these results, which were achieved in conjunction with an improvement in far fewer and less promotional lockdowns than last year. 
As we look past the current global backdrop, we continue to see strong long-term growth opportunities for the Calvin Klein brand, most notably our expansion in Europe, which we believe is at least $1 billion sales opportunity for us, driving both our -- driven both through all channels of distribution as we move forward. We continue to leverage our growth in the digital opportunities and leveraging our growth opportunities across Asia. 
Finally, moving to our Heritage business. We continue to feel pressure due to the challenging North America retail environment in our Heritage brands that really impact moderate price points sit as our Heritage businesses. Revenues for the business declined 1%, with flat comps in our own retail stores. Operating margins remained under pressure as planned as gross margin expansion in the business was offset by expense deleverage on the expense side. We will continue to look for additional ways to optimize and streamline the Heritage business in the future to generate enhanced returns. And we remain on track, as I mentioned before, with the sale of our Speedo business, which should occur in April. 
Before I pass things over to Mike, I want to highlight that PVH's 140-year history is marked by a strong resiliency. We have overcome countless challenges, including the Great Depression, 2 World Wars and the Great Recession in 2008. As we move forward, we have tremendous opportunities across PVH's business model to capture long-term sustainable profit growth, from driving meaningful engagements with our consumers to continuous improvement product at Calvin Klein for capturing the global distribution opportunities for both Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger. And we continue to look for ways to optimize our business model, whether through the supply chain or through efficiencies across the business. 
I believe that our core strengths, our talented people, our iconic brands and our strong financial fundamentals and our balance sheet -- our conservative balance sheet will continue to serve as a key competitive advantages for us as we -- and will allow us to come out of this crisis stronger than we came in. 
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Mike to talk about the financial results in more detail. Mike?"

I'm going to briefly touch on the fourth quarter of 2019 and then move on to 2020. 
Our reported revenues were up 5% and up 6% on a constant currency basis, and revenues were much stronger than our previous guidance. Tommy Hilfiger revenues were very strong, up 12% as reported and 13% on a constant currency basis. And ForEx exceeded our previous guidance. Tommy Hilfiger International revenues increased 20% as reported and were up 22% on a constant currency basis. The Tommy Hilfiger International revenue increase was driven by continued outperformance in Europe and the revenue from our Australia and Tommy Hilfiger Central and Southeast Asia acquisitions. International comp store sales were up 10%. 
Tommy Hilfiger North America revenues declined 2%. Growth in the wholesale business was offset by North America comp sales down 6% primarily due to the lower traffic and spending in our stores in international tourist locations. 
Our Calvin Klein revenues were down 2% as reported and decreased 1% on a constant currency basis and were better than our previous guidance. Calvin Klein International revenues increased 6% as reported and were up 8% on a constant currency basis driven by continued growth in Europe and the revenue from our Australia acquisition, partially offset by softness in Asia due to the Hong Kong protests. 
Our international comp store sales were up 1%. Calvin Klein North America revenues decreased 11%. Our wholesale business revenues were negatively impacted compared to the prior year by the licensing of our women's jeans business to G-III. North America comp sales were up 4%. Heritage revenues were down 1% for the prior year and below our previous guidance. Our Heritage retail business comp store sales were relatively flat to the prior year. 
Our non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.88, which was $0.09 better than our previous guidance. The EPS beat versus previous guidance was driven by outperformance in our Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein businesses for approximately $0.31 and favorable interest and taxes of $0.03. These beats were partially offset by additional inventory reserves we needed to approximately $0.25 because the onset of the virus occurred in Asia at the end of our fourth quarter. 
For the full year 2019, we ended the year with record revenue of $9.9 billion, an increase of 3% versus the prior year, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $9.54. 
Moving on to 2020. Our first quarter and full year 2020 results will be significantly negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The duration and extent of the pandemic is highly uncertain, and our results could be impacted in ways we're not able to predict today. As a result, we are not in a position to issue guidance for the quarter of fiscal year 2020. We're monitoring the situation closely with regard to our associates, customers, business partners and supply chain. We feel we are well positioned to manage through these on certain times. We ended 2019 with cash of $503 million and with inventory levels down 7% compared to the prior year. 
We're taking a number of steps to preserve liquidity and financial flexibility. We feel very comfortable with our liquidity position as we've drawn down from our revolving credit facility in addition to suspending share repurchases under our stock repurchase program. Our mandatory long-term debt repayments in 2020 are only $14 million. This is in addition to suspending our cash dividend beginning with the second quarter of 2020. Our previously announced dividend was paid on March 31 and was not impacted by the suspension. We're reviewing every opportunity to eliminate discretionary spending. We are cutting capital expenditures to approximately $190 million from $345 million in the prior year, with capital expenditures only for minimum requirements in our retail stores and for projects currently in progress related to systems and warehouses. 
We are also reducing operating expenses, including reviewing payroll opportunities and reducing all nonpayroll expenses, including creative, marketing and travel. We're also tightly managing working capital. We are adjusting inventory levels by canceling and delaying orders. We're extending payment terms to both merchandise and non-merchandise vendor invoices or suspending the payment of rent temporarily and delaying or canceling planned new store openings. 
Also, as a reminder, our sale of Speedo North America business to Pentland plc, the parent company of Speedo brand, is expected to close in the first quarter of 2020 for $170 million cash, subject to a working capital adjustment. 
We will give guidance for future quarters and the year once there is more clarity on the impact and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. As we work through 2020, our financial discipline will help us take advantage of the opportunities available to us to withstand current pressures on our business and emerge from the crisis well positioned to capture long-term sustainable profitable growth. 
And with that, operator, we'll open it up for questions."

And then the second question, I don't know, it's probably for Mike. Mike, can you just talk a little bit about the biggest buckets of expense opportunity as you think about where you could pull the levers, whether it is payroll, whether it is rent, even on the marketing side, just sort of how you're really approaching it?

I feel fine. You saw me on TV yesterday. I'm one of the fortunate ones. Whatever symptoms, they have been unbelievably mild.

I'm one of the fortunate ones. Whatever symptoms, they have been unbelievably mild. And I've been able to continue to work and operate and focus on the business. 
From a -- look, spring/summer inventory is the biggest issue that everybody is dealing with, first. Goods are coming in, goods have been ordered. Prior to the pandemic and the crisis, as we ended the year with -- our inventory is down 7%. I could tell you, we were going in the channel, department stores across the board in North America, Asia and Europe. In our own stores, we were going into the year very clean and feeling really good with tremendous amount of momentum. I got to tell you, we were really feeling great in January before this all hit us and felt we were going to be starting the first quarter with a tremendous amount of momentum and the ability to continue to grow margins and add to our top line growth. 
Obviously, that all changed within a couple of week period of time. The biggest challenge we're facing is that we've lost -- we have to assume that stores are going to be closed at a minimum through April here in North America and Europe, our 2 biggest markets. And we've lost at least 6 and -- to 8 weeks of spring selling and spring selling in the heart of the season. So I mean you have to think of it that way. When you think about Easter, when you think about March, April, that's the heart of the season as you're going into it. That's your biggest areas of doing full-price selling as you go in. So that losing that's -- that anywhere from 6 to 8 to 10 weeks of sales is really where the pressure point is going to be. And what we're looking at and stepping is really taken on this with the regions. And our brands across the board is what we're really looking at that inventory, making some judgments about what we should promote and liquidate through our own stores or through some partner accounts to really go after it. 
The other piece that we're really looking hard at there is what should we repurpose and utilize to sell into the season and to sell through the season as we go forward. And we're looking at the ability to potentially pack and hold some really good merchandise that's in the warehouse that we'll use and maybe have to carry for a few months to bring it out as we go forward. So we're looking at all of those from a channel point of view as we think about inventory. 
When we think about inventory for fall, we've done a lot of things for ourselves. Stefan has worked with the teams with Daniel Grieder in Europe, with our Tom Chiu in Asia and Cheryl and Ken Duane here in the United States, to really look at the inventory pipeline and with our logistics teams to really look at how that pipeline would be worked, try to push out with our with our partners to push inventory commitments out at least an additional 4 to 5 weeks. So we'll have some more visibility. We've been able to have deep conversations with our retail partners about what makes sense to cancel and what really is necessary as we go forward. So we're trying to balance that as we look at it. 
I think it's -- the risk-reward today is to have less inventory and chase later, if we need more goods. The best story, if we're sitting here in the third quarter of this year, and I'm sitting with you telling we're low on inventory and we're chasing fall, that would be a real excellent problem to have as we go forward. 
Mike, are you going to take the second part of the question?"

We're taking a hard look at marketing, any expense that is actually discretionary. Obviously, travel is down to 0 now, and we're going to clamp down on in travel moving forward. And it will just be a matter of doing the right things in the short term to be in a position that when things do get better and we do open, we have the base ready to move, ready to staff up and ready to reopen with the appropriate tools at their availability. 
So we're making every discretionary cut we can at this point. Really, it's anything discretionary."

Mike, I'm going to answer the first part. You'll take the CapEx. So just give me a moment to just respond. Look, the digital transaction has been the bright spot throughout this. It's -- even before the coronavirus, we were seeing 20% growth in our digital business. And our penetration for 2019, we've always talked about 10%, has grown to 12% overall digital penetration to PVH. 
I think this -- the pandemic is only accelerated that not only in the short time frame, but I think it's also impacted the way consumers are going to shop going forward. I think -- I was on Mad Money last night being interviewed, and I talked about it is -- I always had a general belief, and I think I've spoken on a number of calls and conferences about that over the next 5 to 6 years, we're going to continue to see consolidation in the retail industry. And we're going to see -- and wholesale apparel industry. And I thought that would be a 5-, 6-year path. I think this pandemic accelerates that. It accelerates the consumers comfort level with buying apparel online. I think it accelerates the potential store closures and the C and D and E stores closing as we go forward. And we'll get to a healthier store base. We've always talked about that, especially in the U.S., there is too many stores. Our sales per cap -- sales per square foot per capita are by far the highest in the world. And it would be healthy to see that happen. But obviously, it's also going to be painful as we go through that process. 
I think what we're seeing in digital and the kind of growth market by market, we're seeing -- you see anywhere from 20% to 60% growth, depending on the channel. In China, our penetration continues to grow. We were somewhere in the neighborhood of about a 15% penetration in China. And I think that this year, it wouldn't surprise us if that moved to 20% as we're seeing outsized growth in our digital channel. We're growing digitally between 35% and 40% on digital sales. And that's a very high margin. So we're not out there promoting. We're out there connecting with our consumers, but we're not doing from a price point basis. We're doing it at a very positive level. So I think that's a bright spot, and I think it will continue to be a bright spot.

And I think -- look, objectively speaking, this is not an industry that has had across the board great inventory control metrics in place. That said, I think as we came out of holiday going into the first quarter, there was a tremendous cleanup that went on in the fourth quarter across the board to get inventories back in line. So at the end of January, what we saw was -- as a bright spot was inventories that were really under control throughout the channel, department stores, North America, Europe. And then even competitively, everyone took advantage of the good selling that was going on overall. And everyone saw some level of margin pressure when they reported earnings. But I think a big piece of that margin pressure was the objective to make sure inventories were clean as we went into 2020.
I think inventory was bought with more discipline because you heard us all complaining on our third quarter calls about open-to-buy dollars being so tight, and the retailers are trying to get turned under control. So that's all true. But I also think that there's going to be a significant amount of inventory. The loss of, let's say, 8 weeks of selling in spring will make the environment promotional, and we've planned for that in our cash flow. We've planned for that in our projections. And I think it's going to be a reality for a period of time."

And maybe did they have a longer shop life than people realize in this environment, how much can you sort of just assume that there's not a lot of sales happening. You can just hold on to that inventory for maybe a longer period of time. And so in the future without have to take maybe super big markdowns on those items."

But I think pack and hold, which we have historically not been big believers in. We try to turn the inventory into cash. If there's -- the old story is in apparel, if you're having a sales problem, this is not like wine that gets better with age. Your inventory gets worse. This is a completely different situation. And we have to have a completely different mindset. And I think a lot will depend on what the off-price promotional market looks like about how aggressive we would have to be in order to clear goods. And if it's too aggressive, I think we'll do exactly what you said, and we will pack and hold core that will -- that doesn't have a big seasonality to it. And then core plus that has a level of seasonality to it, I could see us packing it up for a period of time because there's -- the goods haven't hit the floor. The goods are in scale. I don't believe the goods would be out of cycle or -- from that point of view. So we will take a hard look at that and balance that with our cash flow and balance sheet requirements. 
But given the strength of our balance sheet, I think it's something that we will have as a tool that a lot of our competitors that are not nearly as well capitalized as we are, are not going to have the benefit of carrying goods for 6 or 9 months to get to spring next year and have quality goods to sell. 
So that model has been used extensively by the off-price channel, the T.J.s and the Losses. And I think we're going to have to take a lesson out of that and maybe have to park some inventory for a period of time. Interest rates are very low, and we'll take advantage of that as we go forward. Stefan, I hope I left do something to comment on."

And then if we look at the inventory that is more towards core, it's a strength that we have. Both in Calvin and Tommy, we have a strong core, a lot of essential products that are less seasonally dependent. And we also have a replenishment system there that gives us much better opportunity to react. 
When it comes to the more seasonal part of the assortment, it's the time we're taking while we have this freeze is to plan through what we're going to redirect, how we adjust flow timing, as Manny talked through, how we adjust volumes. So we have significant opportunities to, in this very difficult situation, try to optimize inventory and receive as much as possible and then with the biggest strength being our core."

And I think that you start with that as a premise. 
Also, the consumer is getting more and more comfortable shopping online. I think the winners are going to be those retailers that invested in their online capabilities. I believe in the omnichannel approach. Brick-and-mortar is not going away, but it needs to be coupled and needs to be aligned with your digital strategy. And it needs to be an experience that the consumer has that has no disruption in it. It needs to be clean and it needs to be able to flow directly to them. And it needs to be experienced that doesn't have a lot of problems in it. 
And I think a number of our players -- in North America, Macy's has made major investments there. And Nordstrom and a couple of other key players, including Kohl's, has really started to move in that direction. And I think you're going to see more of that. You're seeing retailers doing curbside pickup, and I think that's only going to continue. I think -- so those kinds of things, I think, are going to accelerate that thought process. 
The other thing is there's a reality to this situation. And I think balance sheets are going to be stretched. Valuations are dramatically down from where they were just 2, 3 months ago when we opened the year. And given that, I think there is the opportunity -- there will be the opportunity to potentially do acquisitions and bring players together. And the old story that 1 plus 1 equals 4, where you can -- where particularly in a retail situation, there's tremendous leverage to that you get from your fixed costs and your back office, being able to spread the investments over a larger base that you need to make in your digital investments, all of those things taken into play -- prior to the pandemic, I felt that we were going to see consolidation in the industry. I think the pandemic has done nothing but accelerate that. It's -- no matter what happens here, balance sheets will be weakened from where they were prior to this. Valuations are going to be lower. And I think given all that dynamic, I think there will be opportunity for consolidation. And I think you'll probably see an acceleration of store closings. 
That's my theory. And I think it's a good way for us to think about how we have to plan the business and how we have to think about it strategically."

We have to take that all into consideration as we plan and we move forward. I think they have plenty of levers to pull, including their real estate has potentially cash-generating assets that help -- may help them get through this as they move forward. And like you said, a lot is going to depend. If the stores open up in May, I think it's -- everybody -- it's back to getting into business.

We're going to use the China model because I think it's the best model we have. It's also the one that makes the most sense to us. 
So just to put that into perspective and what that means for us. In China, what we came into December, January comping up 5%, business very strong. The last week of January through February when the stores closed and there was all the disruption in China and those -- we saw the business go down to minus 85%, 90%. Basically, everything was being done digitally. 
Beginning end of February, business opened. And for the month of March, overall, our business in China is back to about 65%. In the last week, it's probably close to being back to 70% of the business. Digital continues to be very strong. What we're seeing is in the major cities like Beijing, Hong Kong -- Beijing and Shanghai. We're seeing in those cities that are driven by, in some respect, international tourism. And we have the controls and store hours where the controls are tighter on movement and where the tourism has been a big impact on that business in those key cities. There is no tourism going on. Those 2 cities are feeling it much more than the rest of China at large. So it just gives you a sense of where we are. 
We're expecting that as we get into the month of April, that minus 30% will move to minus 20%. And then we get into May, minus 20% will move to minus 15% or 10%. And we are assuming when we get into the second half of the year, we will start to -- assuming that the pandemic goes the way we hope it does, that business will start to get back to a more normal level as we get into the second half of the year. That's how we're planning it. 
I think that's a prudent way for us to plan the way North America will come back as well. I don't think when stores open that the first thing consumers are going to do are going to run out to buy apparel and accessories and get online and go into stores immediately. I think it's going to be a ramp-up as that happens, as people get more and more comfortable with the situation. And I think that's how we're planning it. I hope that was helping."

Dana will take the question on the leverage. And this way, I don't screw it up. Kimberly, we're not giving guidance, so we're not going to give you an update on sales right now. But let's put it into perspective. The stores shut down in the middle of March. There is no sales going on in brick-and-mortar in Europe, in North America, in Australia, in Brazil, on major markets. The only thing that's opened up, and I gave you the exact sales trends, what's going on in Asia is Asia that's opened up. And in Asia, our big markets, China, I talked about in detail. Our career has bounced back the strongest for us. There, our March business is only down about 20%, and the last week was only down about 10%. And Japan seems to be following pretty closely to what's going on in China. Those are our 3 big markets in Asia, and that's what gives us a level of confidence about how we're thinking about planning the business once it's open. 
It's very difficult to have any sense of what the sales are going to be because I have no crystal ball that's going to tell me when stores are going to be opened. I could tell you, pre-coronavirus, sales trends comps were very strong throughout. And then as the coronavirus started to impact us in February with tourism or whatever, we started to see our comps get impacted to a degree but then -- and then stores close. But overall, we were still pretty happy with the kind of sales we were doing. And up until the very last week, when stores around us were closing and people were starting to twin, our business was off probably around 50% overall, which we felt was really good given what was going on on a store basis. But that was the kind of trends we were seeing right before the stores closed for that week for a 10-day period. 
Prior to that, business had been very strong for us. So I hope that helps. But trying to do modeling or whatever is really very difficult now. Dana, you want to talk about the leverage?"

Joining me on the call is Stefan Larsson, our President; Mike Shaffer, our Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer; and Dana Perlman, Treasurer and Senior Vice President of Business Development and Invest",3259,"Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Joining me on the call is Stefan Larsson, our President; Mike Shaffer, our Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer; and Dana Perlman, Treasurer and Senior Vice President of Business Development and Investor Relations.
We're all working from home today. So I want to thank everyone for joining us on our fourth quarter call. I must comment that it is, indeed, strange to be sitting in my living room for this call and not in my conference room, but I suppose that is the new normal. And I hope everyone is safe and healthy this morning.
We were extremely pleased to how we ended the year. We had a strong holiday season with increasing momentum across Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein in the majority of the regions where we operate. We had a significant revenue beat of about $100 million and exceeded our earnings guidance on a non-GAAP basis despite the impact from the coronavirus, which was not contemplated in our initial outlook. If you compare our fiscal year earnings per share results with our guidance of at least $9.45, we had a $0.31 beat out of earning -- out of our business outperformance from Calvin and Tommy and a $0.03 beat from lower interest and taxes. This was offset by a $0.25 hit for the corona inventory reserves that we booked that we recorded at the very end of the fourth quarter, which was not contemplated in our initial guidance.
I believe the magnitude of our business outperformance, especially our sales outperformance, given the backdrop that we were dealing with in the fourth quarter, was truly impressive and speaks to the health of our brands and the momentum in the business that we saw in the fourth quarter. We were pleased to end the year with very clean inventories. Overall, our inventory position was down 7% year-over-year, which also was better than the guidance we talked about.
Before I go into our financial results, I wanted to take a few moments to talk about the coronavirus, which I am sure is top of mind in everyone in the investment community. This is an unprecedented time, and it's a rapidly changing situation. And our hearts go out to all those impacted by the events that are unfolding. Our PVH people are demonstrating their passion and dedication to PVH, with most of our regions working remotely from home to continue to operate our business through this uncertain time. It has been inspiring to see our people rally together, and I truly believe that this demonstrates the power of PVH.
The spread of the coronavirus is unfortunately having a major impact on our business with temporary store closings felt across multiple continents, including store closures across Europe, the Americas and Australia. Our wholesale customers and licensees have been similarly impacted, which, in turn, negatively impacts PVH. Our digital sites and those of our key partners continue to service consumers, and we are seeing significant growth there. Depending on the market, we are seeing anywhere from 20% to over 50% growth on online versus last year, which we are balancing with the health and safety of our workers in the distribution center, making sure goods get to consumers. As a reminder, our digital business in 2019 was up approximately 20% globally and now represents about 12% of our total revenues versus 10% in 2018.
In China, we are seeing some encouraging early signs of recovery. All of our stores have reopened, but stores are operating with shorter hours, and approximately 95% of our franchisee stores are also open. We are seeing some rebound in sales with improvement week over week. And for the month of March, total business was down only about 35%, but digital sales are comping up closer to plus 40%. We know it clearly will take some time to return to normality and hope that our other regions will follow a similar path to normal business once the pandemic has passed.
Before I go into our business review and forward-looking comments, I want to touch on a few topics given the current climate. The health of our balance sheet remains our core strength. We recently drew down about $750 million from our revolver, which gives us over $1.2 billion in cash and available borrowings. We ended the fourth quarter with a gross leverage ratio of 2.2x and a net leverage ratio of 1.9x. Cash preservation is a critical focus of area of us now. We suspended our stock repurchasing program and also suspended our cash dividend beginning in the first quarter of 2020.
Cost-cutting measures have been implemented. We have taken a hard look at expenses and are reducing or canceling discretionary spending and variable expenses in many areas to navigate successfully and take the pressure off the business. This includes our marketing expenditures, although we continue to invest in our digital businesses as this is a critical channel for us to maintain our connection with our consumers and to transact globally with our consumers. As of now, store associates in the U.S., Canada and Europe continue to be paid through this week and next, and we are evaluating aiding any and all payroll opportunities and salary reductions, including looking at what different governments are offering as relief packages in each region.
We took a hard look at capital expenditures and now expect to spend around $190 million in CapEx for 2020, about a 45% reduction from 2019, as we have canceled or delayed capital projects that are not business-critical at this time. On the supply side, our supply chain is one of our key competitive advantages, and we have strong relationships with long-term partners. Therefore, we've been able to reduce our inventory commitments for the fall season, and we are redeploying some inventories, particularly core and core fashion from summer to fall; and consolidating some seasons, particularly holiday and spring, which will give us more time to make better decisions about making inventory commitments.
As we operate in so many countries around the world, we have a task force headed up by Stefan Larsson, our President, reviewing all options, including government relief and support and different inventory programs that we would utilize in each region. We will take advantage of any government support that's available to us as it is appropriate.
Lastly, as a reminder, in January, we announced our transaction to sell our Speedo business to Pentland, which is expected to close in April or this coming month for our business. And we will take advantage of that support of about $170 million that will come in as cash sometime in April.
Before I go into our financial review, I just want to take a moment and reiterate my confidence in PVH and the strengths that we have that will enable us to navigate this crisis. Our brands are iconic with incredibly strong brand health across the board. We have great consumer brand loyalty, and we are taking this opportunity to deepen our connection with the consumers even further as we leverage our always-on digital approach. The diversification of our business is a true advantage, both from a regional and a brand point of view. And we have significant category and regional opportunities to further extend our brands after the pandemic subsides. While the near term is uncertain, I do believe that PVH will emerge from this even stronger given the strength of our brand, our people and our strong competitive balance sheet.
Moving on to the business. We are pleased with the fourth quarter results, especially in light of the challenging and volatile global backdrop. Our revenues rose 6% on a constant currency basis, which significantly exceeded our previous guidance and exceeded it by about $100 million. I think that clearly demonstrates the momentum that we saw in the business, particularly in the December holiday season and in the January period, right before the coronavirus hit.
Outperformance was principally driven by our international businesses, which represented about $75 million of the $100 million beat. Europe, in particular, was strong, but also China.
In North America, we saw an outperformance against our plans of about $25 million in sales, and that was driven principally by our retail businesses, which comped significantly ahead of our initial plans. Our brand health in the region -- all regions is very strong for both Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein, and we feel we significantly outperformed our competition in the fourth quarter. Tommy continued to see an excellent response to its lifestyle offerings, which enabled us to continue to get -- gain share from regional and global competitors. Calvin Klein in Europe continued to see great trajectory of growth, and we remain confident in the long-term path to $2 billion in revenues, which were just about double our business from today, as we expanded both category offerings and capitalized on the consumer appetite for the brand.
If we look to the current state of the business in Europe, obviously, the region today is quite challenged due to the coronavirus epidemic. Our stores remain temporarily closed as per government regulations and so are those of certain of our key wholesale partners. Before the COVID-19 outbreak, our strong order books were for both brands, plus 12% for spring; and for fall, were plus 12% for Tommy and over 20% increase for Calvin Klein. However, in light of the crisis, there will be some pressure from our partners, and we need to support them through this period and allow for some level of cancellations in order to move goods through and in order to get inventories back in line. We will continue to manage this situation in order to position our both Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger for long-term growth in Europe.
Moving to North America. We had a great holiday season relative to our plans. Our wholesale business has performed quite well for both Tommy and Calvin, particularly on digital channels where we continue to grow our penetration. We remain a key account for our wholesale partners. Our brands are traffic drivers.
In our North America retail business in North America, Calvin Klein posted an 800 basis point acceleration in comp stores relative to the third quarter, which we were very pleased with. Comps overall for the quarter came in at plus 4%. However, we saw traffic in sales under pressure during the fourth quarter due to lower visits from international tourists, especially as we got closer to the Lunar New Year period in January. This had a particular impact on our Tommy Hilfiger retail business, which has about 40% of its sales coming from tourists and led us to take deeper discounts and markdowns.
Currently, in North America, there are clearly store closures for both our own stores and those of our wholesale partners. These temporary closures are pressuring our business, and we expect that we will have to deal with some pressure from order cancellations as we move forward. We're working with all of our retail partners to manage that and to manage the inventory flow.
Finally, for our results in Asia. I'd like to highlight that China showed a significant improvement in the fourth quarter relative to third quarter trends, with Tommy Hilfiger's fourth quarter comps up double digits and Calvin Klein fourth quarter comps flat. But in January, we saw significant increases, particularly in China. Obviously, this trend reversed with the coronavirus outbreak where we saw a significant drop in business in the fourth week of January and then moving to February.
As I mentioned earlier, the majority of our stores in Asia are now open, and we have seen a resurgence in business, which I will go into in more detail. Let me begin with talking about Tommy Hilfiger first. Tommy Hilfiger continued to experience momentum during the fourth quarter. Brand health remains strong as we continue to deliver differential product assortments and engaging consumer experiences. We had exciting partnerships, including our sponsorship of the 2020 Hahnenkamm ski races in Australia where Tommy Hilfiger did a full brand takeover. This was in addition to our new capsule collections, including a joint captain (sic) [ capsule ] collection with Lewis Hamilton and Grammy award-winning singer and songwriter H.E.R.
From a business position, Tommy increased its revenue an impressive 12% in the quarter and 13% on a constant currency basis, which significantly exceeded our revenue guidance by about $75 million. However, earnings declined 13% during the quarter, while earnings on Tommy Hilfiger business were up year-over-year during the quarter. This was offset by several factors, most notably the continued gross margin pressure in North America retail business to clear goods as well as the negative impact of additional inventory reserves that were unexpected at the time that we gave items in anticipation of lower sales caused by the coronavirus.
By segment, our international business continued to show strength with revenues up 22% on a constant currency basis, and overall comp stores up 10% with comp store increases particularly in Europe and China, which exceeded our guidance. Tommy's European business continued to outperform as it experienced double-digit revenue growth with strength across all channels of distribution in all markets and product categories. We believe that our market-leading position is driven by our excellent product, our compelling price-value proposition and strong brand power, which is allowing us to take share from regional and global competitors.
Our Asia business posted revenue growth during the fourth quarter. China was very strong for us with comps up double digit. We also experienced strong momentum in our Japan business and had the benefit of the addition of revenues from the acquisitions of our Australia and Central and Southern European Tommy businesses.
In North America, revenues declined only 2%, and margins were down -- but margins were down sharply. We continued to see very favorable trends at wholesale as our brand outperformed competition throughout holiday. However, results for our business -- our retail business, which were planned, were extremely challenged as we continue to take heavy markdowns to end the year clean with inventory.
Our global licensing business continued to be very favorable for us, particularly with G-III on our women's business, that continues to be an excellent partner for us and continue to exceed all of our sales plans for the Tommy Hilfiger women's business.
Despite the current pandemic, we continue to having incredible confidence in the long-term opportunities for the Tommy Hilfiger brand from category and regional expansion opportunities and the ability to optimize our distribution network globally.
Let me move to Calvin Klein now. We continue to expand -- experience brand heat during the fourth quarter. We deepened our connections with consumers by delivering compelling product, engaging brand experiences, and we're providing a platform for self-expression for our consumers. Importantly, we made significant progress to reposition and refocus the brand with an enhanced product focus. We recently launched CK Everyone, a clean fragrance; alongside the new CK One underwear and jeans collection, marking our first-ever cross-category marketing launch that spans both fragrance and fashion. This was a global launch for us for the brand.
We also debuted the spring Calvin Klein jeans and Calvin Klein underwear campaign, featuring new spring offerings and starring Justin Bieber, Lay Zhang, among other key talent people.
Moving to the business. Overall revenues decreased 2% or 1% on a constant currency basis. If you remove the jeans business, which was transferred to our G-III partner, business was up overall 1%, which beat our guidance by approximately $25 million. The only softness in business that we saw was in Asia in Hong Kong during the fourth quarter driven by the protest that continued, which had a major impact on that market's position -- sales position overall. By region, Calvin Klein international revenues increased 8% on a constant currency business (sic) [ basis ] with comp stores increasing overall by 1%. And if you remove the Hong Kong business from that comp store number, comp stores increased ex Hong Kong by 5%.
We continue to see excellent momentum in our European and our China business. Consumers responded well to our offerings for holiday, and performance was broad-based across our channels, markets and product categories. In Asia, we were pleased to see a notable acceleration in China during the quarter. Our trends were quite favorable before the coronavirus escalated.
Bearing that, we've made progress relating to our products and consumer engagement. And I think you can see that in the momentum we saw in sales, particularly in December and January, as we started to deliver new spring product. Our digital businesses continued to see excellent growth as the consumer is increasingly shopping online, and we added more online activation to drive overall engagement. Overall, we were very pleased with Asia's performance outside of Hong Kong, which continued to be impacted by the protest in the fourth quarter.
In North America, revenues declined 11%, largely driven by our decision to license the jeans business to G-III. Wholesale was a positive story for us, particularly our performance in the digital channels. Our retail business posted a sequential acceleration with comps up 4% in the fourth quarter. We were quite pleased with these results, which were achieved in conjunction with an improvement in far fewer and less promotional lockdowns than last year.
As we look past the current global backdrop, we continue to see strong long-term growth opportunities for the Calvin Klein brand, most notably our expansion in Europe, which we believe is at least $1 billion sales opportunity for us, driving both our -- driven both through all channels of distribution as we move forward. We continue to leverage our growth in the digital opportunities and leveraging our growth opportunities across Asia.
Finally, moving to our Heritage business. We continue to feel pressure due to the challenging North America retail environment in our Heritage Brands that really impact moderate price points such as our Heritage businesses. Revenues for the business declined 1% with flat comps in our own retail stores. Operating margins remained under pressure as planned as gross margin expansion in the business was offset by expense deleverage on the expense side. We will continue to look for additional ways to optimize and streamline the Heritage business in the future to generate enhanced returns. And we remain on track, as I mentioned before, with the sale of our Speedo business, which should occur in April.
Before I pass things over to Mike, I want to highlight that PVH's 140-year history is marked by a strong resiliency. We have overcome countless challenges, including the Great Depression, 2 world wars and the Great Recession in 2008. As we move forward, we have tremendous opportunities across PVH's business model to capture long-term sustainable profit growth from driving meaningful engagements with our consumers to continuous improvement in product at Calvin Klein to capturing the global distribution opportunities for both Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger. And we continue to look for ways to optimize our business model whether through the supply chain or through efficiencies across the business.
I believe that our core strengths, our talented people, our iconic brands and our strong financial fundamentals and our balance sheet -- our conservative balance sheet will continue to serve as key competitive advantages for us as we -- and will allow us to come out of this crisis stronger than we came in.
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Mike to talk about the financial results in more detail. Mike?"

The comments I'm about to make are based on non-GAAP results and are reconciled in our press release. I'm going to briefly touch on the fourth quarter of 2019 and then move on to 2020.
Our reported revenues were up 5% and up 6% on a constant currency basis, and revenues were much stronger than our previous guidance. Tommy Hilfiger revenues were very strong, up 12% as reported and 13% on a constant currency basis. And ForEx exceeded our previous guidance. Tommy Hilfiger International revenues increased 20% as reported and were up 22% on a constant currency basis. The Tommy Hilfiger International revenue increase was driven by continued outperformance in Europe and the revenue from our Australia and Tommy Hilfiger Central and Southeast Asia acquisitions. International comp store sales were up 10%.
Tommy Hilfiger North America revenues declined 2%. Growth in the wholesale business was offset by North America comp sales down 6%, primarily due to the lower traffic and spending in our stores in international tourist locations.
Our Calvin Klein revenues were down 2% as reported and decreased 1% on a constant currency basis and were better than our previous guidance. Calvin Klein International revenues increased 6% as reported and were up 8% on a constant currency basis driven by continued growth in Europe and the revenue from our Australia acquisition, partially offset by softness in Asia due to the Hong Kong protests.
Our international comp store sales were up 1%. Calvin Klein North America revenues decreased 11%. Our wholesale business revenues were negatively impacted compared to the prior year by the licensing of our women's jeans business to G-III. North America comp sales were up 4%. Heritage revenues were down 1% to the prior year and below our previous guidance. Our Heritage retail business comp store sales were relatively flat to the prior year.
Our non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.88, which was $0.09 better than our previous guidance. The EPS beat versus previous guidance was driven by outperformance in our Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein businesses for approximately $0.31 and favorable interest and taxes of $0.03. These beats were partially offset by additional inventory reserves we needed to approximately $0.25 because the onset of the virus occurred in Asia at the end of our fourth quarter.
For the full year 2019, we ended the year with record revenue of $9.9 billion, an increase of 3% versus the prior year, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $9.54.
Moving on to 2020. Our first quarter and full year 2020 results will be significantly negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The duration and extent of the pandemic is highly uncertain, and our results could be impacted in ways we are not able to predict today. As a result, we are not in a position to issue guidance for the quarter of fiscal year 2020. We're monitoring the situation closely with regard to our associates, customers, business partners and supply chain. We feel we are well positioned to manage through these uncertain times. We ended 2019 with cash of $503 million and with inventory levels down 7% compared to the prior year.
We're taking a number of steps to preserve liquidity and financial flexibility. We feel very comfortable with our liquidity position as we've drawn down from our revolving credit facility, in addition to suspending share repurchases under our stock repurchase program. Our mandatory long-term debt repayments in 2020 are only $14 million. This is in addition to suspending our cash dividend beginning with the second quarter of 2020. Our previously announced dividend was paid on March 31 and was not impacted by the suspension. We're reviewing every opportunity to eliminate discretionary spending. We are cutting capital expenditures to approximately $190 million from $345 million in the prior year, with capital expenditures only for minimum requirements in our retail stores and for projects currently in progress related to systems and warehouses.
We are also reducing operating expenses, including reviewing payroll opportunities and reducing all nonpayroll expenses, including creative marketing and travel. We're also tightly managing working capital. We are adjusting inventory levels by canceling and delaying orders. We're extending payment terms to both merchandise and nonmerchandise vendor invoices or suspending the payment of rent temporarily and delaying or canceling planned new store openings.
Also, as a reminder, our sale of Speedo North America business to Pentland Group PLC, the parent company of Speedo brand, is expected to close in the first quarter of 2020 for $170 million cash, subject to a working capital adjustment.
We will give guidance for future quarters and the year once there is more clarity on the impact and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. As we work through 2020, our financial discipline will help us take advantage of the opportunities available to us to withstand the current pressures on our business and emerge from the crisis well positioned to capture long-term sustainable profitable growth.
And with that, operator, we'll open it up for questions."

I'm one of the fortunate ones. Whatever symptoms, they have been unbelievably mild. And I've been able to continue to work and operate and focus on the business.
From a -- look, spring/summer inventory is the biggest issue that everybody is dealing with, first. Goods are coming in. Goods have been ordered. Prior to the pandemic and the crisis, as we ended the year with -- our inventory is down 7%. I could tell you, we were going in, in the channel, department stores across the board in North America, Asia and Europe. In our own stores, we were going into the year very clean and feeling really good with tremendous amount of momentum. I got to tell you, we were really feeling great in January before this all hit us and felt we were going to be starting the first quarter with a tremendous amount of momentum and the ability to continue to grow margins and add to our top line growth.
Obviously, that all changed within a couple of week period of time. The biggest challenge we're facing is that we've lost -- we have to assume that stores are going to be closed at a minimum through April here in North America and Europe, our 2 biggest markets. And we've lost at least 6 and -- to 8 weeks of spring selling and spring selling in the heart of the season. So I mean, you have to think of it that way. When you think about Easter, when you think about March, April, that's the heart of the season. As you're going into it, that's your biggest areas of doing full-price selling as you go in. So that losing that's -- that anywhere from 6 to 8 to 10 weeks of sales is really where the pressure point is going to be. And what we're looking at and stepping is really taken on is with the regions. And our brands across the board is what we're really looking at that inventory, making some judgments about what we should promote and liquidate through our own stores or through some partner accounts to really go after it.
The other piece that we're really looking hard at there is what should we repurpose and utilize to sell into the season and to sell through the season as we go forward. And we're looking at the ability to potentially pack and hold some really good merchandise that's in the warehouse that we'll use and maybe have to carry for a few months to bring it out as we go forward. So we're looking at all of those from a channel point of view as we think about inventory.
When we think about inventory for fall, we've done a lot of things for ourselves. Stefan has worked with the teams with Daniel Grieder in Europe, with Tom Chu in Asia and Cheryl and Ken Duane here in the United States, to really look at the inventory pipeline and with our logistics teams to really look at how that pipeline would be worked, try to push out with our partners to push inventory commitments out at least an additional 4 to 5 weeks, so we'll have some more visibility. We have been able to have deep conversations with our retail partners about what makes sense to cancel and what really is necessary as we go forward. So we're trying to balance that as we look at it.
I think it's -- the risk/reward today is to have less inventory and chase later, if we need more goods. The best story, if we're sitting here in the third quarter of this year and I'm sitting with you telling we're low on inventory and we're chasing fall, that would be a real excellent problem to have as we go forward.
Mike, are you going to take the second part of the question?"

Mike, I'm going to answer the first part. You'll take the CapEx. So just give me a moment to just respond. Look, the digital transaction has been the bright spot throughout this. It's -- even before the coronavirus, we were seeing 20% growth in our digital business. And our penetration for 2019, we've always talked about 10%, has grown to 12% overall digital penetration to PVH. I think this -- the pandemic is only accelerated that, not only in the short time frame, but I think it's also impacted the way consumers are going to shop going forward.
I think -- I was on Mad Money last night being interviewed, and I talked about it is -- I always had a general belief, and I think I've spoken on a number of calls and conferences about that over the next 5 to 6 years, we're going to continue to see consolidation in the retail industry. And we're going to see -- and wholesale apparel industry. And I thought that would be a 5-, 6-year path. I think this pandemic accelerates that. It accelerates the consumers' comfort level with buying apparel online. I think it accelerates the potential store closures and the C and D and E stores closing as we go forward. And we'll get to a healthier store base. We've always talked about that, especially in the U.S., there is too many stores. Our sales per -- sales per square foot per capita are by far the highest in the world. And it would be healthy to see that happen. But obviously, it's also going to be painful as we go through that process.
I think that what we're seeing in digital and the kind of growth market by market, we're seeing -- you see anywhere from 20% to 60% growth, depending on the channel. In China, our penetration continues to grow. We were somewhere in the neighborhood of about a 15% penetration in China. And I think that this year, it wouldn't surprise us if that moved to 20% as we're seeing outsized growth in our digital channel. We're growing digitally between 35% and 40% on digital sales. And that's a very high margin. So we're not out there promoting. We're out there connecting with our consumers, but we're not doing from a price point basis. We're doing it at a very positive level. So I think that's a bright spot, and I think it will continue to be a bright spot.
And on the cap side, that one -- capital expense side, that's one area where we haven't backed off, continue to make investments to support that business.

And I think -- look, objectively speaking, this is not an industry that has had across the board great inventory control metrics in place. That said, I think as we came out of holiday going into the first quarter, there was a tremendous cleanup that went on in the fourth quarter across the board to get inventories back in line. So at the end of January, what we saw was -- as a bright spot was inventories that were really under control throughout the channel, department stores, North America and Europe. And then even competitively, everyone took advantage of the good selling that was going on overall. And everyone saw some level of margin pressure when they reported earnings. But I think a big piece of that margin pressure was the objective to make sure inventories were clean as we went into 2020.
I think inventory was bought with more discipline because you heard us all complaining on our third quarter calls about open-to-buy dollars being so tight, and the retailers are trying to get turned under control. So that's all true. But I also think that there's going to be a significant amount of inventory. The loss of, let's say, 8 weeks of selling in spring will make the environment promotional, and we've planned for that in our cash flow. We've planned for that in our projections. And I think it's going to be a reality for a period of time."

But I think pack and hold, which we have historically not been big believers in, we try to turn the inventory into cash. If there's -- the old story is in apparel. If you're having a sales problem, this is not like wine that gets better with age. Your inventory gets worse. This is a completely different situation, and we have to have a completely different mindset. And I think a lot will depend on what the off-price promotional market looks like about how aggressive we would have to be in order to clear goods. And if it's too aggressive, I think we'll do exactly what you said, and we will pack and hold core that will -- that doesn't have a big seasonality to it. And then core plus that has a level of seasonality to it, I could see us packing it up for a period of time because there's -- the goods haven't hit the floor. The goods are in scale. I don't believe the goods would be out of cycle or -- from that point of view. So we will take a hard look at that and balance that with our cash flow and balance sheet requirements. But given the strength of our balance sheet, I think it's something that we will have as a tool that a lot of our competitors that are not nearly as well capitalized as we are, are not going to have the benefit of carrying goods for 6 or 9 months to get to spring next year and have quality goods to sell.
So that model has been used extensively by the off-price channel, the T.J.s and the losses. And I think we're going to have to take a lesson out of that and maybe have to park some inventory for a period of time. Interest rates are very low, and we'll take advantage of that as we go forward.

And then if we look at the inventory that is more towards core, it's a strength that we have. Both in Calvin and Tommy, we have a strong core, a lot of essential products that are less seasonally dependent. And we also have a replenishment system there that gives us much better opportunity to react.
When it comes to the more seasonal part of the assortment, it's the time we're taking while we have this freeze is to plan through what we're going to redirect, how we adjust flow timing, as Manny talked through, how we adjust volumes.

I think the winners are going to be those retailers that invested in their online capabilities. I believe in the omnichannel approach. Brick-and-mortar is not going away, but it needs to be coupled and needs to be aligned with your digital strategy. And it needs to be an experience that the consumer has that has no disruption in it. It needs to be clean, and it needs to be able to flow directly to them. And it needs to be experienced that doesn't have a lot of problems in it.
And I think a number of our players in North America, Macy's has made major investments there. And Nordstrom and a couple of other key players, including Kohl's, has really started to move in that direction. And I think you're going to see more of that. You're seeing retailers doing curbside pickup, and I think that's only going to continue. I think -- so those kinds of things, I think, are going to accelerate that thought process.
The other thing is there's a reality to this situation. And I think balance sheets are going to be stretched. Valuations are dramatically down from where they were just 2, 3 months ago when we opened the year. And given that, I think there is the opportunity -- there will be the opportunity to potentially do acquisitions and bring players together. And the old story that 1 plus 1 equals 4, where you can -- where particularly in a retail situation, there's tremendous leverage that you get from your fixed costs and your back office, being able to spread the investments over a larger base that you need to make in your digital investments, all of those things taking into play -- prior to the pandemic, I felt that we were going to see consolidation in the industry. I think the pandemic has done nothing but accelerate that. It's -- no matter what happens here, balance sheets will be weakened from where they were prior to this. Valuations are going to be lower. And I think -- given all that dynamic, I think there will be opportunity for consolidation. And I think you'll probably see an acceleration of store closings.
That's my theory. And I think it's a good way for us to think about how we have to plan the business and how we have to think about it strategically."

We look at the North America landscape, and these are -- we look at our customer base, which has historically been a very financially successful group of companies that are -- that in normal times are well capitalized and positioned that we really don't give much thought to credit being a major issue for these players. We've had to deal with some levels with some weaker players like Sears and whatever that went on years ago. But as we look at our major customers, it hasn't been.
We have to take that all into consideration as we plan and move forward. I think they have plenty of levers to pull, including their real estate has potentially cash-generating assets that help -- may help them get through this as they move forward. And like you said, a lot is going to depend. If the stores open up in May, I think it's -- everybody -- it's back to getting into business. But if it's 3 months after that, I think then there's going to be a real liquidity crisis as we go forward, and there's going to be winners and losers and potential financial hardship that comes with that. And we're going to have -- we're trying to plan accordingly."

It's also th",439,"Okay. I think there's 2 questions in here. I think there's, what do I think -- how do we -- what do I think and how are we planning the business when stores open. We're going to use the China model because I think it's the best model we have. It's also the one that makes the most sense to us. So just to put that into perspective and what that means for us. In China, we came into December, January comping up 5%, business very strong. The last week of January through February when the stores closed and there was all the disruption in China and those -- we saw the business go down to minus 85%, 90%. Basically, everything was being done digitally.
Beginning end of February, business opened. And for the month of March, overall, our business in China is back to about 65%. In the last week, it's probably close to being back to 70% of the business. Digital continues to be very strong. What we're seeing is in the major cities like Beijing and Hong Kong -- Beijing and Shanghai, we're seeing in those cities that are driven by, in some respect, international tourism. And we have the controls and store hours where the controls are tighter on movement and where the tourism has been a big impact on that business in those key cities. There is no tourism going on. Those 2 cities are feeling it much more than the rest of China at large. So it just gives you a sense of where we are.
We're expecting that as we get into the month of April, that minus 30% will move to minus 20%. And then we get into May, minus 20% will move to minus 15% or 10%. And we are assuming when we get into the second half of the year, we will start to -- assuming that the pandemic goes the way we hope it does, that business will start to get back to a more normal level as we get into the second half of the year. That's how we're planning it.
I think that's a prudent way for us to plan the way North America will come back as well. I don't think when stores open that the first thing consumers are going to do are going to run out to buy apparel and accessories and get online and go into stores immediately. I think it's going to be a ramp-up as that happens, as people get more and more comfortable with the situation. And I think that's how we're planning it. I hope that was helping."

Kimberly, we're not going to give up -- we're not giving guidance, so we're not going to give you an update on sales right now. But let's put it into perspective. The stores shut down in the middle of March. There is no sales going on brick-and-mortar in Europe, in North America, in Australia, in Brazil, on major markets. The only thing that's opened up, and I gave you the exact sales trends, what's going on in Asia, is Asia that's opened up. In Asia, our big markets, China, I talked about in detail, our career has bounced back the strongest for us. There, our March business is only down about 20%, and the last week was only down about 10%. And Japan seems to be following pretty closely to what's going on in China. Those are our 3 big markets in Asia, and that's what gives us a level of confidence about how we're thinking about planning the business once it's open.
It's very difficult to have any sense of what the sales are going to be because I have no crystal ball that's going to tell me when stores are going to be opened. I could tell you, pre-coronavirus, sales trends comps were very strong throughout. And then as the coronavirus started to impact us in February with tourism or whatever, we started to see our comps get impacted to a degree, but then -- and then stores close. But overall, we were still pretty happy with the kind of sales we were doing. And up until the very last week when stores around us were closing and people were starting paddling, our business was off probably around 50% overall, which we felt was really good given what was going on, on a store basis. But that was the kind of trends we were seeing right before the stores closed for that week or a 10-day period. Prior to that, business had been very strong for us. So I hope that helps. But trying to do modeling or whatever is really very difficult now.

We're all working from home today. So I want to thank everyone for joining us on our fourth quarter call. I must comment that it is, indeed, strange to be sitting in my living room for this call and not in my conference room, but I suppose that is the new normal. And I hope everyone is safe and healthy this morning.
We were extremely pleased to how we ended the year. We had a strong holiday season with increasing momentum across Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein in the majority of the regions where we operate. We had a significant revenue beat of about $100 million and exceeded our earnings guidance on a non-GAAP basis despite the impact from the coronavirus, which was not contemplated in our initial outlook. If you compare our fiscal year earnings per share results with our guidance of at least $9.45, we had a $0.31 beat out of earning -- out of our business outperformance from Calvin and Tommy and a $0.03 beat from lower interest and taxes. This was offset by a $0.25 hit for the corona inventory reserves that we booked that we recorded at the very end of the fourth quarter, which was not contemplated in our initial guidance.
I believe the magnitude of our business outperformance, especially our sales outperformance, given the backdrop that we were dealing with in the fourth quarter, was truly impressive and speaks to the health of our brands and the momentum in the business that we saw in the fourth quarter. We were pleased to end the year with very clean inventories. Overall, our inventory position was down 7% year-over-year, which also was better than the guidance we talked about.
Before I go into our financial results, I wanted to take a few moments to talk about the coronavirus, which I am sure is top of mind in everyone in the investment community. This is an unprecedented time, and it's a rapidly changing situation. And our hearts go out to all those impacted by the events that are unfolding. Our PVH people are demonstrating their passion and dedication to PVH, with most of our regions working remotely from home to continue to operate our business through this uncertain time. It has been inspiring to see our people rally together, and I truly believe that this demonstrates the power of PVH.
The spread of the coronavirus is unfortunately having a major impact on our business with temporary store closings felt across multiple continents, including store closures across Europe, the Americas and Australia. Our wholesale customers and licensees have been similarly impacted, which, in turn, negatively impacts PVH. Our digital sites and those of our key partners continue to service consumers, and we are seeing significant growth there. Depending on the market, we are seeing anywhere from 20% to over 50% growth on online versus last year, which we are balancing with the health and safety of our workers in the distribution center, making sure goods get to consumers. As a reminder, our digital business in 2019 was up approximately 20% globally and now represents about 12% of our total revenues versus 10% in 2018.
In China, we are seeing some encouraging early signs of recovery. All of our stores have reopened, but stores are operating with shorter hours, and approximately 95% of our franchisee stores are also open. We are seeing some rebound in sales with improvement week over week. And for the month of March, total business was down only about 35%, but digital sales are comping up closer to plus 40%. We know it clearly will take some time to return to normality and hope that our other regions will follow a similar path to normal business once the pandemic has passed.
Before I go into our business review and forward-looking comments, I want to touch on a few topics given the current climate. The health of our balance sheet remains our core strength. We recently drew down about $750 million from our revolver, which gives us over $1.2 billion in cash and available borrowings. We ended the fourth quarter with a gross leverage ratio of 2.2x and a net leverage ratio of 1.9x. Cash preservation is a critical focus of area of us now. We suspended our stock repurchasing program and also suspended our cash dividend beginning in the first quarter of 2020.
Cost-cutting measures have been implemented. We have taken a hard look at expenses and are reducing or canceling discretionary spending and variable expenses in many areas to navigate successfully and take the pressure off the business. This includes our marketing expenditures, although we continue to invest in our digital businesses as this is a critical channel for us to maintain our connection with our consumers and to transact globally with our consumers. As of now, store associates in the U.S., Canada and Europe continue to be paid through this week and next, and we are evaluating aiding any and all payroll opportunities and salary reductions, including looking at what different governments are offering as relief packages in each region.
We took a hard look at capital expenditures and now expect to spend around $190 million in CapEx for 2020, about a 45% reduction from 2019, as we have canceled or delayed capital projects that are not business-critical at this time. On the supply side, our supply chain is one of our key competitive advantages, and we have strong relationships with long-term partners. Therefore, we've been able to reduce our inventory commitments for the fall season, and we are redeploying some inventories, particularly core and core fashion from summer to fall; and consolidating some seasons, particularly holiday and spring, which will give us more time to make better decisions about making inventory commitments.
As we operate in so many countries around the world, we have a task force headed up by Stefan Larsson, our President, reviewing all options, including government relief and support and different inventory programs that we would utilize in each region. We will take advantage of any government support that's available to us as it is appropriate.
Lastly, as a reminder, in January, we announced our transaction to sell our Speedo business to Pentland, which is expected to close in April or this coming month for our business. And we will take advantage of that support of about $170 million that will come in as cash sometime in April.
Before I go into our financial review, I just want to take a moment and reiterate my confidence in PVH and the strengths that we have that will enable us to navigate this crisis. Our brands are iconic with incredibly strong brand health across the board. We have great consumer brand loyalty, and we are taking this opportunity to deepen our connection with the consumers even further as we leverage our always-on digital approach. The diversification of our business is a true advantage, both from a regional and a brand point of view. And we have significant category and regional opportunities to further extend our brands after the pandemic subsides. While the near term is uncertain, I do believe that PVH will emerge from this even stronger given the strength of our brand, our people and our strong competitive balance sheet.
Moving on to the business. We are pleased with the fourth quarter results, especially in light of the challenging and volatile global backdrop. Our revenues rose 6% on a constant currency basis, which significantly exceeded our previous guidance and exceeded it by about $100 million. I think that clearly demonstrates the momentum that we saw in the business, particularly in the December holiday season and in the January period, right before the coronavirus hit.
Outperformance was principally driven by our international businesses, which represented about $75 million of the $100 million beat. Europe, in particular, was strong, but also China.
In North America, we saw an outperformance against our plans of about $25 million in sales, and that was driven principally by our retail businesses, which comped significantly ahead of our initial plans. Our brand health in the region -- all regions is very strong for both Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein, and we feel we significantly outperformed our competition in the fourth quarter. Tommy continued to see an excellent response to its lifestyle offerings, which enabled us to continue to get -- gain share from regional and global competitors. Calvin Klein in Europe continued to see great trajectory of growth, and we remain confident in the long-term path to $2 billion in revenues, which were just about double our business from today, as we expanded both category offerings and capitalized on the consumer appetite for the brand.
If we look to the current state of the business in Europe, obviously, the region today is quite challenged due to the coronavirus epidemic. Our stores remain temporarily closed as per government regulations and so are those of certain of our key wholesale partners. Before the COVID-19 outbreak, our strong order books were for both brands, plus 12% for spring; and for fall, were plus 12% for Tommy and over 20% increase for Calvin Klein. However, in light of the crisis, there will be some pressure from our partners, and we need to support them through this period and allow for some level of cancellations in order to move goods through and in order to get inventories back in line. We will continue to manage this situation in order to position our both Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger for long-term growth in Europe.
Moving to North America. We had a great holiday season relative to our plans. Our wholesale business has performed quite well for both Tommy and Calvin, particularly on digital channels where we continue to grow our penetration. We remain a key account for our wholesale partners. Our brands are traffic drivers.
In our North America retail business in North America, Calvin Klein posted an 800 basis point acceleration in comp stores relative to the third quarter, which we were very pleased with. Comps overall for the quarter came in at plus 4%. However, we saw traffic in sales under pressure during the fourth quarter due to lower visits from international tourists, especially as we got closer to the Lunar New Year period in January. This had a particular impact on our Tommy Hilfiger retail business, which has about 40% of its sales coming from tourists and led us to take deeper discounts and markdowns.
Currently, in North America, there are clearly store closures for both our own stores and those of our wholesale partners. These temporary closures are pressuring our business, and we expect that we will have to deal with some pressure from order cancellations as we move forward. We're working with all of our retail partners to manage that and to manage the inventory flow.
Finally, for our results in Asia. I'd like to highlight that China showed a significant improvement in the fourth quarter relative to third quarter trends, with Tommy Hilfiger's fourth quarter comps up double digits and Calvin Klein fourth quarter comps flat. But in January, we saw significant increases, particularly in China. Obviously, this trend reversed with the coronavirus outbreak where we saw a significant drop in business in the fourth week of January and then moving to February.
As I mentioned earlier, the majority of our stores in Asia are now open, and we have seen a resurgence in business, which I will go into in more detail. Let me begin with talking about Tommy Hilfiger first. Tommy Hilfiger continued to experience momentum during the fourth quarter. Brand health remains strong as we continue to deliver differential product assortments and engaging consumer experiences. We had exciting partnerships, including our sponsorship of the 2020 Hahnenkamm ski races in Australia where Tommy Hilfiger did a full brand takeover. This was in addition to our new capsule collections, including a joint captain (sic) [ capsule ] collection with Lewis Hamilton and Grammy award-winning singer and songwriter H.E.R.
From a business position, Tommy increased its revenue an impressive 12% in the quarter and 13% on a constant currency basis, which significantly exceeded our revenue guidance by about $75 million. However, earnings declined 13% during the quarter, while earnings on Tommy Hilfiger business were up year-over-year during the quarter. This was offset by several factors, most notably the continued gross margin pressure in North America retail business to clear goods as well as the negative impact of additional inventory reserves that were unexpected at the time that we gave items in anticipation of lower sales caused by the coronavirus.
By segment, our international business continued to show strength with revenues up 22% on a constant currency basis, and overall comp stores up 10% with comp store increases particularly in Europe and China, which exceeded our guidance. Tommy's European business continued to outperform as it experienced double-digit revenue growth with strength across all channels of distribution in all markets and product categories. We believe that our market-leading position is driven by our excellent product, our compelling price-value proposition and strong brand power, which is allowing us to take share from regional and global competitors.
Our Asia business posted revenue growth during the fourth quarter. China was very strong for us with comps up double digit. We also experienced strong momentum in our Japan business and had the benefit of the addition of revenues from the acquisitions of our Australia and Central and Southern European Tommy businesses.
In North America, revenues declined only 2%, and margins were down -- but margins were down sharply. We continued to see very favorable trends at wholesale as our brand outperformed competition throughout holiday. However, results for our business -- our retail business, which were planned, were extremely challenged as we continue to take heavy markdowns to end the year clean with inventory.
Our global licensing business continued to be very favorable for us, particularly with G-III on our women's business, that continues to be an excellent partner for us and continue to exceed all of our sales plans for the Tommy Hilfiger women's business.
Despite the current pandemic, we continue to having incredible confidence in the long-term opportunities for the Tommy Hilfiger brand from category and regional expansion opportunities and the ability to optimize our distribution network globally.
Let me move to Calvin Klein now. We continue to expand -- experience brand heat during the fourth quarter. We deepened our connections with consumers by delivering compelling product, engaging brand experiences, and we're providing a platform for self-expression for our consumers. Importantly, we made significant progress to reposition and refocus the brand with an enhanced product focus. We recently launched CK Everyone, a clean fragrance; alongside the new CK One underwear and jeans collection, marking our first-ever cross-category marketing launch that spans both fragrance and fashion. This was a global launch for us for the brand.
We also debuted the spring Calvin Klein jeans and Calvin Klein underwear campaign, featuring new spring offerings and starring Justin Bieber, Lay Zhang, among other key talent people.
Moving to the business. Overall revenues decreased 2% or 1% on a constant currency basis. If you remove the jeans business, which was transferred to our G-III partner, business was up overall 1%, which beat our guidance by approximately $25 million. The only softness in business that we saw was in Asia in Hong Kong during the fourth quarter driven by the protest that continued, which had a major impact on that market's position -- sales position overall. By region, Calvin Klein international revenues increased 8% on a constant currency business (sic) [ basis ] with comp stores increasing overall by 1%. And if you remove the Hong Kong business from that comp store number, comp stores increased ex Hong Kong by 5%.
We continue to see excellent momentum in our European and our China business. Consumers responded well to our offerings for holiday, and performance was broad-based across our channels, markets and product categories. In Asia, we were pleased to see a notable acceleration in China during the quarter. Our trends were quite favorable before the coronavirus escalated.
Bearing that, we've made progress relating to our products and consumer engagement. And I think you can see that in the momentum we saw in sales, particularly in December and January, as we started to deliver new spring product. Our digital businesses continued to see excellent growth as the consumer is increasingly shopping online, and we added more online activation to drive overall engagement. Overall, we were very pleased with Asia's performance outside of Hong Kong, which continued to be impacted by the protest in the fourth quarter.
In North America, revenues declined 11%, largely driven by our decision to license the jeans business to G-III. Wholesale was a positive story for us, particularly our performance in the digital channels. Our retail business posted a sequential acceleration with comps up 4% in the fourth quarter. We were quite pleased with these results, which were achieved in conjunction with an improvement in far fewer and less promotional lockdowns than last year.
As we look past the current global backdrop, we continue to see strong long-term growth opportunities for the Calvin Klein brand, most notably our expansion in Europe, which we believe is at least $1 billion sales opportunity for us, driving both our -- driven both through all channels of distribution as we move forward. We continue to leverage our growth in the digital opportunities and leveraging our growth opportunities across Asia.
Finally, moving to our Heritage business. We continue to feel pressure due to the challenging North America retail environment in our Heritage Brands that really impact moderate price points such as our Heritage businesses. Revenues for the business declined 1% with flat comps in our own retail stores. Operating margins remained under pressure as planned as gross margin expansion in the business was offset by expense deleverage on the expense side. We will continue to look for additional ways to optimize and streamline the Heritage business in the future to generate enhanced returns. And we remain on track, as I mentioned before, with the sale of our Speedo business, which should occur in April.
Before I pass things over to Mike, I want to highlight that PVH's 140-year history is marked by a strong resiliency. We have overcome countless challenges, including the Great Depression, 2 world wars and the Great Recession in 2008. As we move forward, we have tremendous opportunities across PVH's business model to capture long-term sustainable profit growth from driving meaningful engagements with our consumers to continuous improvement in product at Calvin Klein to capturing the global distribution opportunities for both Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger. And we continue to look for ways to optimize our business model whether through the supply chain or through efficiencies across the business.
I believe that our core strengths, our talented people, our iconic brands and our strong financial fundamentals and our balance sheet -- our conservative balance sheet will continue to serve as key competitive advantages for us as we -- and will allow us to come out of this crisis stronger than we came in.
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Mike to talk about the financial results in more detail. Mike?"

The comments I'm about to make are based on non-GAAP results and are reconciled in our press release. I'm going to briefly touch on the fourth quarter of 2019 and then move on to 2020.
Our reported revenues were up 5% and up 6% on a constant currency basis, and revenues were much stronger than our previous guidance. Tommy Hilfiger revenues were very strong, up 12% as reported and 13% on a constant currency basis. And ForEx exceeded our previous guidance. Tommy Hilfiger International revenues increased 20% as reported and were up 22% on a constant currency basis. The Tommy Hilfiger International revenue increase was driven by continued outperformance in Europe and the revenue from our Australia and Tommy Hilfiger Central and Southeast Asia acquisitions. International comp store sales were up 10%.
Tommy Hilfiger North America revenues declined 2%. Growth in the wholesale business was offset by North America comp sales down 6%, primarily due to the lower traffic and spending in our stores in international tourist locations.
Our Calvin Klein revenues were down 2% as reported and decreased 1% on a constant currency basis and were better than our previous guidance. Calvin Klein International revenues increased 6% as reported and were up 8% on a constant currency basis driven by continued growth in Europe and the revenue from our Australia acquisition, partially offset by softness in Asia due to the Hong Kong protests.
Our international comp store sales were up 1%. Calvin Klein North America revenues decreased 11%. Our wholesale business revenues were negatively impacted compared to the prior year by the licensing of our women's jeans business to G-III. North America comp sales were up 4%. Heritage revenues were down 1% to the prior year and below our previous guidance. Our Heritage retail business comp store sales were relatively flat to the prior year.
Our non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.88, which was $0.09 better than our previous guidance. The EPS beat versus previous guidance was driven by outperformance in our Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein businesses for approximately $0.31 and favorable interest and taxes of $0.03. These beats were partially offset by additional inventory reserves we needed to approximately $0.25 because the onset of the virus occurred in Asia at the end of our fourth quarter.
For the full year 2019, we ended the year with record revenue of $9.9 billion, an increase of 3% versus the prior year, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $9.54.
Moving on to 2020. Our first quarter and full year 2020 results will be significantly negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The duration and extent of the pandemic is highly uncertain, and our results could be impacted in ways we are not able to predict today. As a result, we are not in a position to issue guidance for the quarter of fiscal year 2020. We're monitoring the situation closely with regard to our associates, customers, business partners and supply chain. We feel we are well positioned to manage through these uncertain times. We ended 2019 with cash of $503 million and with inventory levels down 7% compared to the prior year.
We're taking a number of steps to preserve liquidity and financial flexibility. We feel very comfortable with our liquidity position as we've drawn down from our revolving credit facility, in addition to suspending share repurchases under our stock repurchase program. Our mandatory long-term debt repayments in 2020 are only $14 million. This is in addition to suspending our cash dividend beginning with the second quarter of 2020. Our previously announced dividend was paid on March 31 and was not impacted by the suspension. We're reviewing every opportunity to eliminate discretionary spending. We are cutting capital expenditures to approximately $190 million from $345 million in the prior year, with capital expenditures only for minimum requirements in our retail stores and for projects currently in progress related to systems and warehouses.
We are also reducing operating expenses, including reviewing payroll opportunities and reducing all nonpayroll expenses, including creative marketing and travel. We're also tightly managing working capital. We are adjusting inventory levels by canceling and delaying orders. We're extending payment terms to both merchandise and nonmerchandise vendor invoices or suspending the payment of rent temporarily and delaying or canceling planned new store openings.
Also, as a reminder, our sale of Speedo North America business to Pentland Group PLC, the parent company of Speedo brand, is expected to close in the first quarter of 2020 for $170 million cash, subject to a working capital adjustment.
We will give guidance for future quarters and the year once there is more clarity on the impact and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. As we work through 2020, our financial discipline will help us take advantage of the opportunities available to us to withstand the current pressures on our business and emerge from the crisis well positioned to capture long-term sustainable profitable growth.
And with that, operator, we'll open it up for questions."

I'm one of the fortunate ones. Whatever symptoms, they have been unbelievably mild. And I've been able to continue to work and operate and focus on the business.
From a -- look, spring/summer inventory is the biggest issue that everybody is dealing with, first. Goods are coming in. Goods have been ordered. Prior to the pandemic and the crisis, as we ended the year with -- our inventory is down 7%. I could tell you, we were going in, in the channel, department stores across the board in North America, Asia and Europe. In our own stores, we were going into the year very clean and feeling really good with tremendous amount of momentum. I got to tell you, we were really feeling great in January before this all hit us and felt we were going to be starting the first quarter with a tremendous amount of momentum and the ability to continue to grow margins and add to our top line growth.
Obviously, that all changed within a couple of week period of time. The biggest challenge we're facing is that we've lost -- we have to assume that stores are going to be closed at a minimum through April here in North America and Europe, our 2 biggest markets. And we've lost at least 6 and -- to 8 weeks of spring selling and spring selling in the heart of the season. So I mean, you have to think of it that way. When you think about Easter, when you think about March, April, that's the heart of the season. As you're going into it, that's your biggest areas of doing full-price selling as you go in. So that losing that's -- that anywhere from 6 to 8 to 10 weeks of sales is really where the pressure point is going to be. And what we're looking at and stepping is really taken on is with the regions. And our brands across the board is what we're really looking at that inventory, making some judgments about what we should promote and liquidate through our own stores or through some partner accounts to really go after it.
The other piece that we're really looking hard at there is what should we repurpose and utilize to sell into the season and to sell through the season as we go forward. And we're looking at the ability to potentially pack and hold some really good merchandise that's in the warehouse that we'll use and maybe have to carry for a few months to bring it out as we go forward. So we're looking at all of those from a channel point of view as we think about inventory.
When we think about inventory for fall, we've done a lot of things for ourselves. Stefan has worked with the teams with Daniel Grieder in Europe, with Tom Chu in Asia and Cheryl and Ken Duane here in the United States, to really look at the inventory pipeline and with our logistics teams to really look at how that pipeline would be worked, try to push out with our partners to push inventory commitments out at least an additional 4 to 5 weeks, so we'll have some more visibility. We have been able to have deep conversations with our retail partners about what makes sense to cancel and what really is necessary as we go forward. So we're trying to balance that as we look at it.
I think it's -- the risk/reward today is to have less inventory and chase later, if we need more goods. The best story, if we're sitting here in the third quarter of this year and I'm sitting with you telling we're low on inventory and we're chasing fall, that would be a real excellent problem to have as we go forward.
Mike, are you going to take the second part of the question?"

And it will just be a matter of doing the right things in the short term to be in a position that when things do get better and we do open, we have the base ready to move, ready to staff up and ready to reopen with the appropriate tools at their availability. So we're making every discretionary cut we can at this point. Really, it's anything discretionary."

Mike, I'm going to answer the first part. You'll take the CapEx. So just give me a moment to just respond. Look, the digital transaction has been the bright spot throughout this. It's -- even before the coronavirus, we were seeing 20% growth in our digital business. And our penetration for 2019, we've always talked about 10%, has grown to 12% overall digital penetration to PVH. I think this -- the pandemic is only accelerated that, not only in the short time frame, but I think it's also impacted the way consumers are going to shop going forward.
I think -- I was on Mad Money last night being interviewed, and I talked about it is -- I always had a general belief, and I think I've spoken on a number of calls and conferences about that over the next 5 to 6 years, we're going to continue to see consolidation in the retail industry. And we're going to see -- and wholesale apparel industry. And I thought that would be a 5-, 6-year path. I think this pandemic accelerates that. It accelerates the consumers' comfort level with buying apparel online. I think it accelerates the potential store closures and the C and D and E stores closing as we go forward. And we'll get to a healthier store base. We've always talked about that, especially in the U.S., there is too many stores. Our sales per -- sales per square foot per capita are by far the highest in the world. And it would be healthy to see that happen. But obviously, it's also going to be painful as we go through that process.
I think that what we're seeing in digital and the kind of growth market by market, we're seeing -- you see anywhere from 20% to 60% growth, depending on the channel. In China, our penetration continues to grow. We were somewhere in the neighborhood of about a 15% penetration in China. And I think that this year, it wouldn't surprise us if that moved to 20% as we're seeing outsized growth in our digital channel. We're growing digitally between 35% and 40% on digital sales. And that's a very high margin. So we're not out there promoting. We're out there connecting with our consumers, but we're not doing from a price point basis. We're doing it at a very positive level. So I think that's a bright spot, and I think it will continue to be a bright spot.
And on the cap side, that one -- capital expense side, that's one area where we haven't backed off, continue to make investments to support that business.

And I think -- look, objectively speaking, this is not an industry that has had across the board great inventory control metrics in place. That said, I think as we came out of holiday going into the first quarter, there was a tremendous cleanup that went on in the fourth quarter across the board to get inventories back in line. So at the end of January, what we saw was -- as a bright spot was inventories that were really under control throughout the channel, department stores, North America and Europe. And then even competitively, everyone took advantage of the good selling that was going on overall. And everyone saw some level of margin pressure when they reported earnings. But I think a big piece of that margin pressure was the objective to make sure inventories were clean as we went into 2020.
I think inventory was bought with more discipline because you heard us all complaining on our third quarter calls about open-to-buy dollars being so tight, and the retailers are trying to get turned under control. So that's all true. But I also think that there's going to be a significant amount of inventory. The loss of, let's say, 8 weeks of selling in spring will make the environment promotional, and we've planned for that in our cash flow. We've planned for that in our projections. And I think it's going to be a reality for a period of time."

If you're having a sales problem, this is not like wine that gets better with age. Your inventory gets worse. This is a completely different situation, and we have to have a completely different mindset.

And if it's too aggressive, I think we'll do exactly what you said, and we will pack and hold core that will -- that doesn't have a big seasonality to it. And then core plus that has a level of seasonality to it, I could see us packing it up for a period of time because there's -- the goods haven't hit the floor. The goods are in scale. I don't believe the goods would be out of cycle or -- from that point of view. So we will take a hard look at that and balance that with our cash flow and balance sheet requirements. But given the strength of our balance sheet, I think it's something that we will have as a tool that a lot of our competitors that are not nearly as well capitalized as we are, are not going to have the benefit of carrying goods for 6 or 9 months to get to spring next year and have quality goods to sell.
So that model has been used extensively by the off-price channel, the T.J.s and the losses. And I think we're going to have to take a lesson out of that and maybe have to park some inventory for a period of time. Interest rates are very low, and we'll take advantage of that as we go forward.
Stefan, I hope I left you something to comment on."

Thank you, Manny. And Jay, yes, when it comes to the inventory and receipt part of navigating through the crisis, we are starting with -- the most important first step is that as soon as we saw this coming playing out, we froze everything that hasn't been cut. So we bought ourselves time to take the right actions.
And then if we look at the inventory that is more towards core, it's a strength that we have. Both in Calvin and Tommy, we have a strong core, a lot of essential products that are less seasonally dependent. And we also have a replenishment system there that gives us much better opportunity to react.
When it comes to the more seasonal part of the assortment, it's the time we're taking while we have this freeze is to plan through what we're going to redirect, how we adjust flow timing, as Manny talked through, how we adjust volumes. So we have significant opportunities to, in this very difficult situation, try to optimize inventory and receive as much as possible and then with the biggest strength being our core."

And I think that you start with that as a premise. Also, the consumer getting more and more comfortable shopping online. I think the winners are going to be those retailers that invested in their online capabilities. I believe in the omnichannel approach. Brick-and-mortar is not going away, but it needs to be coupled and needs to be aligned with your digital strategy. And it needs to be an experience that the consumer has that has no disruption in it. It needs to be clean, and it needs to be able to flow directly to them. And it needs to be experienced that doesn't have a lot of problems in it.
And I think a number of our players in North America, Macy's has made major investments there. And Nordstrom and a couple of other key players, including Kohl's, has really started to move in that direction. And I think you're going to see more of that. You're seeing retailers doing curbside pickup, and I think that's only going to continue. I think -- so those kinds of things, I think, are going to accelerate that thought process.
The other thing is there's a reality to this situation. And I think balance sheets are going to be stretched. Valuations are dramatically down from where they were just 2, 3 months ago when we opened the year. And given that, I think there is the opportunity -- there will be the opportunity to potentially do acquisitions and bring players together. And the old story that 1 plus 1 equals 4, where you can -- where particularly in a retail situation, there's tremendous leverage that you get from your fixed costs and your back office, being able to spread the investments over a larger base that you need to make in your digital investments, all of those things taking into play -- prior to the pandemic, I felt that we were going to see consolidation in the industry. I think the pandemic has done nothing but accelerate that. It's -- no matter what happens here, balance sheets will be weakened from where they were prior to this. Valuations are going to be lower. And I think -- given all that dynamic, I think there will be opportunity for consolidation. And I think you'll probably see an acceleration of store closings.
That's my theory. And I think it's a good way for us to think about how we have to plan the business and how we have to think about it strategically."

So I'm just -- I'm curious, what are you -- how are you thinking about your business?

We've had to deal with some levels with some weaker players like Sears and whatever that went on years ago. But as we look at our major customers, it hasn't been.
We have to take that all into consideration as we plan and move forward. I think they have plenty of levers to pull, including their real estate has potentially cash-generating assets that help -- may help them get through this as they move forward. And like you said, a lot is going to depend. If the stores open up in May, I think it's -- everybody -- it's back to getting into business.

We're going to use the China model because I think it's the best model we have. It's also the one that makes the most sense to us. So just to put that into perspective and what that means for us. In China, we came into December, January comping up 5%, business very strong. The last week of January through February when the stores closed and there was all the disruption in China and those -- we saw the business go down to minus 85%, 90%. Basically, everything was being done digitally.
Beginning end of February, business opened. And for the month of March, overall, our business in China is back to about 65%. In the last week, it's probably close to being back to 70% of the business. Digital continues to be very strong. What we're seeing is in the major cities like Beijing and Hong Kong -- Beijing and Shanghai, we're seeing in those cities that are driven by, in some respect, international tourism. And we have the controls and store hours where the controls are tighter on movement and where the tourism has been a big impact on that business in those key cities. There is no tourism going on. Those 2 cities are feeling it much more than the rest of China at large. So it just gives you a sense of where we are.
We're expecting that as we get into the month of April, that minus 30% will move to minus 20%. And then we get into May, minus 20% will move to minus 15% or 10%. And we are assuming when we get into the second half of the year, we will start to -- assuming that the pandemic goes the way we hope it does, that business will start to get back to a more normal level as we get into the second half of the year. That's how we're planning it.
I think that's a prudent way for us to plan the way North America will come back as well. I don't think when stores open that the first thing consumers are going to do are going to run out to buy apparel and accessories and get online and go into stores immediately. I think it's going to be a ramp-up as that happens, as people get more and more comfortable with the situation. And I think that's how we're planning it. I hope that was helping."

Kimberly, we're not going to give up -- we're not giving guidance, so we're not going to give you an update on sales right now. But let's put it into perspective. The stores shut down in the middle of March. There is no sales going on brick-and-mortar in Europe, in North America, in Australia, in Brazil, on major markets. The only thing that's opened up, and I gave you the exact sales trends, what's going on in Asia, is Asia that's opened up. In Asia, our big markets, China, I talked about in detail, our career has bounced back the strongest for us. There, our March business is only down about 20%, and the last week was only down about 10%. And Japan seems to be following pretty closely to what's going on in China. Those are our 3 big markets in Asia, and that's what gives us a level of confidence about how we're thinking about planning the business once it's open.
It's very difficult to have any sense of what the sales are going to be because I have no crystal ball that's going to tell me when stores are going to be opened. I could tell you, pre-coronavirus, sales trends comps were very strong throughout. And then as the coronavirus started to impact us in February with tourism or whatever, we started to see our comps get impacted to a degree, but then -- and then stores close. But overall, we were still pretty happy with the kind of sales we were doing. And up until the very last week when stores around us were closing and people were starting paddling, our business was off probably around 50% overall, which we felt was really good given what was going on, on a store basis. But that was the kind of trends we were seeing right before the stores closed for that week or a 10-day period. Prior to that, business had been very strong for us. So I hope that helps. But trying to do modeling or whatever is really very difficult now.

Joining me on the call is Stefan Larsson, our President; Mike Shaffer, our Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer; and Dana Perlman, Treasurer and Senior Vice President of Business Development and Investor Relations.
We're all working from home today. So I want to thank everyone for joining us on our fourth quarter call. I must comment that it is, indeed, strange to be sitting in my living room for this call and not in my conference room, but I suppose that is the new normal. And I hope everyone is safe and healthy this morning.
We were extremely pleased to how we ended the year. We had a strong holiday season with increasing momentum across Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein in the majority of the regions where we operate. We had a significant revenue beat of about $100 million and exceeded our earnings guidance on a non-GAAP basis despite the impact from the coronavirus, which was not contemplated in our initial outlook. If you compare our fiscal year earnings per share results with our guidance of at least $9.45, we had a $0.31 beat out of earning -- out of our business outperformance from Calvin and Tommy and a $0.03 beat from lower interest and taxes. This was offset by a $0.25 hit for the corona inventory reserves that we booked that we recorded at the very end of the fourth quarter, which was not contemplated in our initial guidance.
I believe the magnitude of our business outperformance, especially our sales outperformance, given the backdrop that we were dealing with in the fourth quarter, was truly impressive and speaks to the health of our brands and the momentum in the business that we saw in the fourth quarter. We were pleased to end the year with very clean inventories. Overall, our inventory position was down 7% year-over-year, which also was better than the guidance we talked about.
Before I go into our financial results, I wanted to take a few moments to talk about the coronavirus, which I am sure is top of mind in everyone in the investment community. This is an unprecedented time, and it's a rapidly changing situation. And our hearts go out to all those impacted by the events that are unfolding. Our PVH people are demonstrating their passion and dedication to PVH, with most of our regions working remotely from home to continue to operate our business through this uncertain time. It has been inspiring to see our people rally together, and I truly believe that this demonstrates the power of PVH.
The spread of the coronavirus is unfortunately having a major impact on our business with temporary store closings felt across multiple continents, including store closures across Europe, the Americas and Australia. Our wholesale customers and licensees have been similarly impacted, which, in turn, negatively impacts PVH. Our digital sites and those of our key partners continue to service consumers, and we are seeing significant growth there. Depending on the market, we are seeing anywhere from 20% to over 50% growth on online versus last year, which we are balancing with the health and safety of our workers in the distribution center, making sure goods get to consumers. As a reminder, our digital business in 2019 was up approximately 20% globally and now represents about 12% of our total revenues versus 10% in 2018.
In China, we are seeing some encouraging early signs of recovery. All of our stores have reopened, but stores are operating with shorter hours, and approximately 95% of our franchisee stores are also open. We are seeing some rebound in sales with improvement week over week. And for the month of March, total business was down only about 35%, but digital sales are comping up closer to plus 40%. We know it clearly will take some time to return to normality and hope that our other regions will follow a similar path to normal business once the pandemic has passed.
Before I go into our business review and forward-looking comments, I want to touch on a few topics given the current climate. The health of our balance sheet remains our core strength. We recently drew down about $750 million from our revolver, which gives us over $1.2 billion in cash and available borrowings. We ended the fourth quarter with a gross leverage ratio of 2.2x and a net leverage ratio of 1.9x. Cash preservation is a critical focus of area of us now. We suspended our stock repurchasing program and also suspended our cash dividend beginning in the first quarter of 2020.
Cost-cutting measures have been implemented. We have taken a hard look at expenses and are reducing or canceling discretionary spending and variable expenses in many areas to navigate successfully and take the pressure off the business. This includes our marketing expenditures, although we continue to invest in our digital businesses as this is a critical channel for us to maintain our connection with our consumers and to transact globally with our consumers. As of now, store associates in the U.S., Canada and Europe continue to be paid through this week and next, and we are evaluating aiding any and all payroll opportunities and salary reductions, including looking at what different governments are offering as relief packages in each region.
We took a hard look at capital expenditures and now expect to spend around $190 million in CapEx for 2020, about a 45% reduction from 2019, as we have canceled or delayed capital projects that are not business-critical at this time. On the supply side, our supply chain is one of our key competitive advantages, and we have strong relationships with long-term partners. Therefore, we've been able to reduce our inventory commitments for the fall season, and we are redeploying some inventories, particularly core and core fashion from summer to fall; and consolidating some seasons, particularly holiday and spring, which will give us more time to make better decisions about making inventory commitments.
As we operate in so many countries around the world, we have a task force headed up by Stefan Larsson, our President, reviewing all options, including government relief and support and different inventory programs that we would utilize in each region. We will take advantage of any government support that's available to us as it is appropriate.
Lastly, as a reminder, in January, we announced our transaction to sell our Speedo business to Pentland, which is expected to close in April or this coming month for our business. And we will take advantage of that support of about $170 million that will come in as cash sometime in April.
Before I go into our financial review, I just want to take a moment and reiterate my confidence in PVH and the strengths that we have that will enable us to navigate this crisis. Our brands are iconic with incredibly strong brand health across the board. We have great consumer brand loyalty, and we are taking this opportunity to deepen our connection with the consumers even further as we leverage our always-on digital approach. The diversification of our business is a true advantage, both from a regional and a brand point of view. And we have significant category and regional opportunities to further extend our brands after the pandemic subsides. While the near term is uncertain, I do believe that PVH will emerge from this even stronger given the strength of our brand, our people and our strong competitive balance sheet.
Moving on to the business. We are pleased with the fourth quarter results, especially in light of the challenging and volatile global backdrop. Our revenues rose 6% on a constant currency basis, which significantly exceeded our previous guidance and exceeded it by about $100 million. I think that clearly demonstrates the momentum that we saw in the business, particularly in the December holiday season and in the January period, right before the coronavirus hit.
Outperformance was principally driven by our international businesses, which represented about $75 million of the $100 million beat. Europe, in particular, was strong, but also China.
In North America, we saw an outperformance against our plans of about $25 million in sales, and that was driven principally by our retail businesses, which comped significantly ahead of our initial plans. Our brand health in the region -- all regions is very strong for both Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein, and we feel we significantly outperformed our competition in the fourth quarter. Tommy continued to see an excellent response to its lifestyle offerings, which enabled us to continue to get -- gain share from regional and global competitors. Calvin Klein in Europe continued to see great trajectory of growth, and we remain confident in the long-term path to $2 billion in revenues, which were just about double our business from today, as we expanded both category offerings and capitalized on the consumer appetite for the brand.
If we look to the current state of the business in Europe, obviously, the region today is quite challenged due to the coronavirus epidemic. Our stores remain temporarily closed as per government regulations and so are those of certain of our key wholesale partners. Before the COVID-19 outbreak, our strong order books were for both brands, plus 12% for spring; and for fall, were plus 12% for Tommy and over 20% increase for Calvin Klein. However, in light of the crisis, there will be some pressure from our partners, and we need to support them through this period and allow for some level of cancellations in order to move goods through and in order to get inventories back in line. We will continue to manage this situation in order to position our both Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger for long-term growth in Europe.
Moving to North America. We had a great holiday season relative to our plans. Our wholesale business has performed quite well for both Tommy and Calvin, particularly on digital channels where we continue to grow our penetration. We remain a key account for our wholesale partners. Our brands are traffic drivers.
In our North America retail business in North America, Calvin Klein posted an 800 basis point acceleration in comp stores relative to the third quarter, which we were very pleased with. Comps overall for the quarter came in at plus 4%. However, we saw traffic in sales under pressure during the fourth quarter due to lower visits from international tourists, especially as we got closer to the Lunar New Year period in January. This had a particular impact on our Tommy Hilfiger retail business, which has about 40% of its sales coming from tourists and led us to take deeper discounts and markdowns.
Currently, in North America, there are clearly store closures for both our own stores and those of our wholesale partners. These temporary closures are pressuring our business, and we expect that we will have to deal with some pressure from order cancellations as we move forward. We're working with all of our retail partners to manage that and to manage the inventory flow.
Finally, for our results in Asia. I'd like to highlight that China showed a significant improvement in the fourth quarter relative to third quarter trends, with Tommy Hilfiger's fourth quarter comps up double digits and Calvin Klein fourth quarter comps flat. But in January, we saw significant increases, particularly in China. Obviously, this trend reversed with the coronavirus outbreak where we saw a significant drop in business in the fourth week of January and then moving to February.
As I mentioned earlier, the majority of our stores in Asia are now open, and we have seen a resurgence in business, which I will go into in more detail. Let me begin with talking about Tommy Hilfiger first. Tommy Hilfiger continued to experience momentum during the fourth quarter. Brand health remains strong as we continue to deliver differential product assortments and engaging consumer experiences. We had exciting partnerships, including our sponsorship of the 2020 Hahnenkamm ski races in Australia where Tommy Hilfiger did a full brand takeover. This was in addition to our new capsule collections, including a joint captain (sic) [ capsule ] collection with Lewis Hamilton and Grammy award-winning singer and songwriter H.E.R.
From a business position, Tommy increased its revenue an impressive 12% in the quarter and 13% on a constant currency basis, which significantly exceeded our revenue guidance by about $75 million. However, earnings declined 13% during the quarter, while earnings on Tommy Hilfiger business were up year-over-year during the quarter. This was offset by several factors, most notably the continued gross margin pressure in North America retail business to clear goods as well as the negative impact of additional inventory reserves that were unexpected at the time that we gave items in anticipation of lower sales caused by the coronavirus.
By segment, our international business continued to show strength with revenues up 22% on a constant currency basis, and overall comp stores up 10% with comp store increases particularly in Europe and China, which exceeded our guidance. Tommy's European business continued to outperform as it experienced double-digit revenue growth with strength across all channels of distribution in all markets and product categories. We believe that our market-leading position is driven by our excellent product, our compelling price-value proposition and strong brand power, which is allowing us to take share from regional and global competitors.
Our Asia business posted revenue growth during the fourth quarter. China was very strong for us with comps up double digit. We also experienced strong momentum in our Japan business and had the benefit of the addition of revenues from the acquisitions of our Australia and Central and Southern European Tommy businesses.
In North America, revenues declined only 2%, and margins were down -- but margins were down sharply. We continued to see very favorable trends at wholesale as our brand outperformed competition throughout holiday. However, results for our business -- our retail business, which were planned, were extremely challenged as we continue to take heavy markdowns to end the year clean with inventory.
Our global licensing business continued to be very favorable for us, particularly with G-III on our women's business, that continues to be an excellent partner for us and continue to exceed all of our sales plans for the Tommy Hilfiger women's business.
Despite the current pandemic, we continue to having incredible confidence in the long-term opportunities for the Tommy Hilfiger brand from category and regional expansion opportunities and the ability to optimize our distribution network globally.
Let me move to Calvin Klein now. We continue to expand -- experience brand heat during the fourth quarter. We deepened our connections with consumers by delivering compelling product, engaging brand experiences, and we're providing a platform for self-expression for our consumers. Importantly, we made significant progress to reposition and refocus the brand with an enhanced product focus. We recently launched CK Everyone, a clean fragrance; alongside the new CK One underwear and jeans collection, marking our first-ever cross-category marketing launch that spans both fragrance and fashion. This was a global launch for us for the brand.
We also debuted the spring Calvin Klein jeans and Calvin Klein underwear campaign, featuring new spring offerings and starring Justin Bieber, Lay Zhang, among other key talent people.
Moving to the business. Overall revenues decreased 2% or 1% on a constant currency basis. If you remove the jeans business, which was transferred to our G-III partner, business was up overall 1%, which beat our guidance by approximately $25 million. The only softness in business that we saw was in Asia in Hong Kong during the fourth quarter driven by the protest that continued, which had a major impact on that market's position -- sales position overall. By region, Calvin Klein international revenues increased 8% on a constant currency business (sic) [ basis ] with comp stores increasing overall by 1%. And if you remove the Hong Kong business from that comp store number, comp stores increased ex Hong Kong by 5%.
We continue to see excellent momentum in our European and our China business. Consumers responded well to our offerings for holiday, and performance was broad-based across our channels, markets and product categories. In Asia, we were pleased to see a notable acceleration in China during the quarter. Our trends were quite favorable before the coronavirus escalated.
Bearing that, we've made progress relating to our products and consumer engagement. And I think you can see that in the momentum we saw in sales, particularly in December and January, as we started to deliver new spring product. Our digital businesses continued to see excellent growth as the consumer is increasingly shopping online, and we added more online activation to drive overall engagement. Overall, we were very pleased with Asia's performance outside of Hong Kong, which continued to be impacted by the protest in the fourth quarter.
In North America, revenues declined 11%, largely driven by our decision to license the jeans business to G-III. Wholesale was a positive story for us, particularly our performance in the digital channels. Our retail business posted a sequential acceleration with comps up 4% in the fourth quarter. We were quite pleased with these results, which were achieved in conjunction with an improvement in far fewer and less promotional lockdowns than last year.
As we look past the current global backdrop, we continue to see strong long-term growth opportunities for the Calvin Klein brand, most notably our expansion in Europe, which we believe is at least $1 billion sales opportunity for us, driving both our -- driven both through all channels of distribution as we move forward. We continue to leverage our growth in the digital opportunities and leveraging our growth opportunities across Asia.
Finally, moving to our Heritage business. We continue to feel pressure due to the challenging North America retail environment in our Heritage Brands that really impact moderate price points such as our Heritage businesses. Revenues for the business declined 1% with flat comps in our own retail stores. Operating margins remained under pressure as planned as gross margin expansion in the business was offset by expense deleverage on the expense side. We will continue to look for additional ways to optimize and streamline the Heritage business in the future to generate enhanced returns. And we remain on track, as I mentioned before, with the sale of our Speedo business, which should occur in April.
Before I pass things over to Mike, I want to highlight that PVH's 140-year history is marked by a strong resiliency. We have overcome countless challenges, including the Great Depression, 2 world wars and the Great Recession in 2008. As we move forward, we have tremendous opportunities across PVH's business model to capture long-term sustainable profit growth from driving meaningful engagements with our consumers to continuous improvement in product at Calvin Klein to capturing the global distribution opportunities for both Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger. And we continue to look for ways to optimize our business model whether through the supply chain or through efficiencies across the business.
I believe that our core strengths, our talented people, our iconic brands and our strong financial fundamentals and our balance sheet -- our conservative balance sheet will continue to serve as key competitive advantages for us as we -- and will allow us to come out of this crisis stronger than we came in.
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Mike to talk about the financial results in more detail. Mike?"

The comments I'm about to make are based on non-GAAP results and are reconciled in our press release. I'm going to briefly touch on the fourth quarter of 2019 and then move on to 2020.
Our reported revenues were up 5% and up 6% on a constant currency basis, and revenues were much stronger than our previous guidance. Tommy Hilfiger revenues were very strong, up 12% as reported and 13% on a constant currency basis. And ForEx exceeded our previous guidance. Tommy Hilfiger International revenues increased 20% as reported and were up 22% on a constant currency basis. The Tommy Hilfiger International revenue increase was driven by continued outperformance in Europe and the revenue from our Australia and Tommy Hilfiger Central and Southeast Asia acquisitions. International comp store sales were up 10%.
Tommy Hilfiger North America revenues declined 2%. Growth in the wholesale business was offset by North America comp sales down 6%, primarily due to the lower traffic and spending in our stores in international tourist locations.
Our Calvin Klein revenues were down 2% as reported and decreased 1% on a constant currency basis and were better than our previous guidance. Calvin Klein International revenues increased 6% as reported and were up 8% on a constant currency basis driven by continued growth in Europe and the revenue from our Australia acquisition, partially offset by softness in Asia due to the Hong Kong protests.
Our international comp store sales were up 1%. Calvin Klein North America revenues decreased 11%. Our wholesale business revenues were negatively impacted compared to the prior year by the licensing of our women's jeans business to G-III. North America comp sales were up 4%. Heritage revenues were down 1% to the prior year and below our previous guidance. Our Heritage retail business comp store sales were relatively flat to the prior year.
Our non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.88, which was $0.09 better than our previous guidance. The EPS beat versus previous guidance was driven by outperformance in our Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein businesses for approximately $0.31 and favorable interest and taxes of $0.03. These beats were partially offset by additional inventory reserves we needed to approximately $0.25 because the onset of the virus occurred in Asia at the end of our fourth quarter.
For the full year 2019, we ended the year with record revenue of $9.9 billion, an increase of 3% versus the prior year, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $9.54.
Moving on to 2020. Our first quarter and full year 2020 results will be significantly negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The duration and extent of the pandemic is highly uncertain, and our results could be impacted in ways we are not able to predict today. As a result, we are not in a position to issue guidance for the quarter of fiscal year 2020. We're monitoring the situation closely with regard to our associates, customers, business partners and supply chain. We feel we are well positioned to manage through these uncertain times. We ended 2019 with cash of $503 million and with inventory levels down 7% compared to the prior year.
We're taking a number of steps to preserve liquidity and financial flexibility. We feel very comfortable with our liquidity position as we've drawn down from our revolving credit facility, in addition to suspending share repurchases under our stock repurchase program. Our mandatory long-term debt repayments in 2020 are only $14 million. This is in addition to suspending our cash dividend beginning with the second quarter of 2020. Our previously announced dividend was paid on March 31 and was not impacted by the suspension. We're reviewing every opportunity to eliminate discretionary spending. We are cutting capital expenditures to approximately $190 million from $345 million in the prior year, with capital expenditures only for minimum requirements in our retail stores and for projects currently in progress related to systems and warehouses.
We are also reducing operating expenses, including reviewing payroll opportunities and reducing all nonpayroll expenses, including creative marketing and travel. We're also tightly managing working capital. We are adjusting inventory levels by canceling and delaying orders. We're extending payment terms to both merchandise and nonmerchandise vendor invoices or suspending the payment of rent temporarily and delaying or canceling planned new store openings.
Also, as a reminder, our sale of Speedo North America business to Pentland Group PLC, the parent company of Speedo brand, is expected to close in the first quarter of 2020 for $170 million cash, subject to a working capital adjustment.
We will give guidance for future quarters and the year once there is more clarity on the impact and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. As we work through 2020, our financial discipline will help us take advantage of the opportunities available to us to withstand the current pressures on our business and emerge from the crisis well positioned to capture long-term sustainable profitable growth.
And with that, operator, we'll open it up for questions."

And then the second question, I don't know, it's probably for Mike. Mike, can you just talk a little bit about the biggest buckets of expense opportunity as you think about where you could pull the levers, whether it is payroll, whether it is rent, even on the marketing side, just sort of how you're really approaching it?

I'm one of the fortunate ones. Whatever symptoms, they have been unbelievably mild. And I've been able to continue to work and operate and focus on the business.
From a -- look, spring/summer inventory is the biggest issue that everybody is dealing with, first. Goods are coming in. Goods have been ordered. Prior to the pandemic and the crisis, as we ended the year with -- our inventory is down 7%. I could tell you, we were going in, in the channel, department stores across the board in North America, Asia and Europe. In our own stores, we were going into the year very clean and feeling really good with tremendous amount of momentum. I got to tell you, we were really feeling great in January before this all hit us and felt we were going to be starting the first quarter with a tremendous amount of momentum and the ability to continue to grow margins and add to our top line growth.
Obviously, that all changed within a couple of week period of time. The biggest challenge we're facing is that we've lost -- we have to assume that stores are going to be closed at a minimum through April here in North America and Europe, our 2 biggest markets. And we've lost at least 6 and -- to 8 weeks of spring selling and spring selling in the heart of the season. So I mean, you have to think of it that way. When you think about Easter, when you think about March, April, that's the heart of the season. As you're going into it, that's your biggest areas of doing full-price selling as you go in. So that losing that's -- that anywhere from 6 to 8 to 10 weeks of sales is really where the pressure point is going to be. And what we're looking at and stepping is really taken on is with the regions. And our brands across the board is what we're really looking at that inventory, making some judgments about what we should promote and liquidate through our own stores or through some partner accounts to really go after it.
The other piece that we're really looking hard at there is what should we repurpose and utilize to sell into the season and to sell through the season as we go forward. And we're looking at the ability to potentially pack and hold some really good merchandise that's in the warehouse that we'll use and maybe have to carry for a few months to bring it out as we go forward. So we're looking at all of those from a channel point of view as we think about inventory.
When we think about inventory for fall, we've done a lot of things for ourselves. Stefan has worked with the teams with Daniel Grieder in Europe, with Tom Chu in Asia and Cheryl and Ken Duane here in the United States, to really look at the inventory pipeline and with our logistics teams to really look at how that pipeline would be worked, try to push out with our partners to push inventory commitments out at least an additional 4 to 5 weeks, so we'll have some more visibility. We have been able to have deep conversations with our retail partners about what makes sense to cancel and what really is necessary as we go forward. So we're trying to balance that as we look at it.
I think it's -- the risk/reward today is to have less inventory and chase later, if we need more goods. The best story, if we're sitting here in the third quarter of this year and I'm sitting with you telling we're low on inventory and we're chasing fall, that would be a real excellent problem to have as we go forward.
Mike, are you going to take the second part of the question?"

Mike, I'm going to answer the first part. You'll take the CapEx. So just give me a moment to just respond. Look, the digital transaction has been the bright spot throughout this. It's -- even before the coronavirus, we were seeing 20% growth in our digital business. And our penetration for 2019, we've always talked about 10%, has grown to 12% overall digital penetration to PVH. I think this -- the pandemic is only accelerated that, not only in the short time frame, but I think it's also impacted the way consumers are going to shop going forward.
I think -- I was on Mad Money last night being interviewed, and I talked about it is -- I always had a general belief, and I think I've spoken on a number of calls and conferences about that over the next 5 to 6 years, we're going to continue to see consolidation in the retail industry. And we're going to see -- and wholesale apparel industry. And I thought that would be a 5-, 6-year path. I think this pandemic accelerates that. It accelerates the consumers' comfort level with buying apparel online. I think it accelerates the potential store closures and the C and D and E stores closing as we go forward. And we'll get to a healthier store base. We've always talked about that, especially in the U.S., there is too many stores. Our sales per -- sales per square foot per capita are by far the highest in the world. And it would be healthy to see that happen. But obviously, it's also going to be painful as we go through that process.
I think that what we're seeing in digital and the kind of growth market by market, we're seeing -- you see anywhere from 20% to 60% growth, depending on the channel. In China, our penetration continues to grow. We were somewhere in the neighborhood of about a 15% penetration in China. And I think that this year, it wouldn't surprise us if that moved to 20% as we're seeing outsized growth in our digital channel. We're growing digitally between 35% and 40% on digital sales. And that's a very high margin. So we're not out there promoting. We're out there connecting with our consumers, but we're not doing from a price point basis. We're doing it at a very positive level. So I think that's a bright spot, and I think it will continue to be a bright spot.
And on the cap side, that one -- capital expense side, that's one area where we haven't backed off, continue to make investments to support that business.

And I think -- look, objectively speaking, this is not an industry that has had across the board great inventory control metrics in place. That said, I think as we came out of holiday going into the first quarter, there was a tremendous cleanup that went on in the fourth quarter across the board to get inventories back in line. So at the end of January, what we saw was -- as a bright spot was inventories that were really under control throughout the channel, department stores, North America and Europe. And then even competitively, everyone took advantage of the good selling that was going on overall. And everyone saw some level of margin pressure when they reported earnings. But I think a big piece of that margin pressure was the objective to make sure inventories were clean as we went into 2020.
I think inventory was bought with more discipline because you heard us all complaining on our third quarter calls about open-to-buy dollars being so tight, and the retailers are trying to get turned under control. So that's all true. But I also think that there's going to be a significant amount of inventory. The loss of, let's say, 8 weeks of selling in spring will make the environment promotional, and we've planned for that in our cash flow. We've planned for that in our projections. And I think it's going to be a reality for a period of time."

But I think pack and hold, which we have historically not been big believers in, we try to turn the inventory into cash. If there's -- the old story is in apparel. If you're having a sales problem, this is not like wine that gets better with age. Your inventory gets worse. This is a completely different situation, and we have to have a completely different mindset. And I think a lot will depend on what the off-price promotional market looks like about how aggressive we would have to be in order to clear goods. And if it's too aggressive, I think we'll do exactly what you said, and we will pack and hold core that will -- that doesn't have a big seasonality to it. And then core plus that has a level of seasonality to it, I could see us packing it up for a period of time because there's -- the goods haven't hit the floor. The goods are in scale. I don't believe the goods would be out of cycle or -- from that point of view. So we will take a hard look at that and balance that with our cash flow and balance sheet requirements. But given the strength of our balance sheet, I think it's something that we will have as a tool that a lot of our competitors that are not nearly as well capitalized as we are, are not going to have the benefit of carrying goods for 6 or 9 months to get to spring next year and have quality goods to sell.
So that model has been used extensively by the off-price channel, the T.J.s and the losses. And I think we're going to have to take a lesson out of that and maybe have to park some inventory for a period of time. Interest rates are very low, and we'll take advantage of that as we go forward.
Stefan, I hope I left you something to comment on."

So we bought ourselves time to take the right actions.
And then if we look at the inventory that is more towards core, it's a strength that we have. Both in Calvin and Tommy, we have a strong core, a lot of essential products that are less seasonally dependent. And we also have a replenishment system there that gives us much better opportunity to react.
When it comes to the more seasonal part of the assortment, it's the time we're taking while we have this freeze is to plan through what we're going to redirect, how we adjust flow timing, as Manny talked through, how we adjust volumes. So we have significant opportunities to, in this very difficult situation, try to optimize inventory and receive as much as possible and then with the biggest strength being our core."

And I think that you start with that as a premise. Also, the consumer getting more and more comfortable shopping online. I think the winners are going to be those retailers that invested in their online capabilities. I believe in the omnichannel approach. Brick-and-mortar is not going away, but it needs to be coupled and needs to be aligned with your digital strategy. And it needs to be an experience that the consumer has that has no disruption in it. It needs to be clean, and it needs to be able to flow directly to them. And it needs to be experienced that doesn't have a lot of problems in it.
And I think a number of our players in North America, Macy's has made major investments there. And Nordstrom and a couple of other key players, including Kohl's, has really started to move in that direction. And I think you're going to see more of that. You're seeing retailers doing curbside pickup, and I think that's only going to continue. I think -- so those kinds of things, I think, are going to accelerate that thought process.
The other thing is there's a reality to this situation. And I think balance sheets are going to be stretched. Valuations are dramatically down from where they were just 2, 3 months ago when we opened the year. And given that, I think there is the opportunity -- there will be the opportunity to potentially do acquisitions and bring players together. And the old story that 1 plus 1 equals 4, where you can -- where particularly in a retail situation, there's tremendous leverage that you get from your fixed costs and your back office, being able to spread the investments over a larger base that you need to make in your digital investments, all of those things taking into play -- prior to the pandemic, I felt that we were going to see consolidation in the industry. I think the pandemic has done nothing but accelerate that. It's -- no matter what happens here, balance sheets will be weakened from where they were prior to this. Valuations are going to be lower. And I think -- given all that dynamic, I think there will be opportunity for consolidation. And I think you'll probably see an acceleration of store closings.
That's my theory. And I think it's a good way for us to think about how we have to plan the business and how we have to think about it strategically."

We have to take that all into consideration as we plan and move forward. I think they have plenty of levers to pull, including their real estate has potentially cash-generating assets that help -- may help them get through this as they move forward. And like you said, a lot is going to depend. If the stores open up in May, I think it's -- everybody -- it's back to getting into business.

We're going to use the China model because I think it's the best model we have. It's also the one that makes the most sense to us. So just to put that into perspective and what that means for us. In China, we came into December, January comping up 5%, business very strong. The last week of January through February when the stores closed and there was all the disruption in China and those -- we saw the business go down to minus 85%, 90%. Basically, everything was being done digitally.
Beginning end of February, business opened. And for the month of March, overall, our business in China is back to about 65%. In the last week, it's probably close to being back to 70% of the business. Digital continues to be very strong. What we're seeing is in the major cities like Beijing and Hong Kong -- Beijing and Shanghai, we're seeing in those cities that are driven by, in some respect, international tourism. And we have the controls and store hours where the controls are tighter on movement and where the tourism has been a big impact on that business in those key cities. There is no tourism going on. Those 2 cities are feeling it much more than the rest of China at large. So it just gives you a sense of where we are.
We're expecting that as we get into the month of April, that minus 30% will move to minus 20%. And then we get into May, minus 20% will move to minus 15% or 10%. And we are assuming when we get into the second half of the year, we will start to -- assuming that the pandemic goes the way we hope it does, that business will start to get back to a more normal level as we get into the second half of the year. That's how we're planning it.
I think that's a prudent way for us to plan the way North America will come back as well. I don't think when stores open that the first thing consumers are going to do are going to run out to buy apparel and accessories and get online and go into stores immediately. I think it's going to be a ramp-up as that happens, as people get more and more comfortable with the situation. And I think that's how we're planning it. I hope that was helping."

Kimberly, we're not going to give up -- we're not giving guidance, so we're not going to give you an update on sales right now. But let's put it into perspective. The stores shut down in the middle of March. There is no sales going on brick-and-mortar in Europe, in North America, in Australia, in Brazil, on major markets. The only thing that's opened up, and I gave you the exact sales trends, what's going on in Asia, is Asia that's opened up. In Asia, our big markets, China, I talked about in detail, our career has bounced back the strongest for us. There, our March business is only down about 20%, and the last week was only down about 10%. And Japan seems to be following pretty closely to what's going on in China. Those are our 3 big markets in Asia, and that's what gives us a level of confidence about how we're thinking about planning the business once it's open.
It's very difficult to have any sense of what the sales are going to be because I have no crystal ball that's going to tell me when stores are going to be opened. I could tell you, pre-coronavirus, sales trends comps were very strong throughout. And then as the coronavirus started to impact us in February with tourism or whatever, we started to see our comps get impacted to a degree, but then -- and then stores close. But overall, we were still pretty happy with the kind of sales we were doing. And up until the very last week when stores around us were closing and people were starting paddling, our business was off probably around 50% overall, which we felt was really good given what was going on, on a store basis. But that was the kind of trends we were seeing right before the stores closed for that week or a 10-day period. Prior to that, business had been very strong for us. So I hope that helps. But trying to do modeling or whatever is really very difficult now.

Joining me on the call is Stefan Larsson, our President;  Mike Shaffer, our Chief Operating and Chief Financial Officer; and Dana Perlman, our Treasurer and Senior Vice President of Business Development and Investor Relations. I'",1114,"Good morning, everyone. Joining me on the call is Stefan Larsson, our President;  Mike Shaffer, our Chief Operating and Chief Financial Officer; and Dana Perlman, our Treasurer and Senior Vice President of Business Development and Investor Relations. 
I'd like to take a moment and address all that is going on around us. Most recently, we have seen our country ripped apart by the lethal effects of systemic racism. This has caused too many instances of social injustice in our country. 
At PVH, we are guided by our purpose, which is to drive fashion-forward for good. And one of the best ways we can do this is to fight for racial equality within the walls of our company, throughout our industry and in society at large. We are creating forums to listening and learning. We are also updating our talent, our practices and training development programs to create new opportunities to grow so that we can increase the representation across all levels and support our black associates for success in attaining leadership positions across our company. 
Furthermore, the coronavirus pandemic has dramatically impacted our business over the past few months, impacting every region of our business. The health and well-being of our associates, consumers, partners and the communities where we operate remain our top priority. 
Throughout our almost 140 year history, we have been faced with many challenges. And I'm confident that we will successfully navigate this backdrop as well. We have strong financial discipline, a healthy, strong balance sheet with $1.8 billion of overall liquidity and a wide range of global growth opportunities driven by Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger. Our brand and our people are our 2 greatest assets, and they were both on full display during the first quarter. 
Our associates and business leaders truly demonstrated their passion, dedication and agility. And I would like to thank each and every one of them to helping drive our business forward despite the challenges that COVID-19 pandemic presented. 
From working to first efficiently close stores and then putting plans in place to successfully reopen stores around the world, to those in our warehouses that have kept our businesses moving forward and those working from home who wish truly to see, and I cannot thank everyone up for their resilience and commitment. 
Our iconic Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger Brands has continued to experience excellent consumer response over this period, demonstrating strong brand health and loyalty during the crisis. Each brand attracted new consumers visiting our sites for the very first time with good conversion and strong purchasing behavior over this period. 
Operating a diversified portfolio of brands with strong geographic diversity has always been one of our strong suites. And now more than ever, we have benefited from the diversification of our business. For example, the foresight and expertise we've gained from our Asia teams have been incredibly valuable as we navigated the coronavirus across other regions. This helped us get ahead of key decisions, such as adjusting our marketing campaigns; the ways to engage with consumers and drive our digital business during the temporary store closures; as well as had us safely and most effectively reopen our stores once restrictions were lifted. 
Additionally, we were able to reallocate resources to better support what was opened during this period, focusing on how to best fuel our own and operating e-com sites and also working with our third-party visual partners. These competitive advantages: our people, our brands and our diversified business model or what gives me great confidence in the long-term health of our business. 
And now moving on to the first quarter financial results. We entered 2020 with strong brand health and increasing momentum across Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein in the majority of regions where we operate. Unfortunately, COVID-19 had a significant impact on our business during the first quarter, as our stores and our wholesale partners' stores were closed for over 6 weeks on average during the quarter. This resulted in revenue in our own stores being down 50% to 65% depending on the region, while our wholesale revenues declined about 40% as  shipments to our wholesale partners were dramatically reduced across all markets. 
Our digital businesses, both our own and with our wholesale partners, had outstanding performance and became our #1 most critical channel for business during the quarter, with our European digital businesses being the strongest outperformer of any of our markets. On the operating margin side, our gross margins and SG&A rates were under significant pressure as well. While we tackled every expense line, including marketing and made difficult decisions relating to payroll expense, most of these measures didn't get enacted until the end of the quarter. 
In addition, we recorded about $100 million in reserves for future inventory markdowns and accounts receivable write-offs. Given this operating environment, we have also been addressing our inventory levels to reflect the current demand picture. And I'll work closely with our suppliers in the event of any meaningful shipping disruptions or delays. 
Additionally, during the quarter, our licensing partners were significantly impacted with business disruptions as well. We will continue to work closely with our licensing partners throughout the year as we are planning for their businesses to experience similar pressure to what we are seeing in our business. 
With our long-term vision in mind, we took prudent and proactive measures to strengthen our balance sheet, preserve our liquidity and improve our financial strength to come out of the COVID crisis as a stronger company. Overall, we ended the quarter with $1.8 billion of liquidity. Our CFO, Mike Shaffer, will discuss the specific steps we took to strengthen our financial position in his comments. 
As we navigate through the recovery phase, we will continue to evaluate how we can further strengthen our balance sheet, optimize our businesses and identify efficiencies, which will allow us to operate smarter and ultimately enhance our operating margin profile, which we believe will drive enhanced long-term returns for our stockholders. I believe that these actions in totality will position us to successfully navigate the COVID-19 pandemic and emerge in an overall stronger competitive position. 
Before I hand things over to Stefan to go through our region and brand initiatives, I would like to thank Dan Greider, who served as CEO of Tommy Hilfiger and PVH Europe, for all his contributions to the company over his many years of service. I also want to congratulate on his promotion, and I am confident that Martine will successfully lead Tommy Hilfiger and PVH Europe into the future as we capitalize on the significant future growth opportunities for our business. 
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Stefan."
296568,669545199,2016195,"PVH Corp., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Jun 12, 2020",2020-06-12,"Earnings Calls","PVH Corp.","Executives","Thank you, Manny. And we're giving you all an update today from our regions and brands. I would like to start with, as Manny mentioned in his introduction that this has been a very different kind of quarter, where all of our brands and regions have been h",1972,"Thank you, Manny. And we're giving you all an update today from our regions and brands. I would like to start with, as Manny mentioned in his introduction that this has been a very different kind of quarter, where all of our brands and regions have been heavily impacted by the COVID crisis with our stores and our wholesale customer stores closed for 6 weeks on average during the quarter. Mike will, later on the call, share more details on how the numbers came out and give you an indication of Q2 trends. 
What I would like to share with you is how we are successfully navigating our brands and regions through the different phases of this crisis, what our key learnings have been as well as sharing some of the green shoots that we're starting to see when gearing up to drive an accelerate recovery and to win with our brands and consumer post COVID. 
From a regional perspective, our regions came into this crisis at different times. Asia and China, in particular, came in first and also recovered first. Then Europe was hit, closely followed by North America. 
Starting with Asia and China, they have provided us with the best learnings for the recovery phase in our other regions. Currently, all of our stores in China are open. Since China started to reopen, we have been strong week-over-week improvements across the board. For example, our reopened stores are now approximately flat to last year and our digital business up triple digits for both Calvin and Tommy. We're experiencing very strong conversion and higher units per transaction in stores and lower overall traffic trends. To drive transactions during the store closures, we offered virtual client telling and engaged with shoppers through WeChat. We livestreamed our brands to connect with consumers which led to significant sales growth versus a typical day. 
Then Europe follow closely after Asia, where we have also seen strong week-over-week improvements. Currently, about 85% of our stores are open and trends are very encouraging. We're planning for the U.K. market to reopen early next week. As we reopen stores, we have experienced strong conversion and favorable full price trends with less promotions than planned. We have faced lower overall traffic trends that have improved more in smaller cities versus big cities as consumers are shopping closer to home. We have applied a data-driven approach to be able to offer targeted promotions to increase sellouts while also keeping margins relatively stable. 
Overall, we believe that Europe's recovery will be about one calendar quarter behind the trends we're seeing in China. For wholesale, our full order books that were up mid-teens pre-COVID are now down low to mid-teens for each of our brands as we work with our partners to consolidate product sites to better match demand and to end the year as clean on inventory as possible. 
And lastly, in North America, stores here were the latest to reopen, and we will be at 85% reopen by next week. We are pleased to see how the consumers are coming back. In our own stores, small doors are performing very well. Our domestic consumers are over indexing, and it will be critical to target that domestic consumer for the remainder of the year as international consumers are traveling much as, and we don't expect this trend to materially improve this year. 
Our wholesale partners saw business improve with the introduction of curbside pickup and ship from store. Digital conversion is significantly higher than last year, and we are attracting a lot of new consumers shopping outside. We believe that the recovery in North America will follow a slightly slower recovery trajectory than Europe, and we expect that promotions will be elevated. Also similar to Europe, our wholesale partners stopped accepting shipments in March, which has been a headwind to the business. And we have only seen replenishment orders start flowing again. 
Across regions and brands, when we were hit by the COVID crisis, we had a very strong focus on the short-term navigation through the immediate crisis. The health and well-being of our teams and consumers, cash preservation, expense reduction and inventory decisions to adjust to the current demand situation. We're using multiple approaches to manage our inventories, such as canceling orders, repurposing and reflowing goods, re-platforming fabrics, consolidating future collections and packing away certain core items where we can achieve strong margins in upcoming seasons. 
In parallel to down from a cash cost and inter perspective, we redirected our focus early on to demand creation to where the consumer was shopping. We have supercharged our e-commerce channels across all brands and regions, both own and operated, and we are collaborating very closely with Tmall, Zalando and Amazon, among others, in ways that moves us to where the consumer is going in terms of live events, product launches as well as connecting our inventory from our bricks-and-mortar stores to serve our own e-commerce as well as partner platforms. 
What is exciting to see is that our consumers have expressed a strong demand for our brands across all digital platforms. A few examples: our own digital businesses had excellent performance during the first quarter. Calvin's digital revenues were up 40% and Tommy's own digital business up over 60% with triple-digit increases in the second quarter to date. 
Our Calvin North America e-commerce business turned a quarterly profit for the first time in ck.com's history. In Asia, we furthered our partnership with Tmall by featuring a virtual exhibit for our CK One product drop and our CK One Tmall Club Day saw a strong consumer demand and sell-throughs. In Europe, we accelerated the rollout of connected e-commerce with Zalando and about June, and our ship from store penetration reached double digits for Zalando in April and May. 
North America, our Amazon business benefited from significant growth in prime memberships. And this month, we will participate in their summer sales for softlines as they move their to October. In the product assortment across brands and regions, we have seen the consumers in an accelerated way going towards cash on essential products. There is a big increase in demand for our essential categories like underwear, loungewear, t-shirts, Hoodies, alisher, activewear as well as jeans. All these categories are core strengths of both brands. We have redirected big product introduction and product collaborations to e-commerce and done some of them pure in the digital. 
Our CK One launch had an Instagram reach of 57 million people. We also launched our Tommy Jeans Luna Jeans capsule in a live stream partnership with Tmall, achieving over 45 million impressions. Lastly, this crisis has made it clear that our product lead times have come down across the board to better match inventory to the current demand trends. 
Our marketing has also been redirected towards social and digital to reflect the time we are living in. For Calvin, we hosted monthly live stream session from Wechat using local talents in the campaigns. Calvin's recently launched its prior 2020 campaign, hashtag proud in my calvins across social, digital and e-commerce in over 20 markets. Initial sell-through is strong and the campaign and collection had a plus 89% increase in average commons proposed. 
At Tommy, we livestreamed our spring collections with the ability for consumers to purchase directly from the event for wear now product. Tommy also hosted 4 celebrity live streams or short video platform, do win, which secured 1.5 million views and helped us convert both new and existing consumers to purchase. All our brands have refocused on engaging with the consumer in a more interactive way than any time before. 
I would also like to take a step back and give some global brand highlights, starting with Calvin. Calvin Klein began first quarter with strong brand health, including very strong global awareness. The Calvin Klein lifestyle is truly resonating with consumers during this time, particularly our underwear, loungewear, activewear and wear now offerings. We adapted our marketing message to reflect this through our at-home in my cabins campaign. Our efforts were successful as we saw significant growth in new consumer shopping our sites, and we continue to focus on new consumer acquisition as well as retention and conversion. 
For example, our CK One launch, which is our replay of iconic genderless collection from the 1990s cater to the younger consumer and now represents 10% of our CK underwear sales in Asia. 
Before COVID crisis hit, we had already started the work with setting the forward-looking brand direction for Calvin Klein. And I'm pleased to share that the team has completed this work, and we are looking forward to take you through it in detail at a later time. 
So now I would just like to share that the evolve brand direction is built around going back to the iconic DNA of the brand and reconnecting it to the consumer and culture of today. It's focused on telling clients unique strengths as one of few authentic global lifestyle brands and will be a very strong foundation to drive consumer engagement and profitable growth for the years to come.  The response from our own teams and external collaborators has been very strong. 
Moving on to Tommy Hilfiger. Tommy entered 2020 with a strong underlying momentum. I would like to start with welcoming Martine as our COO for Tom Hilfiger Global and PVH Europe. Martine has been the co-pilot behind the Tommy Hilfiger brand and business success over the last few years. He is a very strong leader and value creator. 
Tommy Hilfiger was recognized in the top 20 on Bob's business index for the top 50 luxury brands, which ranks brands across consumer sentiment, digital presence, omnichannel performance, sustainability reporting and financial performance. We also had exceptional sell-through of collaboration launches throughout the quarter, including Tommy Jeans, Looney Tunes Castle, which shows that our differentiation is a true advantage, especially in a market like China. 
Moving on to heritage. We are pleased to close on our sale of the Speedo business to Pentland in April for approximately $170 million. And we will look for additional opportunities to streamline and/or exit businesses that are non-core plus. Our Heritage Brands business was under significant pressure, although the online businesses from our wholesale partners was a partial offset. The cash realization trend that's being accelerated by COVID that's working for us in both Calvin and Tommy is working against us in the more follower to where product categories and heritage. We are addressing these challenges by managing inventory levels more prudently, lowering our cost base, evaluating our store portfolio and reviewing additional ways to optimize and streamline the business. 
Finally, as Manny mentioned, navigating through this crisis has made us even more aware of the many unique strength we have to build on coming out of COVID. We have 2 of the most iconic brands in the market globally, in Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein, both with very strong global awareness as well as big, strong consumer bases around the world. We also have a very strong multichannel presence in North America, Europe and Asia, and we are increasingly matching our reach towards where the consumer is voting to shop. And the crisis has made us move faster and get even closer to the customer. And what we have realized navigating through the immediate crisis is that many of the key learnings from doing the crisis work are very tightly connected to what it will take to win post COVID. Overall, we see that the COVID effects in our business reflects big accelerations of existing underlying consumer market trends and increased focus on e-commerce, product relevance and consumer engagement will be core priorities as we are driving towards an accelerated recovery. 
And with that, I would like to turn it over to Mike."

I want to briefly touch on the first quarter 2020 results and move on to the current state of the business. As expected, our business was significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic as the majority of our stores in our wholesale partner stores were closed to 6 weeks on average during the quarter. As a result of the widespread store closures, revenues from our retail stores were down approximately 50% to 65% depending on the region. 
Shipments to our wholesale customers sharply reduced as well, resulting in an overall decline of 41% in our global wholesale revenues. Our directly operated digital e-commerce businesses were fully operational during the quarter, and we experienced strong revenue growth in all regions, up 40% versus the prior year with double-digit to triple-digit revenue increases during the period while our stores were closed. This growth in e-commerce partially offset declines in our brick-and-mortar and wholesale revenues. 
Overall, our reported revenue was down 43%. Tommy Hilfiger revenues were down 39% with international down 32% and North America down 51%. Calvin Klein revenue was down 46%, with international down 40% and North America down 54%. Heritage revenues were down 47%. 
In addition to the revenue decline, our results were under significant pressure in the quarter due to a $97 million increase in accounts receivable write-offs and inventory reserves and a significant deleveraging of expenses. We continue to pay certain retail associates for all and most of the time our stores were closed and the measures we are taking to reduce expenses didn't take effect until the end of the quarter. 
The unprecedented revenue and earnings decline as a result of the pandemic resulted in a loss per share on a non-GAAP basis of $3.03 for the first quarter. On a GAAP basis, due to the pandemic and reduction in our market cap, we took noncash goodwill and intangible asset charges of $933 million. Also, we took noncash impairment charges totaling $16 million related to store assets and $12 million related to an equity method investment. 
Moving on to the current state. Our second quarter and full year 2020 results will continue to be significantly negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and we expect that our revenue decline in the second quarter will be more pronounced than the first quarter. The duration and extent of the pandemic remains highly uncertain. Our results could be impacted in ways we are still not able to predict today and as a result, we are not in a position to issue more detailed guidance for the second quarter or for the fiscal year. 
We are continuing with our Phase 3 opening of our stores in the U.S. and around the world. By mid-June, over 85% of our stores will be reopened globally. Although most of the stores are operating with reduced hours and occupancy levels, while sales remained down across all regions on a year-over-year basis, traffic and sales trends are improving each week. 
Second quarter-to-date we're seeing same-store sales for our brick-and-mortar stores that have reopened, running about down 25% from North America, down 20% for Europe and down 25% for total Asia, with China flat and China was the first country to close and the first country to reopen with the pandemic. All in second quarter-to-date for our total direct-to-consumer business, including stores that were closed for a portion of all of the second quarter-to-date and our directly operated digital commerce sites, we are running about down 65% for North America, down 25% for Europe and down 11% for total Asia, but China is up 25%. 
Additionally, most of our wholesale customers have now reopened the majority of their locations across all regions. However, due to the significant levels of inventory that remain in stores, the majority of our North American and European brick-and-mortar wholesale partners stopped accepting shipments beginning in March, which has not materially improved into the second quarter. 
In response to the pandemic, we are taking every proportion to reduce our expenses and working capital. These actions started in mid-April and are continuing into the second quarter and the rest of the year. We are reducing payroll costs, including salary and incentive comp, furloughs, decreased working hours and hiring freezes as well as taking advantage of applicable government relief programs. We are eliminating or reducing other discretionary and variable expenses, including marketing, travel, consulting and creative and design costs. We are also tightly managing inventories, including reducing and canceling inventory commitments, redeploying basic inventory items to subsequent seasons and consolidating future seasonal collections as well as negotiating extended payment terms with our suppliers. 
I want to emphasize that our priority has been on cash flow and liquidity. We ended the quarter with $1.8 billion of liquidity, including cash of approximately $800 million and $1 billion of available borrowings under our revolving credit facilities. 
As previously announced, we moved quickly to reinforce liquidity in response to the pandemic. We suspended share repurchases under our stock repurchase program in March, following approximately $110 million repurchases we completed in the first quarter, and we suspended our cash dividend beginning with the second quarter. We entered into a new [ $275 million ] 364-day revolving quick facility and issued an additional EUR 175 million,of 3.58% senior notes due 2024. 
Importantly, we obtained a waiver of the leverage and interest coverage covenants under our senior credit facilities through and including the first quarter of 2021. We are cutting capital expenditures to approximately $190 million in 2020 from $345 million in 2019, with capital expenditures only from minimum requirements in our retail stores and for projects currently in progress related to our systems and warehouses. 
Additionally, we closed on the sale of our Speedo North America business to Pentland the parent company of the Speedo brand in April for proceeds of about $170 million. We will give guidance for future quarters in the year once there is more clarity on the impact and duration of the COVID-19 pandemi. 
And with that, operator, we will open it up for questions."

And I think those stores that were 6 months ago, 4 months ago cash flow positive, marginally profitable, I think those stores, the pressure that's been put on from the pandemic and the shift to digital is really pointing to the need to reevaluate those stores and look to streamline the portfolio. And I think that will continue, though, particularly here in the United States, and I think to some degree, in Europe as we look at that portfolio. 
In Asia, where we are underdeveloped from a retail point of view, China, it's just about every market in Asia, we've got a good brand positioning. Well, there seems to be brick-and-mortar opportunity there. So I think there will be a net opener. And I think in the more mature markets, we'll probably be a net closer over time. 
The second question, as you could imagine, we're seeing tremendous results, positive results in our permanent population stores, smaller cities, cities that really are driven by -- stores that are really driven by the consumer in that geographic market, both here in Europe, Asia and in North America. And we are being dramatically hurt by tourist location stores. And we just think about the biggest Orlando, Las Vegas, Guam in Asia, Hong Kong, that market that drives off of it in Europe, Paris, Milan, London, those stores which are big profit producers without that international tourism, those stores are down significantly more than the overall averages and our permanent population stores across the board are much positive to flat to ultimately down slightly."

Those are some of our most profitable businesses. And what we -- some of the efficiencies that we've built into our own e-com business and scale, which has really turned those businesses much more profitable for us. So really the e-comm business had no negative impact at all on our profitability in the first quarter. That profitability impact was really driven by the reduced sales volume, the expense initiatives that really began late in the fourth quarter as the stores closed, and we continue to pay people for a month before we started to parallel and take other initiatives hoping that this would be quicker. So I think you'll see those start to become more in line as we get to the second half of the year, the expense ratios. And our margins were impacted by the reserves we took in total $100 million. A big portion of that towards margins for future markdowns that we're anticipating in the second and third quarter. So I think that would have much more impact on our profitability margins and the loss that was generated. 
And then finally, I would just say is, as this demand curve on e-commerce continues, we are seeing our profitability significantly improved in that channel of distribution both from a direct-to-consumer where we are doing everything and selling directly and particularly where we're working with our third-party players that by far is our most profitable business."

As always, the promotional level is lower in Europe than in the United States. And I think that this hasn't changed that. We're seeing in Europe, very strong full-price selling across the board and -- in our full-price stores and in our other channels, we've really targeted our promotions very efficiently. In the U.S., when initially opened, we came out of the box very strong from a promotion point of view. We were anticipating even higher promotions than what actually is happening in the stores today. We have since backed off of that initial promotional cadence. And since we're doing on a POS basis, that gives us the flexibility. As we saw demand exceed our expectations, we have pulled back on the promotional cadence overall. I would compare the promotional cadence in the U.S. to be slightly more than it was this time last year, but not nearly as promotional as we is going to be going forward. So I hope that gives you some color.

My assumption is stores are less open in 2Q overall versus 1Q, but I want to kind of get confirmation from that. And then second question, Stefan, I was really curious here you talked about Calvin Klein, the work you guys have done there on the brand.

Thanks for the question, Omar. On clearly, as we go through the second quarter with the stores, if you take the month of February out of the equation, we're going to be significantly more open in the second quarter than we were in the first quarter as we move forward. Right now, I think, as we say in all our disclosure, we're about 85% open mid-June. So by the end of this weekend, about 85% of our stores will be opened. Store hours are less. I think, that store hours on average are probably down 15% to 20% fall number. To give you a sense that it's cut. It's also store capacity is down. So we can only have so many people in at a time. And in some locations, we have lines outside the store. All of those things are impacting us, where our store traffic is down significantly more than our sales traffic. And I think that's driven by a couple of things. Consumers -- customers that are out and shopping are out and shopping with a purpose. They need something they're out there. They're shopping. They're not just browsing. They're shopping. And secondly, I think we're being very effective on how we are converting customers. We're offering strong value in our product, which we really saw in February. And coming out of the fourth quarter, we saw tremendous momentum in our spring product globally at Calvin and Tommy Hilfiger. And that momentum as the customers come in and they're voting, they're really hitting that target. I think Stefan is not going to give, as you know, in the Calvin organization. We don't announce marketing campaigns way ahead of time until they're ready to be announced. But I think we give you just a flavor of what we're trying to."

And then they connect those components, those DNA components to the consumer and count it today. You will see it gradually coming out. You will see it in social media. You will see it in collaborations. You will see it in an increased folk of modern essential. So if you think about it, Calvin's brand philosophy -- Calvin was 20 years ahead when he focused on the essential products. One thing Calvin kept back -- coming back to what's the meaning of each product? What's the intent behind each product, it's never been more relevant today.

Joining me on the call is Stefan Larsson, our President; Mike Shaffer, our Chief Operating and Chief Financial Officer; and Dana Perlman, our Treasurer and Senior Vice President of Business Development and Investor Relations.  I'",1111,"Good morning, everyone. Joining me on the call is Stefan Larsson, our President; Mike Shaffer, our Chief Operating and Chief Financial Officer; and Dana Perlman, our Treasurer and Senior Vice President of Business Development and Investor Relations.  
I'd like to take a moment and address all that is going on around us. Most recently, we have seen our country ripped apart by the lethal effects of systemic racism. This has caused too many instances of social injustice in our country.  
At PVH, we are guided by our purpose, which is to drive fashion forward for good. And one of the best ways we can do this is to fight for racial equality within the walls of our company, throughout our industry and in society at large. We are creating forums to listening and learning. We are also updating our talent, acquisition practices and training development programs to create new opportunities to grow so that we can increase the representation across all levels and support our black associates for success in attaining leadership positions across our company.  
Furthermore, the coronavirus pandemic has dramatically impacted our business over the past few months, impacting every region of our business. The health and well-being of our associates, consumers, partners and the communities where we operate, remain our top priority.  
Throughout our almost 140-year history, we have been faced with many challenges. And I'm confident that we will successfully navigate this backdrop as well. We have strong financial discipline; a healthy, strong balance sheet with $1.8 billion of overall liquidity; and a wide range of global growth opportunities driven by Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger. Our brand and our people are our 2 greatest assets, and they were both on full display during the first quarter.  
Our associates and business leaders truly demonstrated their passion, dedication and agility. And I would like to thank each and every one of them to helping drive our business forward despite the challenges that COVID-19 pandemic presented. From working to first efficiently close stores and then putting plans in place to successfully reopen stores around the world, to those in our warehouses that have kept our businesses moving forward and those working from home who [indiscernible], and I cannot thank everyone enough for their resilience and commitment.  
Our iconic Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger brands has continued to experience excellent consumer response over this period, demonstrating strong brand health and loyalty during the crisis. Each brand attracted new consumers visiting our sites for the very first time with good conversion and strong purchasing behavior over this period.  
Operating a diversified portfolio of brands with strong geographic diversity has always been one of our strong suites. And now more than ever, we have benefited from the diversification of our business. For example, the foresight and expertise we've gained from our Asia teams have been incredibly valuable as we navigated the coronavirus across other regions. This helped us get ahead of key decisions, such as adjusting our marketing campaigns, the ways to engage with consumers and drive our digital business during the temporary store closures as well as had us safely and most effectively reopen our stores once restrictions were lifted.  
Additionally, we were able to reallocate resources to better support what was opened during this period, focusing on how to rescue our own and operated e-comm sites and also working with our third-party digital partners. These competitive advantages, our people, our brands and our diversified business model is what gives me great confidence in the long-term health of our business.  
And now moving on to the first quarter financial results. We entered 2020 with strong brand health and increasing momentum across Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein in the majority of regions where we operate. Unfortunately, COVID-19 had a significant impact on our business during the first quarter as our stores and our wholesale partners' stores were closed for over 6 weeks on average during the quarter. This resulted in revenue in our own stores being down 50% to 65% depending on the region, while our wholesale revenues declined about 40% as shipments to our wholesale partners were dramatically reduced across all markets.  
Our digital businesses, both our own and with our wholesale partners, had outstanding performance and became our #1, most critical channel for business during the quarter. With our European digital businesses being the strongest outperformer of any of our markets. 
On the operating margin side, our gross margins and SG&A rates were under significant pressure as well. While we tackled every expense line, including marketing and made difficult decisions relating to payroll expense, most of these measures didn't get enacted until the end of the quarter.  
In addition, we recorded about $100 million in reserves for future inventory markdowns and accounts receivable write-offs. Given this operating environment, we have also been addressing our inventory levels to reflect the current demand picture and are work closely with our suppliers in the event of any meaningful shipping disruptions or delays.  
Additionally, during the quarter, our licensing partners were significantly impacted with business disruptions as well. We will continue to work closely with our licensing partners throughout the year as we are planning for their businesses to experience similar pressure to what we are seeing in our business.  
With our long-term vision in mind, we took prudent and proactive measures to strengthen our balance sheet, preserve our liquidity and improve our financial strength to come out of the COVID crisis as a stronger company. Overall, we ended the quarter with $1.8 billion of liquidity. Our CFO, Mike Shaffer, will discuss the specific steps we took to strengthen our financial position in his comments.  
As we navigate through the recovery phase, we will continue to evaluate how we can further strengthen our balance sheet, optimize our businesses and identify efficiencies, which will allow us to operate smarter and ultimately enhance our operating margin profile, which we believe will drive enhanced long-term returns for our stockholders. I believe that these actions in totality will position us to successfully navigate the COVID-19 pandemic and emerge in an overall stronger competitive position.  
Before I hand things over to Stefan to go through our regions and brands initiatives, I would like to thank Daniel Greider, who served as CEO of Tommy Hilfiger and PVH Europe, for all his contributions to the company over his many years of service. I also want to congratulate Martijn Hagman on his promotion, and I am confident that Martijn will successfully lead Tommy Hilfiger and PVH Europe into the future as we capitalize on significant future growth opportunities for our business.  
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Stefan."

And when giving you all an update today from our regions and brands, I would like to start with, as Manny mentioned in his introduction, that this has been a very different kind of quarter where all of our brands and regions have been he",1965,"Thank you, Manny. And when giving you all an update today from our regions and brands, I would like to start with, as Manny mentioned in his introduction, that this has been a very different kind of quarter where all of our brands and regions have been heavily impacted by the COVID crisis with our stores and our wholesale customer stores closed for 6 weeks on average during the quarter. Mike will, later on the call, share more details on how the numbers came out and give you an indication of Q2 trends.  
What I would like to share with you is how we are successfully navigating our brands and regions through the different phases of this crisis, what our key learnings have been as well as sharing some of the green shoots that we're starting to see when gearing up to drive an accelerated recovery and to win with our brands and consumer post COVID.  
From a regional perspective, our regions came into this crisis at different times. Asia and China, in particular, came in first and also recovered first. Then Europe was hit, closely followed by North America.  
Starting with Asia and China, they have provided us with the best learnings for the recovery phase in our other regions. Currently, all of our stores in China are open. Since China started to reopen, we have been strong week-over-week improvements across the board. For example, our reopened stores are now approximately flat to last year and our digital business up triple digits for both Calvin and Tommy. We're experiencing very strong conversion and higher units per transaction in stores and lower overall traffic trends. To drive transactions during the store closures, we offered virtual clienteling and engaged with VIP shoppers through WeChat. We livestreamed our brands to connect with consumers, which led to significant sales growth versus a typical day. 
Then Europe followed closely after Asia, where we have also seen strong week-over-week improvements. Currently, about 85% of our stores are open and trends are very encouraging. We're planning for the U.K. market to reopen early next week. As we reopen stores, we have experienced strong conversion and favorable full price trends with less promotions than planned. We have faced lower overall traffic trends that have improved more in smaller cities versus big cities as consumers are shopping closer to home. We have applied a data-driven approach to be able to offer targeted promotions to increase sellouts while also keeping margins relatively stable. 
Overall, we believe that Europe's recovery will be about one calendar quarter behind the trends we're seeing in China. For wholesale, our full order books that were up mid-teens pre-COVID, are now down low to mid-teens for each of our brands as we work with our partners to consolidate product seasons to better match demand and to end the year as clean on inventory as possible.  
And lastly, North America, stores here were the latest to reopen, and we will be at 85% reopen by next week. We are pleased to see how the consumers are coming back. In our own stores, small doors are performing very well. Our domestic consumers are over indexing, and it will be critical to target that domestic consumer for the remainder of the year as international consumers are traveling much less and we don't expect this trend to materially improve this year.  
Our wholesale partners saw business improve with the introduction of curbside pickup and ship-from-store. Digital conversion is significantly higher than last year, and we are attracting a lot of new consumers shopping on sites. We believe that the recovery in North America will follow a slightly slower recovery trajectory than Europe, and we expect that promotions will be elevated. Also, similar to Europe, our wholesale partners stopped accepting shipments in March, which has been a headwind to the business. And we have only seen replenishment orders start flowing again.  
Across regions and brands, when we were hit by the COVID crisis, we had a very strong focus on the short-term navigation through the immediate crisis, the health and well-being of our teams and consumers, cash preservation, expense reduction and inventory decisions to adjust to the current demand situation. We're using multiple approaches to manage our inventories, such as canceling orders, repurposing and reflowing goods, re-platforming fabrics, consolidating future collections and packing away certain core items where we can achieve strong margins in upcoming seasons.  
In parallel to hunkering down from a cash, cost and inventory perspective, we redirected our focus early on to demand creation to where the consumer was shopping. We have supercharged our e-commerce channels across all brands and regions, both own and operated, and we are collaborating very closely with Tmall, Zalando and Amazon, among others, in ways that moves us to where the consumer is going, both in terms of live events, product launches as well as connecting our inventory from our bricks-and-mortar stores to serve our own e-commerce as well as partner platforms. What is exciting to see is that our consumers have expressed a strong demand for our brands across all digital platforms. A few examples: our own digital businesses had excellent performance during the first quarter. Calvin's digital revenues were up 40% and Tommy's own digital business up over 60% with triple-digit increases in the second quarter to date.  
Our Calvin North America e-commerce business turned a quarterly profit for the first time in ck.com's history. In Asia, we furthered our partnership with Tmall by featuring a virtual exhibit for our CK One product drop and our CK One Tmall Club Day saw a strong consumer demand and sell-throughs. In Europe, we accelerated the rollout of connected e-commerce with Zalando and About You, and our ship-from-store penetration reached double digits for Zalando in April and May.  
North America, our Amazon business benefited from significant growth in Prime memberships. And this month, we will participate in their summer sales at Soft Lines as they move their Prime Day to October. 
In the product assortment across brands and regions, we have seen the consumers in an accelerated way going towards cash on essential products. There is a big increase in demand for our essential categories like underwear, loungewear, t-shirts, hoodies, athleisure, activewear as well as jeans. All these categories are core strengths of both brands. We have redirected big product introduction and product collaborations to e-commerce and done some of them purely digital. Our CK One launch had an Instagram reach of 57 million people. We also launched our Tommy Jeans Looney Tunes capsule in a livestream partnership with Tmall, achieving over 45 million impressions. 
Lastly, this crisis has made it clear that our product lead times have come down across the board to better match inventory to the current demand trends. Our marketing has also been redirected towards social and digital to reflect the time we are living in. For Calvin, we hosted monthly live stream session from WeChat using local talents in the campaigns. Calvin recently launched its Pride 2020 campaign, #proudinmycalvins, across social, digital and e-commerce in over 20 markets. Initial sell-through is strong and the campaign and collection had a plus 89% increase in average comments per post.  
At Tommy, we livestreamed our spring collections with the ability for consumers to purchase directly from the event for wear now product. Tommy also hosted 4 celebrity livestreams on short video platform, GoWin, which secured 1.5 million views and helped us convert both new and existing consumers to purchase. 
All our brands have refocused on engaging with the consumer in a more interactive way than any time before. 
I would also like to take a step back and give some global brand highlights, starting with Calvin. Calvin Klein began first quarter with strong brand health, including very strong global awareness. The Calvin Klein lifestyle is truly resonating with consumers during this time, particularly our underwear, loungewear, activewear and wear now offerings. We adapted our marketing message to reflect this through our #athomeinmycalvins campaign. Our efforts were successful as we saw significant growth in new consumer shopping our sites, and we continue to focus on new consumer acquisition as well as retention and conversion. For example, our CK One launch, which is our replay of the iconic genderless collection from the 1990s cater to the younger consumer and now represents 10% of our CK underwear sales in Asia.  
Before COVID crisis hit, we had already started the work with setting the forward-looking brand direction for Calvin Klein. And I'm pleased to share that the team has completed this work, and we are looking forward to take you through it in detail at a later time. So now I would just like to share that the evolved brand direction is built around going back to the iconic DNA of the brand and reconnecting it to the consumer and culture of today. It's focused on serving clients unique strengths as one of few authentic global lifestyle brands and will be a very strong foundation to drive consumer engagement and profitable growth for the years to come. The response from our own teams and external collaborators has been very strong.  
Moving on to Tommy Hilfiger. Tommy entered 2020 with a strong underlying momentum. I would like to start with welcoming Martijn as our COO for Tom Hilfiger Global and PVH Europe. Martijn has been the co-pilot behind the Tommy Hilfiger brand and business success over the last few years. He is a very strong leader and value creator.  
Tommy Hilfiger was recognized in the top 20 on Vogue's business index for the top 50 luxury brands, which ranks brands across consumer sentiment, digital presence, omnichannel performance, sustainability reporting and financial performance. We also had exceptional sell-through of collaboration launches throughout the quarter, including Tommy Jeans Looney Tunes capsule, which shows that our differentiation is a true advantage, especially in a market like China.  
Moving on to Heritage. We are pleased to close on our sale of the Speedo business to Pentland in April for approximately $170 million. And we will look for additional opportunities to streamline and/or exit businesses that are non-core to us. Our Heritage Brands business was under significant pressure, although the online businesses from our wholesale partners was a partial offset. The cash realization trend that's being accelerated by COVID, that's working for us in both Calvin and Tommy, is working against us in the more formal wear to work product categories in Heritage. We are addressing these challenges by managing inventory levels more prudently, lowering our cost base, evaluating our store portfolio and reviewing additional ways to optimize and streamline the business. 
Finally, as Manny mentioned, navigating through this crisis has made us even more aware of the many unique strength we have to build on coming out of COVID. We have 2 of the most iconic brands in the market globally, in Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein, both with very strong global awareness as well as big, strong consumer bases around the world. We also have a very strong multichannel presence in North America, Europe and Asia, and we are increasingly matching our reach towards where the consumer is voting to shop. And the crisis has made us move faster and get even closer to the customer. And what we have realized navigating through the immediate crisis is that many of the key learnings from doing the crisis work are very tightly connected to what it will take to win post COVID. Overall, we see that the COVID effects in our business reflects big accelerations of existing underlying consumer market trends and increased focus on e-commerce, product relevance and consumer engagement will be core priorities as we are driving towards an accelerated recovery. 
And with that, I would like to turn it over to Mike."

I want to briefly touch on the first quarter 2020 results, then move on to the current state of the business. As expected, our business was significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic as the majority of our stores and our wholesale partner stores were closed for 6 weeks on average during the quarter. As a result of the widespread store closures, revenues from our retail stores were down approximately 50% to 65% depending on the region. 
Shipments to our wholesale customers sharply reduced as well, resulting in an overall decline of 41% in our global wholesale revenues. Our directly operated digital e-commerce businesses were fully operational during the quarter, and we experienced strong revenue growth in all regions, up 40% versus the prior year with double-digit to triple-digit revenue increases during the period while our stores were closed. This growth in e-commerce partially offset declines in our brick-and-mortar and wholesale revenues. 
Overall, our reported revenue was down 43%. Tommy Hilfiger revenues were down 39% with international down 32% and North America down 51%. Calvin Klein revenue was down 46%, with international down 40% and North America down 54%. Heritage revenues were down 47%. 
In addition to the revenue decline, our results were under significant pressure in the quarter due to a $97 million increase in accounts receivable write-offs and inventory reserves and a significant deleveraging of expenses. We continue to pay certain retail associates for all and most of the time our stores were closed and the measures we are taking to reduce expenses didn't take effect until the end of the quarter. 
The unprecedented revenue and earnings decline as a result of the pandemic resulted in a loss per share on a non-GAAP basis of $3.03 for the first quarter. On a GAAP basis, due to the pandemic and reduction in our market cap, we took noncash goodwill and intangible asset charges of $933 million. Also, we took noncash impairment charges totaling $16 million related to store assets and $12 million related to an equity method investment. 
Moving on to the current state. Our second quarter and full year 2020 results will continue to be significantly negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and we expect that our revenue decline in the second quarter will be more pronounced than the first quarter. The duration and extent of the pandemic remains highly uncertain. Our results could be impacted in ways we are still not able to predict today and as a result, we are not in a position to issue more detailed guidance for the second quarter or for the fiscal year. 
We are continuing with our Phase 3 opening of our stores in the U.S. and around the world. By mid-June, over 85% of our stores will be reopened globally. Although most of the stores are operating with reduced hours and occupancy levels, while sales remained down across all regions on a year-over-year basis, traffic and sales trends are improving each week. 
Second quarter-to-date we're seeing same-store sales for our brick-and-mortar stores that have reopened, running about down 25% from North America, down 20% for Europe and down 25% for total Asia, with China flat, and China was the first country to close and the first country to reopen with the pandemic. All in second quarter-to-date for our total direct-to-consumer business, including stores that were closed for a portion of all of the second quarter-to-date and our directly operated digital commerce sites, we are running about down 65% for North America, down 25% for Europe and down 11% for total Asia, but China is up 25%. 
Additionally, most of our wholesale customers have now reopened in the majority of their locations across all regions. However, due to the significant levels of inventory that remain in stores, the majority of our North American and European brick-and-mortar wholesale partners stopped accepting shipments beginning in March, which has not materially improved into the second quarter. 
In response to the pandemic, we are taking every proportion to reduce our expenses and working capital. These actions started in mid-April and are continuing into the second quarter and the rest of the year. We are reducing payroll costs, including salary and incentive comp, furloughs, decreased working hours and hiring freezes as well as taking advantage of applicable government relief programs. We are eliminating or reducing other discretionary and variable expenses, including marketing, travel, consulting, and creative and design costs. We are also tightly managing inventories, including reducing and canceling inventory commitments, redeploying basic inventory items to subsequent seasons and consolidating future seasonal collections as well as negotiating extended payment terms with our suppliers. 
I want to emphasize that our priority has been on cash flow and liquidity. We ended the quarter with $1.8 billion of liquidity, including cash of approximately $800 million and $1 billion of available borrowings under our revolving credit facilities. 
As previously announced, we moved quickly to reinforce liquidity in response to the pandemic. We suspended share repurchases under our stock repurchase program in March, following approximately $110 million repurchases we completed in the first quarter, and we suspended our cash dividend beginning with the second quarter. We entered into a new $275 million 364-day revolving credit facility and issued an additional EUR 175 million, of 3.625% senior notes due 2024. 
Importantly, we obtained a waiver of the leverage and interest coverage covenants under our senior credit facilities through and including the first quarter of 2021. We are cutting capital expenditures to approximately $190 million in 2020 from $345 million in 2019, with capital expenditures only from minimum requirements in our retail stores and for projects currently in progress related to our systems and warehouses. 
Additionally, we closed on the sale of our Speedo North America business to Pentland Group PLC, the parent company of the Speedo brand, in April for proceeds of about $170 million. We will give guidance for future quarters in the year once there is more clarity on the impact and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
And with that, operator, we will open it up for questions."

In Asia, where we are underdeveloped from a retail point of view, China, it's just about every market in Asia, we've got a good brand positioning. Well, there seems to be brick-and-mortar opportunity there. So I think there will be a net opener. And I think in the more mature markets, we'll probably be a net closer over time. 
The second question, as you could imagine, we're seeing tremendous results, positive results in our permanent population stores, smaller cities, cities that really are driven by -- stores that are really driven by the consumer in that geographic market, both here in Europe, Asia and in North America. And we are being dramatically hurt by tourist location stores.

And I think it's clear to us that this is not an environment where you want to get too far from an inventory point of view and a demand point of view for fall. We're being very cautious how we're buying for fall. Based on what we're seeing in our order books, we are not planning on excess replenishment within season. As Mike said, we got plenty of core to support the most profitable sides of our business that underway our basic business, our basic sportswear business. Those businesses, plenty of inventory to support that and meet the demand. But when it comes to fashion sportswear and things like that, we're really buying very, very tightly.

And what we -- some of the efficiencies that we've built into our own e-comm business and scale, which has really turned those businesses much more profitable for us. So really the e-comm business had no negative impact at all on our profitability in the first quarter. That profitability impact was really driven by the reduced sales volume, the expense initiatives that really began late in the fourth quarter as the stores closed, and we continue to pay people for a month before we started to furlough and take other initiatives hoping that this would be quicker. So I think you'll see those start to become more in line as we get to the second half of the year, the expense ratios. And our margins were impacted by the reserves we took in total $100 million. A big portion of that towards margins for future markdowns that we're anticipating in the second and third quarter. So I think that would have much more impact on our profitability margins and the loss that was generated. 
And then finally, I would just say is, as this demand curve on e-commerce continues, we are seeing our profitability significantly improved in that channel of distribution both from a direct-to-consumer where we are doing everything and selling directly and particularly where we're working with our third-party players that by far is our most profitable business."

It's just a -- it's coming at us very fast. We're reacting to it very fast. We're using common inventories in wholesale, retail and the digital channel. We're not like we had been in the past that we can use inventories across channels. And I think that's allowing us the flexibility to react. And it's also built in a level of conservatism, at least, for the next 6 to 9 months that we just can't be chasing goods or growth the way we might have in a different time frame on a different economic situation. So I'd love to give you more color. I'd like to have more color exactly what's going to happen. But I think in some ways, this is going to be how agile every -- we can be, our competitors are going to be in order to react what's going to be coming at us from the wholesale department store channel, what's going to be coming out in the brick-and-mortar retail channel and having the system capability and logistics capability to take advantage of the growth on digital, which, this year, will grow from 2019, which we thought we had a good year. We grew about 12% of our business. This is going to be a significant growth for us, driven by the demand and also driven by the pressures that we're seeing in retail channel."

We're seeing in Europe, very strong full-price selling across the board and -- in our full-price stores and in our other channels, we've really targeted our promotions very efficiently. In the U.S., when initially opened, we came out of the box very strong from a promotion point of view. We were anticipating even higher promotions than what actually is happening in the stores today. We have since backed off of that initial promotional cadence. And since we're doing on a POS basis, that gives us the flexibility. As we saw demand exceed our expectations, we have pulled back on the promotional cadence overall.

On -- clearly, as we go through the second quarter with the stores, if you take the month of February out of the equation, we're going to be significantly more open in the second quarter than we were in the first quarter as we move forward. Right now, I think, as we say in all our disclosure, we're about 85% open mid-June. So by the end of this weekend, about 85% of our stores will be opened. Store hours are less. I think that store hours on average are probably down 15% to 20%, robust number to give you a sense that it's cut. It's also store capacity is down. So we can only let so many people in at a time. And in some locations, we have lines outside the store. All of those things are impacting us, where our store traffic is down significantly more than our sales traffic, and I think that's driven by a couple of things. Consumers -- customers that are out and shopping are out and shopping with a purpose. They need something they're out there. They're shopping. They're not just browsing. They're shopping. And secondly, I think we're being very effective on how we are converting customers. We're offering strong value in our product, which we really saw in February and coming out of the fourth quarter, we saw tremendous momentum in our spring product globally at Calvin and Tommy Hilfiger. And that momentum as the customers come in and they're voting, they're really hitting that target. I think Stefan is not going to give, as you know, in the Calvin organization.

You will see it in collaborations. You will see it in an increased folk of modern essential. So if you think about it, Calvin's brand philosophy -- Calvin was 20 years ahead when he focused on the essential products. One thing Calvin kept back -- kept coming back to what's the meaning of each product, what's the intent behind each product, and it's never been more relevant today.

Joining me on the call is Stefan Larsson, our President; Mike Shaffer, our Chief Operating and Chief Financial Officer; and Dana Perlman, our Treasurer and Senior Vice President of Business Development and Investor Relations.

Joining me on the call is Stefan Larsson, our President; Mike Shaffer, our Chief Operating and Chief Financial Officer; and Dana Perlman, our Treasurer and Senior Vice President of Business Development and Investor Relations.  
I'd like to take a moment and address all that is going on around us. Most recently, we have seen our country ripped apart by the lethal effects of systemic racism. This has caused too many instances of social injustice in our country.  
At PVH, we are guided by our purpose, which is to drive fashion forward for good. And one of the best ways we can do this is to fight for racial equality within the walls of our company, throughout our industry and in society at large. We are creating forums to listening and learning. We are also updating our talent, acquisition practices and training development programs to create new opportunities to grow so that we can increase the representation across all levels and support our black associates for success in attaining leadership positions across our company.  
Furthermore, the coronavirus pandemic has dramatically impacted our business over the past few months, impacting every region of our business. The health and well-being of our associates, consumers, partners and the communities where we operate, remain our top priority.  
Throughout our almost 140-year history, we have been faced with many challenges. And I'm confident that we will successfully navigate this backdrop as well. We have strong financial discipline; a healthy, strong balance sheet with $1.8 billion of overall liquidity; and a wide range of global growth opportunities driven by Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger. Our brand and our people are our 2 greatest assets, and they were both on full display during the first quarter.  
Our associates and business leaders truly demonstrated their passion, dedication and agility. And I would like to thank each and every one of them to helping drive our business forward despite the challenges that COVID-19 pandemic presented. From working to first efficiently close stores and then putting plans in place to successfully reopen stores around the world, to those in our warehouses that have kept our businesses moving forward and those working from home, it was truly a feat, and I cannot thank everyone enough for their resilience and commitment.  
Our iconic Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger brands has continued to experience excellent consumer response over this period, demonstrating strong brand health and loyalty during the crisis. Each brand attracted new consumers visiting our sites for the very first time with good conversion and strong purchasing behavior over this period.  
Operating a diversified portfolio of brands with strong geographic diversity has always been one of our strong suites. And now more than ever, we have benefited from the diversification of our business. For example, the foresight and expertise we've gained from our Asia teams have been incredibly valuable as we navigated the coronavirus across other regions. This helped us get ahead of key decisions, such as adjusting our marketing campaigns, the ways to engage with consumers and drive our digital business during the temporary store closures as well as had us safely and most effectively reopen our stores once restrictions were lifted.  
Additionally, we were able to reallocate resources to better support what was opened during this period, focusing on how to rescue our own and operated e-comm sites and also working with our third-party digital partners. These competitive advantages, our people, our brands and our diversified business model is what gives me great confidence in the long-term health of our business.  
And now moving on to the first quarter financial results. We entered 2020 with strong brand health and increasing momentum across Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein in the majority of regions where we operate. Unfortunately, COVID-19 had a significant impact on our business during the first quarter as our stores and our wholesale partners' stores were closed for over 6 weeks on average during the quarter. This resulted in revenue in our own stores being down 50% to 65% depending on the region, while our wholesale revenues declined about 40% as shipments to our wholesale partners were dramatically reduced across all markets.  
Our digital businesses, both our own and with our wholesale partners, had outstanding performance and became our #1, most critical channel for business during the quarter. With our European digital businesses being the strongest outperformer of any of our markets. 
On the operating margin side, our gross margins and SG&A rates were under significant pressure as well. While we tackled every expense line, including marketing and made difficult decisions relating to payroll expense, most of these measures didn't get enacted until the end of the quarter.  
In addition, we recorded about $100 million in reserves for future inventory markdowns and accounts receivable write-offs. Given this operating environment, we have also been addressing our inventory levels to reflect the current demand picture and are work closely with our suppliers in the event of any meaningful shipping disruptions or delays.  
Additionally, during the quarter, our licensing partners were significantly impacted with business disruptions as well. We will continue to work closely with our licensing partners throughout the year as we are planning for their businesses to experience similar pressure to what we are seeing in our business.  
With our long-term vision in mind, we took prudent and proactive measures to strengthen our balance sheet, preserve our liquidity and improve our financial strength to come out of the COVID crisis as a stronger company. Overall, we ended the quarter with $1.8 billion of liquidity. Our CFO, Mike Shaffer, will discuss the specific steps we took to strengthen our financial position in his comments.  
As we navigate through the recovery phase, we will continue to evaluate how we can further strengthen our balance sheet, optimize our businesses and identify efficiencies, which will allow us to operate smarter and ultimately enhance our operating margin profile, which we believe will drive enhanced long-term returns for our stockholders. I believe that these actions in totality will position us to successfully navigate the COVID-19 pandemic and emerge in an overall stronger competitive position.  
Before I hand things over to Stefan to go through our regions and brands initiatives, I would like to thank Daniel Greider, who served as CEO of Tommy Hilfiger and PVH Europe, for all his contributions to the company over his many years of service. I also want to congratulate Martijn Hagman on his promotion, and I am confident that Martijn will successfully lead Tommy Hilfiger and PVH Europe into the future as we capitalize on significant future growth opportunities for our business.  
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Stefan."

And when giving you all an update today from our regions and brands, I would like to start with, as Manny mentioned in his introduction, that this has been a very different kind of quarter where all of our brands and regions have been he",1965,"Thank you, Manny. And when giving you all an update today from our regions and brands, I would like to start with, as Manny mentioned in his introduction, that this has been a very different kind of quarter where all of our brands and regions have been heavily impacted by the COVID crisis with our stores and our wholesale customer stores closed for 6 weeks on average during the quarter. Mike will, later on the call, share more details on how the numbers came out and give you an indication of Q2 trends.  
What I would like to share with you is how we are successfully navigating our brands and regions through the different phases of this crisis, what our key learnings have been as well as sharing some of the green shoots that we're starting to see when gearing up to drive an accelerated recovery and to win with our brands and consumer post COVID.  
From a regional perspective, our regions came into this crisis at different times. Asia and China, in particular, came in first and also recovered first. Then Europe was hit, closely followed by North America.  
Starting with Asia and China, they have provided us with the best learnings for the recovery phase in our other regions. Currently, all of our stores in China are open. Since China started to reopen, we have been strong week-over-week improvements across the board. For example, our reopened stores are now approximately flat to last year and our digital business up triple digits for both Calvin and Tommy. We're experiencing very strong conversion and higher units per transaction in stores and lower overall traffic trends. To drive transactions during the store closures, we offered virtual clienteling and engaged with VIP shoppers through WeChat. We livestreamed our brands to connect with consumers, which led to significant sales growth versus a typical day. 
Then Europe followed closely after Asia, where we have also seen strong week-over-week improvements. Currently, about 85% of our stores are open and trends are very encouraging. We're planning for the U.K. market to reopen early next week. As we reopen stores, we have experienced strong conversion and favorable full price trends with less promotions than planned. We have faced lower overall traffic trends that have improved more in smaller cities versus big cities as consumers are shopping closer to home. We have applied a data-driven approach to be able to offer targeted promotions to increase sellouts while also keeping margins relatively stable. 
Overall, we believe that Europe's recovery will be about one calendar quarter behind the trends we're seeing in China. For wholesale, our full order books that were up mid-teens pre-COVID, are now down low to mid-teens for each of our brands as we work with our partners to consolidate product seasons to better match demand and to end the year as clean on inventory as possible.  
And lastly, North America, stores here were the latest to reopen, and we will be at 85% reopen by next week. We are pleased to see how the consumers are coming back. In our own stores, small doors are performing very well. Our domestic consumers are over indexing, and it will be critical to target that domestic consumer for the remainder of the year as international consumers are traveling much less and we don't expect this trend to materially improve this year.  
Our wholesale partners saw business improve with the introduction of curbside pickup and ship-from-store. Digital conversion is significantly higher than last year, and we are attracting a lot of new consumers shopping on sites. We believe that the recovery in North America will follow a slightly slower recovery trajectory than Europe, and we expect that promotions will be elevated. Also, similar to Europe, our wholesale partners stopped accepting shipments in March, which has been a headwind to the business. And we have only seen replenishment orders start flowing again.  
Across regions and brands, when we were hit by the COVID crisis, we had a very strong focus on the short-term navigation through the immediate crisis, the health and well-being of our teams and consumers, cash preservation, expense reduction and inventory decisions to adjust to the current demand situation. We're using multiple approaches to manage our inventories, such as canceling orders, repurposing and reflowing goods, re-platforming fabrics, consolidating future collections and packing away certain core items where we can achieve strong margins in upcoming seasons.  
In parallel to hunkering down from a cash, cost and inventory perspective, we redirected our focus early on to demand creation to where the consumer was shopping. We have supercharged our e-commerce channels across all brands and regions, both own and operated, and we are collaborating very closely with Tmall, Zalando and Amazon, among others, in ways that moves us to where the consumer is going, both in terms of live events, product launches as well as connecting our inventory from our bricks-and-mortar stores to serve our own e-commerce as well as partner platforms. What is exciting to see is that our consumers have expressed a strong demand for our brands across all digital platforms. A few examples: our own digital businesses had excellent performance during the first quarter. Calvin's digital revenues were up 40% and Tommy's own digital business up over 60% with triple-digit increases in the second quarter to date.  
Our Calvin North America e-commerce business turned a quarterly profit for the first time in ck.com's history. In Asia, we furthered our partnership with Tmall by featuring a virtual exhibit for our CK One product drop and our CK One Tmall Club Day saw a strong consumer demand and sell-throughs. In Europe, we accelerated the rollout of connected e-commerce with Zalando and About You, and our ship-from-store penetration reached double digits for Zalando in April and May.  
North America, our Amazon business benefited from significant growth in Prime memberships. And this month, we will participate in their summer sales at Soft Lines as they move their Prime Day to October. 
In the product assortment across brands and regions, we have seen the consumers in an accelerated way going towards cash on essential products. There is a big increase in demand for our essential categories like underwear, loungewear, t-shirts, hoodies, athleisure, activewear as well as jeans. All these categories are core strengths of both brands. We have redirected big product introduction and product collaborations to e-commerce and done some of them purely digital. Our CK One launch had an Instagram reach of 57 million people. We also launched our Tommy Jeans Looney Tunes capsule in a livestream partnership with Tmall, achieving over 45 million impressions. 
Lastly, this crisis has made it clear that our product lead times have come down across the board to better match inventory to the current demand trends. Our marketing has also been redirected towards social and digital to reflect the time we are living in. For Calvin, we hosted monthly live stream session from WeChat using local talents in the campaigns. Calvin recently launched its Pride 2020 campaign, #proudinmycalvins, across social, digital and e-commerce in over 20 markets. Initial sell-through is strong and the campaign and collection had a plus 89% increase in average comments per post.  
At Tommy, we livestreamed our spring collections with the ability for consumers to purchase directly from the event for wear now product. Tommy also hosted 4 celebrity livestreams on short video platform, GoWin, which secured 1.5 million views and helped us convert both new and existing consumers to purchase. 
All our brands have refocused on engaging with the consumer in a more interactive way than any time before. 
I would also like to take a step back and give some global brand highlights, starting with Calvin. Calvin Klein began first quarter with strong brand health, including very strong global awareness. The Calvin Klein lifestyle is truly resonating with consumers during this time, particularly our underwear, loungewear, activewear and wear now offerings. We adapted our marketing message to reflect this through our #athomeinmycalvins campaign. Our efforts were successful as we saw significant growth in new consumer shopping our sites, and we continue to focus on new consumer acquisition as well as retention and conversion. For example, our CK One launch, which is our replay of the iconic genderless collection from the 1990s cater to the younger consumer and now represents 10% of our CK underwear sales in Asia.  
Before COVID crisis hit, we had already started the work with setting the forward-looking brand direction for Calvin Klein. And I'm pleased to share that the team has completed this work, and we are looking forward to take you through it in detail at a later time. So now I would just like to share that the evolved brand direction is built around going back to the iconic DNA of the brand and reconnecting it to the consumer and culture of today. It's focused on serving clients unique strengths as one of few authentic global lifestyle brands and will be a very strong foundation to drive consumer engagement and profitable growth for the years to come. The response from our own teams and external collaborators has been very strong.  
Moving on to Tommy Hilfiger. Tommy entered 2020 with a strong underlying momentum. I would like to start with welcoming Martijn as our COO for Tom Hilfiger Global and PVH Europe. Martijn has been the co-pilot behind the Tommy Hilfiger brand and business success over the last few years. He is a very strong leader and value creator.  
Tommy Hilfiger was recognized in the top 20 on Vogue's business index for the top 50 luxury brands, which ranks brands across consumer sentiment, digital presence, omnichannel performance, sustainability reporting and financial performance. We also had exceptional sell-through of collaboration launches throughout the quarter, including Tommy Jeans Looney Tunes capsule, which shows that our differentiation is a true advantage, especially in a market like China.  
Moving on to Heritage. We are pleased to close on our sale of the Speedo business to Pentland in April for approximately $170 million. And we will look for additional opportunities to streamline and/or exit businesses that are non-core to us. Our Heritage Brands business was under significant pressure, although the online businesses from our wholesale partners was a partial offset. The cash realization trend that's being accelerated by COVID, that's working for us in both Calvin and Tommy, is working against us in the more formal wear to work product categories in Heritage. We are addressing these challenges by managing inventory levels more prudently, lowering our cost base, evaluating our store portfolio and reviewing additional ways to optimize and streamline the business. 
Finally, as Manny mentioned, navigating through this crisis has made us even more aware of the many unique strength we have to build on coming out of COVID. We have 2 of the most iconic brands in the market globally, in Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein, both with very strong global awareness as well as big, strong consumer bases around the world. We also have a very strong multichannel presence in North America, Europe and Asia, and we are increasingly matching our reach towards where the consumer is voting to shop. And the crisis has made us move faster and get even closer to the customer. And what we have realized navigating through the immediate crisis is that many of the key learnings from doing the crisis work are very tightly connected to what it will take to win post COVID. Overall, we see that the COVID effects in our business reflects big accelerations of existing underlying consumer market trends and increased focus on e-commerce, product relevance and consumer engagement will be core priorities as we are driving towards an accelerated recovery. 
And with that, I would like to turn it over to Mike."

I want to briefly touch on the first quarter 2020 results, then move on to the current state of the business. As expected, our business was significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic as the majority of our stores and our wholesale par",1010,"Thanks, Stefan. I want to briefly touch on the first quarter 2020 results, then move on to the current state of the business. As expected, our business was significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic as the majority of our stores and our wholesale partner stores were closed for 6 weeks on average during the quarter. As a result of the widespread store closures, revenues from our retail stores were down approximately 50% to 65% depending on the region. 
Shipments to our wholesale customers sharply reduced as well, resulting in an overall decline of 41% in our global wholesale revenues. Our directly operated digital e-commerce businesses were fully operational during the quarter, and we experienced strong revenue growth in all regions, up 40% versus the prior year with double-digit to triple-digit revenue increases during the period while our stores were closed. This growth in e-commerce partially offset declines in our brick-and-mortar and wholesale revenues. 
Overall, our reported revenue was down 43%. Tommy Hilfiger revenues were down 39% with international down 32% and North America down 51%. Calvin Klein revenue was down 46%, with international down 40% and North America down 54%. Heritage revenues were down 47%. 
In addition to the revenue decline, our results were under significant pressure in the quarter due to a $97 million increase in accounts receivable write-offs and inventory reserves and a significant deleveraging of expenses. We continue to pay certain retail associates for all and most of the time our stores were closed and the measures we are taking to reduce expenses didn't take effect until the end of the quarter. 
The unprecedented revenue and earnings decline as a result of the pandemic resulted in a loss per share on a non-GAAP basis of $3.03 for the first quarter. On a GAAP basis, due to the pandemic and reduction in our market cap, we took noncash goodwill and intangible asset charges of $933 million. Also, we took noncash impairment charges totaling $16 million related to store assets and $12 million related to an equity method investment. 
Moving on to the current state. Our second quarter and full year 2020 results will continue to be significantly negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and we expect that our revenue decline in the second quarter will be more pronounced than the first quarter. The duration and extent of the pandemic remains highly uncertain. Our results could be impacted in ways we are still not able to predict today and as a result, we are not in a position to issue more detailed guidance for the second quarter or for the fiscal year. 
We are continuing with our Phase 3 opening of our stores in the U.S. and around the world. By mid-June, over 85% of our stores will be reopened globally. Although most of the stores are operating with reduced hours and occupancy levels, while sales remained down across all regions on a year-over-year basis, traffic and sales trends are improving each week. 
Second quarter-to-date we're seeing same-store sales for our brick-and-mortar stores that have reopened, running about down 25% from North America, down 20% for Europe and down 25% for total Asia, with China flat, and China was the first country to close and the first country to reopen with the pandemic. All in second quarter-to-date for our total direct-to-consumer business, including stores that were closed for a portion of all of the second quarter-to-date and our directly operated digital commerce sites, we are running about down 65% for North America, down 25% for Europe and down 11% for total Asia, but China is up 25%. 
Additionally, most of our wholesale customers have now reopened in the majority of their locations across all regions. However, due to the significant levels of inventory that remain in stores, the majority of our North American and European brick-and-mortar wholesale partners stopped accepting shipments beginning in March, which has not materially improved into the second quarter. 
In response to the pandemic, we are taking every proportion to reduce our expenses and working capital. These actions started in mid-April and are continuing into the second quarter and the rest of the year. We are reducing payroll costs, including salary and incentive comp, furloughs, decreased working hours and hiring freezes as well as taking advantage of applicable government relief programs. We are eliminating or reducing other discretionary and variable expenses, including marketing, travel, consulting, and creative and design costs. We are also tightly managing inventories, including reducing and canceling inventory commitments, redeploying basic inventory items to subsequent seasons and consolidating future seasonal collections as well as negotiating extended payment terms with our suppliers. 
I want to emphasize that our priority has been on cash flow and liquidity. We ended the quarter with $1.8 billion of liquidity, including cash of approximately $800 million and $1 billion of available borrowings under our revolving credit facilities. 
As previously announced, we moved quickly to reinforce liquidity in response to the pandemic. We suspended share repurchases under our stock repurchase program in March, following approximately $110 million repurchases we completed in the first quarter, and we suspended our cash dividend beginning with the second quarter. We entered into a new $275 million 364-day revolving credit facility and issued an additional EUR 175 million, of 3.625% senior notes due 2024. 
Importantly, we obtained a waiver of the leverage and interest coverage covenants under our senior credit facilities through and including the first quarter of 2021. We are cutting capital expenditures to approximately $190 million in 2020 from $345 million in 2019, with capital expenditures only from minimum requirements in our retail stores and for projects currently in progress related to our systems and warehouses. 
Additionally, we closed on the sale of our Speedo North America business to Pentland Group PLC, the parent company of the Speedo brand, in April for proceeds of about $170 million. We will give guidance for future quarters in the year once there is more clarity on the impact and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
And with that, operator, we will open it up for questions."

And I think those stores that were 6 months ago, 4 months ago cash flow positive, marginally profitable, I think those stores with the pressure that's been put on from the pandemic and the shift to digital is really pointing to the need to reevaluate those stores and look to streamline the portfolio. And I think that will continue, though, particularly here in the United States, and I think to some degree, in Europe as we look at that portfolio. 
In Asia, where we are underdeveloped from a retail point of view, China, it's just about every market in Asia, we've got a good brand positioning. Well, there seems to be brick-and-mortar opportunity there. So I think there will be a net opener. And I think in the more mature markets, we'll probably be a net closer over time. 
The second question, as you could imagine, we're seeing tremendous results, positive results in our permanent population stores, smaller cities, cities that really are driven by -- stores that are really driven by the consumer in that geographic market, both here in Europe, Asia and in North America. And we are being dramatically hurt by tourist location stores. And we just think about the biggest Orlando, Las Vegas, Guam in Asia, Hong Kong, that market that drives off of it in Europe, Paris, Milan, London, those stores which are big profit producers, without that international tourism, those stores are down significantly more than the overall averages and our permanent population stores across the board are much positive to flat to ultimately down slightly."

And I think it's clear to us that this is not an environment where you want to get too far from an inventory point of view and a demand point of view for fall. We're being very cautious how we're buying for fall. Based on what we're seeing in our order books, we are not planning on excess replenishment within season. As Mike said, we got plenty of core to support the most profitable sides of our business that underway our basic business, our basic sportswear business. Those businesses, plenty of inventory to support that and meet the demand. But when it comes to fashion sportswear and things like that, we're really buying very, very tightly.

And what we -- some of the efficiencies that we've built into our own e-comm business and scale, which has really turned those businesses much more profitable for us. So really the e-comm business had no negative impact at all on our profitability in the first quarter. That profitability impact was really driven by the reduced sales volume, the expense initiatives that really began late in the fourth quarter as the stores closed, and we continue to pay people for a month before we started to furlough and take other initiatives hoping that this would be quicker. So I think you'll see those start to become more in line as we get to the second half of the year, the expense ratios. And our margins were impacted by the reserves we took in total $100 million. A big portion of that towards margins for future markdowns that we're anticipating in the second and third quarter. So I think that would have much more impact on our profitability margins and the loss that was generated.

And then there is read and react capabilities to seeing when demand trends take off to then react to those versus being bought up front. So we are working, then there are the overall product development lead times that have to come down and will come down. And both in Calvin and Tommy and the Heritage division, we're working with digitalizing the supply chain and the sourcing and product development. So that will cut lead time.

We're seeing in Europe, very strong full-price selling across the board and -- in our full-price stores and in our other channels, we've really targeted our promotions very efficiently. In the U.S., when initially opened, we came out of the box very strong from a promotion point of view. We were anticipating even higher promotions than what actually is happening in the stores today. We have since backed off of that initial promotional cadence. And since we're doing on a POS basis, that gives us the flexibility. As we saw demand exceed our expectations, we have pulled back on the promotional cadence overall.

On -- clearly, as we go through the second quarter with the stores, if you take the month of February out of the equation, we're going to be significantly more open in the second quarter than we were in the first quarter as we move forward. Right now, I think, as we say in all our disclosure, we're about 85% open mid-June. So by the end of this weekend, about 85% of our stores will be opened. Store hours are less. I think that store hours on average are probably down 15% to 20%, robust number to give you a sense that it's cut. It's also store capacity is down. So we can only let so many people in at a time. And in some locations, we have lines outside the store. All of those things are impacting us, where our store traffic is down significantly more than our sales traffic, and I think that's driven by a couple of things. Consumers -- customers that are out and shopping are out and shopping with a purpose. They need something they're out there. They're shopping. They're not just browsing. They're shopping. And secondly, I think we're being very effective on how we are converting customers. We're offering strong value in our product, which we really saw in February and coming out of the fourth quarter, we saw tremendous momentum in our spring product globally at Calvin and Tommy Hilfiger. And that momentum as the customers come in and they're voting, they're really hitting that target. I think Stefan is not going to give, as you know, in the Calvin organization.

Joining me on the call is Stefan Larsson, our President; Mike Shaffer, our Chief Operating and Chief Financial Officer; and Dana Perlman, our Treasurer and Senior Vice President of Business Development and Investor Relations.  
I'd like to take a moment and address all that is going on around us. Most recently, we have seen our country ripped apart by the lethal effects of systemic racism. This has caused too many instances of social injustice in our country.  
At PVH, we are guided by our purpose, which is to drive fashion forward for good. And one of the best ways we can do this is to fight for racial equality within the walls of our company, throughout our industry and in society at large. We are creating forums to listening and learning. We are also updating our talent, acquisition practices and training development programs to create new opportunities to grow so that we can increase the representation across all levels and support our black associates for success in attaining leadership positions across our company.  
Furthermore, the coronavirus pandemic has dramatically impacted our business over the past few months, impacting every region of our business. The health and well-being of our associates, consumers, partners and the communities where we operate, remain our top priority.  
Throughout our almost 140-year history, we have been faced with many challenges. And I'm confident that we will successfully navigate this backdrop as well. We have strong financial discipline; a healthy, strong balance sheet with $1.8 billion of overall liquidity; and a wide range of global growth opportunities driven by Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger. Our brand and our people are our 2 greatest assets, and they were both on full display during the first quarter.  
Our associates and business leaders truly demonstrated their passion, dedication and agility. And I would like to thank each and every one of them to helping drive our business forward despite the challenges that COVID-19 pandemic presented. From working to first efficiently close stores and then putting plans in place to successfully reopen stores around the world, to those in our warehouses that have kept our businesses moving forward and those working from home, it was truly a feat, and I cannot thank everyone enough for their resilience and commitment.  
Our iconic Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger brands has continued to experience excellent consumer response over this period, demonstrating strong brand health and loyalty during the crisis. Each brand attracted new consumers visiting our sites for the very first time with good conversion and strong purchasing behavior over this period.  
Operating a diversified portfolio of brands with strong geographic diversity has always been one of our strong suites. And now more than ever, we have benefited from the diversification of our business. For example, the foresight and expertise we've gained from our Asia teams have been incredibly valuable as we navigated the coronavirus across other regions. This helped us get ahead of key decisions, such as adjusting our marketing campaigns, the ways to engage with consumers and drive our digital business during the temporary store closures as well as had us safely and most effectively reopen our stores once restrictions were lifted.  
Additionally, we were able to reallocate resources to better support what was opened during this period, focusing on how to rescue our own and operated e-comm sites and also working with our third-party digital partners. These competitive advantages, our people, our brands and our diversified business model is what gives me great confidence in the long-term health of our business.  
And now moving on to the first quarter financial results. We entered 2020 with strong brand health and increasing momentum across Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein in the majority of regions where we operate. Unfortunately, COVID-19 had a significant impact on our business during the first quarter as our stores and our wholesale partners' stores were closed for over 6 weeks on average during the quarter. This resulted in revenue in our own stores being down 50% to 65% depending on the region, while our wholesale revenues declined about 40% as shipments to our wholesale partners were dramatically reduced across all markets.  
Our digital businesses, both our own and with our wholesale partners, had outstanding performance and became our #1, most critical channel for business during the quarter. With our European digital businesses being the strongest outperformer of any of our markets. 
On the operating margin side, our gross margins and SG&A rates were under significant pressure as well. While we tackled every expense line, including marketing and made difficult decisions relating to payroll expense, most of these measures didn't get enacted until the end of the quarter.  
In addition, we recorded about $100 million in reserves for future inventory markdowns and accounts receivable write-offs. Given this operating environment, we have also been addressing our inventory levels to reflect the current demand picture and are work closely with our suppliers in the event of any meaningful shipping disruptions or delays.  
Additionally, during the quarter, our licensing partners were significantly impacted with business disruptions as well. We will continue to work closely with our licensing partners throughout the year as we are planning for their businesses to experience similar pressure to what we are seeing in our business.  
With our long-term vision in mind, we took prudent and proactive measures to strengthen our balance sheet, preserve our liquidity and improve our financial strength to come out of the COVID crisis as a stronger company. Overall, we ended the quarter with $1.8 billion of liquidity. Our CFO, Mike Shaffer, will discuss the specific steps we took to strengthen our financial position in his comments.  
As we navigate through the recovery phase, we will continue to evaluate how we can further strengthen our balance sheet, optimize our businesses and identify efficiencies, which will allow us to operate smarter and ultimately enhance our operating margin profile, which we believe will drive enhanced long-term returns for our stockholders. I believe that these actions in totality will position us to successfully navigate the COVID-19 pandemic and emerge in an overall stronger competitive position.  
Before I hand things over to Stefan to go through our regions and brands initiatives, I would like to thank Daniel Greider, who served as CEO of Tommy Hilfiger and PVH Europe, for all his contributions to the company over his many years of service. I also want to congratulate Martijn Hagman on his promotion, and I am confident that Martijn will successfully lead Tommy Hilfiger and PVH Europe into the future as we capitalize on significant future growth opportunities for our business.  
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Stefan."

And when giving you all an update today from our regions and brands, I would like to start with, as Manny mentioned in his introduction, that this has been a very different kind of quarter where all of our brands and regions have been he",1965,"Thank you, Manny. And when giving you all an update today from our regions and brands, I would like to start with, as Manny mentioned in his introduction, that this has been a very different kind of quarter where all of our brands and regions have been heavily impacted by the COVID crisis with our stores and our wholesale customer stores closed for 6 weeks on average during the quarter. Mike will, later on the call, share more details on how the numbers came out and give you an indication of Q2 trends.  
What I would like to share with you is how we are successfully navigating our brands and regions through the different phases of this crisis, what our key learnings have been as well as sharing some of the green shoots that we're starting to see when gearing up to drive an accelerated recovery and to win with our brands and consumer post COVID.  
From a regional perspective, our regions came into this crisis at different times. Asia and China, in particular, came in first and also recovered first. Then Europe was hit, closely followed by North America.  
Starting with Asia and China, they have provided us with the best learnings for the recovery phase in our other regions. Currently, all of our stores in China are open. Since China started to reopen, we have been strong week-over-week improvements across the board. For example, our reopened stores are now approximately flat to last year and our digital business up triple digits for both Calvin and Tommy. We're experiencing very strong conversion and higher units per transaction in stores and lower overall traffic trends. To drive transactions during the store closures, we offered virtual clienteling and engaged with VIP shoppers through WeChat. We livestreamed our brands to connect with consumers, which led to significant sales growth versus a typical day. 
Then Europe followed closely after Asia, where we have also seen strong week-over-week improvements. Currently, about 85% of our stores are open and trends are very encouraging. We're planning for the U.K. market to reopen early next week. As we reopen stores, we have experienced strong conversion and favorable full price trends with less promotions than planned. We have faced lower overall traffic trends that have improved more in smaller cities versus big cities as consumers are shopping closer to home. We have applied a data-driven approach to be able to offer targeted promotions to increase sellouts while also keeping margins relatively stable. 
Overall, we believe that Europe's recovery will be about one calendar quarter behind the trends we're seeing in China. For wholesale, our full order books that were up mid-teens pre-COVID, are now down low to mid-teens for each of our brands as we work with our partners to consolidate product seasons to better match demand and to end the year as clean on inventory as possible.  
And lastly, North America, stores here were the latest to reopen, and we will be at 85% reopen by next week. We are pleased to see how the consumers are coming back. In our own stores, small doors are performing very well. Our domestic consumers are over indexing, and it will be critical to target that domestic consumer for the remainder of the year as international consumers are traveling much less and we don't expect this trend to materially improve this year.  
Our wholesale partners saw business improve with the introduction of curbside pickup and ship-from-store. Digital conversion is significantly higher than last year, and we are attracting a lot of new consumers shopping on sites. We believe that the recovery in North America will follow a slightly slower recovery trajectory than Europe, and we expect that promotions will be elevated. Also, similar to Europe, our wholesale partners stopped accepting shipments in March, which has been a headwind to the business. And we have only seen replenishment orders start flowing again.  
Across regions and brands, when we were hit by the COVID crisis, we had a very strong focus on the short-term navigation through the immediate crisis, the health and well-being of our teams and consumers, cash preservation, expense reduction and inventory decisions to adjust to the current demand situation. We're using multiple approaches to manage our inventories, such as canceling orders, repurposing and reflowing goods, re-platforming fabrics, consolidating future collections and packing away certain core items where we can achieve strong margins in upcoming seasons.  
In parallel to hunkering down from a cash, cost and inventory perspective, we redirected our focus early on to demand creation to where the consumer was shopping. We have supercharged our e-commerce channels across all brands and regions, both own and operated, and we are collaborating very closely with Tmall, Zalando and Amazon, among others, in ways that moves us to where the consumer is going, both in terms of live events, product launches as well as connecting our inventory from our bricks-and-mortar stores to serve our own e-commerce as well as partner platforms. What is exciting to see is that our consumers have expressed a strong demand for our brands across all digital platforms. A few examples: our own digital businesses had excellent performance during the first quarter. Calvin's digital revenues were up 40% and Tommy's own digital business up over 60% with triple-digit increases in the second quarter to date.  
Our Calvin North America e-commerce business turned a quarterly profit for the first time in ck.com's history. In Asia, we furthered our partnership with Tmall by featuring a virtual exhibit for our CK One product drop and our CK One Tmall Club Day saw a strong consumer demand and sell-throughs. In Europe, we accelerated the rollout of connected e-commerce with Zalando and About You, and our ship-from-store penetration reached double digits for Zalando in April and May.  
North America, our Amazon business benefited from significant growth in Prime memberships. And this month, we will participate in their summer sales at Soft Lines as they move their Prime Day to October. 
In the product assortment across brands and regions, we have seen the consumers in an accelerated way going towards cash on essential products. There is a big increase in demand for our essential categories like underwear, loungewear, t-shirts, hoodies, athleisure, activewear as well as jeans. All these categories are core strengths of both brands. We have redirected big product introduction and product collaborations to e-commerce and done some of them purely digital. Our CK One launch had an Instagram reach of 57 million people. We also launched our Tommy Jeans Looney Tunes capsule in a livestream partnership with Tmall, achieving over 45 million impressions. 
Lastly, this crisis has made it clear that our product lead times have come down across the board to better match inventory to the current demand trends. Our marketing has also been redirected towards social and digital to reflect the time we are living in. For Calvin, we hosted monthly live stream session from WeChat using local talents in the campaigns. Calvin recently launched its Pride 2020 campaign, #proudinmycalvins, across social, digital and e-commerce in over 20 markets. Initial sell-through is strong and the campaign and collection had a plus 89% increase in average comments per post.  
At Tommy, we livestreamed our spring collections with the ability for consumers to purchase directly from the event for wear now product. Tommy also hosted 4 celebrity livestreams on short video platform, GoWin, which secured 1.5 million views and helped us convert both new and existing consumers to purchase. 
All our brands have refocused on engaging with the consumer in a more interactive way than any time before. 
I would also like to take a step back and give some global brand highlights, starting with Calvin. Calvin Klein began first quarter with strong brand health, including very strong global awareness. The Calvin Klein lifestyle is truly resonating with consumers during this time, particularly our underwear, loungewear, activewear and wear now offerings. We adapted our marketing message to reflect this through our #athomeinmycalvins campaign. Our efforts were successful as we saw significant growth in new consumer shopping our sites, and we continue to focus on new consumer acquisition as well as retention and conversion. For example, our CK One launch, which is our replay of the iconic genderless collection from the 1990s cater to the younger consumer and now represents 10% of our CK underwear sales in Asia.  
Before COVID crisis hit, we had already started the work with setting the forward-looking brand direction for Calvin Klein. And I'm pleased to share that the team has completed this work, and we are looking forward to take you through it in detail at a later time. So now I would just like to share that the evolved brand direction is built around going back to the iconic DNA of the brand and reconnecting it to the consumer and culture of today. It's focused on serving clients unique strengths as one of few authentic global lifestyle brands and will be a very strong foundation to drive consumer engagement and profitable growth for the years to come. The response from our own teams and external collaborators has been very strong.  
Moving on to Tommy Hilfiger. Tommy entered 2020 with a strong underlying momentum. I would like to start with welcoming Martijn as our COO for Tom Hilfiger Global and PVH Europe. Martijn has been the co-pilot behind the Tommy Hilfiger brand and business success over the last few years. He is a very strong leader and value creator.  
Tommy Hilfiger was recognized in the top 20 on Vogue's business index for the top 50 luxury brands, which ranks brands across consumer sentiment, digital presence, omnichannel performance, sustainability reporting and financial performance. We also had exceptional sell-through of collaboration launches throughout the quarter, including Tommy Jeans Looney Tunes capsule, which shows that our differentiation is a true advantage, especially in a market like China.  
Moving on to Heritage. We are pleased to close on our sale of the Speedo business to Pentland in April for approximately $170 million. And we will look for additional opportunities to streamline and/or exit businesses that are non-core to us. Our Heritage Brands business was under significant pressure, although the online businesses from our wholesale partners was a partial offset. The cash realization trend that's being accelerated by COVID, that's working for us in both Calvin and Tommy, is working against us in the more formal wear to work product categories in Heritage. We are addressing these challenges by managing inventory levels more prudently, lowering our cost base, evaluating our store portfolio and reviewing additional ways to optimize and streamline the business. 
Finally, as Manny mentioned, navigating through this crisis has made us even more aware of the many unique strength we have to build on coming out of COVID. We have 2 of the most iconic brands in the market globally, in Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein, both with very strong global awareness as well as big, strong consumer bases around the world. We also have a very strong multichannel presence in North America, Europe and Asia, and we are increasingly matching our reach towards where the consumer is voting to shop. And the crisis has made us move faster and get even closer to the customer. And what we have realized navigating through the immediate crisis is that many of the key learnings from doing the crisis work are very tightly connected to what it will take to win post COVID. Overall, we see that the COVID effects in our business reflects big accelerations of existing underlying consumer market trends and increased focus on e-commerce, product relevance and consumer engagement will be core priorities as we are driving towards an accelerated recovery. 
And with that, I would like to turn it over to Mike."

I want to briefly touch on the first quarter 2020 results, then move on to the current state of the business. As expected, our business was significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic as the majority of our stores and our wholesale par",1010,"Thanks, Stefan. I want to briefly touch on the first quarter 2020 results, then move on to the current state of the business. As expected, our business was significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic as the majority of our stores and our wholesale partner stores were closed for 6 weeks on average during the quarter. As a result of the widespread store closures, revenues from our retail stores were down approximately 50% to 65% depending on the region. 
Shipments to our wholesale customers sharply reduced as well, resulting in an overall decline of 41% in our global wholesale revenues. Our directly operated digital e-commerce businesses were fully operational during the quarter, and we experienced strong revenue growth in all regions, up 40% versus the prior year with double-digit to triple-digit revenue increases during the period while our stores were closed. This growth in e-commerce partially offset declines in our brick-and-mortar and wholesale revenues. 
Overall, our reported revenue was down 43%. Tommy Hilfiger revenues were down 39% with international down 32% and North America down 51%. Calvin Klein revenue was down 46%, with international down 40% and North America down 54%. Heritage revenues were down 47%. 
In addition to the revenue decline, our results were under significant pressure in the quarter due to a $97 million increase in accounts receivable write-offs and inventory reserves and a significant deleveraging of expenses. We continue to pay certain retail associates for all and most of the time our stores were closed and the measures we are taking to reduce expenses didn't take effect until the end of the quarter. 
The unprecedented revenue and earnings decline as a result of the pandemic resulted in a loss per share on a non-GAAP basis of $3.03 for the first quarter. On a GAAP basis, due to the pandemic and reduction in our market cap, we took noncash goodwill and intangible asset charges of $933 million. Also, we took noncash impairment charges totaling $16 million related to store assets and $12 million related to an equity method investment. 
Moving on to the current state. Our second quarter and full year 2020 results will continue to be significantly negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and we expect that our revenue decline in the second quarter will be more pronounced than the first quarter. The duration and extent of the pandemic remains highly uncertain. Our results could be impacted in ways we are still not able to predict today and as a result, we are not in a position to issue more detailed guidance for the second quarter or for the fiscal year. 
We are continuing with our Phase 3 opening of our stores in the U.S. and around the world. By mid-June, over 85% of our stores will be reopened globally. Although most of the stores are operating with reduced hours and occupancy levels, while sales remained down across all regions on a year-over-year basis, traffic and sales trends are improving each week. 
Second quarter-to-date we're seeing same-store sales for our brick-and-mortar stores that have reopened, running about down 25% from North America, down 20% for Europe and down 25% for total Asia, with China flat, and China was the first country to close and the first country to reopen with the pandemic. All in second quarter-to-date for our total direct-to-consumer business, including stores that were closed for a portion of all of the second quarter-to-date and our directly operated digital commerce sites, we are running about down 65% for North America, down 25% for Europe and down 11% for total Asia, but China is up 25%. 
Additionally, most of our wholesale customers have now reopened in the majority of their locations across all regions. However, due to the significant levels of inventory that remain in stores, the majority of our North American and European brick-and-mortar wholesale partners stopped accepting shipments beginning in March, which has not materially improved into the second quarter. 
In response to the pandemic, we are taking every proportion to reduce our expenses and working capital. These actions started in mid-April and are continuing into the second quarter and the rest of the year. We are reducing payroll costs, including salary and incentive comp, furloughs, decreased working hours and hiring freezes as well as taking advantage of applicable government relief programs. We are eliminating or reducing other discretionary and variable expenses, including marketing, travel, consulting, and creative and design costs. We are also tightly managing inventories, including reducing and canceling inventory commitments, redeploying basic inventory items to subsequent seasons and consolidating future seasonal collections as well as negotiating extended payment terms with our suppliers. 
I want to emphasize that our priority has been on cash flow and liquidity. We ended the quarter with $1.8 billion of liquidity, including cash of approximately $800 million and $1 billion of available borrowings under our revolving credit facilities. 
As previously announced, we moved quickly to reinforce liquidity in response to the pandemic. We suspended share repurchases under our stock repurchase program in March, following approximately $110 million repurchases we completed in the first quarter, and we suspended our cash dividend beginning with the second quarter. We entered into a new $275 million 364-day revolving credit facility and issued an additional EUR 175 million, of 3.625% senior notes due 2024. 
Importantly, we obtained a waiver of the leverage and interest coverage covenants under our senior credit facilities through and including the first quarter of 2021. We are cutting capital expenditures to approximately $190 million in 2020 from $345 million in 2019, with capital expenditures only from minimum requirements in our retail stores and for projects currently in progress related to our systems and warehouses. 
Additionally, we closed on the sale of our Speedo North America business to Pentland Group PLC, the parent company of the Speedo brand, in April for proceeds of about $170 million. We will give guidance for future quarters in the year once there is more clarity on the impact and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
And with that, operator, we will open it up for questions."

And I think those stores that were 6 months ago, 4 months ago cash flow positive, marginally profitable, I think those stores with the pressure that's been put on from the pandemic and the shift to digital is really pointing to the need to reevaluate those stores and look to streamline the portfolio. And I think that will continue, though, particularly here in the United States, and I think to some degree, in Europe as we look at that portfolio. 
In Asia, where we are underdeveloped from a retail point of view, China, it's just about every market in Asia, we've got a good brand positioning. Well, there seems to be brick-and-mortar opportunity there. So I think there will be a net opener. And I think in the more mature markets, we'll probably be a net closer over time. 
The second question, as you could imagine, we're seeing tremendous results, positive results in our permanent population stores, smaller cities, cities that really are driven by -- stores that are really driven by the consumer in that geographic market, both here in Europe, Asia and in North America. And we are being dramatically hurt by tourist location stores. And we just think about the biggest Orlando, Las Vegas, Guam in Asia, Hong Kong, that market that drives off of it in Europe, Paris, Milan, London, those stores which are big profit producers, without that international tourism, those stores are down significantly more than the overall averages and our permanent population stores across the board are much positive to flat to ultimately down slightly."

I think you really relied on your wholesale partners to capture the digital consumer for you and all the spending that it takes to drive traffic to the sites and the digital CapEx that goes with it. Can you talk a little bit about how quick you think you are today if your output of this whole period and the consumer engaging directly with the brands online after this? How does your digital business overall influence your gross margins, SG&A and operating margins?"

And what we -- some of the efficiencies that we've built into our own e-comm business and scale, which has really turned those businesses much more profitable for us. So really the e-comm business had no negative impact at all on our profitability in the first quarter. That profitability impact was really driven by the reduced sales volume, the expense initiatives that really began late in the fourth quarter as the stores closed, and we continue to pay people for a month before we started to furlough and take other initiatives hoping that this would be quicker. So I think you'll see those start to become more in line as we get to the second half of the year, the expense ratios. And our margins were impacted by the reserves we took in total $100 million. A big portion of that towards margins for future markdowns that we're anticipating in the second and third quarter. So I think that would have much more impact on our profitability margins and the loss that was generated. 
And then finally, I would just say is, as this demand curve on e-commerce continues, we are seeing our profitability significantly improved in that channel of distribution both from a direct-to-consumer where we are doing everything and selling directly and particularly where we're working with our third-party players that by far is our most profitable business."

On -- clearly, as we go through the second quarter with the stores, if you take the month of February out of the equation, we're going to be significantly more open in the second quarter than we were in the first quarter as we move forward. Right now, I think, as we say in all our disclosure, we're about 85% open mid-June. So by the end of this weekend, about 85% of our stores will be opened. Store hours are less. I think that store hours on average are probably down 15% to 20%, robust number to give you a sense that it's cut. It's also store capacity is down. So we can only let so many people in at a time. And in some locations, we have lines outside the store. All of those things are impacting us, where our store traffic is down significantly more than our sales traffic, and I think that's driven by a couple of things. Consumers -- customers that are out and shopping are out and shopping with a purpose. They need something they're out there. They're shopping. They're not just browsing. They're shopping. And secondly, I think we're being very effective on how we are converting customers. We're offering strong value in our product, which we really saw in February and coming out of the fourth quarter, we saw tremendous momentum in our spring product globally at Calvin and Tommy Hilfiger. And that momentum as the customers come in and they're voting, they're really hitting that target. I think Stefan is not going to give, as you know, in the Calvin organization.

Good morning, everyone. Joining me on the call are Stephen Lawson, our President; Mike Shaffer, our Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer; and Dana Perlman, Treasurer and Senior Vice President, Business Development and Investor Relations. 
I want to thank you all for joining us on the second quarter earnings call and also hope that you and your families are healthy and safe. Our better-than-expected results reflect the hard work, determination and flexibility of our talented associates across the world, and I can express how grateful I am for their determination and dedication. 
I would like to specifically acknowledge the incredible efforts from our store and distribution center associates who are on the front lines and have kept our businesses running over the last couple of quarters despite the challenging times and unconventional working dynamics. The current backdrop has changed how we will all live probably forever from the COVID-19 pandemic and its impacts to our everyday lives and to the social issues that we are embracing to drive positive changes across our communities. 
We continue to live by our purpose, which is to drive fashion forward for good. One of our most noteworthy recent announcements was the hiring of our first ever Chief Diversity Officer last month. Together with our expanded inclusion and diversity team, we believe that we can continue to accelerate our work to create an inclusive environment where every individual is valued and every voice is heard. We also took key actions to evolve our business and drive an accelerated recovery. 
We accelerated our digital agenda and reallocated additional resources to drive growth in this critically important channel. We continue to optimize our brick-and-mortar presence, including announcing the closure of our heritage retail business in mid-2021. We will continue to review our footprint, what our front put looks like post COVID in our owned and operated network and through our wholesale partners. We are focused on every expense line item, including our previously announced headcount reductions in North America, and we will continue to evaluate further measures as we go forward. 
We managed our inventories prudently while also increasing our inventory buys towards the comfort and casual products that are working exceedingly well with consumers right now. And lastly, we were opportunistic in the capital markets in early July and efficiently raised additional capital to further support our already strong financial and liquidity position. We are confident that these actions will position us well to navigate the COVID-19 pandemic and emerge as a stronger organization. 
Turning to our second quarter performance. While our second quarter results continue to reflect a significant disruption from the COVID-19 pandemic. They exceeded our expectations both from a top and bottom line perspective. Our revenues declined 33% to $1.6 billion as our own stores and wholesale partner stores were closed for about 1 month on average during the quarter. And our stores are operating at significantly reduced hours and occupancy levels. 
We experienced better-than-expected performance across all markets and channels as the casual brand lifestyles that Calvin and Tommy represent were even more relevant with our consumers spending more time at home. Digital continues to outperform. With total digital sales up 50%, including almost 90% growth in our owned commerce sites. We continue to believe that digital sales can reach 20% of our sales in the next couple of years while also contributing favorably to profits. 
In our stores, while traffic was down, particularly in international tourist locations in North America, our conversion was very strong. Gross margins were up 80 basis points driven by the mix shift benefit to our international markets as well as more favorable lockdown rates compared to what our expectations have been. 
As we expected, our SG&A deleveraged versus last year. However, there was a significant sequential improvement versus the first quarter due to the higher revenue days as well as the full quarterly benefit of our cost initiatives. All in all, we were quite pleased with our second quarter results with us delivering EPS of $0.13 a share. 
Before I pass things over to Stefan, I'd like to address how we are approaching the second half of the year, particularly holiday. This will clearly be a unique holiday season, and we are highly strategic in our approach to be competitive and gain share during this period. We are also being conservative in our sales outlook for the fourth quarter given all the uncertainties resulting from the potential impact from the COVID-19 virus. We believe we are in an excellent position given our inventory position, and our sourcing base to be able to meet any sales demand that comes that will be over our expectations. 
While our brands and positioning are strong, we expect that the second half of the year will present itself with a fair amount of volatility, especially if COVID-19 cases resurge. Our assortments will be focused on relevant categories and we are in a position to chase inventory with better-than-expected demand materializes. We expect that brick-and-mortar traffic will remain under pressure and are looking into creative ways to work around that, while also driving people into our stores. 
We will be redirecting resources to digital to support strong growth on our own sites as well as our pure-play partners and other wholesale partners online. From a regional standpoint, we expect to see continued outperformance in our international businesses. China continues to gain momentum for both Calvin and Tommy. And we are pleased to see positive growth in the region, reflecting our brand health and successful consumer engagement initiatives. 
Europe, which has been our strongest market over the past few years, continues to demonstrate a strong recovery. And we believe that we can continue to gain market share for holiday with our best seller capsules planned and leverage our compelling brand propositions. We expect that most -- the most pressure to continue to be felt in our North America businesses for several well telegraphed reasons. First, the resurgence of COVID-19 cases in states significantly impacted consumer shopping and spending patterns. We expect store traffic will be pressured with the virus resurgence. Secondly, while back-to-school was never a big business for PVH, it was a traffic driver for outlet centers and department stores that we are not experiencing at the same level this time this year. And lastly, international share of traffic to the United States, which typically represents about 30% to 40% of our revenues is down over 90% so far this year. And we do not expect it to come back during the second half of 2020. 
That said, the domestic consumer is shopping our stores and is excited and invigorated with our brands. Our efforts for holiday in the U.S. will be focused on engaging with the local consumer in the United States, leading with our halo products and offering compelling price value propositions. We are also prepared to begin the holiday sales season early as a number of our retail partners, including Amazon Prime, which will now be held in October instead of its usual timing in the summer are all beginning the holiday selling at an earlier time. 
Overall, I am opportunistic about the opportunities ahead for PVH, both for the balance of this year and as we look into the next few years. We have a very powerful business model. Led by our incredible people, our iconic global brands and our strong business and financial fundamentals. And I believe these competitive advantages will position us to deliver long-term sustainable growth. And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Stefan to go into some more detailed business. Stefan?"

Since we spoke last, our focus for our brands and regions in the second quarter has increasingly been to lean into the execution towards an accelerated recovery. And in doing that to position our businesses to win with",1854,"Thank you, Manny, and good morning. Since we spoke last, our focus for our brands and regions in the second quarter has increasingly been to lean into the execution towards an accelerated recovery. And in doing that to position our businesses to win with the consumer in the new normal coming out of COVID and to drive sustainable, profitable market share growth. 
Due to the COVID pandemic, just the first quarter, the second quarter and the rest of this year will not look like any other year. Having successfully navigated through the immediate first phase of the crisis, I will now share some key insights on how we grow performance in the second quarter and what our key priorities are to drive towards an accelerated recovery. Just like last quarter, Mike will then share more financial details on our second quarter performance and how we are thinking about the second half of the year. 
In the second quarter across the board, as Manny mentioned, we were able to drive a stronger-than-expected recovery, both top and bottom line, from a number of proactive actions. First, we quickly turn to supercharging e-commerce across owned and operated as well as third-party digital commerce for both pure players and the partner store.com. As a result for the quarter, we grew total digital sales over 50%, including an 87% increase on our own sites, where new user growth continue to be very strong across all regions, particularly within the younger age brackets. 
Next, we continue to increase our focus on driving product relevance, which drove stronger-than-expected demand and margin in key categories. We continue to experience strong performance in cash flow core essentials, within underwear, loungewear and athleisure. We saw favorable pricing power in underwear, and we are chasing inventories to be best positioned to capture demand in the second half. 
We also drove a more effective and interactive consumer engagement. And based on our data insights, we were able to better connect the consumer to the product they're looking for. And follow how their shopping patterns have changed across our channels. From an inventory management perspective, as a result of stronger-than-expected sell-throughs of spring/summer 2020 product we are carrying over less than expected product into the spring 2021 season. Our teams are focused on ending the year as clean as possible, and we will continue to liquidate an reliable product. Lastly, we were successful in taking steps to rightsize our cost structure to better reflect our revenue levels in by COVID. 
This include -- this includes our decision to streamline our North America business, by reducing 12% of our workforce and closing our heritage retail business in 2021. As I provide a regional update, you will see that the recovery continued to be very strong throughout the quarter in both China and Europe. While in North America, even though our digital channels performed very well, we felt increasing pressure towards the end of the quarter, particularly in the brick-and-mortar channels, where we saw virus resurgence, and we have significant exposure to international tourist traffic. 
Let me start with Asia, specifically with China, which is the furthest ahead in terms of the recovery. Our direct-to-consumer sales in China increased double digits in the second quarter. And we continue to experience double-digit growth for the third quarter to date. Digital continued to outperform for Asia as a whole, with our own business up about 75%. We also experienced strong Tmall performance with new live stream events, growing very strong traffic and new customer growth. Our marketing events in China focused on maximizing sales around key consumer moments, including our 618 digital commerce event with Tmall, where both brands drove over 80% growth versus last year. 
During the campaign, we performed over 30 live streams and 70% -- 72% of our consumers were new to the brands. Given continued traffic pressure in brick-and-mortar locations, our promotions in that channel focus on driving conversion and basket size, while limiting discounts on better performing products. Even though we continue to see virus flare-ups impact our business in Japan, parts of Australia, Hong Kong and now Korea. In the region as a whole, we continue to make good progress towards a continued strong recovery. 
Moving on to Europe, where we continue to drive a very strong recovery and we experienced performance trends that were meaningfully above expectations. Our direct-to-consumer sales in Europe were down 10% in the second quarter, which was well above our expectations. Digital commerce continued to outperform, with second quarter sales growing nearly 80% year-over-year. The digital growth was driven by higher traffic and conversion, which is driven by strong product and marketing in combination with having the right inventory availability. Given our position of brand strength, we narrowed our promotions and managed to maintain similar markdown levels to last year. And while traffic in brick-and-mortar remains challenged, particularly in larger cities, conversion was very strong, and the team continues to find innovative ways to drive traffic into our stores. While the virus is seeing some resurgence in Europe, our business in the third quarter-to-date remains very strong, with direct-to-consumer sales tracking mid-single digits. 
We're also pleased with our spring 2021 order books, which showed a sequential improvement, where both brands are tracking down high single digits versus tracking down mid-teens in fall 2020. Lastly, our North American business felt the most pressure relative to our other regions. Our direct-to-consumer sales in North America were down about 45% in the second quarter and are currently running down in the mid-30s in the third quarter to date. 
Our biggest challenge, as Manny mentioned, is the lack of international tourists, which historically represent 30% to 40% of sales of our business, which is down close to 95%. As we look ahead, we do not anticipate this trend to improve before next year. As a reminder, less than 30% of our EBIT was generated from the U.S. in 2019. Despite the challenges with tourism, we are seeing strong engagement with the domestic consumer. However, softer as of late in the virus surge states. 
We experienced very strong digital demand during the quarter as we drove triple-digit growth for both Calvin and Tommy.com, including many new to site consumers. Our business with Amazon was also a highlight as we saw strength in their new soft line sale in June and outstanding growth in new-to-brand consumers. Which has continued into the third quarter. And as we look to the second half of the year, we will continue to manage our inventories prudently. We will redeploy resources to those areas of the business that are performing, such as digital from a channel perspective and essential cash flow products from a category perspective. 
As our performance across regions demonstrates, we have taken a very deliberate approach for each brand to get deeper connected with the consumer and enhance our brand positioning to gain profitable market share. Now I'd like to share a few brief global brand highlights from the quarter, beginning with Calvin. 
Calvin clients brand health remains very strong, and we continue to see strong consumer interaction across Calvin social channels with an average follow increase of over 20% year-over-year. We're implementing our evolved brand direction in our products and marketing. And already now, you can see it in how we drive engagement on Instagram and other social platforms. And you will see even more of it during the holiday season and the beginning of next year. In addition, we took steps to gain greater control of the brand with announcement that we will buy back our European footwear business in spring of 2021, which represents a great opportunity as we leverage our knowledge from Tommy's successful footwear platform. 
And lastly, we announced that Movado, our licensed partner for Tommy Hilfiger, will take over the brands, Watches & Jewelry license for Spring 2022, and we feel optimistic about the partnership and the business potential. 
Moving on to Tommy. Tommy's global momentum continued in the second quarter with the brand demonstrating strong awareness, visibility and consideration to purchase. We continue to convert new consumers to the brand, including in growth markets like China, where our live streams generated over 60% of sales from first-time buyers. In the quarter, we continue to launch limited edition brand collaborations that resonated well with our consumers. We also recently launched Tommy's Make it Possible campaign, which is a bold sustainability program that builds on PVH forward fashion strategy, which is set to reduce our negative impacts to 0 sell positive impact and improve over 1 million lives across our value chain. 
And now to our Heritage business. Our Heritage Brands business was under significant pressure during the second quarter. The casualization trend that's being accelerated by COVID, and it's working very well for us in Calvin and Tommy. It's working against us in the more formal wear-to-work product categories within Heritage. Additionally, the mid-tier department store bankruptcies in North America have negatively impacted this business compared to Calvin and Tommy. 
We are addressing the challenges by managing inventory levels more prudently, lowering our cost base and reviewing additional ways to optimize and streamline the business. That goes beyond the next year closure of our Heritage Brands retail business. 
And before I hand it over to Mike, I would like to reiterate that we are balancing, driving the business here and now, which starts with, as Manny mentioned in his introduction, having the plans and execution to win with the consumer during the upcoming holiday season. It also includes to making sure that we are focused on driving accelerated recovery coming out of COVID, where our main priorities are: first, to continue to drive product strength by focusing on key growth categories and developing strong hero product franchises, all connecting to where the consumer is going, with special focus on casual essentials and at leisure; next is to further supercharge our e-commerce growth and penetration, while at the same time, evaluating what our optimal brick-and-mortar present looks like, both in our own locations and with our wholesale partners; and lastly, we will continue to review our cost base and determine where we can optimize our business model and organizational structure to operate an even leaner and more dynamic organization, while also allocating additional resources towards our growth areas. 
Overall, even though we're still in the early days of driving towards an accelerated recovery, as we intensify our focus to build on our core strength and connect them closer to the consumer than any time before. I feel very optimistic about the forward path ahead for PVH. Every time we take steps closer to what the consumer wants and needs, we see the positive performance proof points, whether it is in product, marketing or e-commerce distribution. The global brand power of Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger is a core strength, and our diversified multi-region, multi-channel platform positions us to gain market share globally. And we see examples every day that our teams are rising up to the challenge to make it happen. And by that, I would like to hand it over to Mike."
296568,684331228,2089335,"PVH Corp., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Sep 03, 2020",2020-09-03,"Earnings Calls","PVH Corp.","Executives","Thanks, Stefan. The comments I'm about to make are based on non-GAAP results and are reconciled in our press release. I'm going to discuss our second quarter 2020 results, then move on to the current state of the business and our second half expectations.",963,"Thanks, Stefan. The comments I'm about to make are based on non-GAAP results and are reconciled in our press release. I'm going to discuss our second quarter 2020 results, then move on to the current state of the business and our second half expectations. While our business continued to be negatively impacted compared to last year by the COVID-19 pandemic, our overall results were an improvement compared to the first quarter and exceeded our expectations. Overall, our reported revenues were down 33%. Tommy Hilfiger revenues were down 28%, with international down 14% and North America down 51%. Calvin Klein revenue was down 32%, with international down 16% and North America down 51%. 
China showed positive year-over-year results in both Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein. Our Heritage revenues were down 51%, which included a 16% decline as a result of the sale of our Speedo business. Our stores as well as those of our wholesale partners were temporarily closed during the first month of the quarter. As a result, our revenue in the second quarter reflected a 40% decline in revenue to our wholesale distribution channel and a 24% decline in revenue from our total direct-to-consumer business. That included an 87% increase in sales to our digital commerce businesses, driven by strong growth across all brands and all regions. 
While we continue to be negatively impacted by the pandemic, our earnings exceeded our expectations, and our earnings per share was $0.13 on a non-GAAP basis for the second quarter. Our gross margin for the second quarter benefited from a favorable mix of business as our international businesses were a larger portion of our total revenue versus the prior year and generally carry higher gross margins in our North America businesses. Additionally, earnings in the second quarter had the benefit of expensive reduction initiatives, including salary reductions, temporary furloughs and lower discretionary spending, including marketing, travel, consulting and creative and design costs as well as onetime benefits from COVID-related government payroll subsidy programs in our international jurisdictions and rent abatements where we negotiated with certain of our landlords. 
Full salaries and most furloughed employees were reinstated at the beginning of the third quarter. Partially offsetting these savings were additional expenses associated with the implementation of health and safety measures to protect our associates, customers and business partners. These safety measures are expected to continue, and the cost of them will be greater in the second half of the year. 
Moving on to the current state of the business. Currently, almost all of our stores in the U.S. and around the world are open, although they are operating on reduced hours and reduced occupancy levels. Third quarter-to-date for our direct-to-consumer business, we are running down low single digits for total Asia, with China up. We are running up mid-single digits in Europe and down about 35% for North America. Our owned and operated digital commerce businesses for the third quarter-to-date have continued to show strong growth. 
Regarding wholesale, both our traditional and pure-play wholesale customers have seen strength in the digital commerce channel, and this trend has continued into the third quarter, with accounts buying inventory to accommodate the strong trend. However, we expect wholesale accounts to buy conservatively for their store-based businesses through the balance of the year and the revenue decline in our North America wholesale business will be more significant than in Europe and Asia. The expected revenue decline in North America includes the impact of recent bankruptcies. 
We continue to be proactive in our response to the pandemic with ongoing focus on operational efficiencies and liquidity such as streamlining our North America operations by exiting our Heritage Brands retail business by mid-2021 and reducing our North America workforce by 12%. We're tightly managing inventories. They decreased 12% from this time last year. We've reduced inventory commitments, consolidated future season collections and negotiated extended payment terms with suppliers. 
As of the end of fiscal 2020, we are now projecting to carry approximately $125 million of basic inventory into spring 2021, which is a reduction compared to our prior projection of about $250 million. Also during the second quarter, we issued $500 million and 4 and [ five eight ] percent senior notes due for 2025, and we ended the quarter with $2.7 billion of liquidity, including cash of approximately $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion of available borrowings under our revolving credit facilities. 
And now moving on to our expectations for the second half. We expect that our second half revenue and earnings will continue to be negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. We currently expect revenue in the second half to be down 25% versus last year. When we think about gross margin, we expect that our second half gross margin will be relatively flat compared to the first half as we project heavy promotional activity across the industry in order to clear inventory, particularly in the United States. When we think about second half expenses and when you compare to the second quarter, we expect our expenses as a percentage of revenue to be slightly higher in the second half than in the second quarter. The second quarter expenses benefited from salary reductions furlough government payroll subsidy programs and rent abatements, which will not materially continue into the second half. Although in North America, we will continue to have payroll savings as a result of the recently announced reduction in our workforce. 
We also expect to incur even greater expenses for health and safety measures in the second half as opposed to the second quarter. We are not in a position to issue more detailed guidance at this time due to the uncertainty related to the duration and severity of the pandemic. And with that, operator, we'll open it up for questions."

So that's consumer spending, particularly in apparel, as it moves on. In addition, I think the fact that we are as a company really focused -- a big part of our business is tourism-driven, international tourist, in particular. And that business has all but gone away, and we're anticipating that, that international tourists his will not be back in the second half of 2020. So that's where we're seeing the pressure on our own retail stores, which are anywhere from 30% to 40% of our sales, all driven by international tours. And so that's where I think it is. I think the opportunity lies in continuation of some of the trends we've seen and moving forward, sees a sequential improvement over that as we go forward. And from a bottom line point of view, I think our biggest opportunity is gross margin. We are anticipating a highly promotional environment for the third and fourth quarter, particularly holiday. And if that would have back off, similar to how we saw in the second quarter where we were much more conservative about markdown rates or thinking that didn't materialize. So I think there's an opportunity both on the top line, but there's also an opportunity that may be more significant on the gross margin."

So I think there is opportunity the business backs up.

Tommy has always had a big jeans component to their sportswear business, almost a similar size to where Calvin is. So both brands, I think, are in a strong position.

And the key will be how much goods are out there that need to be cleared from a fashion point of view or whatever. We don't see any real buildup. As Mike talked about, we were planning to carry out as much as $250 million of goods. That number has already been cut in half. And it factored into all of our second quarter numbers and into third quarter numbers. And I think we'll continue to get that number down compared to where we were originated for.

Good morning, everyone. Joining me on the call are Stefan Larsson, our President; Mike Shaffer, our Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer; and Dana Perlman, Treasurer and Senior Vice President, Business Development and Investor Relations.  
I want to thank you all for joining us on the second quarter earnings call and also hope that you and your families are healthy and safe. Our better-than-expected results reflect the hard work, determination and flexibility of our talented associates across the world, and I can express how grateful I am for their determination and dedication.  
I would like to specifically acknowledge the incredible efforts from our store and distribution center associates who are on the frontline and have kept our businesses running over the last couple of quarters despite the challenging times and unconventional working dynamics. 
The current backdrop has changed how we will all live probably forever from the COVID-19 pandemic and its impacts to our everyday lives and to the social issues that we are embracing to drive positive changes across our communities. 
We continue to live by our purpose, which is to drive fashion forward for good. One of our most noteworthy recent announcements was the hiring of our first ever chief diversity officer last month. Together with our expanded inclusion and diversity team, we believe that we can continue to accelerate our work to create an inclusive environment where every individual is valued and every voice is heard. We also took key actions to evolve our business and drive an accelerated recovery.  
We accelerated our digital agenda and reallocated additional resources to drive growth in this critically important channel. We continue to optimize our brick-and-mortar presence, including announcing the closure of our Heritage retail business in mid-2021. We will continue to review our footprint and our what our footprint looks like post COVID in our owned and operated network and through our wholesale partners. We are focused on every expense line item, including our previously announced headcount reductions in North America, and we will continue to evaluate further measures as we go forward.  
We managed our inventories prudently while also increasing our inventory buys towards the comfort and casual products that are working exceedingly well with consumers right now. 
And lastly, we were opportunistic in the capital markets in early July and efficiently raised additional capital to further support our already strong financial and liquidity position. We are confident that these actions will position us well to navigate the COVID-19 pandemic and emerge as a stronger organization.  
Turning to our second quarter performance. While our second quarter results continue to reflect a significant disruption from the COVID-19 pandemic, they exceeded our expectations both from a top and bottom line perspective. Our revenues declined 33% to $1.6 billion as our owned stores and wholesale partner stores were closed for about 1 month on average during the quarter and our stores are operating at significantly reduced hours and occupancy levels. We experienced better-than-expected performance across all markets and channels as the casual brand lifestyles that Calvin and Tommy represent were even more relevant with our consumers spending more time at home. 
Digital continues to outperform, with total digital sales up 50%, including almost 90% growth in our owned commerce sites. We continue to believe that digital sales can reach 20% of our sales in the next couple of years while also contributing favorably to profits.  
In our stores, while traffic was down, particularly in international tourist locations in North America, our conversion was very strong. Gross margins were up 80 basis points driven by the mix shift benefit to our international markets as well as more favorable lockdown rates compared to what our expectations have been.  
As we expected, our SG&A deleveraged versus last year. However, there was a significant sequential improvement versus the first quarter due to the higher revenue base as well as the full quarterly benefit of our cost initiatives. All in all, we were quite pleased with our second quarter results, with us delivering EPS of $0.13 a share.  
Before I pass things over to Stefan, I'd like to address how we are approaching the second half of the year particularly holiday. This will clearly be a unique holiday season, and we are highly strategic in our approach to be competitive and gain share during this period. We are also being conservative in our sales outlook for the fourth quarter given all the uncertainties resulting from the potential impact from the COVID-19 virus. We believe we are in an excellent position given our inventory position and our sourcing base to be able to meet any sales demand that comes that will be over our expectations.  
While our brands and positioning are strong, we expect that the second half of the year will present itself with a fair amount of volatility, especially if COVID-19 cases resurge. Our assortments will be focused on relevant categories, and we are in a position to chase inventory if better-than-expected demand materializes. We expect that brick-and-mortar traffic will remain under pressure and are looking into creative ways to work around that while also driving people into our stores.  
We will be redirecting resources to digital to support strong growth on our own sites as well as our pure-play partners and other wholesale partners online. From a regional standpoint, we expect to see continued outperformance in our international businesses. China continues to gain momentum for both Calvin and Tommy. And we are pleased to see positive growth in the region, reflecting our brand health and successful consumer engagement initiatives.  
Europe, which has been our strongest market over the past few years, continues to demonstrate a strong recovery. And we believe that we can continue to gain market share for holiday with our best seller capsules planned and leverage our compelling brand propositions. We expect that most -- the most pressure to continue to be felt in our North America businesses for several well-telegraphed reasons. 
First, the resurgence of COVID-19 cases in states significantly impacting consumer shopping and spending patterns. We expect store traffic will be pressured with the virus resurgence. 
Secondly, while back-to-school was never a big business for PVH, it was a traffic driver for outlet centers and department stores that we are not experiencing at the same level this time this year. 
And lastly, international tourist traffic to the United States, which typically represents about 30% to 40% of our revenues, is down over 90% so far this year. And we do not expect it to come back during the second half of 2020.  
That said, the domestic consumer is shopping our stores and is excited and invigorated with our brands. Our efforts for holiday in the U.S. will be focused on engaging with the local consumer in the United States, leading with our Hero products and offering compelling price value propositions. We are also prepared to begin the holiday sales season early, as a number of our retail partners, including Amazon Prime, which will now be held in October instead of its usual timing in the summer, are all beginning the holiday selling at an earlier time.  
Overall, I am opportunistic about the opportunities ahead for PVH, both for the balance of this year and as we look into the next few years. 
We have a very powerful business model led by our incredible people, our iconic global brands and our strong business and financial fundamentals. And I believe these competitive advantages will position us to deliver long-term sustainable growth. 
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Stefan to go into some more detailed business perspective."

Since we spoke last, our focus for our brands and regions in the second quarter has increasingly been to lean into the execution towards an accelerated recovery and in doing that to position our businesses to win with t",1847,"Thank you, Manny, and good morning. Since we spoke last, our focus for our brands and regions in the second quarter has increasingly been to lean into the execution towards an accelerated recovery and in doing that to position our businesses to win with the consumer in the new normal coming out of COVID and to drive sustainable, profitable market share growth.  
Due to the COVID pandemic, just the first quarter, the second quarter and the rest of this year will not look like any other year. Having successfully navigated through the immediate first phase of the crisis, I will now share some key insights on how we grow performance in the second quarter and what our key priorities are to drive towards an accelerated recovery. 
Just like last quarter, Mike will then share more financial details on our second quarter performance and how we are thinking about the second half of the year.  
In the second quarter across the board, as Manny mentioned, we were able to drive a stronger-than-expected recovery both top and bottom line from a number of proactive actions. First, we quickly turn to supercharging e-commerce across owned and operated as well as third-party digital commerce for both pure players and the partner store, dot-com. 
As a result, for the quarter, we grew total digital sales over 50%, including an 87% increase on our owned sites, where new user growth continue to be very strong across all regions particularly within the younger age brackets.  
Next, we continue to increase our focus on driving product relevance, which drove stronger-than-expected demand and margin in key categories. We continue to experience strong performance in casual core essentials within underwear, loungewear and athleisure. We saw favorable pricing power in underwear, and we are chasing inventories to be best positioned to capture demand in the second half.  
We also drove a more effective and interactive consumer engagement. And based on our data insights, we were able to better connect the consumer to the product they're looking for and follow how their shopping patterns have changed across our channels. From an inventory management perspective, as a result of stronger-than-expected sell-throughs of spring/summer 2020 product, we are carrying over less-than-expected product into the spring 2021 season. Our teams are focused on ending the year as clean as possible, and we will continue to liquidate any liable product. 
Lastly, we were successful in taking steps to rightsize our cost structure to better reflect our revenue levels influenced by COVID.  
This include -- this includes our decision to streamline our North America business by reducing 12% of our workforce and closing our heritage retail business in 2021. 
As I provide a regional update, you will see that the recovery continued to be very strong throughout the quarter in both China and Europe. While in North America, even though our digital channels performed very well, we felt increasing pressure towards the end of the quarter particularly the brick-and-mortar channels where we saw virus resurgence, and we have significant exposure to international tourist traffic.  
Let me start with Asia, specifically with China, which is the furthest ahead in terms of the recovery. Our direct-to-consumer sales in China increased double digits in the second quarter. And we continue to experience double-digit growth for the third quarter to date. 
Digital continued to outperform for Asia as a whole, with our owned business up about 75%. We also experienced strong Tmall performance, with new live stream events growing very strong traffic and new customer growth. Our marketing events in China focused on maximizing sales around key consumer moments, including our 618 digital commerce events with Tmall where both brands drove over 80% growth versus last year.  
During the campaign, we performed over 30 live streams and 70% -- 72% of our consumers were new to the brands. Given continued traffic pressure in brick-and-mortar locations, our promotions in that channel focus on driving conversion and basket size while limiting discounts on better-performing products. 
Even though we continue to see virus flare-ups impact our business in Japan, parts of Australia, Hong Kong and now Korea, in the region as a whole, we continue to make good progress towards a continued strong recovery.  
Moving on to Europe where we continue to drive a very strong recovery and we experienced performance trends that were meaningfully above expectations. Our direct-to-consumer sales in Europe were down 10% in the second quarter, which was well above our expectations. 
Digital commerce continued to outperform, with second quarter sales growing nearly 80% year-over-year. The digital growth was driven by higher traffic and conversion, which is driven by strong product and marketing in combination with having the right inventory availability. 
Given our position of brand strength, we narrowed our promotions and managed to maintain similar markdown levels to last year. And while traffic in brick-and-mortar remains challenged, particularly in larger cities, conversion was very strong, and the team continues to find innovative ways to drive traffic into our stores.  
While the virus is seeing some resurgence in Europe, our business in the third quarter-to-date remains very strong, with direct-to-consumer sales tracking mid-single digits. We're also pleased with our spring 2021 order books, which showed a sequential improvement, where both brands are tracking down high single digits versus tracking mid -- down mid-teens in fall 2020. 
Lastly, our North American business felt the most pressure relative to our other regions. Our direct-to-consumer sales in North America were down about 45% in the second quarter and are currently running down in the mid-30s in the third quarter to date.  
Our biggest challenge, as Manny mentioned, is the lack of international tourists, which historically represent 30% to 40% of sales of our business, which is down close to 95%. As we look ahead, we do not anticipate this trend to improve before next year. 
As a reminder, less than 30% of our EBIT was generated from the U.S. in 2019. Despite the challenges with tourism, we are seeing strong engagement with the domestic consumer, however, softer as of late in the virus-surged states.  
We experienced very strong digital demand during the quarter as we drove triple-digit growth for both Calvin and Tommy.com, including many new-to-site consumers. Our business with Amazon was also a highlight as we saw strength in their new soft line sale in June and outstanding growth in new-to-brand consumers, which has continued into the third quarter. 
And as we look to the second half of the year, we will continue to manage our inventories prudently. We will redeploy resources to those areas of the business that are performing, such as digital from a channel perspective and essential casual products from a category perspective.  
As our performance across regions demonstrates, we have taken a very deliberate approach for each brand to get deeper connected with the consumer and enhance our brand positioning to gain profitable market share. 
Now I'd like to share a few brief global brand highlights from the quarter, beginning with Calvin. Calvin Klein's brand health remains very strong, and we continue to see strong consumer interaction across Calvin's social channels with an average follow increase of over 20% year-over-year. We're implementing our evolved brand direction in our products and marketing. And already now, you can see it in how we drive engagement on Instagram and other social platforms and you will see even more of it during the holiday season and the beginning of next year. 
In addition, we took steps to gain greater control of the brand with announcement that we will buy back our European footwear business in spring of 2021, which represents a great opportunity as we leverage our knowledge from Tommy's successful footwear platform.  
And lastly, we announced that Movado, our licensed partner for Tommy Hilfiger, will take over the brand's watches and jewelry license for spring 2022, and we feel optimistic about the partnership and the business potential.  
Moving on to Tommy. Tommy's global momentum continued in the second quarter, with the brand demonstrating strong awareness, visibility and consideration to purchase. We continue to convert new consumers to the brand, including in growth markets like China where our livestreams generated over 60% of sales from first-time buyers. 
In the quarter, we continue to launch limited edition brand collaborations that resonated well with our consumers. We also recently launched Tommy's Make it Possible campaign, which is a bold sustainability program that builds on PVH's forward fashion strategy, which is set to reduce our negative impact to 0, drive positive impact and improve over 1 million lives across our value chain.  
And now to our Heritage business. Our Heritage Brands business was under significant pressure during the second quarter. The casualization trend that's being accelerated by COVID makes working very well for us in Calvin and Tommy. It's working against us in the more formal wear to work product categories within Heritage. Additionally, the mid-tier department store bankruptcies in North America have negatively impacted this business compared to Calvin and Tommy.  
We are addressing the challenges by managing inventory levels more prudently, lowering our cost base and reviewing additional ways to optimize and streamline the business that goes beyond the next year closure of our Heritage Brands retail business. 
And before I hand it over to Mike, I would like to reiterate that we are balancing, driving the business here and now, which starts with, as Manny mentioned in his introduction, having the plans and execution to win with the consumer during the upcoming holiday season. It also includes to making sure that we are focused on driving accelerated recovery coming out of COVID where our main priorities are, first, to continue to drive product strength by focusing on key growth categories and developing strong Hero product franchises, all connecting to where the consumer is going, with special focus on casual essentials and athleisure. 
Next is to further supercharge our e-commerce growth and penetration, while at the same time, evaluating what our optimal brick-and-mortar presence looks like both in our own locations and with our wholesale partners. 
And lastly, we will continue to review our cost base and determine where we can optimize our business model and organizational structure to operate an even leaner and more dynamic organization while also allocating additional resources towards our growth areas. 
Overall, even though we're still in the early days of driving towards an accelerated recovery, as we intensify our focus to build on our core strength and connect them closer to the consumer than any time before, I feel very optimistic about the forward path ahead for PVH. 
Every time we take steps closer to what the consumer wants and needs, we see the positive performance proof points, whether it is in product, marketing or e-commerce distribution. The global brand power of Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger is a core strength, and our diversified multi-region, multi-channel platform positions us to gain market share globally. And we see examples every day that our teams are rising up to the challenge to make it happen. 
And by that, I would like to hand it over to Mike."
296568,684331228,2089473,"PVH Corp., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Sep 03, 2020",2020-09-03,"Earnings Calls","PVH Corp.","Executives","Thanks, Stefan. The comments I'm about to make are based on non-GAAP results and are reconciled in our press release. I'm going to discuss our second quarter 2020 results then move on to the current state of the business and our second half expectations.",960,"Thanks, Stefan. The comments I'm about to make are based on non-GAAP results and are reconciled in our press release. I'm going to discuss our second quarter 2020 results then move on to the current state of the business and our second half expectations. 
While our business continued to be negatively impacted compared to last year by the COVID-19 pandemic, our overall results were an improvement compared to the first quarter and exceeded our expectations. Overall, our reported revenues were down 33%. Tommy Hilfiger revenues were down 28%, with international down 14% and North America down 51%. Calvin Klein revenue was down 32%, with international down 16% and North America down 51%. 
China showed positive year-over-year results in both Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein. Our Heritage revenues were down 51%, which included a 16% decline as a result of the sale of our Speedo business. 
Our stores as well as those of our wholesale partners were temporarily closed during the first month of the quarter. As a result, our revenue in the second quarter reflected a 40% decline in revenue to our wholesale distribution channel and a 24% decline in revenue from our total direct-to-consumer business. That included an 87% increase in sales to our digital commerce businesses driven by strong growth across all brands and all regions. 
While we continue to be negatively impacted by the pandemic, our earnings exceeded our expectations, and our earnings per share was $0.13 on a non-GAAP basis for the second quarter. Our gross margin for the second quarter benefited from a favorable mix of business as our international businesses were a larger portion of our total revenue versus the prior year and generally carry higher gross margins in our North America businesses. 
Additionally, earnings in the second quarter had the benefit of expensive reduction initiatives, including salary reductions, temporary furloughs and lower discretionary spending, including marketing, travel, consulting and creative and design costs as well as onetime benefits from COVID-related government payroll subsidy programs in our international jurisdictions and rent abatements where we negotiated with certain of our landlords. 
Full salaries and most furloughed employees were reinstated at the beginning of the third quarter. Partially offsetting these savings were additional expenses associated with the implementation of health and safety measures to protect our associates, customers and business partners. These safety measures are expected to continue, and the cost of them will be greater in the second half of the year. 
Moving on to the current state of the business. Currently, almost all of our stores in the U.S. and around the world are open, although they are operating on reduced hours and reduced occupancy levels. 
Third quarter-to-date for our direct-to-consumer business, we are running down low single digits for total Asia, with China up. We are running up mid-single digits in Europe and down 30 -- about 35% for North America. Our owned and operated digital commerce businesses for the third quarter-to-date have continued to show strong growth. 
Regarding wholesale. Both our traditional and pure-play wholesale customers have seen strength in the digital commerce channel. And this trend has continued into the third quarter, with accounts buying inventory to accommodate the strong trend. However, we expect wholesale accounts to buy conservatively for their store-based businesses through the balance of the year, and the revenue decline in our North America wholesale business will be more significant than in Europe and Asia. The expected revenue decline in North America includes the impact of recent bankruptcies. 
We continue to be proactive in our response to the pandemic with ongoing focus on operational efficiencies and liquidity such as streamlining our North America operations by exiting our Heritage Brands retail business by mid-2021 and reducing our North America workforce by 12%. 
We're tightly managing inventories. They decreased 12% from this time last year. We've reduced inventory commitments, consolidated future season collections and negotiated extended payment terms with suppliers. As of the end of fiscal 2020, we are now projecting to carry approximately $125 million of basic inventory into spring 2021, which is a reduction compared to our prior projection of about $250 million. 
Also during the second quarter, we issued $500 million and 4 5/8% senior notes due for 2025, and we ended the quarter with $2.7 billion of liquidity, including cash of approximately $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion of available borrowings under our revolving credit facilities. 
And now moving on to our expectations for the second half. We expect that our second half revenue and earnings will continue to be negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. We currently expect revenue in the second half to be down 25% versus last year. When we think about gross margin, we expect that our second half gross margin will be relatively flat compared to the first half as we project heavy promotional activity across the industry in order to clear inventory particularly in the United States. 
When we think about second half expenses and when you compare to the second quarter, we expect our expenses as a percentage of revenue to be slightly higher in the second half than in the second quarter. The second quarter expenses benefited from salary reductions, furlough, government payroll subsidy programs and rent abatements, which will not materially continue into the second half. Although in North America, we will continue to have payroll savings as a result of the recently announced reduction in our workforce.
 
We also expect to incur even greater expenses for health and safety measures in the second half as opposed to the second quarter. We are not in a position to issue more detailed guidance at this time due to the uncertainty related to the duration and severity of the pandemic. 
And with that, operator, we'll open it up for questions."

I think, Bob, the fundamental issue in North America is the lack of control of the virus compared to the rest of the world. And I think that's having an impact on consumer spending. So that's consumer spending, particularly in apparel, as it moves forward. 
In addition, I think the fact that we are, as a company, really focused -- a big part of our business is tourism-driven, international tourist, in particular. And that business has all but gone away. And we're anticipating that, that international tourists will not be back in the second half of 2020. So that's where we're seeing the pressure on our owned retail stores, which are anywhere from 30% to 40% of our sales, all driven by international tours. And so that's where I think it is. 
I think the opportunity lies in continuation of some of the trends we've seen, and moving forward, sees a sequential improvement over that as we go forward. And from a bottom line point of view, I think our biggest opportunity is gross margin. We are anticipating highly promotional environment for the third and fourth quarter particularly holiday. And if that would back off, similar to how we saw in the second quarter where we were much more conservative about markdown rates and operating, that wouldn't materialize. So I think there's an opportunity both on the top line, but there's also an opportunity that may be more significant on the gross margin."

I think you can even see it in a relatively short period of time, when I look at some of my key customers' inventory levels, they've done a good job of getting inventory levels down in a short -- in a really short period of time relative to demand as they've moved into the second half of the year. So I think there is opportunity if business backs up. 
I just would want to remind everybody that, for us, the U.S. wholesale, we have no account that represents close to 5% of our total sales as a company.

This is where art and science come together, trying to make a determination, seeing what's working right now in some of the key core categories where there's minimal inventory fashion risk and willing to take much more of the risk there to continue to service that business and to keep our customers and our consumers satisfied. 
We're making those, I don't want to call them debt, but we're making those investments as we go forward and continually adjust our supply chain as we move forward. But I also don't want to kid anyone. Look, you've heard the disruptions that are going on in supply, the issues with China and the U.S., even if we're not sourcing directly from China, getting raw materials out of China like cotton and other categories. It's a bit of a puzzle. 
But I think given our -- it's an area of expertise with PVH. It's is an area where we have great capabilities. And I think our on-the-ground presence with the team and our offices there allow us to really be on top of it to react to the market to stay in product categories and service those businesses. So we're trying to do it thoughtfully. 
And to be in a position, if we are projecting somewhat -- you've heard the numbers that were projecting conservatively especially in the fourth quarter, if that's the case, we want to be able to capture those incremental sales. And Stefan, you want to add?"

But Tommy is probably, as a brand, much more of a casual brand, much more of an active brand. So our sportswear there really transcends that and works extremely well for us. Tommy has always had a big jeans component to their sportswear business, almost a similar size to where Calvin is. 
So both brands, I think, are in a strong position. Calvin does, by the nature of its brand, just have this huge designer underwear and women's intimate business. Tommy's business is probably about 1/3 of the size, still very soft and substantial. But I think the 2 brands really are able to take advantage of the -- you're talking about 2 of the probably top 5 brands by size in the world. So they have a very diversified product offering that plays across the spectrum. And I think if we can manage the inventories by components, we should be able to really do well with that."

If that's the case, then we'll do better on the gross margin. I think that's a potential big opportunity for a second half of the year. And the key will be how much goods are out there that need to be cleared from a fashion point of view or whatever. We don't see any real buildup. 
As Mike talked about, we were planning to carry out as much as $250 million of goods. That number has already been cut in half. And it factored into all of our second quarter numbers and into third quarter numbers. And I think we'll continue to get that number down compared to where we were originating for.

Good morning, everyone.

I want to thank you all for joining us on the second quarter earnings call and also hope that you and your families are healthy and safe. Our better-than-expected results reflect the hard work, determination and flexibility of our talented associates across the world, and I can express how grateful I am for their determination and dedication.  
I would like to specifically acknowledge the incredible efforts from our store and distribution center associates who are on the frontline and have kept our businesses running over the last couple of quarters despite the challenging times and unconventional working dynamics. 
The current backdrop has changed how we will all live probably forever from the COVID-19 pandemic and its impacts to our everyday lives and to the social issues that we are embracing to drive positive changes across our communities. 
We continue to live by our purpose, which is to drive fashion forward for good. One of our most noteworthy recent announcements was the hiring of our first ever chief diversity officer last month. Together with our expanded inclusion and diversity team, we believe that we can continue to accelerate our work to create an inclusive environment where every individual is valued and every voice is heard. We also took key actions to evolve our business and drive an accelerated recovery.  
We accelerated our digital agenda and reallocated additional resources to drive growth in this critically important channel. We continue to optimize our brick-and-mortar presence, including announcing the closure of our Heritage retail business in mid-2021. We will continue to review our footprint and what our footprint looks like post COVID in our owned and operated network and through our wholesale partners. We are focused on every expense line item, including our previously announced headcount reductions in North America, and we will continue to evaluate further measures as we go forward.  
We managed our inventories prudently while also increasing our inventory buys towards the comfort and casual products that are working exceedingly well with consumers right now. 
And lastly, we were opportunistic in the capital markets in early July and efficiently raised additional capital to further support our already strong financial and liquidity position. We are confident that these actions will position us well to navigate the COVID-19 pandemic and emerge as a stronger organization.  
Turning to our second quarter performance. While our second quarter results continue to reflect a significant disruption from the COVID-19 pandemic, they exceeded our expectations both from a top and bottom line perspective. Our revenues declined 33% to $1.6 billion as our owned stores and wholesale partner stores were closed for about 1 month on average during the quarter and our stores are operating at significantly reduced hours and occupancy levels. We experienced better-than-expected performance across all markets and channels as the casual brand lifestyles that Calvin and Tommy represent were even more relevant with our consumers spending more time at home. 
Digital continues to outperform, with total digital sales up 50%, including almost 90% growth in our owned commerce sites. We continue to believe that digital sales can reach 20% of our sales in the next couple of years while also contributing favorably to profits.  
In our stores, while traffic was down, particularly in international tourist locations in North America, our conversion was very strong. Gross margins were up 80 basis points driven by the mix shift benefit to our international markets as well as more favorable markdown rates compared to what our expectations have been.  
As we expected, our SG&A deleveraged versus last year. However, there was a significant sequential improvement versus the first quarter due to the higher revenue base as well as the full quarterly benefit of our cost initiatives. All in all, we were quite pleased with our second quarter results, with us delivering EPS of $0.13 a share.  
Before I pass things over to Stefan, I'd like to address how we are approaching the second half of the year particularly holiday. This will clearly be a unique holiday season, and we are highly strategic in our approach to be competitive and gain share during this period. We are also being conservative in our sales outlook for the fourth quarter given all the uncertainties resulting from the potential impact from the COVID-19 virus. We believe we are in an excellent position given our inventory position and our sourcing base to be able to meet any sales demand that comes that will be over our expectations.  
While our brands and positioning are strong, we expect that the second half of the year will present itself with a fair amount of volatility, especially if COVID-19 cases resurge. Our assortments will be focused on relevant categories, and we are in a position to chase inventory if better-than-expected demand materializes. We expect that brick-and-mortar traffic will remain under pressure and are looking into creative ways to work around that while also driving people into our stores.  
We will be redirecting resources to digital to support strong growth on our own sites as well as our pure-play partners and other wholesale partners online. From a regional standpoint, we expect to see continued outperformance in our international businesses. China continues to gain momentum for both Calvin and Tommy. And we are pleased to see positive growth in the region, reflecting our brand health and successful consumer engagement initiatives.  
Europe, which has been our strongest market over the past few years, continues to demonstrate a strong recovery. And we believe that we can continue to gain market share for holiday with our best seller capsules planned and leverage our compelling brand propositions. We expect that most -- the most pressure to continue to be felt in our North America businesses for several well-telegraphed reasons. 
First, the resurgence of COVID-19 cases in states significantly impacting consumer shopping and spending patterns. We expect store traffic will be pressured where the virus resurges. 
Secondly, while back-to-school was never a big business for PVH, it was a traffic driver for outlet centers and department stores that we are not experiencing at the same level this time this year. 
And lastly, international tourist traffic to the United States, which typically represents about 30% to 40% of our revenues, is down over 90% so far this year. And we do not expect it to come back during the second half of 2020.  
That said, the domestic consumer is shopping our stores and is excited and invigorated with our brands. Our efforts for holiday in the U.S. will be focused on engaging with the local consumer in the United States, leading with our Hero products and offering compelling price value propositions. We are also prepared to begin the holiday sales season early, as a number of our retail partners, including Amazon Prime, which will now be held in October instead of its usual timing in the summer, are all beginning the holiday selling at an earlier time.  
Overall, I am opportunistic about the opportunities ahead for PVH, both for the balance of this year and as we look into the next few years. 
We have a very powerful business model led by our incredible people, our iconic global brands and our strong business and financial fundamentals. And I believe these competitive advantages will position us to deliver long-term sustainable growth. 
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Stefan to go into some more detailed business perspective."
296568,684331228,2117963,"PVH Corp., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Sep 03, 2020",2020-09-03,"Earnings Calls","PVH Corp.","Executives","Thank you, Manny, and good morning. Since we spoke last, our focus for our brands and regions in the second quarter has increasingly been to lean into the execution towards an accelerated recovery and in doing that to position our businesses to win with t",1847,"Thank you, Manny, and good morning. Since we spoke last, our focus for our brands and regions in the second quarter has increasingly been to lean into the execution towards an accelerated recovery and in doing that to position our businesses to win with the consumer in the new normal coming out of COVID and to drive sustainable, profitable market share growth.  
Due to the COVID pandemic, just the first quarter, the second quarter and the rest of this year will not look like any other year. Having successfully navigated through the immediate first phase of the crisis, I will now share some key insights on how we grow performance in the second quarter and what our key priorities are to drive towards an accelerated recovery. 
Just like last quarter, Mike will then share more financial details on our second quarter performance and how we are thinking about the second half of the year.  
In the second quarter across the board, as Manny mentioned, we were able to drive a stronger-than-expected recovery both top and bottom line from a number of proactive actions. First, we quickly turn to supercharging e-commerce across owned and operated as well as third-party digital commerce for both pure players and the partner store, dot-com. 
As a result, for the quarter, we grew total digital sales over 50%, including an 87% increase on our owned sites, where new user growth continue to be very strong across all regions particularly within the younger age brackets.  
Next, we continue to increase our focus on driving product relevance, which drove stronger-than-expected demand and margin in key categories. We continue to experience strong performance in casual core essentials within underwear, loungewear and athleisure. We saw favorable pricing power in underwear, and we are chasing inventories to be best positioned to capture demand in the second half.  
We also drove a more effective and interactive consumer engagement. And based on our data insights, we were able to better connect the consumer to the product they're looking for and follow how their shopping patterns have changed across our channels. From an inventory management perspective, as a result of stronger-than-expected sell-throughs of spring/summer 2020 product, we are carrying over less-than-expected product into the spring 2021 season. Our teams are focused on ending the year as clean as possible, and we will continue to liquidate any liable product. 
Lastly, we were successful in taking steps to rightsize our cost structure to better reflect our revenue levels influenced by COVID.  
This include -- this includes our decision to streamline our North America business by reducing 12% of our workforce and closing our heritage retail business in 2021. 
As I provide a regional update, you will see that the recovery continued to be very strong throughout the quarter in both China and Europe. While in North America, even though our digital channels performed very well, we felt increasing pressure towards the end of the quarter particularly the brick-and-mortar channels where we saw virus resurgence, and we have significant exposure to international tourist traffic.  
Let me start with Asia, specifically with China, which is the furthest ahead in terms of the recovery. Our direct-to-consumer sales in China increased double digits in the second quarter. And we continue to experience double-digit growth for the third quarter to date. 
Digital continued to outperform for Asia as a whole, with our owned business up about 75%. We also experienced strong Tmall performance, with new live stream events growing very strong traffic and new customer growth. Our marketing events in China focused on maximizing sales around key consumer moments, including our 618 digital commerce events with Tmall where both brands drove over 80% growth versus last year.  
During the campaign, we performed over 30 live streams and 70% -- 72% of our consumers were new to the brands. Given continued traffic pressure in brick-and-mortar locations, our promotions in that channel focus on driving conversion and basket size while limiting discounts on better-performing products. 
Even though we continue to see virus flare-ups impact our business in Japan, parts of Australia, Hong Kong and now Korea, in the region as a whole, we continue to make good progress towards a continued strong recovery.  
Moving on to Europe where we continue to drive a very strong recovery and we experienced performance trends that were meaningfully above expectations. Our direct-to-consumer sales in Europe were down 10% in the second quarter, which was well above our expectations. 
Digital commerce continued to outperform, with second quarter sales growing nearly 80% year-over-year. The digital growth was driven by higher traffic and conversion, which is driven by strong product and marketing in combination with having the right inventory availability. 
Given our position of brand strength, we narrowed our promotions and managed to maintain similar markdown levels to last year. And while traffic in brick-and-mortar remains challenged, particularly in larger cities, conversion was very strong, and the team continues to find innovative ways to drive traffic into our stores.  
While the virus is seeing some resurgence in Europe, our business in the third quarter-to-date remains very strong, with direct-to-consumer sales tracking mid-single digits. We're also pleased with our spring 2021 order books, which showed a sequential improvement, where both brands are tracking down high single digits versus tracking mid -- down mid-teens in fall 2020. 
Lastly, our North American business felt the most pressure relative to our other regions. Our direct-to-consumer sales in North America were down about 45% in the second quarter and are currently running down in the mid-30s in the third quarter to date.  
Our biggest challenge, as Manny mentioned, is the lack of international tourists, which historically represent 30% to 40% of sales of our business, which is down close to 95%. As we look ahead, we do not anticipate this trend to improve before next year. 
As a reminder, less than 30% of our EBIT was generated from the U.S. in 2019. Despite the challenges with tourism, we are seeing strong engagement with the domestic consumer, however, softer as of late in the virus-surged states.  
We experienced very strong digital demand during the quarter as we drove triple-digit growth for both Calvin and Tommy.com, including many new-to-site consumers. Our business with Amazon was also a highlight as we saw strength in their new soft line sale in June and outstanding growth in new-to-brand consumers, which has continued into the third quarter. 
And as we look to the second half of the year, we will continue to manage our inventories prudently. We will redeploy resources to those areas of the business that are performing, such as digital from a channel perspective and essential casual products from a category perspective.  
As our performance across regions demonstrates, we have taken a very deliberate approach for each brand to get deeper connected with the consumer and enhance our brand positioning to gain profitable market share. 
Now I'd like to share a few brief global brand highlights from the quarter, beginning with Calvin. Calvin Klein's brand health remains very strong, and we continue to see strong consumer interaction across Calvin's social channels with an average follow increase of over 20% year-over-year. We're implementing our evolved brand direction in our products and marketing. And already now, you can see it in how we drive engagement on Instagram and other social platforms and you will see even more of it during the holiday season and the beginning of next year. 
In addition, we took steps to gain greater control of the brand with announcement that we will buy back our European footwear business in spring of 2021, which represents a great opportunity as we leverage our knowledge from Tommy's successful footwear platform.  
And lastly, we announced that Movado, our licensed partner for Tommy Hilfiger, will take over the brand's watches and jewelry license for spring 2022, and we feel optimistic about the partnership and the business potential.  
Moving on to Tommy. Tommy's global momentum continued in the second quarter, with the brand demonstrating strong awareness, visibility and consideration to purchase. We continue to convert new consumers to the brand, including in growth markets like China where our livestreams generated over 60% of sales from first-time buyers. 
In the quarter, we continue to launch limited edition brand collaborations that resonated well with our consumers. We also recently launched Tommy's Make it Possible campaign, which is a bold sustainability program that builds on PVH's forward fashion strategy, which is set to reduce our negative impact to 0, drive positive impact and improve over 1 million lives across our value chain.  
And now to our Heritage business. Our Heritage Brands business was under significant pressure during the second quarter. The casualization trend that's being accelerated by COVID makes working very well for us in Calvin and Tommy. It's working against us in the more formal wear to work product categories within Heritage. Additionally, the mid-tier department store bankruptcies in North America have negatively impacted this business compared to Calvin and Tommy.  
We are addressing the challenges by managing inventory levels more prudently, lowering our cost base and reviewing additional ways to optimize and streamline the business that goes beyond the next year closure of our Heritage Brands retail business. 
And before I hand it over to Mike, I would like to reiterate that we are balancing, driving the business here and now, which starts with, as Manny mentioned in his introduction, having the plans and execution to win with the consumer during the upcoming holiday season. It also includes to making sure that we are focused on driving accelerated recovery coming out of COVID where our main priorities are, first, to continue to drive product strength by focusing on key growth categories and developing strong Hero product franchises, all connecting to where the consumer is going, with special focus on casual essentials and athleisure. 
Next is to further supercharge our e-commerce growth and penetration, while at the same time, evaluating what our optimal brick-and-mortar presence looks like both in our own locations and with our wholesale partners. 
And lastly, we will continue to review our cost base and determine where we can optimize our business model and organizational structure to operate an even leaner and more dynamic organization while also allocating additional resources towards our growth areas. 
Overall, even though we're still in the early days of driving towards an accelerated recovery, as we intensify our focus to build on our core strength and connect them closer to the consumer than any time before, I feel very optimistic about the forward path ahead for PVH. 
Every time we take steps closer to what the consumer wants and needs, we see the positive performance proof points, whether it is in product, marketing or e-commerce distribution. The global brand power of Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger is a core strength, and our diversified multi-region, multi-channel platform positions us to gain market share globally. And we see examples every day that our teams are rising up to the challenge to make it happen. 
And by that, I would like to hand it over to Mike."
296568,684331228,2117963,"PVH Corp., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Sep 03, 2020",2020-09-03,"Earnings Calls","PVH Corp.","Executives","Thanks, Stefan. The comments I'm about to make are based on non-GAAP results and are reconciled in our press release. I'm going to discuss our second quarter 2020 results then move on to the current state of the business and our second half expectations.",960,"Thanks, Stefan. The comments I'm about to make are based on non-GAAP results and are reconciled in our press release. I'm going to discuss our second quarter 2020 results then move on to the current state of the business and our second half expectations. 
While our business continued to be negatively impacted compared to last year by the COVID-19 pandemic, our overall results were an improvement compared to the first quarter and exceeded our expectations. Overall, our reported revenues were down 33%. Tommy Hilfiger revenues were down 28%, with international down 14% and North America down 51%. Calvin Klein revenue was down 32%, with international down 16% and North America down 51%. 
China showed positive year-over-year results in both Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein. Our Heritage revenues were down 51%, which included a 16% decline as a result of the sale of our Speedo business. 
Our stores as well as those of our wholesale partners were temporarily closed during the first month of the quarter. As a result, our revenue in the second quarter reflected a 40% decline in revenue to our wholesale distribution channel and a 24% decline in revenue from our total direct-to-consumer business. That included an 87% increase in sales to our digital commerce businesses driven by strong growth across all brands and all regions. 
While we continue to be negatively impacted by the pandemic, our earnings exceeded our expectations, and our earnings per share was $0.13 on a non-GAAP basis for the second quarter. Our gross margin for the second quarter benefited from a favorable mix of business as our international businesses were a larger portion of our total revenue versus the prior year and generally carry higher gross margins in our North America businesses. 
Additionally, earnings in the second quarter had the benefit of expense reduction initiatives, including salary reductions, temporary furloughs and lower discretionary spending, including marketing, travel, consulting and creative and design costs as well as onetime benefits from COVID-related government payroll subsidy programs in our international jurisdictions and rent abatements where we negotiated with certain of our landlords. 
Full salaries and most furloughed employees were reinstated at the beginning of the third quarter. Partially offsetting these savings were additional expenses associated with the implementation of health and safety measures to protect our associates, customers and business partners. These safety measures are expected to continue, and the cost of them will be greater in the second half of the year. 
Moving on to the current state of the business. Currently, almost all of our stores in the U.S. and around the world are open, although they are operating on reduced hours and reduced occupancy levels. 
Third quarter-to-date for our direct-to-consumer business, we are running down low single digits for total Asia, with China up. We are running up mid-single digits in Europe and down 30 -- about 35% for North America. Our owned and operated digital commerce businesses for the third quarter-to-date have continued to show strong growth. 
Regarding wholesale. Both our traditional and pure-play wholesale customers have seen strength in the digital commerce channel. And this trend has continued into the third quarter, with accounts buying inventory to accommodate the strong trend. However, we expect wholesale accounts to buy conservatively for their store-based businesses through the balance of the year, and the revenue decline in our North America wholesale business will be more significant than in Europe and Asia. The expected revenue decline in North America includes the impact of recent bankruptcies. 
We continue to be proactive in our response to the pandemic with ongoing focus on operational efficiencies and liquidity such as streamlining our North America operations by exiting our Heritage Brands retail business by mid-2021 and reducing our North America workforce by 12%. 
We're tightly managing inventories. They decreased 12% from this time last year. We've reduced inventory commitments, consolidated future season collections and negotiated extended payment terms with suppliers. As of the end of fiscal 2020, we are now projecting to carry approximately $125 million of basic inventory into spring 2021, which is a reduction compared to our prior projection of about $250 million. 
Also during the second quarter, we issued $500 million in 4 5/8% senior notes due for 2025, and we ended the quarter with $2.7 billion of liquidity, including cash of approximately $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion of available borrowings under our revolving credit facilities. 
And now moving on to our expectations for the second half. We expect that our second half revenue and earnings will continue to be negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. We currently expect revenue in the second half to be down 25% versus last year. When we think about gross margin, we expect that our second half gross margin will be relatively flat compared to the first half as we project heavy promotional activity across the industry in order to clear inventory particularly in the United States. 
When we think about second half expenses and when you compare to the second quarter, we expect our expenses as a percentage of revenue to be slightly higher in the second half than in the second quarter. The second quarter expenses benefited from salary reductions, furlough, government payroll subsidy programs and rent abatements, which will not materially continue into the second half. Although in North America, we will continue to have payroll savings as a result of the recently announced reduction in our workforce.
 
We also expect to incur even greater expenses for health and safety measures in the second half as opposed to the second quarter. We are not in a position to issue more detailed guidance at this time due to the uncertainty related to the duration and severity of the pandemic. 
And with that, operator, we'll open it up for questions."

I think, Bob, the fundamental issue in North America is the lack of control of the virus compared to the rest of the world. And I think that's having an impact on consumer spending. So that's consumer spending, particularly in apparel, as it moves forward. 
In addition, I think the fact that we are, as a company, really focused -- a big part of our business is tourism-driven, international tourist, in particular. And that business has all but gone away. And we're anticipating that, that international tourists will not be back in the second half of 2020. So that's where we're seeing the pressure on our owned retail stores, which are anywhere from 30% to 40% of our sales, all driven by international tours. And so that's where I think it is. 
I think the opportunity lies in continuation of some of the trends we've seen, and moving forward, sees a sequential improvement over that as we go forward. And from a bottom line point of view, I think our biggest opportunity is gross margin. We are anticipating highly promotional environment for the third and fourth quarter particularly holiday. And if that were to back off, similar to how we saw in the second quarter where we were much more conservative about markdown rates in our thinking, that wouldn't materialize. So I think there's an opportunity both on the top line, but there's also an opportunity that may be more significant on the gross margin."

And we're also not looking to get ourselves in trouble in categories that are softer in nature. So I think there is opportunity to do better, but it will have to -- the consumer will have to vote as they go forward. And they're being very cautious on open to buy. 
I think you can even see it in a relatively short period of time, when I look at some of my key customers' inventory levels, they've done a good job of getting inventory levels down in a short -- in a really short period of time relative to demand as they've moved into the second half of the year. So I think there is opportunity if business backs up. 
I just would want to remind everybody that, for us, the U.S. wholesale, we have no account that represents close to 5% of our total sales as a company.

We're making those, I don't want to call them debt, but we're making those investments as we go forward and continually adjust our supply chain as we move forward. But I also don't want to kid anyone. Look, you've heard the disruptions that are going on in supply, the issues with China and the U.S., even if we're not sourcing directly from China, getting raw materials out of China like cotton and other categories. It's a bit of a puzzle. 
But I think given our -- it's an area of expertise with PVH. It's is an area where we have great capabilities.

But Tommy is probably, as a brand, much more of a casual brand, much more of an active brand. So our sportswear there really transcends that and works extremely well for us. Tommy has always had a big jeans component to their sportswear business, almost a similar size to where Calvin is. 
So both brands, I think, are in a strong position. Calvin does, by the nature of its brand, just have this huge designer underwear and women's intimate business. Tommy's business is probably about 1/3 of the size, still very soft and substantial. But I think the 2 brands really are able to take advantage of the -- you're talking about 2 of the probably top 5 brands by size in the world.

If that's the case, then we'll do better on the gross margin. I think that's a potential big opportunity for a second half of the year. And the key will be how much goods are out there that need to be cleared from a fashion point of view or whatever. We don't see any real buildup. 
As Mike talked about, we were planning to carry out as much as $250 million of goods. That number has already been cut in half. And it factored into all of our second quarter numbers and into third quarter numbers. And I think we'll continue to get that number down compared to where we originally thought.

Good morning, everyone. Joining me on the call are Stefan Larsson, our President; Mike Shaffer, our Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer; and Dana Perlman, Treasurer and Senior Vice President, Business Development and Investor Relations.  
I want to thank you all for joining us on the second quarter earnings call and also hope that you and your families are healthy and safe. Our better-than-expected results reflect the hard work, determination and flexibility of our talented associates across the world, and I can express how grateful I am for their determination and dedication.  
I would like to specifically acknowledge the incredible efforts from our store and distribution center associates who are on the frontline and have kept our businesses running over the last couple of quarters despite the challenging times and unconventional working dynamics. 
The current backdrop has changed how we will all live probably forever from the COVID-19 pandemic and its impacts to our everyday lives and to the social issues that we are embracing to drive positive changes across our communities. 
We continue to live by our purpose, which is to drive fashion forward for good. One of our most noteworthy recent announcements was the hiring of our first ever chief diversity officer last month. Together with our expanded inclusion and diversity team, we believe that we can continue to accelerate our work to create an inclusive environment where every individual is valued and every voice is heard. We also took key actions to evolve our business and drive an accelerated recovery.  
We accelerated our digital agenda and reallocated additional resources to drive growth in this critically important channel. We continue to optimize our brick-and-mortar presence, including announcing the closure of our Heritage retail business in mid-2021. We will continue to review our footprint and what our footprint looks like post COVID in our owned and operated network and through our wholesale partners. We are focused on every expense line item, including our previously announced headcount reductions in North America, and we will continue to evaluate further measures as we go forward.  
We managed our inventories prudently while also increasing our inventory buys towards the comfort and casual products that are working exceedingly well with consumers right now. 
And lastly, we were opportunistic in the capital markets in early July and efficiently raised additional capital to further support our already strong financial and liquidity position. We are confident that these actions will position us well to navigate the COVID-19 pandemic and emerge as a stronger organization.  
Turning to our second quarter performance. While our second quarter results continue to reflect a significant disruption from the COVID-19 pandemic, they exceeded our expectations both from a top and bottom line perspective. Our revenues declined 33% to $1.6 billion as our owned stores and wholesale partner stores were closed for about 1 month on average during the quarter and our stores are operating at significantly reduced hours and occupancy levels. We experienced better-than-expected performance across all markets and channels as the casual brand lifestyles that Calvin and Tommy represent were even more relevant with our consumers spending more time at home. 
Digital continues to outperform, with total digital sales up 50%, including almost 90% growth in our owned commerce sites. We continue to believe that digital sales can reach 20% of our sales in the next couple of years while also contributing favorably to profits.  
In our stores, while traffic was down, particularly in international tourist locations in North America, our conversion was very strong. Gross margins were up 80 basis points driven by the mix shift benefit to our international markets as well as more favorable markdown rates compared to what our expectations have been.  
As we expected, our SG&A deleveraged versus last year. However, there was a significant sequential improvement versus the first quarter due to the higher revenue base as well as the full quarterly benefit of our cost initiatives. All in all, we were quite pleased with our second quarter results, with us delivering EPS of $0.13 a share.  
Before I pass things over to Stefan, I'd like to address how we are approaching the second half of the year particularly holiday. This will clearly be a unique holiday season, and we are highly strategic in our approach to be competitive and gain share during this period. We are also being conservative in our sales outlook for the fourth quarter given all the uncertainties resulting from the potential impact from the COVID-19 virus. We believe we are in an excellent position given our inventory position and our sourcing base to be able to meet any sales demand that comes that will be over our expectations.  
While our brands and positioning are strong, we expect that the second half of the year will present itself with a fair amount of volatility, especially if COVID-19 cases resurge. Our assortments will be focused on relevant categories, and we are in a position to chase inventory if better-than-expected demand materializes. We expect that brick-and-mortar traffic will remain under pressure and are looking into creative ways to work around that while also driving people into our stores.  
We will be redirecting resources to digital to support strong growth on our own sites as well as our pure-play partners and other wholesale partners online. From a regional standpoint, we expect to see continued outperformance in our international businesses. China continues to gain momentum for both Calvin and Tommy. And we are pleased to see positive growth in the region, reflecting our brand health and successful consumer engagement initiatives.  
Europe, which has been our strongest market over the past few years, continues to demonstrate a strong recovery. And we believe that we can continue to gain market share for holiday with our best seller capsules planned and leverage our compelling brand propositions. We expect that most -- the most pressure to continue to be felt in our North America businesses for several well-telegraphed reasons. 
First, the resurgence of COVID-19 cases in states significantly impacting consumer shopping and spending patterns. We expect store traffic will be pressured where the virus resurges. 
Secondly, while back-to-school was never a big business for PVH, it was a traffic driver for outlet centers and department stores that we are not experiencing at the same level this time this year. 
And lastly, international tourist traffic to the United States, which typically represents about 30% to 40% of our revenues, is down over 90% so far this year. And we do not expect it to come back during the second half of 2020.  
That said, the domestic consumer is shopping our stores and is excited and invigorated with our brands. Our efforts for holiday in the U.S. will be focused on engaging with the local consumer in the United States, leading with our Hero products and offering compelling price value propositions. We are also prepared to begin the holiday sales season early, as a number of our retail partners, including Amazon Prime, which will now be held in October instead of its usual timing in the summer, are all beginning the holiday selling at an earlier time.  
Overall, I am opportunistic about the opportunities ahead for PVH, both for the balance of this year and as we look into the next few years. 
We have a very powerful business model led by our incredible people, our iconic global brands and our strong business and financial fundamentals. And I believe these competitive advantages will position us to deliver long-term sustainable growth. 
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Stefan to go into some more detailed business perspective."

Since we spoke last, our focus for our brands and regions in the second quarter has increasingly been to lean into the execution towards an accelerated recovery and in doing that to position our businesses to win with t",1847,"Thank you, Manny, and good morning. Since we spoke last, our focus for our brands and regions in the second quarter has increasingly been to lean into the execution towards an accelerated recovery and in doing that to position our businesses to win with the consumer in the new normal coming out of COVID and to drive sustainable, profitable market share growth.  
Due to the COVID pandemic, just the first quarter, the second quarter and the rest of this year will not look like any other year. Having successfully navigated through the immediate first phase of the crisis, I will now share some key insights on how we grow performance in the second quarter and what our key priorities are to drive towards an accelerated recovery. 
Just like last quarter, Mike will then share more financial details on our second quarter performance and how we are thinking about the second half of the year.  
In the second quarter across the board, as Manny mentioned, we were able to drive a stronger-than-expected recovery both top and bottom line from a number of proactive actions. First, we quickly turn to supercharging e-commerce across owned and operated as well as third-party digital commerce for both pure players and the partner store, dot-com. 
As a result, for the quarter, we grew total digital sales over 50%, including an 87% increase on our owned sites, where new user growth continue to be very strong across all regions particularly within the younger age brackets.  
Next, we continue to increase our focus on driving product relevance, which drove stronger-than-expected demand and margin in key categories. We continue to experience strong performance in casual core essentials within underwear, loungewear and athleisure. We saw favorable pricing power in underwear, and we are chasing inventories to be best positioned to capture demand in the second half.  
We also drove a more effective and interactive consumer engagement. And based on our data insights, we were able to better connect the consumer to the product they're looking for and follow how their shopping patterns have changed across our channels. From an inventory management perspective, as a result of stronger-than-expected sell-throughs of spring/summer 2020 product, we are carrying over less-than-expected product into the spring 2021 season. Our teams are focused on ending the year as clean as possible, and we will continue to liquidate any liable product. 
Lastly, we were successful in taking steps to rightsize our cost structure to better reflect our revenue levels influenced by COVID.  
This include -- this includes our decision to streamline our North America business by reducing 12% of our workforce and closing our heritage retail business in 2021. 
As I provide a regional update, you will see that the recovery continued to be very strong throughout the quarter in both China and Europe. While in North America, even though our digital channels performed very well, we felt increasing pressure towards the end of the quarter particularly the brick-and-mortar channels where we saw virus resurgence, and we have significant exposure to international tourist traffic.  
Let me start with Asia, specifically with China, which is the furthest ahead in terms of the recovery. Our direct-to-consumer sales in China increased double digits in the second quarter. And we continue to experience double-digit growth for the third quarter to date. 
Digital continued to outperform for Asia as a whole, with our owned business up about 75%. We also experienced strong Tmall performance, with new live stream events growing very strong traffic and new customer growth. Our marketing events in China focused on maximizing sales around key consumer moments, including our 618 digital commerce events with Tmall where both brands drove over 80% growth versus last year.  
During the campaign, we performed over 30 live streams and 70% -- 72% of our consumers were new to the brands. Given continued traffic pressure in brick-and-mortar locations, our promotions in that channel focus on driving conversion and basket size while limiting discounts on better-performing products. 
Even though we continue to see virus flare-ups impact our business in Japan, parts of Australia, Hong Kong and now Korea, in the region as a whole, we continue to make good progress towards a continued strong recovery.  
Moving on to Europe where we continue to drive a very strong recovery and we experienced performance trends that were meaningfully above expectations. Our direct-to-consumer sales in Europe were down 10% in the second quarter, which was well above our expectations. 
Digital commerce continued to outperform, with second quarter sales growing nearly 80% year-over-year. The digital growth was driven by higher traffic and conversion, which is driven by strong product and marketing in combination with having the right inventory availability. 
Given our position of brand strength, we narrowed our promotions and managed to maintain similar markdown levels to last year. And while traffic in brick-and-mortar remains challenged, particularly in larger cities, conversion was very strong, and the team continues to find innovative ways to drive traffic into our stores.  
While the virus is seeing some resurgence in Europe, our business in the third quarter-to-date remains very strong, with direct-to-consumer sales tracking mid-single digits. We're also pleased with our spring 2021 order books, which showed a sequential improvement, where both brands are tracking down high single digits versus tracking mid -- down mid-teens in fall 2020. 
Lastly, our North American business felt the most pressure relative to our other regions. Our direct-to-consumer sales in North America were down about 45% in the second quarter and are currently running down in the mid-30s in the third quarter to date.  
Our biggest challenge, as Manny mentioned, is the lack of international tourists, which historically represent 30% to 40% of sales of our business, which is down close to 95%. As we look ahead, we do not anticipate this trend to improve before next year. 
As a reminder, less than 30% of our EBIT was generated from the U.S. in 2019. Despite the challenges with tourism, we are seeing strong engagement with the domestic consumer, however, softer as of late in the virus-surged states.  
We experienced very strong digital demand during the quarter as we drove triple-digit growth for both Calvin and Tommy.com, including many new-to-site consumers. Our business with Amazon was also a highlight as we saw strength in their new soft line sale in June and outstanding growth in new-to-brand consumers, which has continued into the third quarter. 
And as we look to the second half of the year, we will continue to manage our inventories prudently. We will redeploy resources to those areas of the business that are performing, such as digital from a channel perspective and essential casual products from a category perspective.  
As our performance across regions demonstrates, we have taken a very deliberate approach for each brand to get deeper connected with the consumer and enhance our brand positioning to gain profitable market share. 
Now I'd like to share a few brief global brand highlights from the quarter, beginning with Calvin. Calvin Klein's brand health remains very strong, and we continue to see strong consumer interaction across Calvin's social channels with an average follow increase of over 20% year-over-year. We're implementing our evolved brand direction in our products and marketing. And already now, you can see it in how we drive engagement on Instagram and other social platforms and you will see even more of it during the holiday season and the beginning of next year. 
In addition, we took steps to gain greater control of the brand with announcement that we will buy back our European footwear business in spring of 2021, which represents a great opportunity as we leverage our knowledge from Tommy's successful footwear platform.  
And lastly, we announced that Movado, our licensed partner for Tommy Hilfiger, will take over the brand's watches and jewelry license for spring 2022, and we feel optimistic about the partnership and the business potential.  
Moving on to Tommy. Tommy's global momentum continued in the second quarter, with the brand demonstrating strong awareness, visibility and consideration to purchase. We continue to convert new consumers to the brand, including in growth markets like China where our livestreams generated over 60% of sales from first-time buyers. 
In the quarter, we continue to launch limited edition brand collaborations that resonated well with our consumers. We also recently launched Tommy's Make it Possible campaign, which is a bold sustainability program that builds on PVH's forward fashion strategy, which is set to reduce our negative impact to 0, drive positive impact and improve over 1 million lives across our value chain.  
And now to our Heritage business. Our Heritage Brands business was under significant pressure during the second quarter. The casualization trend that's being accelerated by COVID makes working very well for us in Calvin and Tommy. It's working against us in the more formal wear to work product categories within Heritage. Additionally, the mid-tier department store bankruptcies in North America have negatively impacted this business compared to Calvin and Tommy.  
We are addressing the challenges by managing inventory levels more prudently, lowering our cost base and reviewing additional ways to optimize and streamline the business that goes beyond the next year closure of our Heritage Brands retail business. 
And before I hand it over to Mike, I would like to reiterate that we are balancing, driving the business here and now, which starts with, as Manny mentioned in his introduction, having the plans and execution to win with the consumer during the upcoming holiday season. It also includes to making sure that we are focused on driving accelerated recovery coming out of COVID where our main priorities are, first, to continue to drive product strength by focusing on key growth categories and developing strong Hero product franchises, all connecting to where the consumer is going, with special focus on casual essentials and athleisure. 
Next is to further supercharge our e-commerce growth and penetration, while at the same time, evaluating what our optimal brick-and-mortar presence looks like both in our own locations and with our wholesale partners. 
And lastly, we will continue to review our cost base and determine where we can optimize our business model and organizational structure to operate an even leaner and more dynamic organization while also allocating additional resources towards our growth areas. 
Overall, even though we're still in the early days of driving towards an accelerated recovery, as we intensify our focus to build on our core strength and connect them closer to the consumer than any time before, I feel very optimistic about the forward path ahead for PVH. 
Every time we take steps closer to what the consumer wants and needs, we see the positive performance proof points, whether it is in product, marketing or e-commerce distribution. The global brand power of Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger is a core strength, and our diversified multi-region, multi-channel platform positions us to gain market share globally. And we see examples every day that our teams are rising up to the challenge to make it happen. 
And by that, I would like to hand it over to Mike."
296568,684331228,2117967,"PVH Corp., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Sep 03, 2020",2020-09-03,"Earnings Calls","PVH Corp.","Executives","Thanks, Stefan. The comments I'm about to make are based on non-GAAP results and are reconciled in our press release. I'm going to discuss our second quarter 2020 results then move on to the current state of the business and our second half expectations.",960,"Thanks, Stefan. The comments I'm about to make are based on non-GAAP results and are reconciled in our press release. I'm going to discuss our second quarter 2020 results then move on to the current state of the business and our second half expectations. 
While our business continued to be negatively impacted compared to last year by the COVID-19 pandemic, our overall results were an improvement compared to the first quarter and exceeded our expectations. Overall, our reported revenues were down 33%. Tommy Hilfiger revenues were down 28%, with international down 14% and North America down 51%. Calvin Klein revenue was down 32%, with international down 16% and North America down 51%. 
China showed positive year-over-year results in both Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein. Our Heritage revenues were down 51%, which included a 16% decline as a result of the sale of our Speedo business. 
Our stores as well as those of our wholesale partners were temporarily closed during the first month of the quarter. As a result, our revenue in the second quarter reflected a 40% decline in revenue to our wholesale distribution channel and a 24% decline in revenue from our total direct-to-consumer business. That included an 87% increase in sales to our digital commerce businesses driven by strong growth across all brands and all regions. 
While we continue to be negatively impacted by the pandemic, our earnings exceeded our expectations, and our earnings per share was $0.13 on a non-GAAP basis for the second quarter. Our gross margin for the second quarter benefited from a favorable mix of business as our international businesses were a larger portion of our total revenue versus the prior year and generally carry higher gross margins in our North America businesses. 
Additionally, earnings in the second quarter had the benefit of expense reduction initiatives, including salary reductions, temporary furloughs and lower discretionary spending, including marketing, travel, consulting and creative and design costs as well as onetime benefits from COVID-related government payroll subsidy programs in our international jurisdictions and rent abatements where we negotiated with certain of our landlords. 
Full salaries and most furloughed employees were reinstated at the beginning of the third quarter. Partially offsetting these savings were additional expenses associated with the implementation of health and safety measures to protect our associates, customers and business partners. These safety measures are expected to continue, and the cost of them will be greater in the second half of the year. 
Moving on to the current state of the business. Currently, almost all of our stores in the U.S. and around the world are open, although they are operating on reduced hours and reduced occupancy levels. 
Third quarter-to-date for our direct-to-consumer business, we are running down low single digits for total Asia, with China up. We are running up mid-single digits in Europe and down 30 -- about 35% for North America. Our owned and operated digital commerce businesses for the third quarter-to-date have continued to show strong growth. 
Regarding wholesale. Both our traditional and pure-play wholesale customers have seen strength in the digital commerce channel. And this trend has continued into the third quarter, with accounts buying inventory to accommodate the strong trend. However, we expect wholesale accounts to buy conservatively for their store-based businesses through the balance of the year, and the revenue decline in our North America wholesale business will be more significant than in Europe and Asia. The expected revenue decline in North America includes the impact of recent bankruptcies. 
We continue to be proactive in our response to the pandemic with ongoing focus on operational efficiencies and liquidity such as streamlining our North America operations by exiting our Heritage Brands retail business by mid-2021 and reducing our North America workforce by 12%. 
We're tightly managing inventories. They decreased 12% from this time last year. We've reduced inventory commitments, consolidated future season collections and negotiated extended payment terms with suppliers. As of the end of fiscal 2020, we are now projecting to carry approximately $125 million of basic inventory into spring 2021, which is a reduction compared to our prior projection of about $250 million. 
Also during the second quarter, we issued $500 million in 4 5/8% senior notes due for 2025, and we ended the quarter with $2.7 billion of liquidity, including cash of approximately $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion of available borrowings under our revolving credit facilities. 
And now moving on to our expectations for the second half. We expect that our second half revenue and earnings will continue to be negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. We currently expect revenue in the second half to be down 25% versus last year. When we think about gross margin, we expect that our second half gross margin will be relatively flat compared to the first half as we project heavy promotional activity across the industry in order to clear inventory particularly in the United States. 
When we think about second half expenses and when you compare to the second quarter, we expect our expenses as a percentage of revenue to be slightly higher in the second half than in the second quarter. The second quarter expenses benefited from salary reductions, furlough, government payroll subsidy programs and rent abatements, which will not materially continue into the second half. Although in North America, we will continue to have payroll savings as a result of the recently announced reduction in our workforce.
 
We also expect to incur even greater expenses for health and safety measures in the second half as opposed to the second quarter. We are not in a position to issue more detailed guidance at this time due to the uncertainty related to the duration and severity of the pandemic. 
And with that, operator, we'll open it up for questions."

I think, Bob, the fundamental issue in North America is the lack of control of the virus compared to the rest of the world. And I think that's having an impact on consumer spending. So that's consumer spending, particularly in apparel, as it moves forward. 
In addition, I think the fact that we are, as a company, really focused -- a big part of our business is tourism-driven, international tourist, in particular. And that business has all but gone away. And we're anticipating that, that international tourists will not be back in the second half of 2020. So that's where we're seeing the pressure on our owned retail stores, which are anywhere from 30% to 40% of our sales, all driven by international tours. And so that's where I think it is. 
I think the opportunity lies in continuation of some of the trends we've seen, and moving forward, sees a sequential improvement over that as we go forward. And from a bottom line point of view, I think our biggest opportunity is gross margin. We are anticipating highly promotional environment for the third and fourth quarter particularly holiday. And if that were to back off, similar to how we saw in the second quarter where we were much more conservative about markdown rates in our thinking, that wouldn't materialize. So I think there's an opportunity both on the top line, but there's also an opportunity that may be more significant on the gross margin."

And we're also not looking to get ourselves in trouble in categories that are softer in nature. So I think there is opportunity to do better, but it will have to -- the consumer will have to vote as they go forward. And they're being very cautious on open to buy. 
I think you can even see it in a relatively short period of time, when I look at some of my key customers' inventory levels, they've done a good job of getting inventory levels down in a short -- in a really short period of time relative to demand as they've moved into the second half of the year. So I think there is opportunity if business backs up. 
I just would want to remind everybody that, for us, the U.S. wholesale, we have no account that represents close to 5% of our total sales as a company.

But Tommy is probably, as a brand, much more of a casual brand, much more of an active brand. So our sportswear there really transcends that and works extremely well for us. Tommy has always had a big jeans component to their sportswear business, almost a similar size to where Calvin is. 
So both brands, I think, are in a strong position. Calvin does, by the nature of its brand, just have this huge designer underwear and women's intimate business. Tommy's business is probably about 1/3 of the size, still very soft and substantial. But I think the 2 brands really are able to take advantage of the -- you're talking about 2 of the probably top 5 brands by size in the world.

As Mike talked about, we were planning to carry out as much as $250 million of goods. That number has already been cut in half.

And right now, I think we talked about, I think, both Stefan and Mike mentioned that our direct-to-consumer business globally is running about -- is down 15%, which is running ahead of where we would have planned the business at this point. So we haven't seen anything that discourages us at all and actually creates a lot of opportunity."

Joining me on the call this morning is Stefan Larsson, our President; Mike Shaffer, our Chief Operating Officer and CFO; and Dana Perlman, our Head of Treasury and Senior Vice President, Business Development and Investor",933,"Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Joining me on the call this morning is Stefan Larsson, our President; Mike Shaffer, our Chief Operating Officer and CFO; and Dana Perlman, our Head of Treasury and Senior Vice President, Business Development and Investor Relations. 
First of all, I'd like to thank you all for joining us for the third quarter call. It's hard to believe that this is the third earnings call since the pandemic started, and our associates in certain parts of the world have been working remotely for over 9 months now. 
I would truly like to thank all our associates for their hard work and flexibility, in particular, our dedicated retail store and distribution center associates who have manage to keep running our business as usual despite the backdrop, which is far from normal. 
Our third quarter results were very strong, and we significantly outperformed our top and bottom line expectations across all markets and channels despite the challenging environment. 
I'm also very pleased to note that our fourth quarter is off to a very strong start as we are outperforming our plans for our global holiday kickoff events, including Singles Day in Asia; and Black Friday, which is now being observed in many markets outside the U.S. And we feel great about the momentum behind our brands. 
There is clearly an unprecedented amount of change happening in the apparel industry, which the pandemic has only accelerated. To navigate this backdrop, our teams have been evolving our business model to compete in the new world of retail, and in particular, capture the younger consumer generation while continuing to serve our core consumer. 
We also addressed near-term challenges which are -- with a long-term approach to drive sustainable, profitable growth, including some difficult business decisions as we recognize the need to adapt quickly to the realities that COVID-19 is presenting to us with. 
In this context, we have been accelerating our digital agenda and reallocating additional resources to drive growth in this highly important channel. We are seeing strong revenue growth and are pleased that our EBIT margins for our owned digital business are in line with those of our overall business, which, as we continue to scale the business, should continue to improve. We also continue to evolve our business towards the comfort and casual categories that are working with the consumer today, especially the younger generations. 
And lastly, we continue to pivot towards our international businesses, where we continue to see a very significant revenue opportunity for both our Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger businesses while also contributing a higher overall operating margin. We believe that our focus on these aspects of the business will drive long-term revenue and margin growth for our stockholders driven by gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage. Stefan and Mike will get into the specifics of the third quarter as well as the current fourth quarter sales and margin trends, which are all very positive. 
I'm also extremely pleased with the tremendous liquidity that we have in place in order to expand any potential disruption from the pandemic. We are cautiously optimistic about this year's unique holiday season. Clearly, the shift to digital is the narrative for this holiday season. And we have positioned our business to succeed in this context with strong digital advance planned, inventory investments to fuel the demand in the channel and adjustments to the in-store experience to adapt to the capacity constraints in stores. 
We believe that we are positioned to capture market share for holiday while also selling through any carryover inventories. We'll continue to monitor how the virus ebbs and flows as well as its impact on our business. 
Before I pass things over to Stefan, I'd like to just acknowledge what a privilege it has been to lead PVH as CEO for the last 15 years. I truly want to thank the PVH Board and all our amazing associates worldwide for all their contributions, and most importantly, their partnership and support. I'm quite amazed at how PVH has grown and transformed during my 15-year career at PVH. We've evolved from over -- from a North America-based dress shirt business with sales of $1.5 billion to a portfolio of global iconic brands with about 70% of our EBIT coming from outside the U.S., over 40,000 associates employed worldwide and close to $10 billion in revenues last year. We've also developed one of the industry's leading corporate responsibility platforms. And our vision to drive fashion forward for good motivates and guides the way we operate our business every day. 
In my new role as Chairman, I look forward to seeing PVH continue to drive this vision forward and deliver the company's next chapter of growth and profit recovery. I have great confidence in Stefan as he assumes the role of CEO in February. His global experience, consumer focus and high-performance track record, especially in this unprecedented time of disruption, are tremendous assets for PVH. 
As Stefan continues to partner with our incredible team of senior leaders, many that have been here for over a decade, I believe that their expertise and collective knowledge of our industry and consumer base will help maximize the growth potential for PVH. 
Overall, I'm very optimistic about future opportunities ahead for PVH. We have unique competitive advantages: our incredible people, our iconic global brands and our strong financial and operating fundamentals, which I believe will position us to continue to deliver sustainable long-term growth for all of our stakeholders. 
With that, I turn it over to Stefan for comments about the quarter and the fourth quarter."

First, let me start by saying that I'm deeply honored and humbled by the opportunity to succeed Manny in the CEO role for this great company. And I would like to thank Manny and the Board for their confidence",2156,"Thank you, Manny, and good morning, everyone. First, let me start by saying that I'm deeply honored and humbled by the opportunity to succeed Manny in the CEO role for this great company. And I would like to thank Manny and the Board for their confidence and trust in me as well as for a very strong partnership. Manny is one of the few iconic leaders of our industry. And having had the opportunity to work side by side with him over the last 1.5 years has given me unique insights into how he and our team over the last 15 years have built PVH into one of the largest apparel groups in the world. 
My focus will be to build on the core strengths that brought us here and connecting them closer to where the consumer is going than any time before, which will form the foundation to successfully deliver our next chapter of growth. And coming in as the CEO, I will continue to build up on the people-first values Manny has instilled in PVH. 
With the critical start of the holiday season now underway, our teams have been doing a great job in pivoting to optimizing our consumer offering to this very different kind of environment. We're supercharging digital and our omnichannel capabilities. And leaning into our casual essential products led to our strongest-ever digital holiday sales results and an above-planned performance for the initial holiday period overall. 
Our strong execution, including our events for Amazon Prime Day, Singles Day and Black Friday in Asia, Europe and North America, reflects the hard work and flexibility of our talented teams around the world. And I would like to thank everyone for their critical contributions. 
I will now share some key insights on how we drove performance in the third quarter and fourth quarter to date. And as Manny mentioned, Mike will then share more financial details and current trends. 
The focus for our brands and regions has remained to successfully navigate through the pandemic, capture market share in the holiday period and selling through seasonal inventory to enter spring 2021 with a clean inventory position. In parallel to the focus on driving the business here and now, we continue to lean in to drive an accelerated recovery to win with the consumer coming out of COVID. 
I'd like to start by sharing some proof points, demonstrating our progress against 3 value-creating areas that we outlined last quarter. First, we continue to supercharge the e-commerce channel through our owned and operated as well as third-party digital partners. As a result, for the quarter, we grew total digital sales by 36%, including 70% growth on our own sites. We are seeing strong new user growth, particularly with the younger consumers, as we expanded our casual assortments and offered digital innovations such as live streams and targeted activations with the pure players. 
Improved in-stock levels and enhancement to our own sites are also resonating well, including ship-from-store and additional payment options, which are all important to attract and convert the younger consumers. 
Next, we continue to increase our focus on driving product relevance, which led to stronger-than-expected demand and margin in our key cash flow categories. Within these categories -- key categories, we increased our focus on the essential products that have the highest demand. And at the same time, we rationalized unproductive SKUs, resulting in higher AURs in many of our most important products. 
Lastly, we are realizing the savings from our recent workforce reductions in North America, and we continue to evaluate further measures to drive cost efficiencies across the company. While our regions are all in various stages of their recovery, these focus areas continue to guide our teams with clear objectives to operate against to drive an accelerated recovery. 
As I provide a regional update, you will see that the third quarter operating environment had stores open for the majority of the quarter. However, in late October, the virus resurgence intensified, resulting in temporary store closures in Europe and further weakening of our store traffic in North America. 
Let me start with Asia, specifically with China. Overall, China remains the furthest ahead in terms of the recovery, with sales up 6% in the quarter -- in the third quarter and total digital sales up 63% as well as improving traffic in our brick-and-mortar stores. Our teams in Asia has been doing a great job planning and executing the back half of this year. They have supercharged e-commerce, leaned into our big cash flow categories, the most relevant casual and athleisure products, and based on our selling trends, cut many unproductive styles, all leading to improved sell-throughs and markdown rates. They have also been effective with their brand marketing and consumer engagement. 
During the third quarter, we experienced very strong performance in China during Golden Week. And we were also pleased with the start of the fourth quarter, including Singles Day sales, which now spans several weeks, where we grew over 50% on Tmall and drove positive comp store sales in our brick-and-mortar stores at the same time, all with increased pricing power. 
Our strong execution, including live streaming activations with top Chinese live streamer Viya, resulted in market share gains against the competition, with Tommy's ranking in Tmall flagship store rising 14 places. 
And lastly, our marketing activations resonated very well with the consumer, including Calvin's virtual event with Ambassador Lay Zhang, which we live streamed from our Shanghai Danine store, resulting in plus-48% growth that day on Tmall and 2.6 million views on Weibo. 
Overall, while there has been some infection resurgence in Japan and parts of Southeast Asia, we continue to make good progress towards a continued strong recovery in the region as a whole driven largely by China and digital strength. 
Moving on to Europe. Our business across both brands outperformed despite the tough backdrop, with revenues declining only 4% versus last year in local currency. Just like in Asia, our management team in Europe has been very effective in taking sustainable, profitable market share in a very difficult environment. We drove a very strong recovery for the majority of the quarter, including in our brick-and-mortar stores. However, since late October, we have been negatively affected by the resurgence of the virus with an increasing number of lockdowns imposed towards the end of the quarter. 
Overall, strong brand, product and channel execution drove higher consumer and retailer demand for our Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein products to the point where we were chasing goods in select categories to fuel the consumer demand while also achieving strong margins. Our well-developed, scalable digital distribution network continues to be a real competitive advantage. We grew total digital sales by 33% as we continue to post outside growth through our owned and operated sites as well as through our partnerships with Zalando, ASOS and About You. 
With approximately 40% of our stores temporarily closed in Europe during November, we quickly pivoted our operations to best leverage our digital distribution network. And we're also able to leverage our connected store inventory to meet the stronger-than-expected inventory demand online. In recent weeks, the lockdowns have started to ease, and we expect all doors to be opened within the next 10 days, assuming no further government restrictions. 
We feel very good about our future order book, where spring and summer order books actualized up high single digits versus last year. And the first indication for pre-fall 2021 are very positive. All these factors make us have great confidence in our ability to continue to gain market share in Europe. 
Lastly, we our North American business continued to feel the most pressure relative to our other regions driven by a combination of the lack of international tourism, increasing resurgence of the virus across the region and bigger dependency on brick-and-mortar than our other regions. Our teams in North America are working very hard in navigating through the COVID-related challenges. While our overall sales in North America declined 38%, digital remained a true highlight with our own sites growing over 100%, enabled by our site enhancements, inventory investments and logistical improvements to fuel demand. 
We had another strong quarter with Amazon, including Calvin and Tommy posting their highest Prime Day sales ever achieved, with a significant increase in new consumers. At the same time, tourism is currently down 95% and not expected to return in a while, presenting a significant challenge for our brick-and-mortar business. 
Losing the tourist business, that's usually 35%, 40% of our total retail business in North America, has put pressure on clearing through inventory, which, in combination with an unusually early start of the holiday season, led us to be more proactive with driving early promotions, moving some of them from Q4 to Q3. Our main focus remains to enter spring clean from an inventory perspective. 
Moving on to our fourth quarter outlook. We have so far performed better than expected over Black Friday week and Cyber Monday across all channels in North America. While we still have significant amount of business ahead of us for holiday, we're expecting the current business trend to continue through the final holiday stretch. 
So looking ahead for North America. Having navigated through the most challenging parts of the pandemic, while the lack of tourism by far is the biggest challenge we are facing, it's clear that we have our own work to do coming out of the pandemic. We will increase our focus on our domestic consumer. We will continue to take on the significant opportunities to further expand our e-commerce business, both our owned and operated and third party. And we will also improve how we plan and buy inventory to demand. 
As our performance across regions demonstrates, we have taken a very deliberate approach for each brand to get even closer to the consumer as we continue to enhance our brand relevance and positioning. I'd like to share a few brief global highlights from the quarter, beginning with Calvin. 
We are seeing Calvin Klein continue to register strong 86% global brand awareness with increasing consumer consideration to purchase across all regions. Our increased focus on creating product consumers' desire was captured through Calvin Klein underwear collaboration with kids, featuring Gigi Hadid, which sold out 75% of the collection in just 4 days, highlighting incredible results with younger consumers, both from an engagement and sales perspective, which we will continue to build upon as we head into 2021. 
Lastly, I'm excited to say that we strengthened Calvin's global brand leadership team during the quarter, announcing our new key hires across design, merchandising and marketing, which will enable the execution in product and marketing of Calvin's evolved brand vision. 
Moving on to Tommy. I'm excited to welcome Avery Baker back to Tommy in a newly established role of President and Chief Brand Officer with global responsibility for the brand's products, marketing and experiences. Avery was the driving force behind many of the brand's transformational programs, including TOMMYNOW and has experience and real strength in connecting the Tommy DNA to culture and what the consumer desires today. 
Tommy also celebrated its 35 anniversary as an iconic brand with global editorial coverage and a brand activation on Tmall. And we continue to see improving global awareness, including in key growth markets like China. The brand also continued to further its sustainability agenda, launching Tommy jeans recycled denim line for fall 2020. 
Finally, to our Heritage business. Our Heritage Brands business continued to be under pressure during the third quarter as the mid-tier department stores experienced traffic challenges, and dress furnishings categories remains under pressure. We are continuing to actively address the business challenges by managing inventory levels aggressively, lowering our cost base and reviewing additional ways to optimize and streamline the business. 
Before I hand it over to Mike, I would like to reiterate that the actions we are taking now to successfully navigate the pandemic and drive an accelerated recovery are also positioning us to win with the consumer coming into a new normal post COVID. The proof points that I just shared with you from our strong digital growth to our increasing brand engagement and enhanced product strategies to our strong performance internationally demonstrate the global brand power behind Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger and the strong relationships that we are building with our consumers, particularly the next generation. 
As we leverage the power of PVH, focusing in on our core strengths and connecting them to where the consumer is going, I'm confident that we will drive brand relevance, cost efficiencies and deliver long-term sustainable growth while driving fashion forward for good. 
Looking ahead, we are working on our long-term plan for PVH's next chapter of growth and we look forward to sharing more details with you at an Investor Day we are planning for mid-2021. 
And by that, I would like to hand it over to Mike."

The comments I'm about to make are based on non-GAAP results and are reconciled in our press release. I'm going to discuss our third quarter 2020 results and move on to the current state of the business and our fourth quarter expectations.",792,"Thanks, Stefan. The comments I'm about to make are based on non-GAAP results and are reconciled in our press release. I'm going to discuss our third quarter 2020 results and move on to the current state of the business and our fourth quarter expectations. 
While our business continued to be negatively impacted compared to last year by COVID-19 pandemic, our overall results were an improvement compared to the second quarter and exceeded our expectations driven by strong outperformance in Europe and China. Overall, our revenue was down 18% as reported and 21% on a constant currency basis from last year. Tommy Hilfiger revenues were down 12% as reported and 16% on a constant currency basis, with international flat as reported and down 6% on a constant currency basis and North America down 37%. 
Calvin Klein revenue was down 18% as reported and 21% on a constant currency basis, with international flat as reported and down 4% on a constant currency basis and North America down 39%. China continued to show positive year-over-year results in both Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein. Our Heritage revenues were down 36%. 
Our third quarter reflected a 22% decline in revenue through our wholesale distribution channel and an 11% decline in revenue from our total direct-to-consumer businesses, including a 70% increase in sales through our digital commerce business, driven by strong growth across all brands and regions. The lack of international tourist traffic coming to the U.S. continues to challenge our North America brick-and-mortar retail business. 
While we continue to be negatively impacted by the pandemic, our earnings exceeded our expectations, and our earnings per share was $1.32 on a non-GAAP basis for the third quarter. Our gross margin reflected heavy promotional selling in the U.S. as we advanced markdowns from the fourth quarter into the third quarter in order to maximize the earlier holiday selling season. 
Inventories ended the quarter down 16% from last year. As of the end of fiscal 2020, we are now projecting to carry approximately $100 million of basic inventory into spring '21, which is a reduction compared to our prior projection of about $125 million. 
Earnings in the third quarter benefited from cost savings resulting from the North America workforce reduction announced in July 2020 and COVID-related government payroll subsidy programs in international jurisdictions as well as reductions in all discretionary spending categories. Partially offsetting these savings were increased ongoing expenses associated with health and safety measures to protect our associates, customers and business partners. These safety measures are expected to continue. 
We ended the quarter with $2.7 billion of liquidity, consisting of approximately $1.5 billion of cash on hand and over $1.2 billion of available borrowings under our revolving credit facilities. 
Moving on to the current state of business and our expectations for the fourth quarter. Overall, for the fourth quarter-to-date is running down approximately 20% versus last year. And we currently expect that revenue for the full fourth quarter will be down approximately 20% versus last year as well. 
We continue to see strong growth in our owned and operated digital commerce business and experienced a strong positive consumer response to single-state promotions and the holiday season kickoff events globally. Additionally, we see continued overall positive trends in Asia, particularly in China. 
However, our retail stores in Europe and North America continue to face significant pressure as a result of resurgence of COVID-19 cases. Approximately 40% of stores in Europe were closed for the majority of November. As a result, our fourth quarter-to-date direct-to-consumer business has declined compared to the third quarter, running down approximately 25% overall compared to last year. 
When we look at the total direct-to-consumer business by region, we are running up low single digits for total Asia, down high 20s for North America and running down low 30s in Europe, including the impact of the closed stores I mentioned. 
As of today, only about 10% of our stores in Europe are still closed. And within the next 10 days, all of our stores are planned to reopen. We expect the trend in Europe to improve considerably as a result. Also, through November, all of our regions are running ahead of our current plans. 
We expect that our fourth quarter gross margin percentage will be relatively flat compared to last year. And our expenses as a percent of revenue will be in the mid-50s. Overall, for the second half, our gross margin percentage is in line with our previous expectation. And our expenses as a percentage of revenue have improved by approximately 250 basis points. 
We're not in a position to issue detailed guidance due to the uncertainty related to the duration and severity of the pandemic. 
And with that, operator, we'll open it up for questions."

As you mentioned correctly, we have been very successful in pivoting towards e-commerce.

It's an extreme case now given that we are in the middle of the pandemic. So we are tracking where we are going right now and optimizing what we can here and now. And then we are following where the consumer is going coming out of the new normal. But it's going to be an important work for us to make sure that we rightsize the brick-and-mortar portfolio, North America, Asia, Europe. 
What we do see, though, in this quarter, which is very exciting in both Asia and Europe, is when we execute really well, cross-channel, the consumer shops cross-channel. So during the Tmall activation, where we drove a 50% comp, we were also, at the same time, able to drive sales in the stores. And the same in Europe that when we see pivoting an extreme pivoting to 40% of the stores closed, we are able to connect to use our connected inventory. So we see a future where the consumer continue to shift more and more into digital but very much an omnichannel consumer."

Joining me on the call this morning is Stefan Larsson, our President; Mike Shaffer, our Chief Operating Officer and CFO; and Dana Perlman, our Head of Treasury and Senior Vice President, Business Development and Investor",934,"Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Joining me on the call this morning is Stefan Larsson, our President; Mike Shaffer, our Chief Operating Officer and CFO; and Dana Perlman, our Head of Treasury and Senior Vice President, Business Development and Investor Relations.  
First of all, I'd like to thank you all for joining us for the third quarter call. It's hard to believe that this is the third earnings call since the pandemic started, and our associates in certain parts of the world have been working remotely for over 9 months now.  I would truly like to thank all our associates for their hard work and flexibility, in particular, our dedicated retail store and distribution center associates who manage to keep running our business as usual despite the backdrop, which is far from normal.  Our third quarter results were very strong, and we significantly outperformed our top and bottom line expectations across all markets and channels despite the challenging environment.  
I'm also very pleased to note that our fourth quarter is off to a very strong start as we are outperforming our plans for our global holiday kickoff events, including Singles' Day in Asia; and Black Friday, which is now being observed in many markets outside the U.S. And we feel great about the momentum behind our brands.  There is clearly an unprecedented amount of change happening in the apparel industry, which the pandemic has only accelerated. To navigate this backdrop, our teams have been evolving our business model to compete in the new world of retail and, in particular, capture the younger consumer generation while continuing to serve our core consumer.  
We also addressed near-term challenges, which are -- with a long-term approach to drive sustainable, profitable growth, including some difficult business decisions as we recognize the need to adapt quickly to the realities that COVID-19 is presenting to us with. In this context, we have been accelerating our digital agenda and reallocating additional resources to drive growth in this highly important channel. We are seeing strong revenue growth and are pleased that our EBIT margins for our own digital business are in line with those of our overall business, which, as we continue to scale the business, should continue to improve. We also continue to evolve our business towards the comfort and casual categories that are working with the consumer today, especially the younger generations.  
And lastly, we continue to pivot towards our international businesses where we continue to see a very significant revenue opportunity for both our Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger businesses while also contributing a higher overall operating margin. We believe that our focus on these aspects of the business will drive long-term revenue and margin growth for our stockholders driven by gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage. Stefan and Mike will get into the specifics of the third quarter as well as the current fourth quarter sales and margin trends, which are all very positive.  
I'm also extremely pleased with the tremendous liquidity that we have in place in order to expand any potential disruption from the pandemic. We are cautiously optimistic about this year's unique holiday season. Clearly, the shift to digital is the narrative for this holiday season. And we have positioned our business to succeed in this context with strong digital events planned, inventory, investments to fuel the demand in the channel and adjustments to the in-store experience to adapt to the capacity constraints in stores.  We believe that we are positioned to capture market share for holiday while also selling through any carryover inventories. We'll continue to monitor how the virus ebbs and flows as well as its impact on our business.  
Before I pass things over to Stefan, I'd like to just acknowledge what a privilege it has been to lead PVH as CEO for the last 15 years. I truly want to thank the PVH Board and all our amazing associates worldwide for all their contributions and, most importantly, their partnership and support. I'm quite amazed at how PVH has grown and transformed during my 15-year career at PVH. We've evolved from over -- from a North America-based dress shirt business with sales of $1.5 billion to a portfolio of global iconic brands with about 70% of our EBIT coming from outside the U.S., over 40,000 associates employed worldwide and close to $10 billion in revenues last year. We've also developed one of the industry's leading corporate responsibility platforms. And our vision to drive fashion forward for good motivates and guides the way we operate our business every day.  
In my new role as Chairman, I look forward to seeing PVH continue to drive this vision forward and deliver the company's next chapter of growth and profit recovery. I have great confidence in Stefan as he assumes the role of CEO in February. His global experience, consumer focus and high-performance track record, especially in this unprecedented time of disruption, are tremendous assets for PVH.  As Stefan continues to partner with our incredible team of senior leaders, many that have been here for over a decade, I believe that their expertise and collective knowledge of our industry and consumer base will help maximize the growth potential for PVH.  
Overall, I'm very optimistic about future opportunities ahead for PVH. We have unique, competitive advantages: our incredible people, our iconic global brands and our strong financial and operating fundamentals, which I believe will position us to continue to deliver sustainable long-term growth for all of our stakeholders.  
With that, I turn it over to Stefan for comments about the quarter and the fourth quarter as well."

First, let me start by saying that I'm deeply honored and humbled by the opportunity to succeed Manny in the CEO role for this great company. And I would like to thank Manny and the Board for their confidence and trust in me as well as for a very strong partnership. Manny is one of the few iconic leaders of our industry. And having had the opportunity to work side by side with him over the last 1.5 years has given me unique insights into how he and our team over the last 15 years have built PVH into one of the largest apparel groups in the world.  My focus will be to build on the core strengths that brought us here and connecting them closer to where the consumer is going than any time before, which will form the foundation to successfully deliver our next chapter of growth. And coming in as the CEO, I will continue to build up on the people-first values Manny has instilled in PVH.  
With the critical start of the holiday season now underway, our teams have been doing a great job in pivoting to optimizing our consumer offering to this very different kind of environment where supercharging digital and our omnichannel capabilities and leaning into our casual essential products led to our strongest-ever digital holiday sales results and an above-plan performance for the initial holiday period overall.  Our strong execution, including our events for Amazon Prime Day, Singles' Day and Black Friday in Asia, Europe and North America reflects the hard work and flexibility of our talented teams around the world. And I would like to thank everyone for their critical contributions.  
I will now share some key insights on how we drove performance in the third quarter and fourth quarter to date. And as Manny mentioned, Mike will then share more financial details and current trends.  
The focus for our brands and regions has remained to successfully navigate through the pandemic, capture market share in the holiday period and selling through seasonal inventory to enter spring 2021 with a clean inventory position. In parallel to the focus on driving the business here and now, we continue to lean in to drive an accelerated recovery to win with the consumer coming out of COVID.  
I'd like to start by sharing some proof points, demonstrating our progress against 3 value-creating areas that we outlined last quarter. First, we continue to supercharge the e-commerce channel through our owned and operated as well as third-party digital partners. As a result, for the quarter, we grew total digital sales by 36%, including 70% growth on our owned sites. We are seeing strong new user growth, particularly with the younger consumers, as we expanded our casual assortments and offered digital innovations, such as live streams and targeted activations with the pure players. Improved in-stock levels and enhancement to our owned sites are also resonating well, including ship-from-store and additional payment options, which are all important to attract and convert the younger consumers.  
Next, we continued to increase our focus on driving product relevance, which led to stronger-than-expected demand and margin in our key casual categories. Within these categories -- key categories, we increased our focus on the essential products that have the highest demand and, at the same time, we rationalized unproductive SKUs, resulting in higher AURs in many of our most important products.  
Lastly, we are realizing the savings from our recent workforce reductions in North America, and we continue to evaluate further measures to drive cost efficiencies across the company. While our regions are all in various stages of their recovery, these focus areas continue to guide our teams with clear objectives to operate against, to drive an accelerated recovery.  
As I provide a regional update, you will see that the third quarter operating environment had stores open for the majority of the quarter. However, in late October, the virus resurgence intensified, resulting in temporary store closures in Europe and further weakening of our store traffic in North America.  
Let me start with Asia, specifically with China. Overall, China remains the furthest ahead in terms of the recovery with sales up 6% in the quarter -- in the third quarter and total digital sales up 63% as well as improving traffic in our brick-and-mortar stores. 
Our teams in Asia has been doing a great job planning and executing the back half of this year. They have supercharged e-commerce, leaned into our big casual categories, the most relevant casual and athleisure products and based on our selling trends, cut many unproductive styles, all leading to improved sell-throughs and markdown rates. They have also been effective with their brand marketing and consumer engagement.  
During the third quarter, we experienced very strong performance in China during Golden Week. And we were also pleased with the start of the fourth quarter, including Singles' Day sales, which now spans several weeks, where we grew over 50% on Tmall and drove positive comp store sales in our brick-and-mortar stores at the same time, all with increased pricing power.  Our strong execution, including live streaming activations with top Chinese live streamer, Viya, resulted in market share gains against the competition with Tommy's ranking in Tmall flagship store rising 14 places.  
And lastly, our marketing activations resonated very well with the consumer, including Calvin's virtual event with Ambassador Lay Zhang, which we livestreamed from our Shanghai Daning store, resulting in plus-48% growth that day on Tmall and 2.6 million views on Weibo.  
Overall, while there has been some infection resurgence in Japan and parts of Southeast Asia, we continue to make good progress towards a continued strong recovery in the region as a whole driven largely by China and digital strength.  
Moving on to Europe. Our business across both brands outperformed despite the tough backdrop with revenues declining only 4% versus last year in local currency. Just like in Asia, our management team in Europe has been very effective in taking sustainable, profitable market share in a very difficult environment. We drove a very strong recovery for the majority of the quarter, including in our brick-and-mortar stores. However, since late October, we have been negatively affected by the resurgence of the virus with an increasing number of lockdowns imposed towards the end of the quarter.  
Overall, strong brand product and channel execution drove higher consumer and retailer demand for our Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein products to the point where we were chasing goods in select categories to fuel the consumer demand while also achieving strong margins. Our well-developed, scalable digital distribution network continues to be a real competitive advantage. We grew total digital sales by 33% as we continue to post outside growth through our owned and operated sites as well as through our partnerships with Zalando, ASOS and ABOUT YOU.  
With approximately 40% of our stores temporarily closed in Europe during November, we quickly pivoted our operations to best leverage our digital distribution network. And we're also able to leverage our connected store inventory to meet the stronger-than-expected inventory demand online. In recent weeks, the lockdowns have started to ease, and we expect all doors to be open within the next 10 days, assuming no further government restrictions.  
We feel very good about our future order book where spring and summer order books actualized up high single digits versus last year and the first indication for pre-fall 2021 are very positive. All these factors make us have great confidence in our ability to continue to gain market share in Europe.  
Lastly, our North American business continued to feel the most pressure relative to our other regions driven by a combination of the lack of international tourism, increasing resurgence of the virus across the region and bigger dependency on brick-and-mortar than our other regions. Our teams in North America are working very hard in navigating through the COVID-related challenges. 
While our overall sales in North America declined 38%, digital remained a true highlight with our owned sites growing over 100% enabled by our site enhancements, inventory investments and logistical improvements to fuel demand.  We had another strong quarter with Amazon, including Calvin and Tommy posting their highest Prime Day sales ever achieved with a significant increase in new consumers. 
At the same time, tourism is currently down 95% and not expected to return in a while, presenting a significant challenge for our brick-and-mortar business.  Losing the tourist business, that's usually 35%, 40% of our total retail business in North America, has put pressure on clearing through inventory, which, in combination with an unusually early start of the holiday season, led us to be more proactive with driving early promotions, moving some of them from Q4 to Q3. Our main focus remains to enter spring clean from an inventory perspective.  
Moving on to our fourth quarter outlook. We have so far performed better than expected over Black Friday week and Cyber Monday across all channels in North America. While we still have significant amount of business ahead of us for holiday, we're expecting the current business trend to continue through the final holiday stretch. 
So looking ahead for North America. Having navigated through the most challenging parts of the pandemic while the lack of tourism by far is the biggest challenge we are facing, it's clear that we have our own work to do coming out of the pandemic. We will increase our focus on our domestic consumer. We will continue to take on the significant opportunities to further expand our e-commerce business, both our owned and operated and third party. And we will also improve how we plan and buy inventory to demand. 
As our performance across regions demonstrates, we have taken a very deliberate approach for each brand to get even closer to the consumer as we continue to enhance our brand relevance and positioning. I'd like to share a few brief global highlights from the quarter, beginning with Calvin. 
We are seeing Calvin Klein continue to register strong 86% global brand awareness with increasing consumer consideration to purchase across all regions. Our increased focus on creating product consumers' desire was captured through Calvin Klein's underwear collaboration with Kith, featuring Gigi Hadid, which sold out 75% of the collection in just 4 days, highlighting incredible results with younger consumers, both from an engagement and sales perspective, which we will continue to build upon as we head into 2021. 
Lastly, I'm excited to say that we strengthened Calvin's global brand leadership team during the quarter, announcing our new key hires across design, merchandising and marketing, which will enable the execution in product and marketing of Calvin's evolved brand vision. 
Moving on to Tommy. I'm excited to welcome Avery Baker back to Tommy in a newly established role of President and Chief Brand Officer with global responsibility for the brand's products, marketing and experiences. Avery was the driving force behind many of the brand's transformational programs, including TOMMYNOW, and has experience and real strength in connecting the Tommy DNA to culture and what the consumer desires today. 
Tommy also celebrated its 35 anniversary as an iconic brand with global editorial coverage and a brand activation on Tmall. And we continue to see improving global awareness, including in key growth markets like China. The brand also continued to further its sustainability agenda, launching Tommy jeans recycled denim line for fall 2020. 
Finally, to our Heritage business. Our Heritage Brands business continued to be under pressure during the third quarter as the mid-tier department stores experienced traffic challenges and dress furnishings categories remains under pressure. We are continuing to actively address the business challenges by managing inventory levels aggressively, lowering our cost base and reviewing additional ways to optimize and streamline the business. 
Before I hand it over to Mike, I would like to reiterate that the actions we are taking now to successfully navigate the pandemic and drive an accelerated recovery are also positioning us to win with the consumer coming into a new normal post-COVID. The proof points that I just shared with you from our strong digital growth to our increasing brand engagement and enhanced product strategies to our strong performance internationally demonstrate the global brand power behind Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger and the strong relationships that we are building with our consumers, particularly the next generation.  As we leverage the power of PVH, focusing in on our core strengths and connecting them to where the consumer is going, I'm confident that we will drive brand relevance, cost efficiencies and deliver long-term sustainable growth while driving fashion forward for good.  Looking ahead, we are working on our long-term plan for PVH next chapter of growth and we look forward to sharing more details with you at an Investor Day we are planning for mid-2021. 
And by that, I would like to hand it over to Mike."

The comments I'm about to make are based on non-GAAP results and are reconciled in our press release. I'm going to discuss our third quarter 2020 results and move on to the current state of the business and our fourth quarter expectation",798,"Thanks, Stefan. 
The comments I'm about to make are based on non-GAAP results and are reconciled in our press release. I'm going to discuss our third quarter 2020 results and move on to the current state of the business and our fourth quarter expectations. 
While our business continued to be negatively impacted compared to last year by COVID-19 pandemic, our overall results were an improvement compared to the second quarter and exceeded our expectations driven by strong outperformance in Europe and China. 
Overall, our revenue was down 18% as reported and 21% on a constant currency basis from last year. Tommy Hilfiger revenues were down 12% as reported and 16% on a constant currency basis with international flat as reported and down 6% on a constant currency basis and North America down 37%.  Calvin Klein revenue was down 18% as reported and 21% on a constant currency basis with international flat as reported and down 4% on a constant currency basis and North America down 39%. China continued to show positive year-over-year results in both Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein. Our Heritage revenues were down 36%. 
Our third quarter reflected a 22% decline in revenue through our wholesale distribution channel and an 11% decline in revenue from our total direct-to-consumer businesses, including a 70% increase in sales through our digital commerce business driven by strong growth across all brands and regions. The lack of international tourist traffic coming to the U.S. continues to challenge our North America brick-and-mortar retail business. 
While we continue to be negatively impacted by the pandemic, our earnings exceeded our expectations and our earnings per share was $1.32 on a non-GAAP basis for the third quarter. Our gross margin reflected heavy promotional selling in the U.S. as we advanced markdowns from the fourth quarter into the third quarter in order to maximize the earlier holiday selling season.  
Inventories ended the quarter down 16% from last year. As of the end of fiscal 2020, we are now projecting to carry approximately $100 million of basic inventory into spring '21, which is a reduction compared to our prior projection of about $125 million. 
Earnings in the third quarter benefited from cost savings resulting from the North America workforce reduction announced in July 2020 and COVID-related government payroll subsidy programs in international jurisdictions as well as reductions in all discretionary spending categories. Partially offsetting these savings were increased ongoing expenses associated with health and safety measures to protect our associates, customers and business partners. These safety measures are expected to continue. 
We ended the quarter with $2.7 billion of liquidity, consisting of approximately $1.5 billion of cash on hand and over $1.2 billion of available borrowings under our revolving credit facilities. 
Moving on to the current state of business and our expectations for the fourth quarter. Overall, for the fourth quarter to date is running down approximately 20% versus last year. And we currently expect that revenue for the full fourth quarter will be down approximately 20% versus last year as well. 
We continue to see strong growth in our owned and operated digital commerce business and experienced a strong positive consumer response to Singles' Day promotions and the holiday season kickoff events globally. Additionally, we see continued overall positive trends in Asia, particularly in China. 
However, our retail stores in Europe and North America continue to face significant pressure as a result of resurgence of COVID-19 cases. Approximately 40% of stores in Europe were closed for the majority of November. As a result, our fourth quarter to date direct-to-consumer business has declined compared to the third quarter, running down approximately 25% overall compared to last year.  
When we look at the total direct-to-consumer business by region, we are running up low single digits for total Asia, down high 20s for North America and running down low 30s in Europe, including the impact of the closed stores I mentioned. As of today, only about 10% of our stores in Europe are still closed. And within the next 10 days, all of our stores are planned to reopen. We expect the trend in Europe to improve considerably as a result. Also, through November, all of our regions are running ahead of our current plans. 
We expect that our fourth quarter gross margin percentage will be relatively flat compared to last year and our expenses as a percent of revenue will be in the mid-50s. Overall, for the second half, our gross margin percentage is in line with our previous expectation. And our expenses as a percentage of revenue have improved by approximately 250 basis points. We're not in a position to issue a detailed guidance due to the uncertainty related to the duration and severity of the pandemic. 
And with that, operator, we'll open it up for questions."

So it's all those things put together. It's truly detailed work, it's truly getting the benefit of that scaling of the business. 
As we look forward, the business in terms of digital is -- overall, across our regions, is now approaching the profitability level of our brick-and-mortar business.

But it's going to be an important work for us to make sure that we rightsize the brick-and-mortar portfolio, North America, Asia, Europe. 
What we do see, though, in this quarter, which is very exciting in both Asia and Europe, is when we execute really well, cross-channel, the consumer shops cross-channel. So during the Tmall activation where we drove a 50% comp, we were also, at the same time, able to drive sales in the stores. And the same in Europe that when we see pivoting -- an extreme pivoting to 40% of the stores closed, we are able to connect to use our connected inventory. So we see a future where the consumer continue to shift more and more into digital but very much an omnichannel consumer."

We saw it pay off Tmall -- the collaboration with Tmall that we really double down on a year ago roughly and we planned into this Singles' Day event, which is now 2, 3 weeks, and we planned in and came together with them and really won with the consumer.  And then when it comes to Zalando, we are -- have very strong partnership with them and also connect our inventory in store. 
So we were able to pivot. When the stores were closed, we were still driving significant sales through fulfilling online. So this is continuous work. And we have some ship-from-store capabilities that we were able to standoff within just a few months coming into the crisis.  We -- it's a continuous work, but those are just a few examples of what we are doing and what we will continue to do. And the most exciting with that is that it resonates with the consumer."
