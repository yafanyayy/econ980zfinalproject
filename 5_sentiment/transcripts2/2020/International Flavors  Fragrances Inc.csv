And a very special welcome to Rustom, our recently appointed CFO, who joined us about 3 weeks ago. We could not be more excited to welcome him to the IFF team as he brings a strong track record over 30 years of operational and financial leadership across several international markets with significant experience in managing global finance teams, developing strategy, driving efficiency initiatives and completing acquisitions. So welcome, Rustom. I would like to take the opportunity to thank Rich O'Leary for his service as our CFO and looking forward to his contributions as our integration lead for the DuPont Nutrition & Biosciences combination. He has deep institutional knowledge, insights and perspectives financially and strategically and will be enormously valuable as it takes on his new role as our integration officer. 
On today's call, as usual, I will give an executive overview of our performance for the fourth quarter and full year 2019, including an update on the progress we are making with the integration of Frutarom. Following the discussion, I will ask Rustom to provide a financial review of the business and take you through our financial expectations for 2020. We will also recap IFF's transformational journey and the exciting opportunities we see with our combination with DuPont Nutrition & Biosciences business, which we announced in the [ fourth ] quarter 2019. Upon the completion of our prepared remarks, we will take any questions that you may have. 
Let's come to 2019. 2019 was a transformational year in IFF's history. It can be categorized as a year of great progress despite some challenges. Over the course of the year, there were many positive accomplishments, including the development of our new strategy, strong progress against our integration synergy targets, unlocking incremental access to new businesses via [ call lists ] and announcing our combination with N&B unparalleled in our industry as it will broaden our product offerings and create a global leader in innovative, integrated solutions. 
I've also to acknowledge that there were several challenges like continued raw material cost increases; impactful end market dynamics like destocking; isolated sales pressure, including delayed launches and dissynergies; as well as the Russia and Ukraine compliance issue, which I'm pleased to say that has now been fully completed and closed. In that context, we surpassed $5 billion in sales for the first time and expanded adjusted operating profit margin, excluding amortization, a testament to our team's focus, dedication and commitment to delivering strong results and executing our long-term strategy. 
We ended 2019 with meaningful growth in the fourth quarter, seeing 7% currency-neutral revenue growth, including the 4 percentage points related to the 53rd week. We also achieved currency-neutral adjusted EPS growth of 23% excluding amortization, led by volume growth, integration synergies, productivity initiatives, the Brazil tax recovery as well as more favorable tax rate and higher income. In the fourth quarter, the team was able to continue to exceed expectations on Frutarom cost synergies, capturing approximately $20 million cost synergies driven by procurement harmonization and manufacturing optimization. 
This very sustained focus across the organization ultimately positioned IFF to accelerate our vision through the announced combination with DuPont N&B business at the end of the year. The decline in combination will allow us to develop integrated solutions with greater global scale to meet what our customers demand high-quality products, innovative solutions and strategic partnerships to deliver growth. 
But let's take a step back and look at the full year 2019. I'm pleased to say we delivered solid top and bottom line results in a very challenging environment. We realized sales of $5.1 billion, expanded adjusting operating profit margin, excluding amortization by 30 bps to 19.2%. We also delivered strong adjusted earnings per share excluding amortization of USD 6.17, principally led by adjusted operating profit growth, realized synergies and improved productivity. Ultimately, we have many strategic accomplishments that build momentum throughout the year and drove significant value creation. 
Our investment innovation includes the opening of IFF centers of excellence and innovation hubs in New Jersey and Texas. Specifically, our new center of excellence of foodservice and seasonings in Carrollton, Texas; the opening of our Home and Fabric Care innovation center at Bell Works in Homdel, New Jersey; and the openings of our global service center in Budapest and L'Atelier Du Parfumeur in Grasse, France, reflects our commitment to environmentally responsible real estate development. In addition, we also modernized our largest Scent creative centers in New York and Paris and continued our investment in Greater Asia, including 2 new plants in India and China, which we will complete -- will be completed in 2020. 
In June, we took another bold step forward in leading our industry on sustainability when we articulated IFF's purpose: to redefine and transform how we live and care for the resources of the world. In line with this mission, we accelerated our global industry leadership in sustainability, opening the industry's largest solar array of our facilities in New Jersey and signing on to the United Nations pledged to help limit global temperature rise. Most recently, IFF was named once again to CDP's A list for climate change and water security, placing our company among a prestigious group of global environmental leaders with AA distinction. And just a week ago, we were named [indiscernible] 100 most sustainable companies list for the third consecutive year. 
Throughout the year, we continued to complete the important work of bringing our colleagues at Frutarom more fully to the IFF family. We have addressed the most significant outselling challenges related to bringing these businesses together and are now in a position to accelerate growth by capturing new opportunities and delivering the solutions our customers need. 
But perhaps most importantly, we have continued to achieve significant cost synergies throughout the integration process, well ahead of our year 1 cost synergy target, including approximately $50 million cost synergies in 2019. This is mainly driven by procure excellence, but we also have made progress on our operational footprint. We have closed 10 sites in 2019. And I really believe we are on track to deliver more than $145 million in synergies, further supporting the business and driving value to our shareholders. We expect to potentially complete the Frutarom integration by the end of 2020. 
The efficient operational execution was complemented by solid year 1 run rate revenue synergies of approximately $15 million. We've identified a strong pipeline of cross-selling opportunities of more than 1,000 projects representing approximately $150 million of sales and plan to build on this momentum in 2020. We have accelerated the expansion of our Tastepoint model to serve fast-growing local and regional customer segment through increased speed and agility, enabling them to win in the marketplace. We will fully consolidate Frutarom into our legacy IFF business. As we refine our structure and reporting, we're aligning our talent organization and responsibility based on our new structure. With this in mind, starting in Q1 of 2020, we will report financial results as Taste and Scent, incorporating most of Frutarom within our Taste segment. 
Lastly, we continue to generate strong cash flows as operating cash flow was up $261 million year-over-year in 2019. We continue to deleverage our balance sheet, improving our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio from 3.6x to 3.2x, putting us on track to deliver on our commitment to be below 3x by the end of 2020. 
With that, I would like to turn it over to Rustom to take us through our financial performance in greater detail."
281407,652781212,1909200,"International Flavors & Fragrances Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Feb 13, 2020",2020-02-13,"Earnings Calls","International Flavors & Fragrances Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Andreas. First, let me say how delighted I am to have joined IFF at this exciting time as we move past the integration of Frutarom to the combination with DuPont's N&B business and the many opportunities and challenges this will bring. For my p",1708,"Thank you, Andreas. First, let me say how delighted I am to have joined IFF at this exciting time as we move past the integration of Frutarom to the combination with DuPont's N&B business and the many opportunities and challenges this will bring. For my part, I expect to focus on, first, improving execution and accountability; second, enhancing effective collaboration across the business, that's legacy IFF, Frutarom, and soon, N&B; third, strengthening our cost discipline; and finally, delivering solid ROI. 
Now on to the numbers. Reported sales increased by 29% in 2019 with 3 additional quarters of Frutarom being the major driver. Excluding Frutarom, currency-neutral sales grew 3% with 2019's 53rd week contributing 1%. I'll provide more color on sales by segment as we go through those slides. 
Our full year adjusted operating profit margin excluding amortization, rose by 30 basis points, driven by productivity initiatives, acquisition-related synergies and a Brazilian tax recovery. It's also worth noting that in our fourth quarter, our currency-neutral EPS ex amortization grew a robust 23%, driven mostly by acquisition-related synergies, volume growth, lower incentive compensation, a Brazilian tax recovery and a lower effective tax rate, which more than offset a headwind from higher raw material costs and mix. 
As the IFF team has done in previous quarters, I would like to highlight the impact of emerging market pricing on our growth rate to better compare to our peers. As a reminder, for a variety of reasons, many of our sales transactions in the emerging markets occur either in U.S. dollars or other hard currencies,or our index to hard currencies when we have to invoice in local market currencies. So when reporting our currency-neutral sales growth, we exclude foreign exchange-related price changes in emerging markets. But this is different from our peers. We believe that our reporting standard provides investors with a true assessment of underlying currency-neutral growth, especially when there are large emerging market devaluations relative to the U.S. dollar or euro. However, it's important to help all of you understand our performance relative to competition. 
For the fourth quarter of 2019, the stronger U.S. dollar environment plus emerging market devaluations year-over-year in several key markets had approximately a 1% currency impact on growth if we include emerging market pricing. For the full year, this impact represented approximately a 2% currency impact on growth. 
Breaking it down a little further. Let's move on to Scent on Slide 11. In the fourth quarter, currency-neutral sales increased year-over-year by 6% to $478.3 million. Fourth quarter performance was strongest in Consumer Fragrance, increasing in the high single digits from the prior year, driven by growth in Home, Fabric and Hair Care. Fine Fragrance grew in the mid-single digits year-over-year led by double-digit growth in both greater Asia and in Latin America. At the same time, Fragrance Ingredients declined in the low single digits from last year as price increases were offset by volume declines, mainly as a result of industry destocking. 
For the full year, currency-neutral sales increased by 4% from 2018 to $1.9 billion with growth across all regions and in all categories, especially those that are a strategic focus. Both Fine Fragrance, with record new win contribution; and Consumer Fragrance grew in the mid-single digits from 2018. Our performance in Fine Fragrance was driven by double-digit growth in EAME and Greater Asia, while as in the fourth quarter, Consumer Fragrance was led by strong improvements in Home and Fabric Care. For the year, Fragrance Ingredients improved double -- by low single digits, driven by price increases. 
For the full year, currency-neutral segment profit grew 6% and margin expanded 30 basis points to 17.3%. Drivers included raw materials-driven price increases as well as benefits from productivity initiatives that ran the gamut from manufacturing, procurement and make versus buy to innovation. 
Moving on to Taste on Slide 12. In the fourth quarter, currency-neutral sales increased year-over-year by 8% to $429.9 million. This performance was led by double-digit growth in Greater Asia and high single-digit growth in North America. Sales to multinationals, which had been under pressure in the last few quarters, grew mid-single digits, indicating an inflection point in Q4. 
We also saw a much stronger growth from regional and local customers. From a category perspective, we were strongest in Beverage and Savory, helped greatly by strong new win performance. For the full year, currency-neutral sales increased by approximately 2% to $1.7 billion, driven by high single-digit growth in Greater Asia and low single-digit growth in EAME. As discussed during the year, we had some challenges in North America and Latin America related to volume declines with multinational customers. And as in the fourth quarter, full year 2019 growth was strongest in Beverage and Savory. 
For the full year, Taste posted an industry-leading 22.1% segment profit margin with $383 million in segment profit, which was supported by productivity increases, integration-related synergies and lower incentive compensation expense. 
Now let's move on to Frutarom's performance on Slide 13. In the fourth quarter, Frutarom currency-neutral sales increased year-over-year by 6%, including the net contribution of acquisitions and divested businesses, which is a sequential improvement in underlying performance. Organic currency-neutral growth for the quarter was 2%, essentially led by our Taste and Savory businesses. 
As discussed in past calls, Frutarom experienced compliance and portfolio-related transitory headwinds. Excluding these, organic currency-neutral growth would have been 6%. 
For the full year, sales were $1.5 billion for the segment, up 3% on a currency-neutral basis to the prior year, including the net contribution of acquisitions and divested businesses. In 2019, organic sales growth was flat. And if you exclude the transitory issues, organic currency-neutral sales growth was 3%, driven by solid growth in Taste and Savory solutions. The fastest-growing category at Frutarom include double-digit increases in food protection, infusions and [ allergy. ]
For the first -- for the full year, Frutarom segment profit was $127 million or $286 million, excluding amortization. And we finished the year with a strong quarterly segment profit increase of 24%, led by acquisition-related synergies. The full year operating margin, excluding amortization, was 19.2%, supported by delivering on our acquisition-related synergies and by disciplined cost management. 
Slide 14 provides some additional color on cash flow. As you will see, operating cash flow for the full year was up significantly from $438 million in 2018 to $699 million this year, a $261 million or 60% increase. This was driven primarily by higher cash earnings from Frutarom with Frutarom included for the entire year. Core working capital, defined as inventories, accounts receivables and accounts payables, improved year-over-year with progress in all 3 metrics. Inventories still remain at elevated levels primarily due to raw material cost increases and safety stocks within the Scent division. However, in the fourth quarter, we saw continued positive trends. 
For 2019, CapEx as a percentage of sales was approximately 4.6%, which is a significant investment in the future. Throughout the year, we made new capital, made new plants and capacity investments, mainly in greater Asia as well as creative centers, and we invested in high-return integration-related synergy projects such as manufacturing optimization. Bringing all this together, we have strong $195 million increase in free cash flow for 2019, representing a 73% increase year-over-year. 
Moving on to Slide 15. We expect full year 2020 sales of between $5.15 billion and $5.35 billion with adjusted EPS, excluding amortization, between $6.20 and $6.45. 
At this point in time, we expect a modest impact on sales from the recent coronavirus outbreak. But we are unable to quantify this as there are just too many variables and uncertainties. In addition, we have already incurred some relatively modest costs related to the outbreak as we acted to mitigate the impact on our supply chain. Right now, it's too early to quantify the impact on our results, but we did widen both our sales and adjusted EPS ex amortization guidance ranges to make some allowance for this as well as for continued volatile operating environment. 
The next slide provides some additional color about what we expect to drive our core sales growth for the year. Looking into our 2020 sales growth expectations and given the several moving parts, we felt it is important to give you an overview of drivers. As you see from this slide, sales growth for 2020 is expected to be approximately 1% to 5% on a currency-neutral basis. This includes a headwind of about 0.5 percentage point impact from portfolio adjustments, namely the carryover impact from compliance at CitraSources and an estimated 1 percentage point impact related to the 53rd week in the prior year period. Excluding these impacts, our core currency-neutral sales growth is expected to be approximately 2.5% to 6.5%, which includes approximately 2% to 5.5% from the organic business, 0.5% to 1% from cross-selling and little to no impact from M&A. 
Now let's move to Slide 17 for some additional color on what is driving our EPS growth. Adjusted EPS, excluding amortization growth for 2020, is expected to be approximately 3.5% to 7.5% on a currency-neutral basis. This includes a headwind of approximately 5 percentage points related to an incentive compensation reset, which is due to our performance versus our internal budget in 2019; an anticipated 0.5% impact due to the portfolio adjustment; and an estimated 1 percentage point impact related to the 53rd week in the prior year. Excluding those impacts, core currency-neutral adjusted EPS ex amortization is expected to grow in a range of 4% to 8%. We also expect to have a 6% positive contribution from integration synergies, which when added to our core growth puts us in the double-digit growth range. 
Moving on to Slide 18. I'm pleased to tell you that we remain on track to deliver on our commitment to delevering down to below 3.3x net debt-to-EBITDA by the end of 2020 while maintaining an investment-grade rating. We are already down to approximately 3.2x, down from 3.6x a year ago, and we will continue to focus on improving working capital, tightly managing aspects while making the necessary investments and, of course, growing our cash earnings. To further support achieving this goal, management incentives are aligned to repayment of debt. 
With that, let me turn the call back to Andreas."

Very well done. I just want to spend a few moments and highlighting the evolution of IFF from a traditional leader in the flavor and fragrance space to now sit uniquely positioned to redefine our industry at a time when consumers' demand are forcing changes across our customers. With Frutarom, we took the first big step. We can now reach one of the broader set of our CPG customers of all sizes in the world and added critical depth proposition as a top provider of flavors, savory solutions and natural taste solutions. As I mentioned, we are seeing some excellent cross-selling opportunities further supported by our Tastepoint model. With N&B, we take the next leap forward in delivering integrated solutions that allow us to partner with our customers to solve their most pressing problems. It is a truly powerful combination. IFF's leadership in natural Solutions and N&B leadership in Clean Label, including cultures, enzyme and soy proteins, will be a vital component in creating solutions that meet customer needs for better-for-you products. 
Our complementary product portfolio will be among the most balanced in the industry. Together, we will have #1 or #2 positions in the high-value most in-demand ingredients categories across our shared end markets of food and beverage, health and wellness and home and personal care. 
Ultimately, what we are doing is strengthening is position to serve our customers. We are witnessing powerful trends that are forcing all of us to think differently, and we have received very positive customer feedback about that combination. We will be a very powerful leader with even better R&D and application development capabilities and even deeper and more robust product development pipeline in addition to a portfolio that will be among the most balanced in the industry. Importantly, our shared cultures led by science and creativity will drive our strengths to unlock the potential of this combination. And again, it's really about how we can deliver highly compelling value propositions to all of our customer types. For many of our global multinational customers, we will bring deep experience with high-growth segments, faster speed to market and very deep consumer insights. For local and regional organizations, we will provide global reach to support regional and/or global expansion, paired with a strong local presence and a culture of collaboration. For new brands, we will be their end-to-end partner from idea to production, providing the reliability of scale and the power of global. 
The opportunity before us is clear and compelling, and we are taking the wide steps to ensure that we are positioned to bring these 2 businesses together as efficiently as possible. As we announced along with Rustom's appointment back in December, Rich O'Leary has been named as to lead the N&B integration efforts for IFF. Similarly, [indiscernible] N&B SVP of Global Tech and Innovation, will oversee the N&B integration lead. Each brings unparalleled unproved knowledge of the respective businesses and a diverse operating perspective to this team. We believe that their combination of experience and leadership best positions us to bring this combination to life. As I have had the opportunity to meet with leaders from across N&B business, each of these conversations has reaffirmed that IFF and N&B are perfect partners. While we look forward to hitting the ground running, the deal close is targeted for the first quarter of 2021, providing significant runway for planning and integration-related execution. 
As you can see, we have already been diligently working on planning to execute our road map to integrate these businesses. On Slide 22, we are showing that while our N&B integration planning has started and is working in parallel with our ongoing Frutarom integration work, we do expect the business integration work of Frutarom to be completed in the third quarter of 2020, with 90% of the manufacturing consolidation complete as planned. This ensures that we are ready to begin the DuPont integration. We will tap the combined integration muscle of both IFF and N&B along with robust external subject experts. 
So in summary, we delivered solid top and bottom line results and took clear and significant strategic steps on our journey to lead our industry as an invaluable partner for our customers. In 2019, we surpassed $5 billion in sales for the first time and expanded adjusted operating profit margin, excluding amortization, by 30 bps. I'm pleased that we ended the year with a significant acceleration in growth, seeing a 7% currency-neutral revenue increase and a robust 23% increase in currency-neutral adjusted EPS, excluding amortization. Reflecting on the year, we have a lot to be proud of. Our key accomplishments include significant integration-related synergies, strong progress in cross selling, great strides in sustainability and completion of the Russia and Ukraine compliance issue. At the end of the year, in the fourth quarter, we also saw a fundamental improvement in our Taste segment, a key inflection point as we head into 2020. 
But I also want to acknowledge that not everything went in our favor in 2019. We experienced significant raw material cost increases across both segments and sales came in lower-than-expected across all segments for the various reasons we explained earlier. As we look ahead in 2020, leveraging the key learnings from '19, our priorities are very clear: drive growth and profitability in our business, substantially complete Frutarom integration and lay the groundwork to begin successfully combining with N&B. With continued focus on execution, we will be well positioned to become a global leader in innovative, integrated solutions and be able to deliver value creation for all of our stakeholders. And while we are early in 2020, we are pleased to say that the start of the year strong with growth in all segments. 
With that, I would like to open it up for questions."

It's a bit wider, I think, too, relative to your peers. I guess I'm curious why you're giving a wider range? I hear the China commentary, but was under the impression it wasn't particularly large as a percentage of business. So is there something from a macro standpoint? Is there something from a customer standpoint that you're hearing or worried about? And then the second question is Frutarom. So I get organic growth for 4Q down about 4% if you back out the acquisition contribution and the pieces of the business from the closing of the prior year that you didn't known for the full quarter, so that gets a full year number down about 1%. So I guess the question there is you've owned the asset now for a little over a year. What's a reasonable run rate of growth? You've talked about 6% of that target longer term, but it just seems like it's not the case anymore. So maybe you're still thinking 6%, but if you could kind of walk through how you're thinking about it if that's the case? Or what are the moving parts today? That would be helpful."

What do we do in an environment where we are in, which is a pretty, let's say, volatile? It's -- on one hand, certainly, the corona situation, I come to that in a second. And then also tariffs, which are not easy to plan. But corona was probably the tipping point for us because it's very hard to quantify, but we know that it will have an impact. We had our manufacturing plants actually closed up to last Monday, Tuesday, where we opened it. We have relatively soft demand. We will see whether we will make it up. We have seen that we have also modest cost increases already and particularly on transportation. We have to make sure that we manage our inventory well in this situation because you have, let's say, disruptions in the supply chain. And one of our bigger customers also said that travel retail is actually pretty down because people are not traveling too much any longer. Just to give you one very personal example, my family came back from Europe yesterday. My wife told me in Frankfurt that the border control, there was nobody else. And the airplane, Lufthansa airplane was a smaller one than before, and it was just half booked, so just as to validate what we are seeing and reading. So we said it's probably a prudent thing to widen the guidance range because we just don't know. We hope at least that we will make it up. And as I said, our manufacturing plants are open again, and we are starting to manufacture, and it seems to be all good. But that's how we see it.

We believe when we cycle through, as we said, probably over the course of last year, through some of the onetime effects, we see that this business has good potential of mid- single-digit growth in average. And I come to some of the exceptions here. What we have to cycle through is our compliance issues, we issue we had in Russia. Thanks it's solved on the legal front now. We have to make sure that on the business side, it's running well. The second thing is the CitraSource, where one of our peer companies lost their big customer, and they are our biggest customer in that business. And then we had the impact on raw material prices on Natural Colors. So we believe that within the second quarter, we will cycle through these effects and we will grow this business around about mid-single digits. We have actually -- if you look at the different categories, some of these business are doing extremely well and have even double-digit growth like inclusions, where [ Gerardo ] is part of it, and the food protection business. So we are driving this, and we see also that these businesses are helping us with our cross-selling activities, which is basically reflected in the guidance, by the way. Most of it, it's a Frutarom business."

First of all, as we said before, we have basically access to 3 more very important qualities on the Scent side. What we see is that the team is executing with the customer are very, very closely now on new projects. We will see already some good wins in 2020.  the bulk of it will probably come in 2021. But we see that this is working out very well. And I was myself at the BIC congress ACI, the American Cleaning Institute, and I talk myself to many customers. And particularly, the ones where we have won the new calls, and that's very positive because they're happy with the innovation provided by IFF and the projects are already starting to ramp up. That's number one. Number two, and that was -- it was super important for us last year. We saw the inflection point now with the Taste business. We had basically 3, almost 4 quarters not so great growth. It was fourth quarter in '18 and then up to the third quarter in '19. And we saw that many of our bigger CPG customers had very slow volumes. Not that we were losing businesses but just the volume was very, very low of our business with these customers. And we had, on the other hand, a very good win rate over the course of the year. That started to materialize now in the fourth quarter. And we see already a good start into the first quarter as well with good January numbers. So it looks like that we are coming back on the Taste business to our usually average growth rates. And when I go back here on my spreadsheet, the last 3 years, the average CAGR was 3.9%; last 5 years, 3.7%. And that's certainly a number the business can achieve. Then on top of it, we look at the food business, I just gave the answer to Mark. It's a bit backloaded in general because of the cycling through of the topics I just mentioned. Well, what comes on top of it, we see actually a good activity now on the cross-selling. It started slower than we expected, but right now, we have run about 1,000 projects which have significant value for us, where we see that we can combine our products, that we can cross-sell products into combined customers. And that's something which is really, really good and gives us confidence that the growth is -- will be good in our core business over the course of 2020. So that's how we see it. I don't know, Rustom whether you want to add anything?"

So in the fourth quarter, our gross margin was negatively impacted by higher raw material costs and unfavorable mix, right? So from what I've learned in my first couple of weeks, raw material costs can fluctuate monthly, quarterly due to inventories. And in Taste in Q4, that's really where we saw it.

We have Scent raw materials came in much more favorable.

And a very special welcome to Rustom, our recently appointed CFO, who joined us about 3 weeks ago. We could not be more excited to welcome him to the IFF team as he brings a strong track record over 30 years of operational and financial leadership across several international markets with significant experience in managing global finance teams, developing strategy, driving efficiency initiatives and completing acquisitions. So welcome, Rustom. I would like to take the opportunity to thank Rich O'Leary for his service as our CFO and looking forward to his contributions as our integration lead for the DuPont Nutrition & Biosciences combination. He has deep institutional knowledge, insights and perspectives both financially and strategically and will be enormously valuable as it takes on his new role as our Integration Officer.
On today's call, as usual, I will give an executive overview of our performance for the fourth quarter and full year 2019, including an update on the progress we are making with the integration of Frutarom. Following the discussion, I will ask Rustom to provide a financial review of the business and take you through our financial expectations for 2020. We will also recap IFF's transformational journey and the exciting opportunities we see with our combination with DuPont Nutrition & Biosciences business, which we announced in the fourth quarter 2019. Upon the completion of our prepared remarks, we will take any questions that you may have.
Let's come to 2019. 2019 was a transformational year in IFF's history. It can be categorized as a year of great progress despite some challenges. Over the course of the year, there were many positive accomplishments, including the development of our new strategy, strong progress against our integration synergy targets, unlocking incremental access to new businesses via core lists and announcing our combination with N&B unparalleled in our industry as it will broaden our product offerings and create a global leader in innovative, integrated solutions.
I have also to acknowledge that there were several challenges are like continued raw material cost increases; impactful end market dynamics like destocking; isolated sales pressure, including delayed launches and dissynergies; as well as the Russia and Ukraine compliance issue, which I'm pleased to say that has now been fully completed and closed. In that context, we surpassed $5 billion in sales for the first time and expanded adjusted operating profit margin, excluding amortization, a testament to our team's focus, dedication and commitment to delivering strong results and executing our long-term strategy.
We ended 2019 with meaningful growth in the fourth quarter, seeing 7% currency-neutral revenue growth, including the 4 percentage points related to the 53rd week. We also achieved currency-neutral adjusted EPS growth of 23% excluding amortization, led by volume growth, integration synergies, productivity initiatives, the Brazil tax recovery as well as more favorable tax rate and higher other income. In the fourth quarter, the team was able to continue to exceed expectations on Frutarom cost synergies, capturing approximately $20 million cost synergies driven by procurement harmonization and manufacturing optimization.
This very sustained focus across the organization ultimately positioned IFF to accelerate our vision through the announced combination with DuPont N&B business at the end of the year. The exciting combination will allow us to develop integrated solutions with greater global scale to meet what our customers demand: high-quality products, innovative solutions and strategic partnerships to deliver growth.
But let's take a step back and look at the full year 2019. I'm pleased to say we delivered solid top and bottom line results in a very challenging environment. We realized sales of $5.1 billion, expanded adjusting operating profit margin, excluding amortization by 30 bps to 19.2%. We also delivered strong adjusted earnings per share excluding amortization of USD 6.17, principally led by adjusted operating profit growth, realized synergies and improved productivity. Ultimately, we have many strategic accomplishments that build momentum throughout the year and drove significant value creation.
Our investment innovation includes the opening of IFF Centers of Excellence and innovation hubs in New Jersey and Texas. Specifically, our new Center of Excellence for Food Service and Seasonings in Carrollton, Texas; the opening of our Home & Fabric Care Innovation Center at Bell Works in Holmdel, New Jersey; and the openings of our global service center in Budapest and L'Atelier Du Parfumeur in Grasse, France, reflects our commitment to environmentally responsible real estate development. In addition, we also modernized our largest Scent creative centers in New York and Paris and continued our investment in Greater Asia, including 2 new plants in India and China, which we will complete -- will be completed in 2020.
In June, we took another bold step forward in leading our industry on sustainability when we articulated IFF's new purpose: to redefine and transform how we live and care for the resources of the world. In line with this mission, we accelerated our global industry leadership in sustainability, opening the industry's largest solar array of our facilities in New Jersey and signing on to the United Nations' pledge to help limit global temperature rise. Most recently, IFF was named once again to CDP's A List for climate change and water security, placing our company among a prestigious group of global environmental leaders with AA distinction. And just a week ago, we were named Barron's 100 Most Sustainable Companies List for the third consecutive year.
Throughout the year, we continued to complete the important work of bringing our colleagues at Frutarom more fully to the IFF family. We have addressed the most significant outselling challenges related to bringing these businesses together and are now in a position to accelerate growth by capturing new opportunities and delivering the solutions our customers need.
But perhaps most importantly, we have continued to achieve significant cost synergies throughout integration process, well ahead of our year 1 cost synergy target, including approximately $50 million cost synergies in 2019. This is mainly driven by procurement excellence, but we also have made progress on our operational footprint. We have closed 10 sites in 2019. And I really believe we are on track to deliver more than $145 million in synergies, further supporting the business and driving value to our shareholders. We expect to potentially complete the Frutarom integration by the end of 2020.
The efficient operational execution was complemented by solid year 1 run rate revenue synergies of approximately $15 million. We've identified a strong pipeline of cross-selling opportunities of more than 1,000 projects, representing approximately $150 million of sales and plan to build on this momentum in 2020. We have accelerated the expansion of our Tastepoint model to serve fast-growing local and regional customer segment through increased speed and agility, enabling them to win in the marketplace. We will fully consolidate Frutarom into our legacy IFF business. As we refine our structure and reporting, we're aligning our talent organization and responsibility based on our new structure. With this in mind, starting in Q1 of 2020, we will report financial results as Taste and Scent, incorporating most of Frutarom within our Taste segment.
Lastly, we continue to generate strong cash flows as operating cash flow was up $261 million year-over-year in 2019. We continue to deleverage our balance sheet, improving our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio from 3.6x to 3.2x, putting us on track to deliver on our commitment to be below 3x by the end of 2020. 
With that, I would like to turn it over to Rustom to take us through our financial performance in greater detail."

For my p",1717,"Thank you, Andreas. First, let me say how delighted I am to have joined IFF at this exciting time as we move past the integration of Frutarom to the combination with DuPont's N&B business and the many opportunities and challenges this will bring. For my part, I expect to focus on: first, improving execution and accountability; second, enhancing effective collaboration across the business, that's legacy IFF, Frutarom, and soon, N&B; third, strengthening our cost discipline; and finally, delivering solid ROI.
Now on to the numbers. Reported sales increased by 29% in 2019 with 3 additional quarters of Frutarom being the major driver. Excluding Frutarom, currency-neutral sales grew 3% with 2019's 53rd week contributing 1%. I'll provide more color on sales by segment as we go through those slides.
Our full year adjusted operating profit margin excluding amortization, rose by 30 basis points, driven by productivity initiatives, acquisition-related synergies and a Brazilian tax recovery. It's also worth noting that in our fourth quarter, our currency-neutral EPS ex amortization grew a robust 23%, driven mostly by acquisition-related synergies, volume growth, lower incentive compensation, a Brazilian tax recovery and a lower effective tax rate, which more than offset a headwind from higher raw material costs and mix.
As the IFF team has done in previous quarters, I would like to highlight the impact of emerging market pricing on our growth rates to better compare to our peers. As a reminder, for a variety of reasons, many of our sales transactions in the emerging markets occur either in U.S. dollars or other hard currencies, or our index to hard currencies when we have to invoice in local market currencies. So when reporting our currency-neutral sales growth, we exclude foreign exchange-related price changes in emerging markets. But this is different from our peers. We believe that our reporting standard provides investors with a truer assessment of underlying currency-neutral growth, especially when there are large emerging market devaluations relative to the U.S. dollar or euro. However, it's important to help all of you understand our performance relative to competition.
For the fourth quarter of 2019, the stronger U.S. dollar environment plus emerging market devaluations year-over-year in several key markets had approximately 1% currency impact on growth if we include emerging market pricing. For the full year, this impact represented approximately a 2% currency impact on growth.
Breaking it down a little further. Let's move on to Scent on Slide 11. In the fourth quarter, currency-neutral sales increased year-over-year by 6% to $478.3 million. Fourth quarter performance was strongest in Consumer Fragrance, increasing in the high single digits from the prior year, driven by growth in Home, Fabric and Hair Care. Fine Fragrance grew in the mid-single digits year-over-year led by double-digit growth in both Greater Asia and in Latin America. At the same time, Fragrance Ingredients declined in the low single digits from last year as price increases were offset by volume declines, mainly as a result of industry destocking.
For the full year, currency-neutral sales increased by 4% from 2018 to $1.9 billion with growth across all regions and in all categories, especially those that are a strategic focus. Both Fine Fragrance, with record new win contribution, and Consumer Fragrance grew in the mid-single digits from 2018. Our performance in Fine Fragrance was driven by double-digit growth in EAME and Greater Asia, while as in the fourth quarter, Consumer Fragrance was led by strong improvements in Home and Fabric Care. For the year, Fragrance Ingredients improved by low double -- by low single digits driven by price increases.
For the full year, currency-neutral segment profit grew 6% and margin expanded 30 basis points to 17.3%. Drivers included raw materials-driven price increases as well as benefits from productivity initiatives that ran the gamut from manufacturing, procurement and make versus buy to innovation.
Moving on to Taste on Slide 12. In the fourth quarter, currency-neutral sales increased year-over-year by 8% to $429.9 million. This performance was led by double-digit growth in Greater Asia and high single-digit growth in North America. Sales to multinationals, which had been under pressure in the last few quarters, grew mid-single digits, indicating an inflection point in Q4.
We also saw a much stronger growth from regional and local customers. From a category perspective, we were strongest in Beverage and Savory, helped greatly by strong new win performance. For the full year, currency-neutral sales increased by approximately 2% to $1.7 billion, driven by high single-digit growth in Greater Asia and low single-digit growth in EAME. As discussed during the year, we had some challenges in North America and Latin America related to volume declines with multinational customers. And as in the fourth quarter, full year 2019 growth was strongest in Beverage and Savory.
For the full year, Taste posted an industry-leading 22.1% segment profit margin with $383 million in segment profit, which was supported by productivity increases, integration-related synergies and lower incentive compensation expense.
Now let's move on to Frutarom's performance on Slide 13. In the fourth quarter, Frutarom currency-neutral sales increased year-over-year by 6%, including the net contribution of acquisitions and divested businesses, which is a sequential improvement in underlying performance. Organic currency-neutral growth for the quarter was 2%, essentially led by our Taste and Savory businesses.
As discussed in past calls, Frutarom experienced compliance and portfolio-related transitory headwinds. Excluding these, organic currency-neutral growth would have been 6%.
For the full year, sales were $1.5 billion for the segment, up 3% on a currency-neutral basis from the prior year, including the net contribution of acquisitions and divested businesses. In 2019, organic sales growth was flat. And if you exclude the transitory issues, organic currency-neutral sales growth was 3%, driven by solid growth in Taste and Savory solutions. The fastest-growing categories at Frutarom include double-digit increases in food protection, inclusions and algae.
For the first -- for the full year, Frutarom's segment profit was $127 million or $286 million, excluding amortization. And we finished the year with a strong quarterly segment profit increase of 24%, led by acquisition-related synergies. The full year operating margin, excluding amortization, was 19.2%, supported by delivering on our acquisition-related synergies and by disciplined cost management.
Slide 14 provides some additional color on cash flow. As you will see, operating cash flow for the full year was up significantly from $438 million in 2018 to $699 million this year, a $261 million or 60% increase. This was driven primarily by higher cash earnings from Frutarom with Frutarom included for the entire year. Core working capital, defined as inventories, accounts receivables and accounts payables, improved year-over-year with progress in all 3 metrics. Inventories still remain at elevated levels primarily due to raw material cost increases and safety stocks within the Scent division. However, in the fourth quarter, we saw continued positive trends.
For 2019, CapEx as a percentage of sales was approximately 4.6%, which is a significant investment in the future. Throughout the year, we made new capital, made new plants and capacity investments, mainly in greater Asia as well as creative centers, and we invested in high-return integration-related synergy projects such as manufacturing optimization. Bringing all this together, we have strong $195 million increase in free cash flow for 2019, representing a 73% increase year-over-year.
Moving on to Slide 15. We expect full year 2020 sales of between $5.15 billion and $5.35 billion with adjusted EPS, excluding amortization, between $6.20 and $6.45.
At this point in time, we expect a modest impact on sales from the recent coronavirus outbreak. But we are unable to quantify this as there are just too many variables and uncertainties. In addition, we have already incurred some relatively modest costs related to the outbreak as we acted to mitigate the impact on our supply chain. Right now, it's too early to quantify the impact on our results, but we did widen both our sales and adjusted EPS ex amortization guidance ranges to make some allowance for this as well as for continued volatile operating environment.
The next slide provides some additional color about what we expect to drive our core sales growth for the year. Looking into our 2020 sales growth expectations and given the several moving parts, we felt it was important to give you an overview of drivers. As you see from this slide, sales growth for 2020 is expected to be approximately 1% to 5% on a currency-neutral basis. This includes a headwind of about 0.5 percentage point impact from portfolio adjustments, namely the carryover impact from compliance at CitraSource and an estimated 1 percentage point impact related to the 53rd week in the prior year period. Excluding these impacts, our core currency-neutral sales growth is expected to be approximately 2.5% to 6.5%, which includes approximately 2% to 5.5% from the organic business, 0.5% to 1% from cross-selling and little to no impact from M&A.
Now let's move to Slide 17 for some additional color on what is driving our EPS growth. Adjusted EPS, excluding amortization growth for 2020, is expected to be approximately 3.5% to 7.5% on a currency-neutral basis. This includes a headwind of approximately 5 percentage points related to an incentive compensation reset, which is due to our performance versus our internal budget in 2019; an anticipated 0.5% impact due to our -- due to the portfolio adjustment; and an estimated 1 percentage point impact related to the 53rd week in the prior year. Excluding those impacts, core currency-neutral adjusted EPS ex amortization is expected to grow in a range of 4% to 8%. We also expect to have a 6% positive contribution from integration synergies, which when added to our core growth puts us in the double-digit growth range.
Moving on to Slide 18. I'm pleased to tell you that we remain on track to deliver on our commitment to delevering down to below 3.3x (sic) [ 3.0x ] net debt-to-EBITDA by the end of 2020 while maintaining an investment-grade rating. We are already down to approximately 3.2x, down from 3.6x a year ago, and we will continue to focus on improving working capital, tightly managing our CapEx while making the necessary investments and, of course, growing our cash earnings. To further support achieving this goal, management incentives are aligned to repayment of debt.
With that, let me turn the call back to Andreas."

Very well done. I now want to spend a few moments and highlighting the evolution of IFF from a traditional leader in the flavor and fragrance space to now as it uniquely positioned to redefine our industry at a time when consumers' demands are forcing changes across our customers. With Frutarom, we took the first big step. We can now reach one of the broader set of our CPG customers of all sizes in the world and added critical depth proposition as a top provider of flavors, savory solutions and natural taste solutions. As I mentioned, we are seeing some excellent cross-selling opportunities further supported by our Tastepoint model. With N&B, we take the next leap forward in delivering integrated solutions that allow us to partner with our customers to solve their most pressing problems. It is a truly powerful combination. IFF's leadership in natural solutions and N&B's leadership in clean label, including cultures, enzyme and soy proteins, will be a vital component in creating solutions that meet customer needs for better-for-you products.
Our complementary product portfolio will be among the most balanced in the industry. Together, we will have #1 or #2 positions in the high-value most in-demand ingredients categories across our shared end markets of food and beverage, health and wellness, and home and personal care.
Ultimately, what we are doing is strengthening IFF's position to serve our customers. We are witnessing powerful trends that are forcing all of us to think differently, and we have received very positive customer feedback about that combination. We will be a very powerful leader with even better R&D and application development capabilities and even deeper and more robust product development pipeline in addition to a portfolio that will be among the most balanced in the industry. Importantly, our shared cultures, led by science and creativity, will drive our strengths to unlock the potential of this combination. And again, it's really about how we can deliver highly compelling value propositions to all of our customer types. For many of our global to multinational customers, we will bring deep experience with high-growth segments, faster speed to market and very deep consumer insights. For local and regional organizations, we will provide global reach to support regional and/or global expansion, paired with a strong local presence and a culture of collaboration. For new brands, we will be their end-to-end partner from idea to production, providing the reliability of scale and the power of global reach.
The opportunity before us is clear and compelling, and we are taking the wide steps to ensure that we are positioning -- positioned to bring these 2 businesses together as efficiently as possible. As we announced along with Rustom's appointment back in December, Rich O'Leary has been named as the -- lead the N&B integration efforts for IFF. Similarly, Angela Naef, N&B's SVP of Global Tech and Innovation, will oversee the N&B integration lead. Each brings unparalleled knowledge of the respective businesses and a diverse operating perspective to this team. We believe that their combination of experience and leadership best positions us to bring this combination to life. As I have had the opportunity to meet with leaders from across N&B business, each of these conversations has reaffirmed that IFF and N&B are perfect partners. While we look forward to hitting the ground running, the deal close is targeted for the first quarter of 2021, providing significant runway for planning and integration-related execution.
As you can see, we have already been diligently working on planning to execute our road map to integrate these businesses. On Slide 22, we are showing that while our N&B integration planning has started and is working in parallel with our ongoing Frutarom integration work, we do expect the business integration work of Frutarom to be completed in the third quarter of 2020, with 90% of the manufacturing consolidation complete as planned. This ensures that we are ready to begin the DuPont N&B integration. We will tap the combined integration muscle of both IFF and N&B along with robust external subject experts.
So in summary, we delivered solid top and bottom line results and took clear and significant strategic steps on our journey to lead our industry as an invaluable partner for our customers. In 2019, we surpassed $5 billion in sales for the first time and expanded adjusted operating profit margin, excluding amortization by 30 bps. I'm pleased that we ended the year with a significant acceleration in growth, seeing a 7% currency-neutral revenue increase and a robust 23% increase in currency-neutral adjusted EPS, excluding amortization. Reflecting on the year, we have a lot to be proud of. Our key accomplishments include significant integration-related synergies, strong progress in cross-selling, great strides in sustainability and completion of the Russia and Ukraine compliance issue. At the end of the year, in the fourth quarter, we also saw a fundamental improvement in our Taste segment, a key inflection point as we head into 2020.
But I also want to acknowledge that not everything went in our favor in 2019. We experienced significant raw material cost increases across both segments, and sales came in lower-than-expected across all segments for the various reasons we explained earlier. As we look ahead in 2020, leveraging the key learnings from '19, our priorities are very clear: drive growth and profitability in our business, substantially complete Frutarom integration and lay the groundwork to begin successfully combining with N&B. With continued focus on execution, we will be well positioned to become a global leader in innovative, integrated solutions and be able to deliver value creation for all of our stakeholders. And while we are early in 2020, we are pleased to say that started of the year strong with growth in all segments.
With that, I would like to open it up for questions."

It's a bit wider, I think, too, relative to some of your peers. I guess I'm curious why you're giving a wider range. I hear the China commentary, but I was under the impression, it wasn't particularly large as a percentage of business. So is there something from a macro standpoint? Or is there something from a customer standpoint that you're hearing or worried about?
And then the second question is Frutarom. So I get organic growth for 4Q down about 4%, if you back out the acquisition contribution and the piece of the business from the closing of prior year that you did known for the full quarter, so that gets a full year number down about 1%. So I guess, the question there is you've owned the asset now for a little over 1 year. What's a reasonable run rate of growth? You've talked about 6% of that target longer term, but it just seems like it's not the case anymore. So maybe you're still thinking 6%, but if you could kind of walk through how you're thinking about it, if that's the case. Or what are the moving parts today? That would be helpful."

What do we do in an environment where we are in, which is a pretty, let's say, volatile. It's -- on one hand, certainly, the corona situation, I'll come to that in a second. And then also tariffs, which are not easy to plan. But corona was probably the tipping point for us because it's very hard to quantify, but we know that it will have an impact. With our manufacturing plants actually closed up to last Monday, Tuesday, well, we opened it. We have relatively soft demand. We will see whether we will make it up. We have seen that we have also modest cost increases already on -- particularly on transportation. We have to make sure that we manage our inventory well in this situation because you have, let's say, disruptions in the supply chain.
And one of our bigger customers also said that the travel retail is actually pretty down because people are not traveling too much any longer. Just to give you one very personal example, my family came back from Europe yesterday. My wife told me in Frankfurt that the -- at the border control, there was nobody else. And the airplane, Lufthansa airplane was a smaller one than before, and it was just half booked, so just as to validate what we are seeing and reading. So we said it's probably a prudent thing to widen the guidance range because we just don't know. We hope at least that we will make it up. And as I said, our manufacturing plants are open again, and we are starting to manufacture, and it seems to be all good. But that's how we see it. And I hand it over to Rustom to talk a bit about the guidance."

Let me take now your second question on Frut. We believe when we cycle through, as we said, probably over the course of last year, through some of the onetime effects, we see that this business has good potential of mid-single-digit growth in average, and I come to some of the exceptions here. What we have to cycle through is our compliance issues, we -- issue we had in Russia. Thanks God, it's solved on the legal front now. We have to make sure that on the business side, it's running well. The second thing is the CitraSource, where one of our peer companies lost their big customer, and they are our biggest customer in that business. And then we had the impact on raw material prices on Natural Colors.
So we believe that within the second quarter, we will cycle through these effects and we will grow this business around about mid-single digits. We have actually -- if you look at the different categories, some of these businesses are doing extremely well and have even double-digit growth like inclusions, where gelato is part of it, and the Food Protection business. So we are driving this, and we see also that these businesses are helping us with our cross-selling activities, which is basically reflected in the guidance, by the way. And most of it, it's a Frutarom business, okay?"

First of all, as we said before, we have basically access to 3 more very important core lists on the Scent side. What we see is that the team is executing with the customer very, very closely now on new projects. We will see already some good wins in 2020, but the bulk of it will probably come in 2021. But we see that this is working out very well. And I was myself at the BIC Congress, ACI, the American Cleaning Institute, and I talked myself to many customers. And particularly, the ones where we have won the new core lists, and that's very positive because they're happy with the innovation provided by IFF, and the projects are already starting to ramp up. That's number one.
Number two, and that was -- it was super important for us last year. We saw the inflection point now with the Taste business. We had basically 3, almost 4 quarters, not so great growth. It was fourth quarter in '18 and then up to the third quarter in '19. And we saw that many of our bigger CPG customers had very slow volumes. Not that we were losing businesses but just the volume was very, very low of our business with these customers. And we had, on the other hand, a very good win rate over the course of the year and that started to materialize now in the fourth quarter. And we see already a good start into the first quarter as well with good January numbers. So it looks like that we are coming back on the Taste business to our usually average growth rates. And when I go back here on my spreadsheet, the last 3 years, the average CAGR was 3.9%; last 5 years, 3.7%. And that's certainly a number the business can achieve.
Then on top of it, we look at the Frutarom business, I just gave the answer to Mark. It's a bit backloaded in general because of the cycling through of the topics I just mentioned. Well, what comes on top of it, we see actually a good activity now on the cross-selling. It started slower than we expected, but right now, we have run about 1,000 projects which have significant value for us, where we see that we can combine our products, that we can cross-sell products into combined customers. And that's something which is really, really good and gives us confidence that the growth is -- will be good in our core business over the course of 2020. So that's how we see it. I don't know, Rustom, whether you want to add anything."

Not all of them will hit certainly this year, but it shows the strength. If I would look back maybe 1 year, 1.5 years, I would have hoped it comes faster. But I have to say now, since we are having a really dedicated good team on it and exploring it more, it comes much better than we have expected.

So in the fourth quarter, our gross margin was negatively impacted by higher raw material costs and unfavorable mix, right? So from what I've learned in my first couple of weeks, raw material costs can fluctuate monthly, quarterly due to inventories. And in Taste in Q4, that's really where we saw it. They were primarily impacted by the timing of raw material cost for the balance sheet, the P&L. And that's not much different from what happened in the second quarter. We have Scent, raw materials came in much more favorable. And then if you want to think about specific commodities, in Taste, it was primarily vanilla, and incentive continues to be turpentine in China tariffs, right? Capital, you wanted to -- the cash flow, yes, roughly about 4.5%, next year as well. 4.5% of sales, sorry, 4.5% of sales on capital.
And then the final part of your question, or at least the intermediate part of your question, was about raw materials and how that would flow through into next year, right? And look, in 2020, we believe that raw material costs will stabilize, specifically in the Scent division, where we had the largest raw material increases. Our current purchases are stabilizing.

And we will provide some visibility on this one as well. Where it is tough, and I'm building here on Rustom's comment on to create visibilities on the cross sales. And you see cross sales is 0.5 percentage to 1 percentage point growth for this year. And most of it actually, it comes out of the Frutarom portfolio and that's tough to track. But I think you can model it that most part of it comes out of the Frutarom portfolio, and that should be helpful for you when you model the legacy Frut business.
But we are bringing it together with Taste as actually 2 reasons. One is a very practical business reason. It is helping with our cross-selling activities and bringing the technologies and the people very well together. That's number one.

And a very special welcome to Rustom, our recently appointed CFO, who joined us about 3 weeks ago. We could not be more excited to welcome him to the IFF team as he brings a strong track record over 30 years of operational and financial leadership across several international markets with significant experience in managing global finance teams, developing strategy, driving efficiency initiatives and completing acquisitions. So welcome, Rustom. I would like to take the opportunity to thank Rich O'Leary for his service as our CFO and looking forward to his contributions as our integration lead for the DuPont Nutrition & Biosciences combination. He has deep institutional knowledge, insights and perspectives both financially and strategically and will be enormously valuable as he takes on his new role as our Integration Officer.
On today's call, as usual, I will give an executive overview of our performance for the fourth quarter and full year 2019, including an update on the progress we are making with the integration of Frutarom. Following the discussion, I will ask Rustom to provide a financial review of the business and take you through our financial expectations for 2020. We will also recap IFF's transformational journey and the exciting opportunities we see with our combination with DuPont Nutrition & Biosciences business, which we announced in the fourth quarter 2019. Upon the completion of our prepared remarks, we will take any questions that you may have.
Let's come to 2019. 2019 was a transformational year in IFF's history. It can be categorized as a year of great progress despite some challenges. Over the course of the year, there were many positive accomplishments, including the development of our new strategy, strong progress against our integration synergy targets, unlocking incremental access to new businesses via core lists and announcing our combination with N&B unparalleled in our industry as it will broaden our product offerings and create a global leader in innovative, integrated solutions.
I have also to acknowledge that there were several challenges are like continued raw material cost increases; impactful end market dynamics like destocking; isolated sales pressure, including delayed launches and dissynergies; as well as the Russia and Ukraine compliance issue, which I'm pleased to say that has now been fully completed and closed. In that context, we surpassed $5 billion in sales for the first time and expanded adjusted operating profit margin, excluding amortization, a testament to our team's focus, dedication and commitment to delivering strong results and executing our long-term strategy.
We ended 2019 with meaningful growth in the fourth quarter, seeing 7% currency-neutral revenue growth, including the 4 percentage points related to the 53rd week. We also achieved currency-neutral adjusted EPS growth of 23% excluding amortization, led by volume growth, integration synergies, productivity initiatives, the Brazil tax recovery as well as more favorable tax rate and higher other income. In the fourth quarter, the team was able to continue to exceed expectations on Frutarom cost synergies, capturing approximately $20 million cost synergies driven by procurement harmonization and manufacturing optimization.
This very sustained focus across the organization ultimately positioned IFF to accelerate our vision through the announced combination with DuPont N&B business at the end of the year. The exciting combination will allow us to develop integrated solutions with greater global scale to meet what our customers demand: high-quality products, innovative solutions and strategic partnerships to deliver growth.
But let's take a step back and look at the full year 2019. I'm pleased to say we delivered solid top and bottom line results in a very challenging environment. We realized sales of $5.1 billion, expanded adjusting operating profit margin, excluding amortization by 30 bps to 19.2%. We also delivered strong adjusted earnings per share excluding amortization of USD 6.17, principally led by adjusted operating profit growth, realized synergies and improved productivity. Ultimately, we have many strategic accomplishments that build momentum throughout the year and drove significant value creation.
Our investment innovation includes the opening of IFF Centers of Excellence and innovation hubs in New Jersey and Texas. Specifically, our new Center of Excellence for Food Service and Seasonings in Carrollton, Texas; the opening of our Home & Fabric Care Innovation Center at Bell Works in Holmdel, New Jersey; and the openings of our global service center in Budapest and L'Atelier Du Parfumeur in Grasse, France, reflects our commitment to environmentally responsible real estate development. In addition, we also modernized our largest Scent creative centers in New York and Paris and continued our investment in Greater Asia, including 2 new plants in India and China, which we will complete -- will be completed in 2020.
In June, we took another bold step forward in leading our industry on sustainability when we articulated IFF's new purpose: to redefine and transform how we live and care for the resources of the world. In line with this mission, we accelerated our global industry leadership in sustainability, opening the industry's largest solar array of our facilities in New Jersey and signing on to the United Nations' pledge to help limit global temperature rise. Most recently, IFF was named once again to CDP's A List for climate change and water security, placing our company among a prestigious group of global environmental leaders with AA distinction. And just a week ago, we were named to Barron's 100 Most Sustainable Companies List for the third consecutive year.
Throughout the year, we continued to complete the important work of bringing our colleagues at Frutarom more fully into the IFF family. We have addressed the most significant outselling challenges related to bringing these businesses together and are now in a position to accelerate growth by capturing new opportunities and delivering the solutions our customers need.
But perhaps most importantly, we have continued to achieve significant cost synergies throughout integration process, well ahead of our year 1 cost synergy target, including approximately $50 million cost synergies in 2019. This mainly driven by procurement excellence, but we also have made progress on our operational footprint. We have closed 10 sites in 2019. And I really believe we are on track to deliver more than $145 million in synergies, further supporting the business and driving value to our shareholders. We expect to substantially complete the Frutarom integration by the end of 2020.
The efficient operational execution was complemented by solid year 1 run rate revenue synergies of approximately $15 million. We've identified a strong pipeline of cross-selling opportunities of more than 1,000 projects, representing approximately $150 million of sales and plan to build on this momentum in 2020. We have accelerated the expansion of our Tastepoint model to serve fast-growing local and regional customer segment through increased speed and agility, enabling them to win in the marketplace. We will fully consolidate Frutarom into our legacy IFF business. As we refine our structure and reporting, we're aligning our talent organization and responsibility based on our new structure. With this in mind, starting in Q1 of 2020, we will report financial results as Taste and Scent, incorporating most of Frutarom within our Taste segment.
Lastly, we continue to generate strong cash flows as operating cash flow was up $261 million year-over-year in 2019. We continue to deleverage our balance sheet, improving our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio from 3.6x to 3.2x, putting us on track to deliver on our commitment to be below 3x by the end of 2020. 
With that, I would like to turn it over to Rustom to take us through our financial performance in greater detail."
281407,652781212,1911019,"International Flavors & Fragrances Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Feb 13, 2020",2020-02-13,"Earnings Calls","International Flavors & Fragrances Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Andreas. First, let me say how delighted I am to have joined IFF at this exciting time as we move past the integration of Frutarom to the combination with DuPont's N&B business and the many opportunities and challenges this will bring. For my p",1717,"Thank you, Andreas. First, let me say how delighted I am to have joined IFF at this exciting time as we move past the integration of Frutarom to the combination with DuPont's N&B business and the many opportunities and challenges this will bring. For my part, I expect to focus on: first, improving execution and accountability; second, enhancing effective collaboration across the business, that's legacy IFF, Frutarom, and soon, N&B; third, strengthening our cost discipline; and finally, delivering solid ROI.
Now on to the numbers. Reported sales increased by 29% in 2019 with 3 additional quarters of Frutarom being the major driver. Excluding Frutarom, currency-neutral sales grew 3% with 2019's 53rd week contributing 1%. I'll provide more color on sales by segment as we go through those slides.
Our full year adjusted operating profit margin excluding amortization, rose by 30 basis points, driven by productivity initiatives, acquisition-related synergies and a Brazilian tax recovery. It's also worth noting that in our fourth quarter, our currency-neutral EPS ex amortization grew a robust 23%, driven mostly by acquisition-related synergies, volume growth, lower incentive compensation, a Brazilian tax recovery and a lower effective tax rate, which more than offset a headwind from higher raw material costs and mix.
As the IFF team has done in previous quarters, I would like to highlight the impact of emerging market pricing on our growth rates to better compare to our peers. As a reminder, for a variety of reasons, many of our sales transactions in the emerging markets occur either in U.S. dollars or other hard currencies, or our index to hard currencies when we have to invoice in local market currencies. So when reporting our currency-neutral sales growth, we exclude foreign exchange-related price changes in emerging markets. But this is different from our peers. We believe that our reporting standard provides investors with a truer assessment of underlying currency-neutral growth, especially when there are large emerging market devaluations relative to the U.S. dollar or euro. However, it's important to help all of you understand our performance relative to competition.
For the fourth quarter of 2019, the stronger U.S. dollar environment plus emerging market devaluations year-over-year in several key markets had approximately a 1% currency impact on growth if we include emerging market pricing. For the full year, this impact represented approximately a 2% currency impact on growth.
Breaking it down a little further. Let's move on to Scent on Slide 11. In the fourth quarter, currency-neutral sales increased year-over-year by 6% to $478.3 million. Fourth quarter performance was strongest in Consumer Fragrance, increasing in the high single digits from the prior year, driven by growth in Home, Fabric and Hair Care. Fine Fragrance grew in the mid-single digits year-over-year led by double-digit growth in both Greater Asia and in Latin America. At the same time, Fragrance Ingredients declined in the low single digits from last year as price increases were offset by volume declines, mainly as a result of industry destocking.
For the full year, currency-neutral sales increased by 4% from 2018 to $1.9 billion with growth across all regions and in all categories, especially those that are a strategic focus. Both Fine Fragrance, with record new win contribution, and Consumer Fragrance grew in the mid-single digits from 2018. Our performance in Fine Fragrance was driven by double-digit growth in EAME and Greater Asia, while as in the fourth quarter, Consumer Fragrance was led by strong improvements in Home and Fabric Care. For the year, Fragrance Ingredients improved by low double -- by low single digits driven by price increases.
For the full year, currency-neutral segment profit grew 6% and margin expanded 30 basis points to 17.3%. Drivers included raw materials-driven price increases as well as benefits from productivity initiatives that ran the gamut from manufacturing, procurement and make-versus-buy to innovation.
Moving on to Taste on Slide 12. In the fourth quarter, currency-neutral sales increased year-over-year by 8% to $429.9 million. This performance was led by double-digit growth in Greater Asia and high single-digit growth in North America. Sales to multinationals, which had been under pressure in the last few quarters, grew mid-single digits, indicating an inflection point in Q4.
We also saw a much stronger growth from regional and local customers. From a category perspective, we were strongest in Beverage and Savory, helped greatly by strong new win performance. For the full year, currency-neutral sales increased by approximately 2% to $1.7 billion, driven by high single-digit growth in Greater Asia and low single-digit growth in EAME. As discussed during the year, we had some challenges in North America and Latin America related to volume declines with multinational customers. And as in the fourth quarter, full year 2019 growth was strongest in Beverage and Savory.
For the full year, Taste posted an industry-leading 22.1% segment profit margin with $383 million in segment profit, which was supported by productivity increases, integration-related synergies and lower incentive compensation expense.
Now let's move on to Frutarom's performance on Slide 13. In the fourth quarter, Frutarom currency-neutral sales increased year-over-year by 6%, including the net contribution of acquisitions and divested businesses, which is a sequential improvement in underlying performance. Organic currency-neutral growth for the quarter was 2%, essentially led by our Taste and Savory businesses.
As discussed in past calls, Frutarom experienced compliance and portfolio-related transitory headwinds. Excluding these, organic currency-neutral growth would have been 6%.
For the full year, sales were $1.5 billion for the segment, up 3% on a currency-neutral basis from the prior year, including the net contribution of acquisitions and divested businesses. In 2019, organic sales growth was flat. And if you exclude the transitory issues, organic currency-neutral sales growth was 3%, driven by solid growth in Taste and Savory solutions. The fastest-growing categories at Frutarom include double-digit increases in food protection, inclusions and algae.
For the first -- for the full year, Frutarom's segment profit was $127 million or $286 million, excluding amortization. And we finished the year with a strong quarterly segment profit increase of 24%, led by acquisition-related synergies. The full year operating margin, excluding amortization, was 19.2%, supported by delivering on our acquisition-related synergies and by disciplined cost management.
Slide 14 provides some additional color on cash flow. As you will see, operating cash flow for the full year was up significantly from $438 million in 2018 to $699 million this year, a $261 million or 60% increase. This was driven primarily by higher cash earnings from Frutarom with Frutarom included for the entire year. Core working capital, defined as inventories, accounts receivables and accounts payables, improved year-over-year with progress in all 3 metrics. Inventories still remain at elevated levels primarily due to raw material cost increases and safety stocks within the Scent division. However, in the fourth quarter, we saw continued positive trends.
For 2019, CapEx as a percentage of sales was approximately 4.6%, which is a significant investment in the future. Throughout the year, we made new capital -- made new plant and capacity investments, mainly in greater Asia as well as creative centers, and we invested in high-return integration-related synergy projects such as manufacturing optimization. Bringing all this together, we had a strong $195 million increase in free cash flow for 2019, representing a 73% increase year-over-year.
Moving on to Slide 15. We expect full year 2020 sales of between $5.15 billion and $5.35 billion with adjusted EPS, excluding amortization, between $6.20 and $6.45.
At this point in time, we expect a modest impact on sales from the recent coronavirus outbreak. But we are unable to quantify this as there are just too many variables and uncertainties. In addition, we have already incurred some relatively modest costs related to the outbreak as we acted to mitigate the impact on our supply chain. Right now, it's too early to quantify the impact on our results, but we did widen both our sales and adjusted EPS ex amortization guidance ranges to make some allowance for this as well as for continued volatile operating environment.
The next slide provides some additional color about what we expect to drive our core sales growth for the year. Looking into our 2020 sales growth expectations and given the several moving parts, we felt it was important to give you an overview of the drivers. As you see from this slide, sales growth for 2020 is expected to be approximately 1% to 5% on a currency-neutral basis. This includes a headwind of about 0.5 percentage point impact from portfolio adjustments, namely the carryover impact from compliance at CitraSource and an estimated 1 percentage point impact related to the 53rd week in the prior year period. Excluding these impacts, our core currency-neutral sales growth is expected to be approximately 2.5% to 6.5%, which includes approximately 2% to 5.5% from the organic business, 0.5% to 1% from cross-selling and little to no impact from M&A.
Now let's move to Slide 17 for some additional color on what is driving our EPS growth. Adjusted EPS, excluding amortization growth for 2020, is expected to be approximately 3.5% to 7.5% on a currency-neutral basis. This includes a headwind of approximately 5 percentage points related to an incentive compensation reset, which is due to our performance versus our internal budget in 2019; an anticipated 0.5% impact due to our -- due to the portfolio adjustment; and an estimated 1 percentage point impact related to the 53rd week in the prior year. Excluding those impacts, core currency-neutral adjusted EPS ex amortization is expected to grow in a range of 4% to 8%. We also expect to have a 6% positive contribution from integration synergies, which when added to our core growth puts us in the double-digit growth range.
Moving on to Slide 18. I'm pleased to tell you that we remain on track to deliver on our commitment to delevering down to below 3. -- 3x net debt-to-EBITDA by the end of 2020 while maintaining an investment-grade rating. We are already down to approximately 3.2x, down from 3.6x a year ago, and we will continue to focus on improving working capital, tightly managing our CapEx while making the necessary investments and, of course, growing our cash earnings. To further support achieving this goal, management incentives are aligned to repayment of debt.
With that, let me turn the call back to Andreas."

Very well done. I now want to spend a few moments and highlighting the evolution of IFF from a traditional leader in the flavor and fragrance space to now as it uniquely positioned to redefine our industry at a time when consumers' demands are forcing changes across our customers. With Frutarom, we took the first big step. We can now reach one of the broader set of our CPG customers of all sizes in the world and added critical depth to our position as a top provider of flavors, savory solutions and natural taste solutions. As I mentioned, we are seeing some excellent cross-selling opportunities further supported by our Tastepoint model. With N&B, we take the next leap forward in delivering integrated solutions that allow us to partner with our customers to solve their most pressing problems. It is a truly powerful combination. IFF's leadership in natural solutions and N&B's leadership in clean label, including cultures, enzyme and soy proteins, will be a vital component in creating solutions that meet customer needs for better-for-you products.
Our complementary product portfolio will be among the most balanced in the industry. Together, we will have #1 or #2 positions in the high-value most in-demand ingredients categories across our shared end markets of food and beverage, health and wellness, and home and personal care.
Ultimately, what we are doing is strengthening IFF's position to serve our customers. We are witnessing powerful trends that are forcing all of us to think differently, and we have received very positive customer feedback about that combination. We will be a very powerful leader with even better R&D and application development capabilities and even deeper and more robust product development pipeline in addition to a portfolio that will be among the most balanced in the industry. Importantly, our shared cultures, led by science and creativity, will drive our strengths to unlock the potential of this combination. 
And again, it's really about how we can deliver highly compelling value propositions to all of our customer types. For many of our global multinational customers, we will bring deep experience with high-growth segments, faster speed to market and very deep consumer insights. For local and regional organizations, we will provide global reach to support regional and/or global expansion, paired with a strong local presence and a culture of collaboration. For new brands, we will be their end-to-end partner from idea to production, providing the reliability of scale and the power of global reach.
The opportunity before us is clear and compelling, and we are taking the wide steps to ensure that we are positioning -- positioned to bring these 2 businesses together as efficiently as possible. As we announced along with Rustom's appointment back in December, Rich O'Leary has been named as a lead -- the N&B integration efforts for IFF. Similarly, Angela Naef, N&B's SVP of Global Tech and Innovation, will oversee the N&B integration lead. Each brings unparalleled knowledge of the respective businesses and a diverse operating perspective to this team. We believe that their combination of experience and leadership best positions us to bring this combination to life. As I have had the opportunity to meet with leaders from across N&B business, each of these conversations has reaffirmed that IFF and N&B are perfect partners. While we look forward to hitting the ground running, the deal close is targeted for the first quarter of 2021, providing significant runway for planning and integration-related execution.
As you can see, we have already been diligently working on planning to execute our road map to integrate these businesses. On Slide 22, we are showing that while our N&B integration planning has started and is working in parallel with our ongoing Frutarom integration work, we do expect the business integration work of Frutarom to be completed in the third quarter of 2020, with 90% of the manufacturing consolidation complete as planned. This ensures that we are ready to begin the DuPont N&B integration. We will tap the combined integration muscle of both IFF and N&B along with robust external subject matter experts.
So in summary, we delivered solid top and bottom line results and took clear and significant strategic steps on our journey to lead our industry as an invaluable partner for our customers. In 2019, we surpassed $5 billion in sales for the first time and expanded adjusted operating profit margin, excluding amortization by 30 bps. I'm pleased that we ended the year with a significant acceleration in growth, seeing a 7% currency-neutral revenue increase and a robust 23% increase in currency-neutral adjusted EPS, excluding amortization. Reflecting on the year, we have lots to be proud of. Our key accomplishments include significant integration-related synergies, strong progress in cross-selling, great strides in sustainability and completion of the Russia and Ukraine compliance issue. At the end of the year, in the fourth quarter, we also saw a fundamental improvement in our Taste segment, a key inflection point as we head into 2020.
But I also want to acknowledge that not everything went in our favor in 2019. We experienced significant raw material cost increases across both segments, and sales came in lower-than-expected across all segments for the various reasons we explained earlier. As we look ahead in 2020, leveraging the key learnings from '19, our priorities are very clear: drive growth and profitability in our business, substantially complete Frutarom integration and lay the groundwork to begin successfully combining with N&B. With continued focus on execution, we will be well positioned to become a global leader in innovative, integrated solutions and be able to deliver value creation for all of our stakeholders. And while we are early in 2020, we are pleased to say that start of the year strong with growth in all segments.
With that, I would like to open it up for questions."

It's a bit wider, I think, too, relative to some of your peers. I guess I'm curious why you're giving a wider range. I hear the China commentary, but I was under the impression, it wasn't particularly large as a percentage of business. So is there something from a macro standpoint? Or is there something from a customer standpoint that you're hearing or worried about?
And then the second question is Frutarom. So I get organic growth for 4Q down about 4%, if you back out the acquisition contribution and the piece of the business from the closing of prior year that you did known for the full quarter, so that gets a full year number down about 1%. So I guess, the question there is you've owned the asset now for a little over 1 year. What's a reasonable run rate of growth? You've talked about 6% of that target longer term, but it just seems like it's not the case anymore. So maybe you're still thinking 6%, but if you could kind of walk through how you're thinking about it, if that's the case. Or what are the moving parts today? That would be helpful."

What do we do in an environment where we are in, which is a pretty, let's say, volatile. It's -- on one hand, certainly, the corona situation, I'll come to that in a second. And then also tariffs, which are not easy to plan. But corona was probably the tipping point for us because it's very hard to quantify, but we know that it will have an impact. With our manufacturing plants actually closed up to last Monday, Tuesday, well, we opened it. We have relatively soft demand. We will see whether we will make it up. We have seen that we have also modest cost increases already on -- particularly on transportation. We have to make sure that we manage our inventory well in this situation because you have, let's say, disruptions in the supply chain.
And one of our bigger customers also said that travel retail is actually pretty down because people are not traveling too much any longer. Just to give you one very personal example, my family came back from Europe yesterday. My wife told me in Frankfurt that the -- at the border control, there was nobody else. And the airplane, Lufthansa airplane was a smaller one than before, and it was just half booked, so just as to validate what we are seeing and reading. So we said it's probably a prudent thing to widen the guidance range because we just don't know. We hope at least that we will make it up. And as I said, our manufacturing plants are open again, and we are starting to manufacture, and it seems to be all good. But that's how we see it. And I hand it over to Rustom to talk a bit about the guidance."

Let me take now your second question on Frut. We believe when we cycle through, as we said, probably over the course of last year, through some of the onetime effects, we see that this business has good potential of mid-single-digit growth in average, and I come to some of the exceptions here. What we have to cycle through is our compliance issues, we -- issue we had in Russia. Thanks God, it's solved on the legal front now. We have to make sure that on a business side, it's running well. The second thing is the CitraSource, where one of our peer companies lost their big customer, and they are our biggest customer in that business. And then we had the impact on raw material prices on Natural Colors.
So we believe that within the second quarter, we will cycle through these effects and we will grow this business around about mid-single digits. We have actually -- if you look at the different categories, some of these businesses are doing extremely well and have even double-digit growth like inclusions, where gelato is part of it, and the Food Protection business. So we are driving this, and we see also that these businesses are helping us with our cross-selling activities, which is basically reflected in the guidance, by the way. And most of it, it's a Frutarom business, okay?"

First of all, as we said before, we have basically access to 3 more very important core lists on the Scent side. What we see is that the team is executing with the customer very, very closely now on new projects. We will see already some good wins in 2020, but the bulk of it will probably come in 2021. But we see that this is working out very well. And I was myself at the BIC Congress, ACI, the American Cleaning Institute, and I talked myself to many customers. And particularly, the ones where we have won the new core lists, and that's very positive because they're happy with the innovation provided by IFF, and the projects are already starting to ramp up. That's number one.
Number two, and that was -- it was super important for us last year. We saw the inflection point now with the Taste business. We had basically 3, almost 4 quarters, not so great growth. It was fourth quarter in '18 and then up to the third quarter in '19. And we saw that many of our bigger CPG customers had very slow volumes. Not that we were losing businesses but just the volume was very, very low of our business with these customers. And we had, on the other hand, a very good win rate over the course of the year and that started to materialize now in the fourth quarter. And we see already a good start into the first quarter as well with good January numbers. So it looks like that we are coming back on the Taste business to our usually average growth rates. And when I go back here on my spreadsheet, the last 3 years, the average CAGR was 3.9%; last 5 years, 3.7%. And that's certainly a number the business can achieve.
Then on top of it, we look at the Frutarom business, I just gave the answer to Mark. It's a bit backloaded in general because of the cycling through of the topics I just mentioned. Well, what comes on top of it, we see actually a good activity now on the cross-selling. It started slower than we expected, but right now, we have round about 1,000 projects which have significant value for us, where we see that we can combine our products, that we can cross-sell products into combined customers. And that's something which is really, really good and gives us confidence that the growth is -- will be good in our core business over the course of 2020. So that's how we see it. I don't know, Rustom, whether you want to add anything."

Not all of them will hit certainly this year, but it shows the strength. If I would look back maybe 1 year, 1.5 years, I would have hoped it comes faster.

So in the fourth quarter, our gross margin was negatively impacted by higher raw material costs and unfavorable mix, right? So from what I've learned in my first couple of weeks, raw material costs can fluctuate monthly, quarterly due to inventories. And in Taste in Q4, that's really where we saw it. They were primarily impacted by the timing of raw material cost for the balance sheet, the P&L. And that's not much different from what happened the second quarter. We have Scent, raw materials came in much more favorable. And then if you want to think about specific commodities, in Taste, it was primarily vanilla, and in Scent it continues to be turpentine and China tariffs, right? Capital, you wanted to -- the cash flow, yes, roughly about 4.5%, next year as well. 4.5% of sales, sorry, 4.5% of sales on capital.
And then the final part of your question, or at least the intermediate part of your question, was about raw materials and how that would flow through into next year, right? And look, in 2020, we believe that raw material costs will stabilize, specifically in the Scent division, where we had the largest raw material increases. Our current purchases are stabilizing. And look, it's important to note, there still remain elevated levels and that we will, as we always have, work with our customers and actions, including price increases, to cover that exposure. And I think those were your questions, right? It's good?"

Here, we feel much better because since the factory is -- and that specific factory is opened since last Tuesday, we are probably on safe grounds that we can supply our ingredients to the rest of the company.

And we will provide some visibility on this one as well. Where it is tough, and I'm building here on Rustom's comment on to create visibilities on the cross sales. And you see cross sales is 0.5 percentage to 1 percentage point growth for this year. And most of it actually, it comes out of the Frutarom portfolio and that's tough to track. But I think you can model it that most part of it comes out of the Frutarom portfolio, and that should be helpful for you when you model the legacy Frut business.
But we are bringing it together with Taste as actually 2 reasons. One is a very practical business reason. It is helping with our cross-selling activities and bringing the technologies and the people very well together. That's number one.

And a very special welcome to Rustom, our recently appointed CFO, who joined us about 3 weeks ago. We could not be more excited to welcome him to the IFF team as he brings a strong track record over 30 years of operational and financial leadership across several international markets with significant experience in managing global finance teams, developing strategy, driving efficiency initiatives and completing acquisitions. So welcome, Rustom. I would like to take the opportunity to thank Rich O'Leary for his service as our CFO and looking forward to his contributions as our integration lead for the DuPont Nutrition & Biosciences combination. He has deep institutional knowledge, insights and perspectives both financially and strategically and will be enormously valuable as he takes on his new role as our Integration Officer.
On today's call, as usual, I will give an executive overview of our performance for the fourth quarter and full year 2019, including an update on the progress we are making with the integration of Frutarom. Following the discussion, I will ask Rustom to provide a financial review of the business and take you through our financial expectations for 2020. We will also recap IFF's transformational journey and the exciting opportunities we see with our combination with DuPont Nutrition & Biosciences business, which we announced in the fourth quarter 2019. Upon the completion of our prepared remarks, we will take any questions that you may have.
Let's come to 2019. 2019 was a transformational year in IFF's history. It can be categorized as a year of great progress despite some challenges. Over the course of the year, there were many positive accomplishments, including the development of our new strategy, strong progress against our integration synergy targets, unlocking incremental access to new businesses via core lists and announcing our combination with N&B unparalleled in our industry as it will broaden our product offerings and create a global leader in innovative, integrated solutions.
I have also to acknowledge that there were several challenges are like continued raw material cost increases; impactful end market dynamics like destocking; isolated sales pressure, including delayed launches and dissynergies; as well as the Russia and Ukraine compliance issue, which I'm pleased to say that has now been fully completed and closed. In that context, we surpassed $5 billion in sales for the first time and expanded adjusted operating profit margin, excluding amortization, a testament to our team's focus, dedication and commitment to delivering strong results and executing our long-term strategy.
We ended 2019 with meaningful growth in the fourth quarter, seeing 7% currency-neutral revenue growth, including the 4 percentage points related to the 53rd week. We also achieved currency-neutral adjusted EPS growth of 23% excluding amortization, led by volume growth, integration synergies, productivity initiatives, the Brazil tax recovery as well as more favorable tax rate and higher other income. In the fourth quarter, the team was able to continue to exceed expectations on Frutarom cost synergies, capturing approximately $20 million cost synergies driven by procurement harmonization and manufacturing optimization.
This very sustained focus across the organization ultimately positioned IFF to accelerate our vision through the announced combination with DuPont N&B business at the end of the year. The exciting combination will allow us to develop integrated solutions with greater global scale to meet what our customers demand: high-quality products, innovative solutions and strategic partnerships to deliver growth.
But let's take a step back and look at the full year 2019. I'm pleased to say we delivered solid top and bottom line results in a very challenging environment. We realized sales of $5.1 billion, expanded adjusting operating profit margin, excluding amortization by 30 bps to 19.2%. We also delivered strong adjusted earnings per share excluding amortization of USD 6.17, principally led by adjusted operating profit growth, realized synergies and improved productivity. Ultimately, we have many strategic accomplishments that build momentum throughout the year and drove significant value creation.
Our investment innovation includes the opening of IFF Centers of Excellence and innovation hubs in New Jersey and Texas. Specifically, our new Center of Excellence for Food Service and Seasonings in Carrollton, Texas; the opening of our Home & Fabric Care Innovation Center at Bell Works in Holmdel, New Jersey; and the openings of our global service center in Budapest and L'Atelier Du Parfumeur in Grasse, France, reflects our commitment to environmentally responsible real estate development. In addition, we also modernized our largest Scent creative centers in New York and Paris and continued our investment in Greater Asia, including 2 new plants in India and China, which we will complete -- will be completed in 2020.
In June, we took another bold step forward in leading our industry on sustainability when we articulated IFF's new purpose: to redefine and transform how we live and care for the resources of the world. In line with this mission, we accelerated our global industry leadership in sustainability, opening the industry's largest solar array of our facilities in New Jersey and signing on to the United Nations' pledge to help limit global temperature rise. Most recently, IFF was named once again to CDP's A List for climate change and water security, placing our company among a prestigious group of global environmental leaders with AA distinction. And just a week ago, we were named to Barron's 100 Most Sustainable Companies List for the third consecutive year.
Throughout the year, we continued to complete the important work of bringing our colleagues at Frutarom more fully into the IFF family. We have addressed the most significant outselling challenges related to bringing these businesses together and are now in a position to accelerate growth by capturing new opportunities and delivering the solutions our customers need.
But perhaps most importantly, we have continued to achieve significant cost synergies throughout integration process, well ahead of our year 1 cost synergy target, including approximately $50 million cost synergies in 2019. This mainly driven by procurement excellence, but we also have made progress on our operational footprint. We have closed 10 sites in 2019. And I really believe we are on track to deliver more than $145 million in synergies, further supporting the business and driving value to our shareholders. We expect to substantially complete the Frutarom integration by the end of 2020.
The efficient operational execution was complemented by solid year 1 run rate revenue synergies of approximately $15 million. We've identified a strong pipeline of cross-selling opportunities of more than 1,000 projects, representing approximately $150 million of sales and plan to build on this momentum in 2020. We have accelerated the expansion of our Tastepoint model to serve fast-growing local and regional customer segment through increased speed and agility, enabling them to win in the marketplace. We will fully consolidate Frutarom into our legacy IFF business. As we refine our structure and reporting, we're aligning our talent organization and responsibility based on our new structure. With this in mind, starting in Q1 of 2020, we will report financial results as Taste and Scent, incorporating most of Frutarom within our Taste segment.
Lastly, we continue to generate strong cash flows as operating cash flow was up $261 million year-over-year in 2019. We continue to deleverage our balance sheet, improving our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio from 3.6x to 3.2x, putting us on track to deliver on our commitment to be below 3x by the end of 2020. 
With that, I would like to turn it over to Rustom to take us through our financial performance in greater detail."
281407,652781212,1911648,"International Flavors & Fragrances Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Feb 13, 2020",2020-02-13,"Earnings Calls","International Flavors & Fragrances Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Andreas. First, let me say how delighted I am to have joined IFF at this exciting time as we move past the integration of Frutarom to the combination with DuPont's N&B business and the many opportunities and challenges this will bring. For my p",1717,"Thank you, Andreas. First, let me say how delighted I am to have joined IFF at this exciting time as we move past the integration of Frutarom to the combination with DuPont's N&B business and the many opportunities and challenges this will bring. For my part, I expect to focus on: first, improving execution and accountability; second, enhancing effective collaboration across the business, that's legacy IFF, Frutarom, and soon, N&B; third, strengthening our cost discipline; and finally, delivering solid ROI.
Now on to the numbers. Reported sales increased by 29% in 2019 with 3 additional quarters of Frutarom being the major driver. Excluding Frutarom, currency-neutral sales grew 3% with 2019's 53rd week contributing 1%. I'll provide more color on sales by segment as we go through those slides.
Our full year adjusted operating profit margin excluding amortization, rose by 30 basis points, driven by productivity initiatives, acquisition-related synergies and a Brazilian tax recovery. It's also worth noting that in our fourth quarter, our currency-neutral EPS ex amortization grew a robust 23%, driven mostly by acquisition-related synergies, volume growth, lower incentive compensation, a Brazilian tax recovery and a lower effective tax rate, which more than offset a headwind from higher raw material costs and mix.
As the IFF team has done in previous quarters, I would like to highlight the impact of emerging market pricing on our growth rates to better compare to our peers. As a reminder, for a variety of reasons, many of our sales transactions in the emerging markets occur either in U.S. dollars or other hard currencies, or our index to hard currencies when we have to invoice in local market currencies. So when reporting our currency-neutral sales growth, we exclude foreign exchange-related price changes in emerging markets. But this is different from our peers. We believe that our reporting standard provides investors with a truer assessment of underlying currency-neutral growth, especially when there are large emerging market devaluations relative to the U.S. dollar or euro. However, it's important to help all of you understand our performance relative to competition.
For the fourth quarter of 2019, the stronger U.S. dollar environment plus emerging market devaluations year-over-year in several key markets had approximately a 1% currency impact on growth if we include emerging market pricing. For the full year, this impact represented approximately a 2% currency impact on growth.
Breaking it down a little further. Let's move on to Scent on Slide 11. In the fourth quarter, currency-neutral sales increased year-over-year by 6% to $478.3 million. Fourth quarter performance was strongest in Consumer Fragrance, increasing in the high single digits from the prior year, driven by growth in Home, Fabric and Hair Care. Fine Fragrance grew in the mid-single digits year-over-year led by double-digit growth in both Greater Asia and in Latin America. At the same time, Fragrance Ingredients declined in the low single digits from last year as price increases were offset by volume declines, mainly as a result of industry destocking.
For the full year, currency-neutral sales increased by 4% from 2018 to $1.9 billion with growth across all regions and in all categories, especially those that are a strategic focus. Both Fine Fragrance, with record new win contribution, and Consumer Fragrance grew in the mid-single digits from 2018. Our performance in Fine Fragrance was driven by double-digit growth in EAME and Greater Asia, while as in the fourth quarter, Consumer Fragrance was led by strong improvements in Home and Fabric Care. For the year, Fragrance Ingredients improved by low double -- by low single digits driven by price increases.
For the full year, currency-neutral segment profit grew 6% and margin expanded 30 basis points to 17.3%. Drivers included raw materials-driven price increases as well as benefits from productivity initiatives that ran the gamut from manufacturing, procurement and make-versus-buy to innovation.
Moving on to Taste on Slide 12. In the fourth quarter, currency-neutral sales increased year-over-year by 8% to $429.9 million. This performance was led by double-digit growth in Greater Asia and high single-digit growth in North America. Sales to multinationals, which had been under pressure in the last few quarters, grew mid-single digits, indicating an inflection point in Q4.
We also saw a much stronger growth from regional and local customers. From a category perspective, we were strongest in Beverage and Savory, helped greatly by strong new win performance. For the full year, currency-neutral sales increased by approximately 2% to $1.7 billion, driven by high single-digit growth in Greater Asia and low single-digit growth in EAME. As discussed during the year, we had some challenges in North America and Latin America related to volume declines with multinational customers. And as in the fourth quarter, full year 2019 growth was strongest in Beverage and Savory.
For the full year, Taste posted an industry-leading 22.1% segment profit margin with $383 million in segment profit, which was supported by productivity increases, integration-related synergies and lower incentive compensation expense.
Now let's move on to Frutarom's performance on Slide 13. In the fourth quarter, Frutarom currency-neutral sales increased year-over-year by 6%, including the net contribution of acquisitions and divested businesses, which is a sequential improvement in underlying performance. Organic currency-neutral growth for the quarter was 2%, essentially led by our Taste and Savory businesses.
As discussed in past calls, Frutarom experienced compliance and portfolio-related transitory headwinds. Excluding these, organic currency-neutral growth would have been 6%.
For the full year, sales were $1.5 billion for the segment, up 3% on a currency-neutral basis from the prior year, including the net contribution of acquisitions and divested businesses. In 2019, organic sales growth was flat. And if you exclude the transitory issues, organic currency-neutral sales growth was 3%, driven by solid growth in Taste and Savory solutions. The fastest-growing categories at Frutarom include double-digit increases in food protection, inclusions and algae.
For the first -- for the full year, Frutarom's segment profit was $127 million or $286 million, excluding amortization. And we finished the year with a strong quarterly segment profit increase of 24%, led by acquisition-related synergies. The full year operating margin, excluding amortization, was 19.2%, supported by delivering on our acquisition-related synergies and by disciplined cost management.
Slide 14 provides some additional color on cash flow. As you will see, operating cash flow for the full year was up significantly from $438 million in 2018 to $699 million this year, a $261 million or 60% increase. This was driven primarily by higher cash earnings from Frutarom with Frutarom included for the entire year. Core working capital, defined as inventories, accounts receivables and accounts payables, improved year-over-year with progress in all 3 metrics. Inventories still remain at elevated levels primarily due to raw material cost increases and safety stocks within the Scent division. However, in the fourth quarter, we saw continued positive trends.
For 2019, CapEx as a percentage of sales was approximately 4.6%, which is a significant investment in the future. Throughout the year, we made new capital -- made new plant and capacity investments, mainly in greater Asia as well as creative centers, and we invested in high-return integration-related synergy projects such as manufacturing optimization. Bringing all this together, we had a strong $195 million increase in free cash flow for 2019, representing a 73% increase year-over-year.
Moving on to Slide 15. We expect full year 2020 sales of between $5.15 billion and $5.35 billion with adjusted EPS, excluding amortization, between $6.20 and $6.45.
At this point in time, we expect a modest impact on sales from the recent coronavirus outbreak. But we are unable to quantify this as there are just too many variables and uncertainties. In addition, we have already incurred some relatively modest costs related to the outbreak as we acted to mitigate the impact on our supply chain. Right now, it's too early to quantify the impact on our results, but we did widen both our sales and adjusted EPS ex amortization guidance ranges to make some allowance for this as well as for continued volatile operating environment.
The next slide provides some additional color about what we expect to drive our core sales growth for the year. Looking into our 2020 sales growth expectations and given the several moving parts, we felt it was important to give you an overview of the drivers. As you see from this slide, sales growth for 2020 is expected to be approximately 1% to 5% on a currency-neutral basis. This includes a headwind of about 0.5 percentage point impact from portfolio adjustments, namely the carryover impact from compliance at CitraSource and an estimated 1 percentage point impact related to the 53rd week in the prior year period. Excluding these impacts, our core currency-neutral sales growth is expected to be approximately 2.5% to 6.5%, which includes approximately 2% to 5.5% from the organic business, 0.5% to 1% from cross-selling and little to no impact from M&A.
Now let's move to Slide 17 for some additional color on what is driving our EPS growth. Adjusted EPS, excluding amortization growth for 2020, is expected to be approximately 3.5% to 7.5% on a currency-neutral basis. This includes a headwind of approximately 5 percentage points related to an incentive compensation reset, which is due to our performance versus our internal budget in 2019; an anticipated 0.5% impact due to our -- due to the portfolio adjustment; and an estimated 1 percentage point impact related to the 53rd week in the prior year. Excluding those impacts, core currency-neutral adjusted EPS ex amortization is expected to grow in a range of 4% to 8%. We also expect to have a 6% positive contribution from integration synergies, which when added to our core growth puts us in the double-digit growth range.
Moving on to Slide 18. I'm pleased to tell you that we remain on track to deliver on our commitment to delevering down to below 3. -- 3x net debt-to-EBITDA by the end of 2020 while maintaining an investment-grade rating. We are already down to approximately 3.2x, down from 3.6x a year ago, and we will continue to focus on improving working capital, tightly managing our CapEx while making the necessary investments and, of course, growing our cash earnings. To further support achieving this goal, management incentives are aligned to repayment of debt.
With that, let me turn the call back to Andreas."

Very well done. I now want to spend a few moments and highlighting the evolution of IFF from a traditional leader in the flavor and fragrance space to now as it uniquely positioned to redefine our industry at a time when consumers' demands are forcing changes across our customers. With Frutarom, we took the first big step. We can now reach one of the broader set of our CPG customers of all sizes in the world and added critical depth to our position as a top provider of flavors, savory solutions and natural taste solutions. As I mentioned, we are seeing some excellent cross-selling opportunities further supported by our Tastepoint model. With N&B, we take the next leap forward in delivering integrated solutions that allow us to partner with our customers to solve their most pressing problems. It is a truly powerful combination. IFF's leadership in natural solutions and N&B's leadership in clean label, including cultures, enzyme and soy proteins, will be a vital component in creating solutions that meet customer needs for better-for-you products.
Our complementary product portfolio will be among the most balanced in the industry. Together, we will have #1 or #2 positions in the high-value most in-demand ingredients categories across our shared end markets of food and beverage, health and wellness, and home and personal care.
Ultimately, what we are doing is strengthening IFF's position to serve our customers. We are witnessing powerful trends that are forcing all of us to think differently, and we have received very positive customer feedback about that combination. We will be a very powerful leader with even better R&D and application development capabilities and even deeper and more robust product development pipeline in addition to a portfolio that will be among the most balanced in the industry. Importantly, our shared cultures, led by science and creativity, will drive our strengths to unlock the potential of this combination. 
And again, it's really about how we can deliver highly compelling value propositions to all of our customer types. For many of our global multinational customers, we will bring deep experience with high-growth segments, faster speed to market and very deep consumer insights. For local and regional organizations, we will provide global reach to support regional and/or global expansion, paired with a strong local presence and a culture of collaboration. For new brands, we will be their end-to-end partner from idea to production, providing the reliability of scale and the power of global reach.
The opportunity before us is clear and compelling, and we are taking the wide steps to ensure that we are positioning -- positioned to bring these 2 businesses together as efficiently as possible. As we announced along with Rustom's appointment back in December, Rich O'Leary has been named as a lead -- the N&B integration efforts for IFF. Similarly, Angela Naef, N&B's SVP of Global Tech and Innovation, will oversee the N&B integration lead. Each brings unparalleled knowledge of the respective businesses and a diverse operating perspective to this team. We believe that their combination of experience and leadership best positions us to bring this combination to life. As I have had the opportunity to meet with leaders from across N&B business, each of these conversations has reaffirmed that IFF and N&B are perfect partners. While we look forward to hitting the ground running, the deal close is targeted for the first quarter of 2021, providing significant runway for planning and integration-related execution.
As you can see, we have already been diligently working on planning to execute our road map to integrate these businesses. On Slide 22, we are showing that while our N&B integration planning has started and is working in parallel with our ongoing Frutarom integration work, we do expect the business integration work of Frutarom to be completed in the third quarter of 2020, with 90% of the manufacturing consolidation complete as planned. This ensures that we are ready to begin the DuPont N&B integration. We will tap the combined integration muscle of both IFF and N&B along with robust external subject matter experts.
So in summary, we delivered solid top and bottom line results and took clear and significant strategic steps on our journey to lead our industry as an invaluable partner for our customers. In 2019, we surpassed $5 billion in sales for the first time and expanded adjusted operating profit margin, excluding amortization by 30 bps. I'm pleased that we ended the year with a significant acceleration in growth, seeing a 7% currency-neutral revenue increase and a robust 23% increase in currency-neutral adjusted EPS, excluding amortization. Reflecting on the year, we have lots to be proud of. Our key accomplishments include significant integration-related synergies, strong progress in cross-selling, great strides in sustainability and completion of the Russia and Ukraine compliance issue. At the end of the year, in the fourth quarter, we also saw a fundamental improvement in our Taste segment, a key inflection point as we head into 2020.
But I also want to acknowledge that not everything went in our favor in 2019. We experienced significant raw material cost increases across both segments, and sales came in lower-than-expected across all segments for the various reasons we explained earlier. As we look ahead in 2020, leveraging the key learnings from '19, our priorities are very clear: drive growth and profitability in our business, substantially complete Frutarom integration and lay the groundwork to begin successfully combining with N&B. With continued focus on execution, we will be well positioned to become a global leader in innovative, integrated solutions and be able to deliver value creation for all of our stakeholders. And while we are early in 2020, we are pleased to say that start of the year strong with growth in all segments.
With that, I would like to open it up for questions."

It's a bit wider, I think, too, relative to some of your peers. I guess I'm curious why you're giving a wider range. I hear the China commentary, but I was under the impression, it wasn't particularly large as a percentage of business. So is there something from a macro standpoint? Or is there something from a customer standpoint that you're hearing or worried about?
And then the second question is Frutarom. So I get organic growth for 4Q down about 4%, if you back out the acquisition contribution and the piece of the business from the closing of prior year that you did known for the full quarter, so that gets a full year number down about 1%. So I guess, the question there is you've owned the asset now for a little over 1 year. What's a reasonable run rate of growth? You've talked about 6% of that target longer term, but it just seems like it's not the case anymore. So maybe you're still thinking 6%, but if you could kind of walk through how you're thinking about it, if that's the case. Or what are the moving parts today? That would be helpful."

What do we do in an environment where we are in, which is a pretty, let's say, volatile. It's -- on one hand, certainly, the corona situation, I'll come to that in a second. And then also tariffs, which are not easy to plan. But corona was probably the tipping point for us because it's very hard to quantify, but we know that it will have an impact. With our manufacturing plants actually closed up to last Monday, Tuesday, well, we opened it. We have relatively soft demand. We will see whether we will make it up. We have seen that we have also modest cost increases already on -- particularly on transportation. We have to make sure that we manage our inventory well in this situation because you have, let's say, disruptions in the supply chain.
And one of our bigger customers also said that travel retail is actually pretty down because people are not traveling too much any longer. Just to give you one very personal example, my family came back from Europe yesterday. My wife told me in Frankfurt that the -- at the border control, there was nobody else. And the airplane, Lufthansa airplane was a smaller one than before, and it was just half booked, so just as to validate what we are seeing and reading. So we said it's probably a prudent thing to widen the guidance range because we just don't know. We hope at least that we will make it up. And as I said, our manufacturing plants are open again, and we are starting to manufacture, and it seems to be all good. But that's how we see it.

Let me take now your second question on Frut. We believe when we cycle through, as we said, probably over the course of last year, through some of the onetime effects, we see that this business has good potential of mid-single-digit growth in average, and I come to some of the exceptions here. What we have to cycle through is our compliance issues, we -- issue we had in Russia. Thanks God, it's solved on the legal front now. We have to make sure that on a business side, it's running well. The second thing is the CitraSource, where one of our peer companies lost their big customer, and they are our biggest customer in that business. And then we had the impact on raw material prices on Natural Colors.
So we believe that within the second quarter, we will cycle through these effects and we will grow this business around about mid-single digits. We have actually -- if you look at the different categories, some of these businesses are doing extremely well and have even double-digit growth like inclusions, where gelato is part of it, and the Food Protection business. So we are driving this, and we see also that these businesses are helping us with our cross-selling activities, which is basically reflected in the guidance, by the way. And most of it, it's a Frutarom business, okay?"

First of all, as we said before, we have basically access to 3 more very important core lists on the Scent side. What we see is that the team is executing with the customer very, very closely now on new projects. We will see already some good wins in 2020, but the bulk of it will probably come in 2021. But we see that this is working out very well. And I was myself at the BIC Congress, ACI, the American Cleaning Institute, and I talked myself to many customers. And particularly, the ones where we have won the new core lists, and that's very positive because they're happy with the innovation provided by IFF, and the projects are already starting to ramp up. That's number one.
Number two, and that was -- it was super important for us last year. We saw the inflection point now with the Taste business. We had basically 3, almost 4 quarters, not so great growth. It was fourth quarter in '18 and then up to the third quarter in '19. And we saw that many of our bigger CPG customers had very slow volumes. Not that we were losing businesses but just the volume was very, very low of our business with these customers. And we had, on the other hand, a very good win rate over the course of the year and that started to materialize now in the fourth quarter. And we see already a good start into the first quarter as well with good January numbers. So it looks like that we are coming back on the Taste business to our usually average growth rates. And when I go back here on my spreadsheet, the last 3 years, the average CAGR was 3.9%; last 5 years, 3.7%. And that's certainly a number the business can achieve.
Then on top of it, we look at the Frutarom business, I just gave the answer to Mark. It's a bit backloaded in general because of the cycling through of the topics I just mentioned. Well, what comes on top of it, we see actually a good activity now on the cross-selling. It started slower than we expected, but right now, we have round about 1,000 projects which have significant value for us, where we see that we can combine our products, that we can cross-sell products into combined customers. And that's something which is really, really good and gives us confidence that the growth is -- will be good in our core business over the course of 2020. So that's how we see it. I don't know, Rustom, whether you want to add anything."

So in the fourth quarter, our gross margin was negatively impacted by higher raw material costs and unfavorable mix, right? So from what I've learned in my first couple of weeks, raw material costs can fluctuate monthly, quarterly due to inventories. And in Taste in Q4, that's really where we saw it. They were primarily impacted by the timing of raw material cost for the balance sheet, the P&L. And that's not much different from what happened the second quarter. We have Scent, raw materials came in much more favorable.

This is truly a remarkable m",1988,"Thank you, Mike. Good morning, and good afternoon, everyone. At IFF, with global operations in 44 countries and sales into approximately 200 countries, we have seen firsthand how the coronavirus pandemic has touched our world. This is truly a remarkable moment in history. It presents all of us with new challenges, but also revealed the best humanity at the same time. On behalf of every one at IFF, I want to express my sincere sympathy for all those affected by pandemic. 
I also want to thank every one in the global health care community who exemplifies the best of all of us in responding to this crisis with courage and grace. Everyone on the frontline who continue to keep our society moving forwards has our thanks. To all the essential workers in the consumer goods supply chain, of which IFF is proud to play an important role, we thank you for responding so quickly and moving swiftly to deliver for consumers around the world. This is very clear that we are still in the early stages of adjusting to the changes the pandemic process to our world. As we'll review in more detail later, the IFF business is strongly positioned to be resilient through economic cycles given our substantial portfolio delivering needed solutions to vital consumers and markets. 
The steps we have taken in recent years, including diversifying of our customer base and expansion into more categories, have only served to further strengthen our ability to be a vital partner to our customers and affirm our ability to be resilient through the cycles. Like many, we are seeing uneven impacts on our business due to the pandemic and the resulting economic challenges. While some end markets are seeing increases in demand, others are seeing notable declines. We are fortunate that only about 15% of our revenue, not including Fragrance Ingredients, that is subject to the downward pressure right now. However, the unpredictable nature of the pandemic and the early stage of the economic impact creates enough uncertainty for us that we have made the decision to withdraw our full year financial guidance. Rustom will cover this in more detail later. But while we navigate through this challenge, we are committed to providing as much forward outlook as we can so you understand the trends driving earnings. 
On today's call, I will provide an executive overview of our operational and financial performance for the first quarter 2020 before offering a more in-depth review of IFF management of the ongoing and evolving COVID-19 situation. Following this discussion, I will ask Rustom to provide a more detailed financial review of business, including additional insight into our liquidity and capital structure, which is very strong, given the uncertainty of the pandemic going forward. 
As you may also have seen, today, we announced important progress related to our pending combination with DuPont Nutrition & Biosciences, including a new guiding purpose and vision for the future combined company as well as our operating model and executive management team post close. Following Rustom's remarks, I will provide an overview of these important integration updates. Upon the completion of our prepared commentary, we will take any questions that you may have. 
Our strong performance for the first quarter 2020 affirms the strength of our organization and the essential position in serving vital end markets through economic cycles. We achieved a strong start to the year with mid-single-digit sales and double-digit adjusted EPS ex amortization growth, both of which are currency-neutral basis. Importantly, we continue to achieve financial benefits related to our integration of the Frutarom business, both revenue and cost synergies. 
As I mentioned before, we have also made significant progress with integration planning to support our combination with the DuPont N&B business. And I must acknowledge our teams that have worked hard to build the foundation for this combination while continuing to contribute to IFF's day-to-day operations. 
Our teams have worked tirelessly to deliver for our customers and have gone above and beyond to support our communities around the world during this time. Our strong quarter is a testament to their unwavering dedication, the underlying strength of our business and our role as an essential partner in the global food and consumer product supply chains. While we have certainly faced many challenges through these unprecedented situation, our operations and global network remains strong, and we have taken appropriate steps to ensure our business is well positioned to successfully manage through the pandemic. 
Looking at our financial performance in the first quarter. I am pleased to say we delivered strong improvements across key financial metrics. In the first quarter, IFF achieved sales of USD 1.3 billion, which represents a 6% growth on a currency-neutral basis, driven by our performance in both our Taste and Scent businesses. We also achieved strong adjusted earnings per share of $1.62, excluding amortization, reflecting a 13% year-over-year increase on a currency-neutral basis, led by currency-neutral adjusted operating profit of 9% to USD 271 million. 
In addition, we expanded our operating margin, excluding amortization, by 60 basis points to 20.1%, driven by volume growth and productivity. In summary, IFF entered 2020 with solid momentum and continued to deliver currency-neutral sales growth in the high single digits through the end of February. However, for March onwards, we started to see the global impact of COVID-19 on our business, and we expect this to impact our results in the second quarter as we have seen uneven impact across end markets. Rustom will touch on this in more detail later. 
I would like to spend a few moments outlining the key characteristics and drivers of our business, which leave IFF very well positioned to navigate today's new reality. More than ever, it is clear that IFF plays a vital role in the global CPG supply chain, especially for world's most important manufacturers in food and beverage as well as essential home, personal care and sanitation supplies. 
IFF's broad-based exposure across regions, categories and customer positions us to remain resilient through the ongoing challenges brought about by the pandemic. As a result of regulatory actions and corresponding economic challenges, we are seeing certain reduction and demand in our Fine Fragrance, Cosmetic Active and Food Service offerings where end markets are seeing significant impact. This represents approximately 15% of our revenue. At the same time, we're seeing tremendous pickup in areas with the solutions that IFF are absolutely critical to the production of essential products. Our categories exposed to packaged food and beverage and hygiene and disinfection saw continued strong growth during the quarter. That is about 85% of our revenue. 
Fortunately, our operations remain strong as we continue to deliver the creative solutions that our customers and end consumers demand during these unprecedented times. Our goal from the outset of this crisis has been twofold. First, we are deeply determined to ensure the well-being of our people. Second, we are committed to preserving continued across the network so that we can continue meeting the needs of our customers. Our global, regional and local crisis teams are working around the clock to do what is the best for our people and our business. A co-working group, including representative from our executive team and across functional support groups and business teams, meets daily to ensure alignment from top to bottom across our teams. This team is putting in place plans and protocols to be sure we are anticipating what is to come and keep all of our stakeholders engaged through this extended period of disruption. 
We have been proactively reviewing our resiliency plan to address the COVID-19 developments, and we are coordinating our response with federal and local health and government entities around the world. We have updated internal protocols as the situation has evolved, taking significant measures to protect our people, including implementing enhanced disinfection and sanitation measures at our operational facilities and taking precautions to minimize contact among employees as part of social distancing by grouping our professionals into smaller pots and separating their work shifts. For those able to work from home, we're instituting a remote working policy across many of our locations as well. 
Given IFF's vital role in the consumer product supply chain, we continue to secure essential designations that provide our company with permission to manufacture our products around the world as governments extend workplace restrictions. A good example of our team working through these unexpected challenges has been India. Recently, our Chennai facility, where we have been secured essential business designations, was still forced to shut for several days due to regulatory restrictions. Thanks to the diligence of our team and a strong working relationship with regulators, we were able to move ahead of time in response to the shutdown to meet all customer demands through the shutdown while keeping employees safe. 
In terms of our operations, we are seeing some challenges with logistics, and our lead times have increased, but the team is doing an excellent job navigating the transportation restrictions. We realize we are certainly not alone in this challenge. For these reasons, we have also seen some limitation in raw material distribution and have activated our contingency plans to limit the disruption that any material shortages might have for our customers.  
Where we have seen disruptions to our supply chain, it has been mostly limited to the regions where the most significant government restrictions are in place, including Italy, Spain and India. On the new project and innovation front, most of our creative centers remain open and are engaging remotely as needed, and I'm happy to say that our project an remains solid across our entire portfolio. 
As I mentioned from the outset, our business has displayed impressive resilience through the evolving situation. We continue to proactively take steps that will ensure that IFF is operating from a position of financial strength. Specifically, we're adapting an especially disciplined approach to cost management. This means we are tightening any nonessential spend and reviewing new opportunities for efficiencies that can preserve our margin profile. We also are looking at CapEx and considering near-term priorities while pushing out longer-term investments as appropriate. And we are considering additional ways to optimize our net working capital by closely reviewing existing inventories and pursuing collections. Lastly, we have a strong cash position with USD 1 billion of untapped credit revolver available, giving us confidence in ensuring our strong position even in the event of a prolonged economic downturn. 
Even in the midst of increased demand and the challenging operating environment, our teams have mobilized to support frontline health care workers and first responders across the global IFF network. IFFers across the globe have found very creative ways to leverage the company's unique capabilities and innovative spirit and lead a number of exciting community-focused initiatives, including from New Jersey to the Netherlands, IFF has modified our production facilities to allow for the manufacture and distribution of hand sanitizers. To date, I have estimated more than 65 metric tons of handset sanitizers globally to first responders and other organizations in need. Our North America Scent creative team quickly developed a new scent, HOPE 2020, that has been used by IFF and other partners in the production of hand sanitizers. Our Scent team has also partnered with Harvard Medical School and Mass General Hospital to create early detection smell test for asymptomatic carriers, the first develop globally. In India, our facilities donated food and other necessary sanitation items to local orphanages, hospitals and police stations. These actions speak to how our employees continue to embody our commitment to care for the resources of our world, and nothing could be more important than caring for our communities. 
I could not be more proud of the spirit of caring that IFF has demonstrated throughout the global pandemic. With that, I would like to turn it over to Rustom, who will discuss our first quarter financial performance in greater detail."
281407,665128569,1981886,"International Flavors & Fragrances Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, May 12, 2020",2020-05-12,"Earnings Calls","International Flavors & Fragrances Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Andreas. Now to Slide 12, I'm taking a more detailed look at our quarterly financial performance. On a currency-neutral basis, IFF delivered broad-based sales growth of 6% versus 2019's first quarter. Adjusted operating profit margin improved",1866,"Thank you, Andreas. Now to Slide 12, I'm taking a more detailed look at our quarterly financial performance. 
On a currency-neutral basis, IFF delivered broad-based sales growth of 6% versus 2019's first quarter. Adjusted operating profit margin improved in both Taste and Scent with procurement synergies, volume leverage and productivity initiatives and disciplined research, sales and administration for RSA cost containment. And this helped reduce our operating expenses as a percentage of sales. I am therefore pleased to say that we also saw solid profit growth in roughly 60 points of currency-neutral margin expansion on an adjusted operating profit mix amount basis. 
COVID-19 did impact our P&L in Q1, but more in terms of sales mix rather than in total dollars and only in the final weeks of the quarter. It did have a modest negative impact on our adjusted operating profit in the quarter, causing us to incur extra manufacturing costs, additional freight expenses and higher raw material costs. But most of these went into inventory and will not be in expenses. 
Our currency-neutral earnings per share, excluding amortization, grew a strong 13%, with robust operating profit growth boosted by lower year-on-year interest expenses and a lower effective tax rate. FX adversely impacted our reported numbers, including sales and adjusted operating profits down a couple of percent. It had a much larger negative impact on other income/expenses in March as a result of currencies collapsing globally against the dollar and the euro. So on a reported basis, this pulled down year-on-year adjusted EPS growth. 
Now looking at our Scent division on Slide 13. In the first quarter, currency-neutral Scent sales grew 7% with growth in all regions and nearly all categories. Sales performance was strongest in Consumer Fragrance with a double-digit increase led by robust growth in fabric, home and hair care. And while we did experience a volume lift from COVID-19, especially from the increase in hygiene and disinfection categories, we also benefited from strong new wins, including with customers where we have recently gained access through their colleagues. We also saw high single-digit growth in Fragrance Ingredients, led by robust volume growth. 
At the same time, Fine Fragrance sales declined as disruption of consumer access to retail markets, and a pronounced drop in global travel due to COVID-19 led to deceleration late in the quarter. Fine Fragrance has started 2020 well and was growing until the last couple of weeks of the quarter even against last Q1 double-digit comp. And then we saw a significant contraction as our customers adapted their supply chains for new store closure and travel realities. This trend has continued in Q2 with a far greater impact, and I will elaborate on this shortly. 
For the entire Scent segment, we posted a 20.4% segment profit margin. And segment profit grew to $105 million, up 19% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by volume growth and lower operating expenses. 
Moving to Taste on Slide 14. We saw currency-neutral sales growth of 5% in the first quarter having achieved increases in all regions. We saw mid- to high single-digit growth in LatAm, Greater Asia and EMEA. From a category perspective, we again saw significant mid-teens growth in Savory Solutions with very strong growth in EMEA, our largest market, and also LatAm. 
Flavors grew low single digits, led by Greater Asia and Latin America. And this was driven by strong commercial performance on new wins,  in particular, in the attractive categories of beverage and dairy. 
Though Frutarom is now mostly incorporated in the Taura business, we did commit to continue providing updates as to how sales are doing as if this had remained on a stand-alone basis. So if we had measured Frutarom as a stand-alone, currency-neutral sales would have grown by roughly 4% versus the prior year. 
For the entire Taste business, we had a 16.5% margin with segment profit growing 6% to $137 million, led by volume benefits and Frutarom integration-related synergies. You may have noticed that this segment profit margin appears lower than you are used to seeing. This is because Frutarom is now included, and there is approximately $44 million of amortization of intangible assets. 
Now I would like to provide an update on cash flow through the first quarter of 2020. The chart on Page 15 is designed to show the reconciliation from reported net income to cash flow, inclusive of all the drivers. Operating cash flow was $17 million in the first quarter, down from $47 million in 2019's first quarter, primarily due to higher core working capital levels. Within core working capital, we had solid improvements in inventory that were offset by higher accounts receivable as a result of strong sales in Q1 2020 as well as 2019 calendar effect. We expect the portion of this will normalize as we move through the year. Nevertheless, our cash conversion cycle in Q1 2020 was consistent with 2019's first quarter. 
We continue to invest in the business, particularly for planned capacity increases and Frutarom integration. Our capital expenditures as a percentage of sales in the first quarter of 2020 was 3.6%, and this was versus last year's 4.5%. And I will touch on our outlook for the balance of the year at the moment. 
The net impact on our free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less CapEx, were a negative $31 million. As a reminder, Q1 is our seasonably lowest quarter of the year, and last year, it was a negative $11 million. 
In terms of cash usage, M&A and earn-outs and dividends amounted to $94 million versus $112 million in the prior year's first quarter, and this was all due to lower M&A and earn-outs. As Andreas noted before, we are taking steps to preserve our strong financial position at this time. Given the current environment and the possibility that the global economy could face a protracted downturn, we are constantly refining our scenario planning to ensure we are well prepared. This starts with controlling what we can control, targeting reductions in operational and capital expenses. We are being very cautious with hiring, mainly just critical replacement positions and a handful of critical new hires. And we are reducing any and all nonessential spend in the near term, including the likes of travel, entertainment, consulting, et cetera. 
COVID-19 does bring some working capital headwind. We have experienced supply chain disruptions as various countries took lockdown action. We value our long-term customer relationships, so we purchased additional raw materials to serve as safety stocks, giving us capability to move manufacturing around and, in general, to help insulate against supply chain disruption as we've seen in India. We are also paying some of our smaller and/or COVID-19-impacted suppliers more promptly if this is warranted. And this could be expected. We're experiencing an increase in receivables, particularly from Food Service and Fine Fragrance customers. 
Of course, we're working to offset these working capital pressures where we can. For inventory, we are constantly balancing the need to ensure business continuity during COVID-19 with the need to not over order. Where we could extend our payables, we are working with suppliers to do so. And we are pursuing collections from customers with overviews and being proactive with those where there is credit risk. 
For capital expenditures, we are targeting reductions across the business. Specifically, we are prioritizing the highest-returning projects while delaying longer-term investments that are not absolutely necessary at this time. And of course, practically, COVID-19 is making it much harder to launch our complete projects where significant travel is required.  Moving forward, we also have to be smart to ensure that we invest in a flexible and healthy ecosystem. 
Turning to Slide 17. As we consider our current capital structure and manage our balance sheet moving forward, we've outlined our upcoming debt maturity schedule, which includes a good balance of short- and long-term tiers. We have strong and ample liquidity, well within our debt covenants as our net debt-to-EBITDA at the end of Q1 2020 was 3.3x. Our cash position at the end of Q1 is strong at $433 million with $1 billion of an untapped credit revolver available should we need it. Looking ahead, following the close of the DuPont N&B transaction, we are committed to maintaining our investment-grade rating. As stated in December, we intend to quickly delever after the close of the transaction to get below 3x net debt-to-EBITDA within the following 24 months. 
Now turning to our outlook. To conceptualize our expected sales dynamic in Q2, I wanted to highlight the many moving parts we are seeing and expecting this quarter. COVID-19 presents both opportunities and challenges as we forge ahead. Starting on the left side of the slide, we expect to see continued robust growth in our Taste business, excluding Food Service as well as in our consumer Fragrance business. The demand and consumption of the products that these businesses are supporting remain high, and we are well positioned with our global footprint to capitalize on this. In the middle box is Fragrance Ingredients where demand is strong. However, we are facing challenges in the supply chain and,  in particular, the Indian lockdown. This means that we have to forgo external sales to ensure that we protect our Fragrance Compounds business. 
The last category is where demand has been adversely impacted by COVID-19. Food Service, with a vast stay-at-home orders across the globe as well as changes in consumer behaviors, have impacted away-from-home consumption. Fine Fragrance and Cosmetic Actives, where the retail channels have been temporarily closed and travel retail is down, both due to COVID-19, as well as these categories being more discretionary in nature. 
Now more than ever, IFF's broad-based exposure across regions, categories and customers positions us to remain resilient through the ongoing challenges. We are fortunate that the majority of our revenues comes from categories exposed to packaged food and beverage and from hygiene and disinfection, so parts of our business are experiencing higher sales volumes in this current environment. Having said this, we're not totally immune. Not surprisingly, April's currency-neutral sales were challenged, with strong Consumer Fragrance and Flavors, offset primarily by weakness in Fine Fragrance and Food Service. For the second quarter, while we are not giving specific guidance, it is worth noting that with the pressure in Fine Fragrances, operating margin mix will be a headwind as well as with additional COVID-19-related costs. 
We continue to evaluate what evolving global market dynamics will mean for our business performance and projections moving forward. As the second quarter progresses and we gain greater visibility, as Andreas noted, we'll provide updates as appropriate. While our ability to pivot quickly and modify our daily operation has enabled us to responsibly operate our business, the constantly evolving global responses to COVID-19 have created uncertainties for IFF and for other companies and our partners as well. Given the extent of the current uncertainty globally and the potential for uneven impact on our businesses, we have decided to withdraw our fiscal 2020 guidance. We will continue to manage our business by taking actions to generate strong cash flow and maintain ample liquidity. 
With that, let me turn the call back over to Andreas."

As you know, we are extremely excited to combine our 2 customer-focused and consumer-led organizations with leading positions in high-value categories. Together, our product portfolio will be among the industry most robust and diverse. We have a coveted R&D program with an industry-leading pipeline, and most importantly, we will be poised to redefine our industry by delivering essential solutions to our customers. We remain on target to close the transaction in the first quarter of 2021. Until then, IFF and N&B will remain independent entities and will operate separately. 
Since we announced our merger in December 2019, our teams have been hard at work bringing this combination to life. We have formal integration management office, cleared the U.S. regulatory process, filed for regulatory events in Europe and China and filed our initial registration statement. The potential of this combination continues to excite our teams, and we are working diligently to make sure we can hit the ground and full sprint on day 1. 
Some of our important highlights over the past 4 months include: completed strategic assessment of the future combined company portfolio, joint cross-function integration program in place and operational, created ideation framework to identify, assess and prioritize synergy opportunities. Today, we took another significant step forward. We have announced our purpose, vision and operating model and Executive Committee for the future combined company. In short, we are announcing who we'll be, what we intend to do and who will lead our incredible team once we combined forces with the N&B business in the first quarter of 2021. 
Our purpose is the why that drives everything we do. The combined companies' purpose, applying science and creativity for a better world, we'll focus on our intent to push past traditional industry boundaries and commit to be a force for a better, more sustainable future. We will shape the future of our industry with best-in-class solutions at the intersection of science and creativity where passionate organizations, major team members who see their job as so much more. Our collective purpose inspires us every day to strive for better. 
It's not just that we are talented scientists and creators, but that we are passionate about using those talents to generate results for our customers and for the world. We need both, the rigor of scientific expertise and the imagination of new possibilities, to create the best results. The fusion of both that will lead us to realizing the full potential of this combination. 
Everything we do is for the purpose of improving the world, lengthening life spans, replacing or sustaining resources, enhancing sensorial experiences, solving house problems and more. And together, we can do even more good. 
Creative science, scientific art, when science and creativity intersect, the possibilities are better. Here, innovation is a business department. It's our business. Incredible curiosity, relentless drive, purposeful impact, innovation is simply our way of operating and now with double the R&D resources unmatched in the industry. If you are keeping track, our people can't wait to get starting collaborating on something new. 
We are shaping the future of the industry for the better. Our vision is our strategy for future success. It articulates our aspirations and guides the development of future strategies and initiatives. It is a filter by which endeavors can be evaluated. Our vision is to be the partner for essential solutions. From day 1, we will bring unmatched innovation and leading-edge insight to anticipate what will be essential to tomorrow's consumers. Helping our customers and consumers need is at the heart of our business. 
We are more than a vendor or supplier. Yes, we supply the ingredients, compounds and solutions you require, but we're also united in understanding and meeting the challenges of today and tomorrow. Essential solutions means that we will work to make both our relationship and what we provide invaluable to our customers' business. It pushes us to supply technology and know-how that no one else can. With customers of all sizes across the globe, from start-up to multinational, we have the agility and the expertise to deliver more of what you need. Unmatched innovation and leading-edge insight means we are already anticipating what will be essential to tomorrow's consumers.  As we come together as 1 organization, we can help our customers meet consumers' needs faster. 
Our new operational model will leverage the capabilities and offerings of both organizations to create a sustainable framework that best position our teams, customers, shareholders for success on day 1 and well into the future. The complementary structure will focus our organization into 4 divisions: Taste, Food and Beverage, Scent, Health and Bioscience, and Pharma Solutions. We carefully examined how each division go to market, including customer overlap, R&D focus and service level requirements. Among other, several factors to make sure we create global divisions that we have built for success. 
Just as important as our 4 operating divisions will be our global centralized functions. Each of these will work in collaboration across our divisions. I want to call out,  in particular, that we will be establishing a new integrated solution Center of Excellence to focus on incubating new business opportunities and total product solutions. We are also creating a Center for Commercial Excellence to support our business and commercial teams through development of best practices, customer insights and analysis, resource deployment and the optimization of pricing strategies and solutions. These 2 are extremely important as they will be instrumental in collaborating with the business to achieve our revenue synergy goals. 
We also announced the Executive Committee for the combined company, including highly qualified and diverse leaders with deep knowledge and expertise. If you're interested in the team's background, please check out on strongerinnovationtogether.com. I will go through all of these distinguished leaders here, but I will note that this was a particular challenging process. Most organizations have tremendously talented individuals. We are fortunate that as a significantly large organization, we will be able to create many challenging, exciting new opportunities to further the carriers of our employees. 
I'm also very encouraged by the world-class Board of Directors we are beginning to assemble. As shared at the deal announcement, DuPont Executive Chairman and CEO, Ed Breen, will join the Board of the combined company as the DuPont designee following the close of a transaction and will serve as lead Independent Director starting in June 1, 2021. 
I'm also pleased to say that Matthias Heinzel, President of Nutrition & Biosciences at Dupont, will be joining the Board of Directors of IFF following the close of the transaction. Under his leadership, Matthias has strategically transformed the N&B business, driving customer-focused innovation, operational effectiveness and multiple business integrations. As an Independent Director, his extensive global management experience and deep knowledge of the industry will support the future company as it unlocks the value of the merger. 
In addition, Carol A. Davidson will also be appointed to join the Board of Directors of the future combined company following the close of the transaction. Ms. Davidson is a CPA with more than 30 years of leadership experience across multiple industries. She has held a variety of leadership roles at Tyco, International Tea and Dell Inc. and financial leadership boards at the Eastman Kodak Company. Ms. Davidson is the lead Independent Director of Legg Mason and serves on the Board of TE Connectivity. For this team, both Board and management, I know our combined company will charge a new path forward for our industry and have a powerful impact on the world around us. 
Stepping back, I will say that I'm deeply impressed, even more so given COVID-19, by the dedication and focus both the IFF and N&B teams have brought to this effort. We knew early on that these companies would be a strong cultural match, and our excitement and conviction behind the potential of this combination was only grown as our teams begin more and more to cooperate. As we look ahead, we are focused on executing the next key milestones and will do so within the same spend and diligence we have achieved thus far. 
In summary, we are pleased with our strong financial performance despite an unprecedented first quarter 2020. We delivered on all of our key metrics and saw broad-based growth in both divisions with mid-single-digit sales and double-digit adjusted EPS ex amortization growth on a consolidated basis. We continue to make important progress in the integration of Frutarom business and have taken substantial steps forward in bringing on our combination with DuPont and N&B to life. 
I'm also credibly proud of each and every one of my colleagues at IFF for what they have achieved during these challenging times, not just for our business, but for our partners, our customers and our communities. 
While global conditions remain volatile in the near term, our order book for Q2 looks solid as we are successfully navigating through these unprecedented times to emerge as a stronger company. 
I would now like to open the call for questions."

The emerging markets in the first quarter were particularly strong, Latin America by around about 10% and Greater Asia by plus 9%. What we see in terms of the different categories,  in particular, the Consumer Fragrance in Latin America in high-teens, as well as Flavors, high single, and Savory solutions in high-teens as well. So really, really good results. Probably strongest from the multinationals, specifically in the HBC field. In Asia, it was all about Consumer Fragrances as well, so mid-teens, really good. Taste in high single digits. No surprise to COVID-19, I would say. And here in Asia, very much across both multinationals as well as regional and locals. Frutarom, as we said, is probably around about 4% growth with some benefits of smaller M&A, but still a very, very good performance. 
I would say, country-wise, it depends where the COVID-19 started. We have seen the first impact in Asia, in particular, in China, then moved to Europe, then to the U.S. and Latin America. So that's probably what you can see in the first quarter. 
In terms of the pipeline, our pipeline remains strong also into the second quarter. But having said all of that, it's really different from customer to customer. I can say, also for us, our accretive labs are basically almost all open. They're working on new launches. They're working on, let's say, better, let's say, improvements of some of the products. So all in all, I would say, a very strong picture. Certainly, impact on Fine Fragrance because -- and you heard this from our customer base as well, which is not positive. But all the essential products are really really going actually very, very strong. 
Rustom, you might comment on that."

In all of the categories, #1 and #2 in the market. We have a great R&D pipeline with a combined spend of around about $550 million, $50 million. More than 9,000 patents granted. So I believe very, very robust. And as you have seen the N&B results in the first quarter as well, it shows it's an essential business. Probiotics are going gangbusters and many of the other portfolio areas as well. 
Coming back to the integration fees. So as you know, we have formed an IMO, so an integration management office. We cleared antitrust in the U.S. We filed in Europe and in China. The combined integration planning can do a lot, which is even in these challenging times, and I'm very, very pleased how they worked together all over Zoom or Skype. Of course, it's very, very interesting. So we really make sure that we are ready for day 1. The next up on the schedule is the shareholder vote in September, then the financing and then the close, hopefully, in the first quarter 2021. So I have to say that this COVID-19 has further solidified our position. Strategic logic is very strong. Very resilient business. Very great market position. And I believe that we're in a very, very good spot right now."

We are fortunate that most of our revenue comes from the packaged food and beverage categories as well as hygiene and disinfection, right? Those -- so we have continued strength there.

As always, sort of trying to be cognizant of the safety of our employees and well-being as we go forward. 
China, regarding the China, part of your question. Fine Fragrance is a very small part of the portfolio, I mean, based on category demand, I mean, less than 2% of total fine.

And we believe on the Consumer Fragrance side, certainly, the activity in washing clothes and detergent, the softness -- it's very much demand. It's not so much stockpiling here. I think we see this. We see also all the hygiene products are really used. It's not just that people put it in the pantry. But that's what we see. And also on the food side, when you talk to some of our customers, the yogurts are going like there's no tomorrow, which is probably not a big surprise to all of us because working from home, instead of going to the company cafeteria, you go to the fridge and pull your yogurt and that's your lunch. So we see some categories very much it's consumption. It's moving, but I can't give you all the details. What is for us, right now, really important is on the consumer insight side. We do all of our studies. We know how the consumer behaves right now. But what is sustainable? So that we really can orient ourselves in terms of our R&D and the new product development towards things which might well come. We believe that everything in terms of sanitizing will stay. We believe also that many of the health products,  in particular, fortified with vitamins or probiotics will stay. But there's more and more to come. So that's the work we are doing right now. So in many areas, the consumption is real. By the way, one last one, potato chips are also going like gangbusters. But Rustom, please comment."

Consumer demand remains high in hygiene and disinfection. And if anyone has been to the store lately, it's just hard to get those products, right? 
But let me address one aspect, too. I mean that's same profitability because of specifics and we got to fine, right? profitability without [indiscernible] will be adversely impacted in Q2. I don't -- I can't get into -- I don't want to get into specifics, but based on our largest -- one our largest Fine Fragrances customer are saying publicly, the category is declining double digits. So I'd expect the same for IFF and our competitors. And being that it is one of our highest-margin categories, well above consolidated average, and with these declines, margins will be down. Then you add in additional costs that we had in Q2, a full quarter's worth, and that's just another factor."

You might remember at the beginning, toilet paper was also very precious article around the world in many of the supermarkets. But that's back to normal. So actually, we have seen already quite a normalization, not because COVID is gone, but people see and feel that they can buy whatever they need. There was not a big disruption in the supply chain. So we believe that the inventory has changed. It's different than pharmaceuticals, for example, where people just keeping their diabetes product better for 3 or 4 months instead of 1 month to make sure that they are covered. But here, I think in many cases, we are already back to normal. 
On the plants, it's a bit of a different situation because we are managing the supply chain actually almost by the week because India, which is a big country for raw materials in our industry, has some challenges with lockdown as well. So you really had to make sure that we get enough inventory in all the plants around the world to secure supply for our customers. So here, you probably will see some elevated inventory levels for quite some time. But again, situation is volatile. I expected this actually for the first quarter as well. But we were selling so much, the inventory actually went down. So that's our plan of basically what what we assume for now, but it might change because it's very dependent on the demand as well.

And in terms of geography, it's about 3/4 Taste and the rest in Scent roughly, okay? 
The Scent synergies showed through. And as you saw Scent's performance, there's leverage. But Taste, where you're homing in, did benefit some synergies as well. But it also had mix. I mean we went straight there. We also had mid-teens growth in Savory solutions, which is a lower-margin business. We had the lost CitraSource, and then we have some added costs, right, manufacturing and procurement, of course, head up in the balance sheet and everything. We also had some bad debt as we increased our bad debt provision, not actual bad debts but provisions as we did. So there were all offsets in here. 
Now as to your second part of your question about the ongoing plans that we have. I mean, yes, there will be some delays. There's a little bit of disruptions to achieving,  in particular, the manufacturing synergies that we expected from Frutarom, right? And that's quite simply because we can't -- the people are not traveling out to various sites. We're working from home quite effectively. But as Andreas has mentioned, too, we do prioritize the safety of our people. And people are just not traveling on the site. So there will be some delays in realizing the synergies from Frutarom coming through. And the same thing on procurement. On the procurement in, by the way, because with the huge disruption that we've seen out there in the in raw materials and sourcing and all the rest of that, that hasn't shown up in our P&L. But that's because our teams have been sort of pulling in really hard yards, making sure that we handled all this without disrupting our customers, right?

We have seen a couple of elements of the legacy food business which performed very well and we believe it's sustainable. So everything which is connected to health, we believe, will be sustainable because that's an incredible drive for the sales ingredients. That's number one. 
The second one is on Food Protection because people really want to increase shelf life and make sure that this works out well. So that's going extremely well, double digit, but we believe it will be also sustainable. And then on Savory, we will see. The Savory Solutions has made actually extreme progress in terms of bringing it together with the legacy flavors. And we have seen good developments. Whether this is certainly not sustainable in a double-digit growth rate, it is more dependent on how quickly the economies open up and how much is in the Food Service area because that certainly has more of a negative impact here as well. On the other hand, this is part of this famous butchers business. People in Austria and Germany waiting meat like there's no tomorrow because all the restaurants were closed, and that helped us with our sales as well. So sometimes, it's -- these are interesting, interesting dynamics. But I hope that helps as an explanation. And then on the food integration, risk associated was not being done with the integration work before merging with DuPont. It is basically -- some wanted to, on our manufacturing plants, we just hold back because we believe with N&B now we have a different way forward where we can use these capacities and can use them for some of the N&B products. So we do now everything, which we have said we are doing. Despite the things where we believe with the N&B combination, we have a better way forward when we have N&B in Board as well. So that's it. That's the only thing. And that's on Tilburg in Holland, but that's it. We can talk more in detail. I hope that helps."

At IFF, with global operations in 44 countries and sales into approximately 200 countries, we have seen firsthand how the coronavirus pandemic has touched our world. This is truly a remarkable moment in history. It presents all of us with new challenges, but also revealed the best humanity at the same time. On behalf of every one at IFF, I want to express my sincere sympathy for all those affected by the pandemic.
I also want to thank every one in the global health care community who exemplifies the best of all of us in responding to this crisis with courage and grace. Everyone on the frontline who continue to keep our society moving [ towards ] has our thanks. To all the essential workers and the consumer goods supply chain, of which IFF is proud to play an important role, we thank you for responding so quickly and moving swiftly to deliver for consumers around the world. This is very clear that we are still in the early stages of adjusting to the changes the pandemic poses to our world. As we'll review in more detail later, the IFF business is strongly positioned to be resilient through economic cycles given our substantial portfolio delivering needed solutions to vital consumers and markets.
The steps we have taken in recent years, including diversifying of our customer base and expansion into more categories, have only served to further strengthen our ability to be a vital partner to our customers and affirm our ability to be resilient through the cycles. Like many, we are seeing uneven impacts on our business due to the pandemic and the resulting economic challenges. While some end markets are seeing increases in demand, others are seeing notable declines. We are fortunate that only about 15% of our revenue, not including Fragrance Ingredients, that is subject to the downward pressure right now. However, the unpredictable nature of the pandemic and the early stage of the economic impact creates enough uncertainty for us that we have made the decision to withdraw our full year financial guidance. Rustom will cover this in more detail later. But while we navigate through this challenge, we are committed to providing as much forward outlook as we can so you understand the trends driving earnings.
On today's call, I will provide an executive overview of our operational and financial performance for the first quarter 2020 before offering a more in-depth review of IFF's management of the ongoing and evolving COVID-19 situation. Following this discussion, I will ask Rustom to provide a more detailed financial review of business, including additional insight into our liquidity and capital structure, which is very strong, given the uncertainty of the pandemic going forward.
As you may also have seen, today, we announced important progress related to our pending combination with DuPont Nutrition & Biosciences, including a new guiding purpose and vision for the future combined company as well as our operating model and executive management team post close. Following Rustom's remarks, I will provide an overview of these important integration updates. Upon the completion of our prepared commentary, we will take any questions that you may have.
Our strong performance for the first quarter 2020 affirms the strength of our organization and the essential position in serving vital end markets through economic cycles. We achieved a strong start to the year with mid-single-digit sales and double-digit adjusted EPS ex-amortization growth, both of which are currency-neutral basis. Importantly, we continue to achieve financial benefits related to our integration of the Frutarom business, both revenue and cost synergies. 
As I mentioned before, we have also made significant progress with integration planning to support our combination with the DuPont N&B business. And I must acknowledge our teams that have worked hard to build the foundation for this combination while continuing to contribute to IFF's day-to-day operations. 
Our teams have worked tirelessly to deliver for our customers. They have gone above and beyond to support our communities around the world during this time. Our strong quarter is a testament to their unwavering dedication, the underlying strength of our business and our role as an essential partner in the global food and consumer product supply chains. While we have certainly faced many challenges through these unprecedented situation, our operations and global network remains strong, and we have taken appropriate steps to ensure our business is well positioned to successfully manage through the pandemic.
Looking at our financial performance in the first quarter, I am pleased to say we delivered strong improvements across key financial metrics. In the first quarter, IFF achieved sales of USD 1.3 billion, which represents a 6% growth on currency-neutral basis, driven by our performance in both our Taste and Scent businesses. We also achieved strong adjusted earnings per share of $1.62, excluding amortization, reflecting a 13% year-over-year increase on a currency-neutral basis, led by currency-neutral adjusted operating profit of 9% to USD 271 million.
In addition, we expanded our operating margin, excluding amortization, by 60 basis points to 20.1%, driven by volume growth and productivity. In summary, IFF entered 2020 with solid momentum and continued to deliver currency-neutral sales growth in the high single digits through the end of February. However, for March onwards, we started to see the global impact of COVID-19 on our business, and we expect this to impact our results in the second quarter as we have seen uneven impact across end markets. Rustom will touch on this in more detail later.
I would like to spend a few moments outlining the key characteristics and drivers of our business, which leave IFF very well positioned to navigate today's new reality. More than ever, it is clear that IFF plays a vital role in the global CPG supply chain, especially for world's most important manufacturers in food and beverage as well as essential home, personal care and sanitation supplies.
IFF's broad-based exposure across regions, categories and customer positions us to remain resilient through the ongoing challenges brought about by the pandemic. As a result of regulatory actions and corresponding economic challenges, we are seeing certain reduction in demand in our Fine Fragrance, Cosmetic Active and Food Service offerings where end markets are seeing significant impact. This represents approximately 15% of our revenue. At the same time, we're seeing tremendous pickup in areas where the solutions that IFF pose are absolutely critical to the production of essential products. Our categories exposed to packaged food and beverage and hygiene and disinfection saw continued strong growth during the quarter. That is about 85% of our revenue.
Fortunately, our operations remain strong as we continue to deliver the creative solutions that our customers and end consumers demand during these unprecedented times. Our goal from the outset of this crisis has been twofold. First, we are deeply determined to ensure the well-being of our people. Second, we are committed to preserving continuity across the network so that we can continue meeting the needs of our customers. Our global, regional and local crisis teams are working around the clock to do what is the best for our people and our business. A co-working group, including representative from our executive team and across functional support groups and business teams, meets daily to ensure alignment from top to bottom across our teams. This team is putting in place plans and protocols to be sure we are anticipating what is to come and keep all of our stakeholders engaged through this extended period of disruption.
We have been proactively reviewing our resiliency plan to address the COVID-19 developments, and we are coordinating our response with federal and local health and government entities around the world. We have updated internal protocols as the situation has evolved, taking significant measures to protect our people, including implementing enhanced disinfection and sanitation measures at our operational facilities and taking precautions to minimize contact among employees as part of social distancing by grouping our professionals into smaller pots and separating their work shifts. For those able to work from home, we're instituting a remote working policy across many of our locations as well.
Given IFF's vital role in the consumer product supply chain, we continue to secure essential designations that provide our company with permission to manufacture our products around the world as governments extend workplace restrictions. A good example of our team working through these unexpected challenges has been India. Recently, our Chennai facility, where we have been secured essential business designations, was still forced to shut for several days due to regulatory restrictions. Thanks to the diligence of our team and a strong working relationship with regulators, we were able to move ahead of time in response to the shutdown to meet all customer demands through the shutdown while keeping employees safe.
In terms of our operations, we are seeing some challenges with logistics, and our lead times have increased, but the team is doing an excellent job navigating the transportation restrictions. We realize we are certainly not alone in this challenge. For these reasons, we have also seen some limitation in raw material distribution and have activated our contingency plans to limit the disruption that any material shortages might have for our customers.
Now we have seen disruptions to our supply chain, it has been mostly limited to the regions where the most significant government restrictions are in place, including Italy, Spain and India. On the new project and innovation front, most of our creative centers remain open and are engaging remotely as needed, and I'm happy to say that our project pipeline remains solid across our entire portfolio.
As I mentioned from the outset, our business has displayed impressive resilience through the evolving situation. We continue to proactively take steps that will ensure that IFF is operating from a position of financial strength. Specifically, we're adapting an especially disciplined approach to cost management. This means we are tightening any nonessential spend and reviewing new opportunities for efficiencies that can preserve our margin profile. We also are looking at CapEx and considering near-term priorities while pushing out longer-term investments as appropriate. And we are considering additional ways to optimize our net working capital by closely reviewing existing inventories and pursuing collections. Lastly, we have a strong cash position with USD 1 billion of untapped credit revolver available, giving us confidence in ensuring our strong position even in the event of a prolonged economic downturn.
Even in the midst of increased demand and the challenging operating environment, our teams have mobilized to support frontline health care workers and first responders across the global IFF network. IFFers across the globe have found very creative ways to leverage the company's unique capabilities and innovative spirit and lead a number of exciting community-focused initiatives, including from New Jersey to the Netherlands, IFF has modified our production facilities to allow for the manufacture and distribution of hand sanitizers. To date, I have estimated more than 65 metric tons of hand sanitizers globally to first responders and other organizations in need. Our North America Scent creator team quickly developed a new scent, HOPE 2020, that has been used by IFF and other partners in the production of hand sanitizers. Our Scent team has also partnered with Harvard Medical School and Mass General Hospital to create early detection smell test for asymptomatic carriers, the first developed globally. 
In India, our facilities donated food and other necessary sanitation items to local orphanages, hospitals and police stations. These actions speak to how our employees continue to embody our commitment to care for the resources of our world, and nothing could be more important than caring for our communities.
I could not be more proud of the spirit of caring that IFF has demonstrated throughout the global pandemic. 
With that, I would like to turn it over to Rustom, who will discuss our first quarter financial performance in greater detail."
281407,665128569,1982259,"International Flavors & Fragrances Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, May 12, 2020",2020-05-12,"Earnings Calls","International Flavors & Fragrances Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Andreas. Now to Slide 12, and taking a more detailed look at our quarterly financial performance.On a currency-neutral basis, IFF delivered broad-based sales growth of 6% versus 2019's first quarter. Adjusted operating profit margin improved",1868,"Thank you, Andreas. Now to Slide 12, and taking a more detailed look at our quarterly financial performance.
On a currency-neutral basis, IFF delivered broad-based sales growth of 6% versus 2019's first quarter. Adjusted operating profit margin improved in both Taste and Scent with procurement synergies; volume leverage; and productivity initiatives; and disciplined research, sales and administration for RSA cost containment. And this helped reduce our operating expenses as a percentage of sales. I am therefore pleased to say that we also saw solid profit growth in roughly 60 points of currency-neutral margin expansion on an adjusted operating profit mix amount basis.
COVID-19 did impact our P&L in Q1, but more in terms of sales mix rather than in total dollars and only in the final weeks of the quarter. It did have a modest negative impact on our adjusted operating profit in the quarter, causing us to incur extra manufacturing costs, additional freight expenses and higher raw material costs. But most of these went into inventory and will not be with expenses.
Our currency-neutral earnings per share, excluding amortization, grew a strong 13%, with robust operating profit growth boosted by lower year-on-year interest expenses and a lower effective tax rate. FX adversely impacted our reported numbers, pulling sales and adjusted operating profits down a couple of percent. It had a much larger negative impact on other income/expenses in March as a result of currencies collapsing globally against the dollar and the euro. So on a reported basis, this pulled down year-on-year adjusted EPS growth.
Now looking at our Scent division on Slide 13. In the first quarter, currency-neutral Scent sales grew 7% with growth in all regions and nearly all categories. Sales performance was strongest in Consumer Fragrance with a double-digit increase led by robust growth in Fabric, Home and Hair Care. And while we did experience a volume lift from COVID-19, especially from the increase in hygiene and disinfection categories, we also benefited from strong new wins, including with customers where we have recently gained access to their call list. We also saw high single-digit growth in Fragrance Ingredients, led by robust volume growth.
At the same time, Fine Fragrance sales declined as disruption of consumer access to retail markets, and a pronounced drop in global travel due to COVID-19 led to deceleration late in the quarter. Fine Fragrances started 2020 well and was growing until the last couple of weeks of the quarter even against last Q1 double-digit comp. And then we saw a significant contraction as our customers adapted their supply chains for new store closure and travel realities. This trend has continued in Q2 with a far greater impact, and I will elaborate on this shortly.
For the entire Scent segment, we posted a 20.4% segment profit margin. And segment profit grew to $105 million, up 19% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by volume growth and lower operating expenses.
Moving to Taste on Slide 14. We saw currency-neutral sales growth of 5% in the first quarter having achieved increases in all regions. We saw mid- to high single-digit growth in LatAm, Greater Asia and EMEA. From a category perspective, we again saw significant mid-teens growth in Savory Solutions with very strong growth in EMEA, our largest market, and also LatAm. 
Flavors grew low single digits, led by Greater Asia and Latin America. And this was driven by strong commercial performance on new wins, in particular, in the attractive categories of Beverage and Dairy. 
Though Frutarom is now mostly incorporated in the Taste business, we did commit to continue providing updates as to how sales are doing as if this had remained on a stand-alone basis. So if we had measured Frutarom as a stand-alone, currency-neutral sales would have grown by roughly 4% versus the prior year.
For the entire Taste business, we had a 16.5% margin with segment profit growing 6% to $137 million, led by volume benefits and Frutarom integration-related synergies. You may have noticed that this segment profit margin appears lower than you are used to seeing. This is because Frutarom is now included, and there is approximately $44 million of amortization of intangible assets.
Now I would like to provide an update on cash flow through the first quarter of 2020. The chart on Page 15 is designed to show the reconciliation from reported net income to cash flow, inclusive of all the drivers. Operating cash flow was $17 million in the first quarter, down from $47 million in 2019's first quarter, primarily due to higher core working capital levels. Within core working capital, we had solid improvements in inventory that were offset by higher accounts receivable as a result of strong sales in Q1 2020 as well as 2019 calendar shift. We expect the portion of this will normalize as we move through the year. Nevertheless, our cash conversion cycle in Q1 2020 was consistent with 2019's first quarter.
We continue to invest in the business, particularly for planned capacity increases and Frutarom integrations. Our capital expenditures as a percentage of sales in the first quarter of 2020 was 3.6%, and this was versus last year's 4.5%. And I will touch on our outlook for the balance of the year in a moment. 
The net impact on our free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less CapEx, was a negative $31 million. As a reminder, Q1 is our seasonably lowest quarter of the year, and last year, it was a negative $11 million.
In terms of cash usage, M&A and earn-outs and dividends amounted to $94 million versus $112 million in the prior year's first quarter, and this was all due to lower M&A and earn-outs. 
As Andreas noted before, we are taking steps to preserve our strong financial position at this time. Given the current environment and the possibility that the global economy could face a protracted downturn, we are constantly refining our scenario planning to ensure we are well prepared. This starts with controlling what we can control, targeting reductions in operational and capital expenses. We are being very cautious with hiring, mainly just critical replacement positions and a handful of critical new hires. And we are reducing any and all nonessential spend in the near term, including the likes of travel, entertainment, consulting, et cetera.
COVID-19 does bring some working capital headwind. We have experienced supply chain disruptions as various countries took lockdown action. We value our long-term customer relationships, so we purchased additional raw materials to serve as safety stocks, giving us capability to move manufacturing around and, in general, to help insulate against supply chain disruption as we've seen in India. We are also paying some of our smaller and/or COVID-19-impacted suppliers more promptly if this is warranted. And this could be expected. We're experiencing an increase in receivables, particularly from Food Service and Fine Fragrance customers. 
Of course, we're working to offset these working capital pressures where we can. For inventory, we are constantly balancing the need to ensure business continuity during COVID-19 with the need to not over order. Where we could extend our payables, we are working with suppliers to do so. And we are pursuing collections from customers with over dues and being proactive with those where there is credit risk.
For capital expenditures, we are targeting reductions across the business. Specifically, we are prioritizing the highest-returning projects while delaying longer-term investments that are not absolutely necessary at this time. And of course, practically, COVID-19 is making it much harder to launch our complete projects where significant travel is required. Moving forward, we also have to be smart to ensure that we invest in a flexible and healthy ecosystem.
Turning to Slide 17. As we consider our current capital structure and manage our balance sheet moving forward, we've outlined our upcoming debt maturity schedule, which includes a good balance of short- and long-term tiers. We have strong and ample liquidity, well within our debt covenants as our net debt-to-EBITDA at the end of Q1 2020 was 3.3x. Our cash position at the end of Q1 is strong at $433 million with $1 billion of an untapped credit revolver available should we need it. Looking ahead, following the close of the DuPont N&B transaction, we are committed to maintaining our investment-grade rating. As stated in December, we intend to quickly delever after the close of the transaction to get below 3x net debt-to-EBITDA within the following 24 months.
Now turning to our outlook. To conceptualize our expected sales dynamic in Q2, I wanted to highlight the many moving parts we are seeing and expecting this quarter. COVID-19 presents both opportunities and challenges as we forge ahead. Starting on the left side of the slide, we expect to see continued robust growth in our Taste business, excluding Food Service as well as in our Consumer Fragrance business. The demand and consumption of the products that these businesses are supporting remain high, and we are well positioned with our global footprint to capitalize on this. In the middle box is Fragrance Ingredients where demand is strong. However, we are facing challenges in the supply chain and,  in particular, the Indian lockdown. This means that we have to forgo external sales to ensure that we protect our Fragrance compounds business.
The last category is where demand has been adversely impacted by COVID-19. Food Service, with a vast stay-at-home orders across the globe as well as changes in consumer behaviors, have impacted away-from-home consumption. Fine Fragrance and Cosmetic Actives, where the retail channels have been temporarily closed and travel retail is down, both due to COVID-19, as well as these categories being more discretionary in nature.
Now more than ever, IFF's broad-based exposure across the regions, categories and customers positions us to remain resilient through the ongoing challenges. We are fortunate that the majority of our revenues comes from categories exposed to packaged food and beverage and from hygiene and disinfection, so parts of our business are experiencing higher sales volumes in this current environment. Having said this, we're not totally immune. Not surprisingly, April's currency-neutral sales were challenged, with strong Consumer Fragrance and Flavors, offset primarily by weakness in Fine Fragrance and Food Service. For the second quarter, while we are not giving specific guidance, it is worth noting that with the pressure in Fine Fragrances, operating margin mix will be a headwind as well as the additional COVID-19-related costs.
We continue to evaluate what evolving global market dynamics will mean for our business performance and projections moving forward. As the second quarter progresses and we gain greater visibility, as Andreas noted, we'll provide updates as appropriate. While our ability to pivot quickly and modify our daily operation has enabled us to responsibly operate our business, the constantly evolving global responses to COVID-19 have created uncertainties for IFF and for other companies and our partners as well. Given the extent of the current uncertainty globally and the potential for uneven impact on our businesses, we have decided to withdraw our fiscal 2020 guidance. We will continue to manage our business by taking actions to generate strong cash flow and maintain ample liquidity.
With that, let me turn the call back over to Andreas."

With customers of all sizes across the globe, from start-up to multinational, we have the agility and the expertise to deliver what you need. Unmatched innovation and leading-edge insight means we are already anticipating what will be essential to tomorrow's consumers.  As we come together as one organization, we can help our customers meet consumers' needs faster.
Our new operational model will leverage the capabilities and offerings of both organizations to create a sustainable framework that best position our teams, customers, shareholders for success on day 1 and well into the future. The complementary structure will focus our organization into 4 divisions: Taste, Food and Beverage; Scent; Health & Bioscience; and Pharma Solutions. We carefully examined how each division go to market, including customer overlap, R&D focus and service level requirements. Among other, several factors to make sure we created global divisions that were built for success.
Just as important as our 4 operating divisions will be our global centralized functions. Each of these will work in collaboration across our divisions. I want to call out, in particular, that we will be establishing a new integrated solution Center of Excellence to focus on incubating new business opportunities and total product solutions. We are also creating a Center for Commercial Excellence to support our business and commercial teams through development of best practices, customer insights and analysis, resource deployment and the optimization of pricing strategies and solutions. These 2 are extremely important as it will be instrumental collaborating with the business to achieve our revenue synergy goals.
We also announced the Executive Committee for the combined company, including highly qualified and diverse leaders with deep knowledge and expertise. If you're interested in the team's background, please check out on strongerinnovationtogether.com. I won't go through all of these distinguished leaders here, but I will note that this was a particular challenging process. Most organizations have tremendously talented individuals. We are fortunate that as a significantly large organization, we will be able to create many challenging, exciting new opportunities to further the careers of our employees.
I'm also very encouraged by the world-class Board of Directors we are beginning to assemble. As shared at the deal announcement, DuPont Executive Chairman and CEO, Ed Breen, will join the Board of the combined company as the DuPont designee following the close of a transaction and will serve as lead Independent Director starting in June 1, 2021. 
I'm also pleased to say that Matthias Heinzel, President of Nutrition & Biosciences at Dupont, will be joining the Board of Directors of IFF following the close of the transaction. Under his leadership, Matthias has strategically transformed the N&B business, driving customer-focused innovation, operational effectiveness and multiple business integrations. As an Independent Director, his extensive global management experience and deep knowledge of the industry will support the future company as it unlocks the value of the merger. 
In addition, Carol A. Davidson will also be appointed to join the Board of Directors of the future combined company following the close of the transaction. Mr. Davidson is a CPA with more than 30 years of leadership experience across multiple industries. He has held a variety of leadership roles at Tyco, International TE and Dell Inc. and financial leadership roles at the Eastman Kodak Company. Mr. Davidson is the lead Independent Director of Legg Mason and serves on the Board of TE Connectivity. For this team, both Board and management, I know our combined company will charge a new path forward for our industry and have a powerful impact on the world around us.
Stepping back, I will say that I'm deeply impressed, even more so given COVID-19, by the dedication and focus both the IFF and N&B teams have brought to this effort. We knew early on that these companies would be a strong cultural match, and our excitement and conviction behind the potential of this combination was only grown as our teams begin more and more to cooperate. As we look ahead, we are focused on executing the next key milestones and will do so within the same spend and diligence we have achieved thus far.
In summary, we are pleased with our strong financial performance despite an unprecedented first quarter 2020. We delivered on all of our key metrics and saw broad-based growth in both divisions with mid-single-digit sales and double-digit adjusted EPS ex-amortization growth on a consolidated basis. We continue to make important progress in the integration of Frutarom business and have taken substantial steps forward in bringing on our combination with DuPont and N&B to life. 
I'm also credibly proud of each and every one of my colleagues at IFF for what they have achieved during these challenging times, not just for our business, but for our partners, our customers and our communities. 
While global conditions remain volatile in the near term, our order book for Q2 looks solid as we are successfully navigating through these unprecedented times to emerge as a stronger company. 
I would now like to open the call for questions."

The emerging markets in the first quarter were particularly strong, Latin America by round about 10% and Greater Asia by plus 9%. What we see in terms of the different categories,  in particular, the Consumer Fragrance in Latin America in high-teens, as well as Flavors, high single, and Savory Solutions in high-teens as well. So really, really good results. Probably strongest from the multinationals, specifically in the HBC field. In Asia, it was all about Consumer Fragrances as well, so mid-teens, really good. Taste in high single digits. No surprise to COVID-19, I would say. And here in Asia, very much across both multinationals as well as regional and locals. Frutarom, as we said, is probably around about 4% growth with some benefits of smaller M&A, but still a very, very good performance.
I would say, country wise, it depends where the COVID-19 wave has started. We have seen the first impact in Asia, in particular, in China, then it moved to Europe, then to the U.S. and Latin America. So that's probably what you can see in the first quarter.
In terms of the pipeline, our pipeline remains strong also into the second quarter. But having said all of that, it's really different from customer to customer. I can say, also for us, our accretive labs are basically almost all open. They're working on new launches. They're working on, let's say, better, let's say, improvements of some of the products. So all in all, I would say, a very strong picture. Certainly, impact on Fine Fragrance because -- and you heard this from our customer base as well, which is not positive. But all the essential products are really going actually very, very strong.

We're in all of the categories, #1 and #2 in the market. We have a great R&D pipeline with a combined spend of around about $550 million, more than 9,000 patents granted. So I believe very, very robust. And as you have seen the N&B results in the first quarter as well, it shows it's an essential business. Probiotics are going gangbusters and many of the other portfolio areas as well.
Coming back to the integration fees. So as you know, we have formed an IMO, so an integration management office. We cleared antitrust in the U.S. We filed in Europe and in China. The combined integration planning can do a lot, which is even in these challenging times, and I'm very, very pleased how they worked together all over Zoom or Skype. Of course, it's very, very interesting. So we really make sure that we are ready for day 1. The next up on the schedule is the shareholder vote in September, then the financing and then the close, hopefully, in the first quarter 2021. So I have to say that this COVID-19 has further solidified our position. Strategic logic is very strong. Very resilient business. Very great market position.

We are fortunate that most of our revenue comes from the packaged Food and Beverage categories as well as hygiene and disinfection, right? Those -- so we have continued strength there. I mean the path that you're referring to is the part that we're not immune, is the categories most exposed to retail end markets where stores closed and travel dropped sharply.

So we're seeing that impact, and we are choosing to be -- try to stay resilient, flexible, close to our customers as we possibly can be. And always, sort of trying to be cognizant of the safety of our employees and well-being as we go forward.
China, regarding the China, part of your question. Fine Fragrance is a very small part of the portfolio, I mean, based on category demand, I mean, less than 2% of total Fine.

It's hard to disaggregate the underlying demand versus stockpiling. But we talk with many of our customers. And we believe on the Consumer Fragrance side, certainly, the activity in washing clothes and detergent, the softeners, it's very much demand. It's not so much stockpiling here. I think we see this. We see also all the hygiene products are really used. It's not just that people put it in the pantry. But that's what we see. And also on the Food side, when you talk to some of our customers, the yogurts are going like there's no tomorrow, which is probably not a big surprise to all of us because working from home, instead of going to the company cafeteria, you go to the fridge and pull a yogurt and that's your lunch. So we see some categories very much it's consumption. It's moving, but I can't give you all the details. What is for us, right now, really important is on the consumer insight side. We do all of our studies, we know how the consumer behaves right now. And what is sustainable? So that we really can orient ourselves in terms of our R&D and the new product development towards things which might will come. We believe that everything in terms of sanitizing will stay. We believe also that many of the health products, in particular, fortified with vitamins or probiotics will stay. But there's more to come. So that's the work we are doing right now. So in many areas, the consumption is real. By the way, one last one, potato chips are also going like gangbusters. But Rustom, please comment."

I mean the part of your question -- then you also talked about sustainability, right? Sustainability of Consumer Fragrance, we do believe this will continue to be robust. Consumer demand remains high in hygiene and disinfection. And if anyone has been to the store lately, it's just hard to get those products, right?
But let me address one aspect, too. I mean the Scent profitability because of specifics and because of Fine, right? Scent profitability without -- that will still be adversely impacted in Q2. I don't -- I can't get into -- I don't want to get into specifics, but based on our largest -- what our largest Fine Fragrances customers are saying publicly, the category is declining double digits. So I'd expect the same for IFF and our competitors. And being that it is one of our highest-margin categories, well above consolidated average, and with these declines, margins will be down. Then you add in additional COVID costs that we had in Q2, a full quarter's worth then that's just another factor."

You might remember at the beginning, toilet paper was also very precious article around the world in many of the supermarkets. But that's back to normal. So actually, we have seen already quite a normalization, not because COVID is gone, but people see and feel that they can buy whatever they need. There was not a big disruption in the supply chain. So we believe that the inventory has changed. It's different than in pharmaceuticals, for example, where people just keeping their diabetes product better for 3 or 4 months instead of 1 month to make sure that they are covered. But here, I think in many cases, we are already back to normal.
On the plants, it's a bit of a different situation because we are managing the supply chain actually almost by the week because India, which is a big country for raw materials in our industry, has some challenges with lockdown as well. So we really had to make sure that we get enough inventory in all the plants around the world to secure supply for our customers. So here, you probably will see some elevated inventory levels for quite some time. But again, situation is volatile. I expected this actually for the first quarter as well. But we were selling so much, the inventory actually went down. So that's our plan of basically what we assume for now, but it might change because it's very dependent on the demand as well.

So in the -- first of all, we are on track with our cost synergies target through Q1, Frutarom, I mean, with more than 25% of our $50 million full year savings coming in Q1. And in terms of geography, it's about 3/4 Taste and the rest in Scent roughly, okay?
The Scent synergies showed through. And as you saw Scent's performance, there's consumer leverage. But Taste, where you're homing in, did benefit some synergies as well. But it also had mix. I mean we went straight there. We also had mid-teens growth in Savory Solutions, which is a lower-margin business. We had the loss CitraSource, and then we have some added costs, right? Manufacturing and procurement, and cost hid up in the balance sheet and everything. But we also had some bad debt as we increased our bad debt provision, not actual bad debts but actually provisions as we did. So there were all offsets in here. 
Now as to your second part of your question about the ongoing plans that we have. I mean, yes, there will be some delays. There's a little bit of disruptions to achieving, in particular, the manufacturing synergies that we expected from Frutarom, right? And that's quite simply because we can't -- the people are not traveling out to various sites. Even we're working from home quite effectively. But as Andreas has mentioned, too, we do prioritize the safety of our people. And people are just not traveling out to site. So there will be some delays in realizing the synergies from Frutarom coming through. And the same thing on procurement. On the procurement then, by the way, because with the huge disruption that we've seen out there in the -- in raw materials and sourcing and all the rest of that, that hasn't shown up in our P&L. But that's because our teams have been sort of pulling in really hard yards, making sure that we handled all this without disrupting our customers, right? But something gives, and that something is -- one of those things that it have given is pushing through some of those other synergies. Andreas, is there anything you want to add there as well?"

So I just wanted to kind of clarify that versus what you had just said about the only a 3-month delay on synergy.
And then just more broadly on Frutarom. I was just curious to know kind of what drove the upside in the quarter. Is it sustainable? From what we can see, it looks like Savory was a big part of that. And just is that also -- we talked about some mix dynamic, the areas in Frutarom that are coming through maybe a bit better than expected. Is that also another drive on mix?"

We have seen a couple of elements of the legacy Food business which performed very well and we believe it's sustainable. So everything which is connected to health, we believe, will be sustainable because that's an incredible drive for the sales ingredients. That's number one.
The second one is on food protection because people really want to increase shelf life and make sure that this works out well. So that's going extremely well, double digit, but we believe it will be also sustainable.
And then on Savory, we will see. The Savory Solutions has made actually extreme progress in terms of bringing it together with the legacy flavors. And we have seen good developments. Whether this is -- certainly not sustainable in a double-digit growth rate, it is more dependent on how quickly the economies open up and how much is in the Food Service area because that certainly has more of a negative impact here as well. On the other hand, this is part of this famous butchers business. People in Austria and Germany were eating meat like there's no tomorrow because all the restaurants were closed, and that helped us with our sales as well. So sometimes, it's -- these are interesting, interesting dynamics. But I hope that helps as an explanation. 
And then on the food integration, risk associated was not being done with the integration work before merging with DuPont. It is basically some -- 1 or 2, on our manufacturing plants, we just hold back because we believe with N&B now we have a different way forward where we can use these capacities and can use them for some of the N&B products. So we do note everything, which we have said we are doing. Despite the things where we believe with the N&B combination, we have a better way forward when we have N&B on board as well. So that's it. That's the only thing. And that's on Tilburg in Holland, but that's it. We can't talk more in detail. I hope that helps."

At IFF, with global operations in 44 countries and sales into approximately 200 countries, we have seen firsthand how the coronavirus pandemic has touched our world. This is truly a remarkable moment in history. It presents all of us with new challenges, but also revealed the best humanity at the same time. On behalf of every one at IFF, I want to express my sincere sympathy for all those affected by the pandemic.
I also want to thank every one in the global health care community who exemplifies the best of all of us in responding to this crisis with courage and grace. Everyone on the frontline who continue to keep our society moving [ towards ] has our thanks. To all the essential workers and the consumer goods supply chain, of which IFF is proud to play an important role, we thank you for responding so quickly and moving swiftly to deliver for consumers around the world. This is very clear that we are still in the early stages of adjusting to the changes the pandemic poses to our world. As we'll review in more detail later, the IFF business is strongly positioned to be resilient through economic cycles given our substantial portfolio delivering needed solutions to vital consumers and markets.
The steps we have taken in recent years, including diversifying of our customer base and expansion into more categories, have only served to further strengthen our ability to be a vital partner to our customers and affirm our ability to be resilient through the cycles. Like many, we are seeing uneven impacts on our business due to the pandemic and the resulting economic challenges. While some end markets are seeing increases in demand, others are seeing notable declines. We are fortunate that only about 15% of our revenue, not including Fragrance Ingredients, that is subject to the downward pressure right now. However, the unpredictable nature of the pandemic and the early stage of the economic impact creates enough uncertainty for us that we have made the decision to withdraw our full year financial guidance. Rustom will cover this in more detail later. But while we navigate through this challenge, we are committed to providing as much forward outlook as we can so you understand the trends driving earnings.
On today's call, I will provide an executive overview of our operational and financial performance for the first quarter 2020 before offering a more in-depth review of IFF's management of the ongoing and evolving COVID-19 situation. Following this discussion, I will ask Rustom to provide a more detailed financial review of business, including additional insight into our liquidity and capital structure, which is very strong, given the uncertainty of the pandemic going forward.
As you may also have seen, today, we announced important progress related to our pending combination with DuPont Nutrition & Biosciences, including a new guiding purpose and vision for the future combined company as well as our operating model and executive management team post close. Following Rustom's remarks, I will provide an overview of these important integration updates. Upon the completion of our prepared commentary, we will take any questions that you may have.
Our strong performance for the first quarter 2020 affirms the strength of our organization and the essential position in serving vital end markets through economic cycles. We achieved a strong start to the year with mid-single-digit sales and double-digit adjusted EPS ex-amortization growth, both of which are currency-neutral basis. Importantly, we continue to achieve financial benefits related to our integration of the Frutarom business, both revenue and cost synergies. 
As I mentioned before, we have also made significant progress with integration planning to support our combination with the DuPont N&B business. And I must acknowledge our teams that have worked hard to build the foundation for this combination while continuing to contribute to IFF's day-to-day operations. 
Our teams have worked tirelessly to deliver for our customers. They have gone above and beyond to support our communities around the world during this time. Our strong quarter is a testament to their unwavering dedication, the underlying strength of our business and our role as an essential partner in the global food and consumer product supply chains. While we have certainly faced many challenges through these unprecedented situation, our operations and global network remains strong, and we have taken appropriate steps to ensure our business is well positioned to successfully manage through the pandemic.
Looking at our financial performance in the first quarter, I am pleased to say we delivered strong improvements across key financial metrics. In the first quarter, IFF achieved sales of USD 1.3 billion, which represents a 6% growth on currency-neutral basis, driven by our performance in both our Taste and Scent businesses. We also achieved strong adjusted earnings per share of $1.62, excluding amortization, reflecting a 13% year-over-year increase on a currency-neutral basis, led by currency-neutral adjusted operating profit of 9% to USD 271 million.
In addition, we expanded our operating margin, excluding amortization, by 60 basis points to 20.1%, driven by volume growth and productivity. In summary, IFF entered 2020 with solid momentum and continued to deliver currency-neutral sales growth in the high single digits through the end of February. However, for March onwards, we started to see the global impact of COVID-19 on our business, and we expect this to impact our results in the second quarter as we have seen uneven impact across end markets. Rustom will touch on this in more detail later.
I would like to spend a few moments outlining the key characteristics and drivers of our business, which leave IFF very well positioned to navigate today's new reality. More than ever, it is clear that IFF plays a vital role in the global CPG supply chain, especially for world's most important manufacturers in food and beverage as well as essential home, personal care and sanitation supplies.
IFF's broad-based exposure across regions, categories and customer positions us to remain resilient through the ongoing challenges brought about by the pandemic. As a result of regulatory actions and corresponding economic challenges, we are seeing certain reduction in demand in our Fine Fragrance, Cosmetic Active and Food Service offerings where end markets are seeing significant impact. This represents approximately 15% of our revenue. At the same time, we're seeing tremendous pickup in areas where the solutions that IFF pose are absolutely critical to the production of essential products. Our categories exposed to packaged food and beverage and hygiene and disinfection saw continued strong growth during the quarter. That is about 85% of our revenue.
Fortunately, our operations remain strong as we continue to deliver the creative solutions that our customers and end consumers demand during these unprecedented times. Our goal from the outset of this crisis has been twofold. First, we are deeply determined to ensure the well-being of our people. Second, we are committed to preserving continuity across the network so that we can continue meeting the needs of our customers. Our global, regional and local crisis teams are working around the clock to do what is the best for our people and our business. A co-working group, including representative from our executive team and across functional support groups and business teams, meets daily to ensure alignment from top to bottom across our teams. This team is putting in place plans and protocols to be sure we are anticipating what is to come and keep all of our stakeholders engaged through this extended period of disruption.
We have been proactively reviewing our resiliency plan to address the COVID-19 developments, and we are coordinating our response with federal and local health and government entities around the world. We have updated internal protocols as the situation has evolved, taking significant measures to protect our people, including implementing enhanced disinfection and sanitation measures at our operational facilities and taking precautions to minimize contact among employees as part of social distancing by grouping our professionals into smaller pots and separating their work shifts. For those able to work from home, we're instituting a remote working policy across many of our locations as well.
Given IFF's vital role in the consumer product supply chain, we continue to secure essential designations that provide our company with permission to manufacture our products around the world as governments extend workplace restrictions. A good example of our team working through these unexpected challenges has been India. Recently, our Chennai facility, where we have been secured essential business designations, was still forced to shut for several days due to regulatory restrictions. Thanks to the diligence of our team and a strong working relationship with regulators, we were able to move ahead of time in response to the shutdown to meet all customer demands through the shutdown while keeping employees safe.
In terms of our operations, we are seeing some challenges with logistics, and our lead times have increased, but the team is doing an excellent job navigating the transportation restrictions. We realize we are certainly not alone in this challenge. For these reasons, we have also seen some limitation in raw material distribution and have activated our contingency plans to limit the disruption that any material shortages might have for our customers.
Now we have seen disruptions to our supply chain, it has been mostly limited to the regions where the most significant government restrictions are in place, including Italy, Spain and India. On the new project and innovation front, most of our creative centers remain open and are engaging remotely as needed, and I'm happy to say that our project pipeline remains solid across our entire portfolio.
As I mentioned from the outset, our business has displayed impressive resilience through the evolving situation. We continue to proactively take steps that will ensure that IFF is operating from a position of financial strength. Specifically, we're adapting an especially disciplined approach to cost management. This means we are tightening any nonessential spend and reviewing new opportunities for efficiencies that can preserve our margin profile. We also are looking at CapEx and considering near-term priorities while pushing out longer-term investments as appropriate. And we are considering additional ways to optimize our net working capital by closely reviewing existing inventories and pursuing collections. Lastly, we have a strong cash position with USD 1 billion of untapped credit revolver available, giving us confidence in ensuring our strong position even in the event of a prolonged economic downturn.
Even in the midst of increased demand and the challenging operating environment, our teams have mobilized to support frontline health care workers and first responders across the global IFF network. IFFers across the globe have found very creative ways to leverage the company's unique capabilities and innovative spirit and lead a number of exciting community-focused initiatives, including from New Jersey to the Netherlands, IFF has modified our production facilities to allow for the manufacture and distribution of hand sanitizers. To date, I have estimated more than 65 metric tons of hand sanitizers globally to first responders and other organizations in need. Our North America Scent creator team quickly developed a new scent, HOPE 2020, that has been used by IFF and other partners in the production of hand sanitizers. Our Scent team has also partnered with Harvard Medical School and Mass General Hospital to create early detection smell test for asymptomatic carriers, the first developed globally. 
In India, our facilities donated food and other necessary sanitation items to local orphanages, hospitals and police stations. These actions speak to how our employees continue to embody our commitment to care for the resources of our world, and nothing could be more important than caring for our communities.
I could not be more proud of the spirit of caring that IFF has demonstrated throughout the global pandemic. 
With that, I would like to turn it over to Rustom, who will discuss our first quarter financial performance in greater detail."
281407,665128569,2022026,"International Flavors & Fragrances Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, May 12, 2020",2020-05-12,"Earnings Calls","International Flavors & Fragrances Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Andreas. Now to Slide 12, and taking a more detailed look at our quarterly financial performance.On a currency-neutral basis, IFF delivered broad-based sales growth of 6% versus 2019's first quarter. Adjusted operating profit margin improved",1868,"Thank you, Andreas. Now to Slide 12, and taking a more detailed look at our quarterly financial performance.
On a currency-neutral basis, IFF delivered broad-based sales growth of 6% versus 2019's first quarter. Adjusted operating profit margin improved in both Taste and Scent with procurement synergies; volume leverage; and productivity initiatives; and disciplined research, sales and administration for RSA cost containment. And this helped reduce our operating expenses as a percentage of sales. I am therefore pleased to say that we also saw solid profit growth in roughly 60 points of currency-neutral margin expansion on an adjusted operating profit mix amount basis.
COVID-19 did impact our P&L in Q1, but more in terms of sales mix rather than in total dollars and only in the final weeks of the quarter. It did have a modest negative impact on our adjusted operating profit in the quarter, causing us to incur extra manufacturing costs, additional freight expenses and higher raw material costs. But most of these went into inventory and will not be with expenses.
Our currency-neutral earnings per share, excluding amortization, grew a strong 13%, with robust operating profit growth boosted by lower year-on-year interest expenses and a lower effective tax rate. FX adversely impacted our reported numbers, pulling sales and adjusted operating profits down a couple of percent. It had a much larger negative impact on other income/expenses in March as a result of currencies collapsing globally against the dollar and the euro. So on a reported basis, this pulled down year-on-year adjusted EPS growth.
Now looking at our Scent division on Slide 13. In the first quarter, currency-neutral Scent sales grew 7% with growth in all regions and nearly all categories. Sales performance was strongest in Consumer Fragrance with a double-digit increase led by robust growth in Fabric, Home and Hair Care. And while we did experience a volume lift from COVID-19, especially from the increase in hygiene and disinfection categories, we also benefited from strong new wins, including with customers where we have recently gained access to their call list. We also saw high single-digit growth in Fragrance Ingredients, led by robust volume growth.
At the same time, Fine Fragrance sales declined as disruption of consumer access to retail markets, and a pronounced drop in global travel due to COVID-19 led to deceleration late in the quarter. Fine Fragrances started 2020 well and was growing until the last couple of weeks of the quarter even against last Q1 double-digit comp. And then we saw a significant contraction as our customers adapted their supply chains for new store closure and travel realities. This trend has continued in Q2 with a far greater impact, and I will elaborate on this shortly.
For the entire Scent segment, we posted a 20.4% segment profit margin. And segment profit grew to $105 million, up 19% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by volume growth and lower operating expenses.
Moving to Taste on Slide 14. We saw currency-neutral sales growth of 5% in the first quarter having achieved increases in all regions. We saw mid- to high single-digit growth in LatAm, Greater Asia and EMEA. From a category perspective, we again saw significant mid-teens growth in Savory Solutions with very strong growth in EMEA, our largest market, and also LatAm. 
Flavors grew low single digits, led by Greater Asia and Latin America. And this was driven by strong commercial performance on new wins, in particular, in the attractive categories of Beverage and Dairy. 
Though Frutarom is now mostly incorporated in the Taste business, we did commit to continue providing updates as to how sales are doing as if this had remained on a stand-alone basis. So if we had measured Frutarom as a stand-alone, currency-neutral sales would have grown by roughly 4% versus the prior year.
For the entire Taste business, we had a 16.5% margin with segment profit growing 6% to $137 million, led by volume benefits and Frutarom integration-related synergies. You may have noticed that this segment profit margin appears lower than you are used to seeing. This is because Frutarom is now included, and there is approximately $44 million of amortization of intangible assets.
Now I would like to provide an update on cash flow through the first quarter of 2020. The chart on Page 15 is designed to show the reconciliation from reported net income to cash flow, inclusive of all the drivers. Operating cash flow was $17 million in the first quarter, down from $47 million in 2019's first quarter, primarily due to higher core working capital levels. Within core working capital, we had solid improvements in inventory that were offset by higher accounts receivable as a result of strong sales in Q1 2020 as well as 2019 calendar shift. We expect the portion of this will normalize as we move through the year. Nevertheless, our cash conversion cycle in Q1 2020 was consistent with 2019's first quarter.
We continue to invest in the business, particularly for planned capacity increases and Frutarom integrations. Our capital expenditures as a percentage of sales in the first quarter of 2020 was 3.6%, and this was versus last year's 4.5%. And I will touch on our outlook for the balance of the year in a moment. 
The net impact on our free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less CapEx, was a negative $31 million. As a reminder, Q1 is our seasonably lowest quarter of the year, and last year, it was a negative $11 million.
In terms of cash usage, M&A and earn-outs and dividends amounted to $94 million versus $112 million in the prior year's first quarter, and this was all due to lower M&A and earn-outs. 
As Andreas noted before, we are taking steps to preserve our strong financial position at this time. Given the current environment and the possibility that the global economy could face a protracted downturn, we are constantly refining our scenario planning to ensure we are well prepared. This starts with controlling what we can control, targeting reductions in operational and capital expenses. We are being very cautious with hiring, mainly just critical replacement positions and a handful of critical new hires. And we are reducing any and all nonessential spend in the near term, including the likes of travel, entertainment, consulting, et cetera.
COVID-19 does bring some working capital headwind. We have experienced supply chain disruptions as various countries took lockdown action. We value our long-term customer relationships, so we purchased additional raw materials to serve as safety stocks, giving us capability to move manufacturing around and, in general, to help insulate against supply chain disruption as we've seen in India. We are also paying some of our smaller and/or COVID-19-impacted suppliers more promptly if this is warranted. And this could be expected. We're experiencing an increase in receivables, particularly from Food Service and Fine Fragrance customers. 
Of course, we're working to offset these working capital pressures where we can. For inventory, we are constantly balancing the need to ensure business continuity during COVID-19 with the need to not over order. Where we could extend our payables, we are working with suppliers to do so. And we are pursuing collections from customers with over dues and being proactive with those where there is credit risk.
For capital expenditures, we are targeting reductions across the business. Specifically, we are prioritizing the highest-returning projects while delaying longer-term investments that are not absolutely necessary at this time. And of course, practically, COVID-19 is making it much harder to launch our complete projects where significant travel is required. Moving forward, we also have to be smart to ensure that we invest in a flexible and healthy ecosystem.
Turning to Slide 17. As we consider our current capital structure and manage our balance sheet moving forward, we've outlined our upcoming debt maturity schedule, which includes a good balance of short- and long-term tiers. We have strong and ample liquidity, well within our debt covenants as our net debt-to-EBITDA at the end of Q1 2020 was 3.3x. Our cash position at the end of Q1 is strong at $433 million with $1 billion of an untapped credit revolver available should we need it. Looking ahead, following the close of the DuPont N&B transaction, we are committed to maintaining our investment-grade rating. As stated in December, we intend to quickly delever after the close of the transaction to get below 3x net debt-to-EBITDA within the following 24 months.
Now turning to our outlook. To conceptualize our expected sales dynamic in Q2, I wanted to highlight the many moving parts we are seeing and expecting this quarter. COVID-19 presents both opportunities and challenges as we forge ahead. Starting on the left side of the slide, we expect to see continued robust growth in our Taste business, excluding Food Service as well as in our Consumer Fragrance business. The demand and consumption of the products that these businesses are supporting remain high, and we are well positioned with our global footprint to capitalize on this. In the middle box is Fragrance Ingredients where demand is strong. However, we are facing challenges in the supply chain and,  in particular, the Indian lockdown. This means that we have to forgo external sales to ensure that we protect our Fragrance compounds business.
The last category is where demand has been adversely impacted by COVID-19. Food Service, with a vast stay-at-home orders across the globe as well as changes in consumer behaviors, have impacted away-from-home consumption. Fine Fragrance and Cosmetic Actives, where the retail channels have been temporarily closed and travel retail is down, both due to COVID-19, as well as these categories being more discretionary in nature.
Now more than ever, IFF's broad-based exposure across the regions, categories and customers positions us to remain resilient through the ongoing challenges. We are fortunate that the majority of our revenues comes from categories exposed to packaged food and beverage and from hygiene and disinfection, so parts of our business are experiencing higher sales volumes in this current environment. Having said this, we're not totally immune. Not surprisingly, April's currency-neutral sales were challenged, with strong Consumer Fragrance and Flavors, offset primarily by weakness in Fine Fragrance and Food Service. For the second quarter, while we are not giving specific guidance, it is worth noting that with the pressure in Fine Fragrances, operating margin mix will be a headwind as well as the additional COVID-19-related costs.
We continue to evaluate what evolving global market dynamics will mean for our business performance and projections moving forward. As the second quarter progresses and we gain greater visibility, as Andreas noted, we'll provide updates as appropriate. While our ability to pivot quickly and modify our daily operation has enabled us to responsibly operate our business, the constantly evolving global responses to COVID-19 have created uncertainties for IFF and for other companies and our partners as well. Given the extent of the current uncertainty globally and the potential for uneven impact on our businesses, we have decided to withdraw our fiscal 2020 guidance. We will continue to manage our business by taking actions to generate strong cash flow and maintain ample liquidity.
With that, let me turn the call back over to Andreas."

As you know, we are extremely excited to combine our 2 customer-focused and consumer-led organizations with leading positions in high-value categories. Together, our product portfolio will be among the industry most robust and diverse. We have a coveted R&D program with an industry-leading pipeline, and most importantly, we will be poised to redefine our industry by delivering essential solutions to our customers. We remain on target to close the transaction in the first quarter of 2021. Until then, IFF and N&B will remain independent entities and will operate separately.
Since we announced our merger in December 2019, our teams have been hard at work bringing this combination to life. We have formal integration management office, cleared the U.S. regulatory process, filed for regulatory events in Europe and China and filed our initial registration statement. The potential of this combination continues to excite our teams, and we are working diligently to make sure we can hit the ground in full sprint on day 1.
Some of our important highlights over the past 4 months include: completed strategic assessment of the future combined company portfolio, joint cross-function integration program in place and operational, created ideation framework to identify, assess and prioritize synergy opportunities. Today, we took another significant step forward. We have announced our purpose, vision and operating model and Executive Committee for the future combined company. In short, we are announcing who we'll be, what we intend to do and who will lead our incredible team once we combine forces with the N&B business in the first quarter of 2021.
Our purpose is the why that drives everything we do. The combined companies' purpose, applying science and creativity for a better world, we'll focus on our intent to push past traditional industry boundaries and commit to be a force for a better, more sustainable future. We will shape the future of our industry with best-in-class solutions at the intersection of science and creativity. We're passionate organizations made of team members who see their job as so much more. Our collective purpose inspires us every day to strive for better.
It's not just that we are talented scientists and creators, but that we are passionate about using those talents to generate results for our customers and for the world. We need both, the rigor of scientific expertise and the imagination of new possibilities, to create the best results. The fusion of both that will lead us to realizing the full potential of this combination.
Everything we do is for the purpose of improving the world, lengthening life spans, replacing or sustaining resources, enhancing sensorial experiences, solving house problems and more. And together, we can do even more good.
Creative science, scientific art, when science and creativity intersect, the possibilities are better. Here, innovation isn't a department. It's our business. Incredible curiosity, relentless drive, purposeful impact, innovation is simply our way of operating, and now with double the R&D resources, unmatched in the industry. If you are keeping track, our people can't wait to get starting collaborating on something new.
We are shaping the future of the industry for the better. Our vision is our strategy for future success. It articulates our aspirations and guides the development of future strategies and initiatives. It is a filter by which endeavors can be evaluated. Our vision is to be the partner for essential solutions. From day 1, we will bring unmatched innovation and leading-edge insight to anticipate what will be essential to tomorrow's consumers. Helping our customers and consumers need is at the heart of our business.
We are more than a vendor or supplier. Yes, we supply the ingredients, compounds and solutions you require, but we're also united in understanding and meeting the challenges of today and tomorrow. Essential solutions means that we will work to make both our relationship and what we provide invaluable to our customers' business. It pushes us to supply technology and know-how that no one else can. With customers of all sizes across the globe, from start-up to multinational, we have the agility and the expertise to deliver what you need. Unmatched innovation and leading-edge insight means we are already anticipating what will be essential to tomorrow's consumers.  As we come together as one organization, we can help our customers meet consumers' needs faster.
Our new operational model will leverage the capabilities and offerings of both organizations to create a sustainable framework that best position our teams, customers, shareholders for success on day 1 and well into the future. The complementary structure will focus our organization into 4 divisions: Taste, Food and Beverage; Scent; Health & Bioscience; and Pharma Solutions. We carefully examined how each division go to market, including customer overlap, R&D focus and service level requirements. Among other, several factors to make sure we created global divisions that were built for success.
Just as important as our 4 operating divisions will be our global centralized functions. Each of these will work in collaboration across our divisions. I want to call out, in particular, that we will be establishing a new integrated solution Center of Excellence to focus on incubating new business opportunities and total product solutions. We are also creating a Center for Commercial Excellence to support our business and commercial teams through development of best practices, customer insights and analysis, resource deployment and the optimization of pricing strategies and solutions. These 2 are extremely important as it will be instrumental collaborating with the business to achieve our revenue synergy goals.
We also announced the Executive Committee for the combined company, including highly qualified and diverse leaders with deep knowledge and expertise. If you're interested in the team's background, please check out on strongerinnovationtogether.com. I won't go through all of these distinguished leaders here, but I will note that this was a particular challenging process. Most organizations have tremendously talented individuals. We are fortunate that as a significantly large organization, we will be able to create many challenging, exciting new opportunities to further the careers of our employees.
I'm also very encouraged by the world-class Board of Directors we are beginning to assemble. As shared at the deal announcement, DuPont Executive Chairman and CEO, Ed Breen, will join the Board of the combined company as the DuPont designee following the close of a transaction and will serve as lead Independent Director starting in June 1, 2021. 
I'm also pleased to say that Matthias Heinzel, President of Nutrition & Biosciences at Dupont, will be joining the Board of Directors of IFF following the close of the transaction. Under his leadership, Matthias has strategically transformed the N&B business, driving customer-focused innovation, operational effectiveness and multiple business integrations. As an Independent Director, his extensive global management experience and deep knowledge of the industry will support the future company as it unlocks the value of the merger. 
In addition, Carol A. Davidson will also be appointed to join the Board of Directors of the future combined company following the close of the transaction. Mr. Davidson is a CPA with more than 30 years of leadership experience across multiple industries. He has held a variety of leadership roles at Tyco, International TE and Dell Inc. and financial leadership roles at the Eastman Kodak Company. Mr. Davidson is the lead Independent Director of Legg Mason and serves on the Board of TE Connectivity. For this team, both Board and management, I know our combined company will charge a new path forward for our industry and have a powerful impact on the world around us.
Stepping back, I will say that I'm deeply impressed, even more so given COVID-19, by the dedication and focus both the IFF and N&B teams have brought to this effort. We knew early on that these companies would be a strong cultural match, and our excitement and conviction behind the potential of this combination was only grown as our teams begin more and more to cooperate. As we look ahead, we are focused on executing the next key milestones and will do so within the same spend and diligence we have achieved thus far.
In summary, we are pleased with our strong financial performance despite an unprecedented first quarter 2020. We delivered on all of our key metrics and saw broad-based growth in both divisions with mid-single-digit sales and double-digit adjusted EPS ex-amortization growth on a consolidated basis. We continue to make important progress in the integration of Frutarom business and have taken substantial steps forward in bringing on our combination with DuPont and N&B to life. 
I'm also credibly proud of each and every one of my colleagues at IFF for what they have achieved during these challenging times, not just for our business, but for our partners, our customers and our communities. 
While global conditions remain volatile in the near term, our order book for Q2 looks solid as we are successfully navigating through these unprecedented times to emerge as a stronger company. 
I would now like to open the call for questions."

The emerging markets in the first quarter were particularly strong, Latin America by round about 10% and Greater Asia by plus 9%. What we see in terms of the different categories,  in particular, the Consumer Fragrance in Latin America in high-teens, as well as Flavors, high single, and Savory Solutions in high-teens as well. So really, really good results. Probably strongest from the multinationals, specifically in the HBC field. In Asia, it was all about Consumer Fragrances as well, so mid-teens, really good. Taste in high single digits. No surprise to COVID-19, I would say. And here in Asia, very much across both multinationals as well as regional and locals. Frutarom, as we said, is probably around about 4% growth with some benefits of smaller M&A, but still a very, very good performance.
I would say, country wise, it depends where the COVID-19 wave has started. We have seen the first impact in Asia, in particular, in China, then it moved to Europe, then to the U.S. and Latin America. So that's probably what you can see in the first quarter.
In terms of the pipeline, our pipeline remains strong also into the second quarter. But having said all of that, it's really different from customer to customer. I can say, also for us, our accretive labs are basically almost all open. They're working on new launches. They're working on, let's say, better, let's say, improvements of some of the products. So all in all, I would say, a very strong picture. Certainly, impact on Fine Fragrance because -- and you heard this from our customer base as well, which is not positive. But all the essential products are really going actually very, very strong.

We're in all of the categories, #1 and #2 in the market. We have a great R&D pipeline with a combined spend of around about $550 million, more than 9,000 patents granted. So I believe very, very robust. And as you have seen the N&B results in the first quarter as well, it shows it's an essential business. Probiotics are going gangbusters and many of the other portfolio areas as well.
Coming back to the integration fees. So as you know, we have formed an IMO, so an integration management office. We cleared antitrust in the U.S. We filed in Europe and in China. The combined integration planning can do a lot, which is even in these challenging times, and I'm very, very pleased how they worked together all over Zoom or Skype. Of course, it's very, very interesting. So we really make sure that we are ready for day 1. The next up on the schedule is the shareholder vote in September, then the financing and then the close, hopefully, in the first quarter 2021. So I have to say that this COVID-19 has further solidified our position. Strategic logic is very strong. Very resilient business. Very great market position.

We are fortunate that most of our revenue comes from the packaged Food and Beverage categories as well as hygiene and disinfection, right? Those -- so we have continued strength there. I mean the path that you're referring to is the part that we're not immune, is the categories most exposed to retail end markets where stores closed and travel dropped sharply. And that hasn't changed as of now. So that's Fine Fragrance and Cosmetic Actives as well, right? And also the away-from-home channels. So we're seeing that impact, and we are choosing to be -- try to stay resilient, flexible, close to our customers as we possibly can be. And always, sort of trying to be cognizant of the safety of our employees and well-being as we go forward.
China, regarding the China, part of your question. Fine Fragrance is a very small part of the portfolio, I mean, based on category demand, I mean, less than 2% of total Fine. And although it was quite strong in Q1, I mean, we -- that sea in China is opening up as well. Now Food Service in China was particularly challenged in Q1. That's obviously COVID.

And we believe on the Consumer Fragrance side, certainly, the activity in washing clothes and detergent, the softeners, it's very much demand. It's not so much stockpiling here. I think we see this. We see also all the hygiene products are really used. It's not just that people put it in the pantry. But that's what we see. And also on the Food side, when you talk to some of our customers, the yogurts are going like there's no tomorrow, which is probably not a big surprise to all of us because working from home, instead of going to the company cafeteria, you go to the fridge and pull a yogurt and that's your lunch. So we see some categories very much it's consumption. It's moving, but I can't give you all the details. What is for us, right now, really important is on the consumer insight side. We do all of our studies, we know how the consumer behaves right now. And what is sustainable? So that we really can orient ourselves in terms of our R&D and the new product development towards things which might will come. We believe that everything in terms of sanitizing will stay. We believe also that many of the health products, in particular, fortified with vitamins or probiotics will stay. But there's more to come. So that's the work we are doing right now. So in many areas, the consumption is real. By the way, one last one, potato chips are also going like gangbusters. But Rustom, please comment."

I mean the part of your question -- then you also talked about sustainability, right? Sustainability of Consumer Fragrance, we do believe this will continue to be robust. Consumer demand remains high in hygiene and disinfection. And if anyone has been to the store lately, it's just hard to get those products, right?
But let me address one aspect, too. I mean the Scent profitability because of specifics and because of Fine, right? Scent profitability without -- that will still be adversely impacted in Q2. I don't -- I can't get into -- I don't want to get into specifics, but based on our largest -- what our largest Fine Fragrances customers are saying publicly, the category is declining double digits. So I'd expect the same for IFF and our competitors. And being that it is one of our highest-margin categories, well above consolidated average, and with these declines, margins will be down. Then you add in additional COVID costs that we had in Q2, a full quarter's worth then that's just another factor."

You might remember at the beginning, toilet paper was also very precious article around the world in many of the supermarkets. But that's back to normal. So actually, we have seen already quite a normalization, not because COVID is gone, but people see and feel that they can buy whatever they need. There was not a big disruption in the supply chain. So we believe that the inventory has changed. It's different than in pharmaceuticals, for example, where people just keeping their diabetes product better for 3 or 4 months instead of 1 month to make sure that they are covered. But here, I think in many cases, we are already back to normal.
On the plants, it's a bit of a different situation because we are managing the supply chain actually almost by the week because India, which is a big country for raw materials in our industry, has some challenges with lockdown as well. So we really had to make sure that we get enough inventory in all the plants around the world to secure supply for our customers. So here, you probably will see some elevated inventory levels for quite some time. But again, situation is volatile. I expected this actually for the first quarter as well. But we were selling so much, the inventory actually went down. So that's our plan of basically what we assume for now, but it might change because it's very dependent on the demand as well.

And in terms of geography, it's about 3/4 Taste and the rest in Scent roughly, okay?
The Scent synergies showed through. And as you saw Scent's performance, there's consumer leverage. But Taste, where you're homing in, did benefit some synergies as well. But it also had mix. I mean we went straight there. We also had mid-teens growth in Savory Solutions, which is a lower-margin business. We had the loss CitraSource, and then we have some added costs, right? Manufacturing and procurement, and cost hid up in the balance sheet and everything. But we also had some bad debt as we increased our bad debt provision, not actual bad debts but actually provisions as we did. So there were all offsets in here. 
Now as to your second part of your question about the ongoing plans that we have. I mean, yes, there will be some delays. There's a little bit of disruptions to achieving, in particular, the manufacturing synergies that we expected from Frutarom, right? And that's quite simply because we can't -- the people are not traveling out to various sites. Even we're working from home quite effectively. But as Andreas has mentioned, too, we do prioritize the safety of our people. And people are just not traveling out to site. So there will be some delays in realizing the synergies from Frutarom coming through. And the same thing on procurement. On the procurement then, by the way, because with the huge disruption that we've seen out there in the -- in raw materials and sourcing and all the rest of that, that hasn't shown up in our P&L. But that's because our teams have been sort of pulling in really hard yards, making sure that we handled all this without disrupting our customers, right? But something gives, and that something is -- one of those things that it have given is pushing through some of those other synergies. Andreas, is there anything you want to add there as well?"

So I just wanted to kind of clarify that versus what you had just said about the only a 3-month delay on synergy.
And then just more broadly on Frutarom. I was just curious to know kind of what drove the upside in the quarter. Is it sustainable? From what we can see, it looks like Savory was a big part of that. And just is that also -- we talked about some mix dynamic, the areas in Frutarom that are coming through maybe a bit better than expected. Is that also another drive on mix?"

We have seen a couple of elements of the legacy Food business which performed very well and we believe it's sustainable. So everything which is connected to health, we believe, will be sustainable because that's an incredible drive for the sales ingredients. That's number one.
The second one is on food protection because people really want to increase shelf life and make sure that this works out well. So that's going extremely well, double digit, but we believe it will be also sustainable.
And then on Savory, we will see. The Savory Solutions has made actually extreme progress in terms of bringing it together with the legacy flavors. And we have seen good developments. Whether this is -- certainly not sustainable in a double-digit growth rate, it is more dependent on how quickly the economies open up and how much is in the Food Service area because that certainly has more of a negative impact here as well. On the other hand, this is part of this famous butchers business. People in Austria and Germany were eating meat like there's no tomorrow because all the restaurants were closed, and that helped us with our sales as well. So sometimes, it's -- these are interesting, interesting dynamics. But I hope that helps as an explanation. 
And then on the food integration, risk associated was not being done with the integration work before merging with DuPont. It is basically some -- 1 or 2, on our manufacturing plants, we just hold back because we believe with N&B now we have a different way forward where we can use these capacities and can use them for some of the N&B products. So we do note everything, which we have said we are doing. Despite the things where we believe with the N&B combination, we have a better way forward when we have N&B on board as well. So that's it. That's the only thing. And that's on Tilburg in Holland, but that's it. We can't talk more in detail. I hope that helps."

At IFF, with global operations in 44 countries and sales into approximately 200 countries, we have seen firsthand how the coronavirus pandemic has touched our world. This is truly a remarkable moment in history. It presents all of us with new challenges, but also revealed the best humanity at the same time. On behalf of every one at IFF, I want to express my sincere sympathy for all those affected by the pandemic.
I also want to thank everyone in the global health care community who exemplifies the best of all of us in responding to this crisis with courage and grace. Everyone on the frontline who continue to keep our society moving [ towards ] has our thanks. To all the essential workers and the consumer goods supply chain, of which IFF is proud to play an important role, we thank you for responding so quickly and moving swiftly to deliver for consumers around the world. This is very clear that we are still in the early stages of adjusting to the changes the pandemic poses to our world. As we'll review in more detail later, the IFF business is strongly positioned to be resilient through economic cycles given our substantial portfolio delivering needed solutions to vital consumers and markets.
The steps we have taken in recent years, including diversifying of our customer base and expansion into more categories, have only served to further strengthen our ability to be a vital partner to our customers and affirm our ability to be resilient through the cycles. Like many, we are seeing uneven impacts on our business due to the pandemic and the resulting economic challenges. While some end markets are seeing increases in demand, others are seeing notable declines. We are fortunate that only about 15% of our revenue, not including Fragrance Ingredients, that is subject to the downward pressure right now. However, the unpredictable nature of the pandemic and the early stage of the economic impact creates enough uncertainty for us that we have made the decision to withdraw our full year financial guidance. Rustom will cover this in more detail later. But while we navigate through this challenge, we are committed to providing as much forward outlook as we can so you understand the trends driving earnings.
On today's call, I will provide an executive overview of our operational and financial performance for the first quarter 2020 before offering a more in-depth review of IFF's management of the ongoing and evolving COVID-19 situation. Following this discussion, I will ask Rustom to provide a more detailed financial review of business, including additional insight into our liquidity and capital structure, which is very strong, given the uncertainty of the pandemic going forward.
As you may also have seen, today, we announced important progress related to our pending combination with DuPont Nutrition & Biosciences, including a new guiding purpose and vision for the future combined company as well as our operating model and executive management team post close. Following Rustom's remarks, I will provide an overview of these important integration updates. Upon the completion of our prepared commentary, we will take any questions that you may have.
Our strong performance for the first quarter 2020 affirms the strength of our organization and the essential position in serving vital end markets through economic cycles. We achieved a strong start to the year with mid-single-digit sales and double-digit adjusted EPS ex-amortization growth, both of which are currency-neutral basis. Importantly, we continue to achieve financial benefits related to our integration of the Frutarom business, both revenue and cost synergies. 
As I mentioned before, we have also made significant progress with integration planning to support our combination with the DuPont N&B business. And I must acknowledge our teams that have worked hard to build the foundation for this combination while continuing to contribute to IFF's day-to-day operations. 
Our teams have worked tirelessly to deliver for our customers. They have gone above and beyond to support our communities around the world during this time. Our strong quarter is a testament to their unwavering dedication, the underlying strength of our business and our role as an essential partner in the global food and consumer product supply chains. While we have certainly faced many challenges through these unprecedented situation, our operations and global network remains strong, and we have taken appropriate steps to ensure our business is well positioned to successfully manage through the pandemic.
Looking at our financial performance in the first quarter, I am pleased to say we delivered strong improvements across key financial metrics. In the first quarter, IFF achieved sales of USD 1.3 billion, which represents a 6% growth on currency-neutral basis, driven by our performance in both our Taste and Scent businesses. We also achieved strong adjusted earnings per share of $1.62, excluding amortization, reflecting a 13% year-over-year increase on a currency-neutral basis, led by currency-neutral adjusted operating profit of 9% to USD 271 million.
In addition, we expanded our operating margin, excluding amortization, by 60 basis points to 20.1%, driven by volume growth and productivity. In summary, IFF entered 2020 with solid momentum and continued to deliver currency-neutral sales growth in the high single digits through the end of February. However, for March onwards, we started to see the global impact of COVID-19 on our business, and we expect this to impact our results in the second quarter as we have seen uneven impact across end markets. Rustom will touch on this in more detail later.
I would like to spend a few moments outlining the key characteristics and drivers of our business, which leave IFF very well positioned to navigate today's new reality. More than ever, it is clear that IFF plays a vital role in the global CPG supply chain, especially for world's most important manufacturers in food and beverage as well as essential home, personal care and sanitation supplies.
IFF's broad-based exposure across regions, categories and customer positions us to remain resilient through the ongoing challenges brought about by the pandemic. As a result of regulatory actions and corresponding economic challenges, we are seeing certain reduction in demand in our Fine Fragrance, Cosmetic Active and Food Service offerings where end markets are seeing significant impact. This represents approximately 15% of our revenue. At the same time, we're seeing tremendous pickup in areas where the solutions that IFF pose are absolutely critical to the production of essential products. Our categories exposed to packaged food and beverage and hygiene and disinfection saw continued strong growth during the quarter. That is about 85% of our revenue.
Fortunately, our operations remain strong as we continue to deliver the creative solutions that our customers and end consumers demand during these unprecedented times. Our goal from the outset of this crisis has been twofold. First, we are deeply determined to ensure the well-being of our people. Second, we are committed to preserving continuity across the network so that we can continue meeting the needs of our customers. Our global, regional and local crisis teams are working around the clock to do what is the best for our people and our business. A co-working group, including representative from our executive team and across functional support groups and business teams, meets daily to ensure alignment from top to bottom across our teams. This team is putting in place plans and protocols to be sure we are anticipating what is to come and keep all of our stakeholders engaged through this extended period of disruption.
We have been proactively reviewing our resiliency plan to address the COVID-19 developments, and we are coordinating our response with federal and local health and government entities around the world. We have updated internal protocols as the situation has evolved, taking significant measures to protect our people, including implementing enhanced disinfection and sanitation measures at our operational facilities and taking precautions to minimize contact among employees as part of social distancing by grouping our professionals into smaller pots and separating their work shifts. For those able to work from home, we're instituting a remote working policy across many of our locations as well.
Given IFF's vital role in the consumer product supply chain, we continue to secure essential designations that provide our company with permission to manufacture our products around the world as governments extend workplace restrictions. A good example of our team working through these unexpected challenges has been India. Recently, our Chennai facility, where we have been secured essential business designations, was still forced to shut for several days due to regulatory restrictions. Thanks to the diligence of our team and a strong working relationship with regulators, we were able to move ahead of time in response to the shutdown to meet all customer demands through the shutdown while keeping employees safe.
In terms of our operations, we are seeing some challenges with logistics, and our lead times have increased, but the team is doing an excellent job navigating the transportation restrictions. We realize we are certainly not alone in this challenge. For these reasons, we have also seen some limitation in raw material distribution and have activated our contingency plans to limit the disruption that any material shortages might have for our customers.
Now we have seen disruptions to our supply chain, it has been mostly limited to the regions where the most significant government restrictions are in place, including Italy, Spain and India. On the new project and innovation front, most of our creative centers remain open and are engaging remotely as needed, and I'm happy to say that our project pipeline remains solid across our entire portfolio.
As I mentioned from the outset, our business has displayed impressive resilience through the evolving situation. We continue to proactively take steps that will ensure that IFF is operating from a position of financial strength. Specifically, we're adapting an especially disciplined approach to cost management. This means we are tightening any nonessential spend and reviewing new opportunities for efficiencies that can preserve our margin profile. We also are looking at CapEx and considering near-term priorities while pushing out longer-term investments as appropriate. And we are considering additional ways to optimize our net working capital by closely reviewing existing inventories and pursuing collections. Lastly, we have a strong cash position with USD 1 billion of untapped credit revolver available, giving us confidence in ensuring our strong position even in the event of a prolonged economic downturn.
Even in the midst of increased demand and the challenging operating environment, our teams have mobilized to support frontline health care workers and first responders across the global IFF network. IFFers across the globe have found very creative ways to leverage the company's unique capabilities and innovative spirit and lead a number of exciting community-focused initiatives, including from New Jersey to the Netherlands, IFF has modified our production facilities to allow for the manufacture and distribution of hand sanitizers. To date, I have estimated more than 65 metric tons of hand sanitizers globally to first responders and other organizations in need. Our North America Scent creator team quickly developed a new scent, HOPE 2020, that has been used by IFF and other partners in the production of hand sanitizers. Our Scent team has also partnered with Harvard Medical School and Mass General Hospital to create early detection smell test for asymptomatic carriers, the first developed globally. 
In India, our facilities donated food and other necessary sanitation items to local orphanages, hospitals and police stations. These actions speak to how our employees continue to embody our commitment to care for the resources of our world, and nothing could be more important than caring for our communities.
I could not be more proud of the spirit of caring that IFF has demonstrated throughout the global pandemic. 
With that, I would like to turn it over to Rustom, who will discuss our first quarter financial performance in greater detail."
281407,665128569,2022027,"International Flavors & Fragrances Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, May 12, 2020",2020-05-12,"Earnings Calls","International Flavors & Fragrances Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Andreas. Now to Slide 12, and taking a more detailed look at our quarterly financial performance.On a currency-neutral basis, IFF delivered broad-based sales growth of 6% versus 2019's first quarter. Adjusted operating profit margin improved",1868,"Thank you, Andreas. Now to Slide 12, and taking a more detailed look at our quarterly financial performance.
On a currency-neutral basis, IFF delivered broad-based sales growth of 6% versus 2019's first quarter. Adjusted operating profit margin improved in both Taste and Scent with procurement synergies; volume leverage; and productivity initiatives; and disciplined research, sales and administration for RSA cost containment. And this helped reduce our operating expenses as a percentage of sales. I am therefore pleased to say that we also saw solid profit growth in roughly 60 points of currency-neutral margin expansion on an adjusted operating profit mix amount basis.
COVID-19 did impact our P&L in Q1, but more in terms of sales mix rather than in total dollars and only in the final weeks of the quarter. It did have a modest negative impact on our adjusted operating profit in the quarter, causing us to incur extra manufacturing costs, additional freight expenses and higher raw material costs. But most of these went into inventory and will not be with expenses.
Our currency-neutral earnings per share, excluding amortization, grew a strong 13%, with robust operating profit growth boosted by lower year-on-year interest expenses and a lower effective tax rate. FX adversely impacted our reported numbers, pulling sales and adjusted operating profits down a couple of percent. It had a much larger negative impact on other income/expenses in March as a result of currencies collapsing globally against the dollar and the euro. So on a reported basis, this pulled down year-on-year adjusted EPS growth.
Now looking at our Scent division on Slide 13. In the first quarter, currency-neutral Scent sales grew 7% with growth in all regions and nearly all categories. Sales performance was strongest in Consumer Fragrance with a double-digit increase led by robust growth in Fabric, Home and Hair Care. And while we did experience a volume lift from COVID-19, especially from the increase in hygiene and disinfection categories, we also benefited from strong new wins, including with customers where we have recently gained access to their call list. We also saw high single-digit growth in Fragrance Ingredients, led by robust volume growth.
At the same time, Fine Fragrance sales declined as disruption of consumer access to retail markets, and a pronounced drop in global travel due to COVID-19 led to deceleration late in the quarter. Fine Fragrances started 2020 well and was growing until the last couple of weeks of the quarter even against last Q1 double-digit comp. And then we saw a significant contraction as our customers adapted their supply chains for new store closure and travel realities. This trend has continued in Q2 with a far greater impact, and I will elaborate on this shortly.
For the entire Scent segment, we posted a 20.4% segment profit margin. And segment profit grew to $105 million, up 19% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by volume growth and lower operating expenses.
Moving to Taste on Slide 14. We saw currency-neutral sales growth of 5% in the first quarter having achieved increases in all regions. We saw mid- to high single-digit growth in LatAm, Greater Asia and EMEA. From a category perspective, we again saw significant mid-teens growth in Savory Solutions with very strong growth in EMEA, our largest market, and also LatAm. 
Flavors grew low single digits, led by Greater Asia and Latin America. And this was driven by strong commercial performance on new wins, in particular, in the attractive categories of Beverage and Dairy. 
Though Frutarom is now mostly incorporated in the Taste business, we did commit to continue providing updates as to how sales are doing as if this had remained on a stand-alone basis. So if we had measured Frutarom as a stand-alone, currency-neutral sales would have grown by roughly 4% versus the prior year.
For the entire Taste business, we had a 16.5% margin with segment profit growing 6% to $137 million, led by volume benefits and Frutarom integration-related synergies. You may have noticed that this segment profit margin appears lower than you are used to seeing. This is because Frutarom is now included, and there is approximately $44 million of amortization of intangible assets.
Now I would like to provide an update on cash flow through the first quarter of 2020. The chart on Page 15 is designed to show the reconciliation from reported net income to cash flow, inclusive of all the drivers. Operating cash flow was $17 million in the first quarter, down from $47 million in 2019's first quarter, primarily due to higher core working capital levels. Within core working capital, we had solid improvements in inventory that were offset by higher accounts receivable as a result of strong sales in Q1 2020 as well as 2019 calendar shift. We expect the portion of this will normalize as we move through the year. Nevertheless, our cash conversion cycle in Q1 2020 was consistent with 2019's first quarter.
We continue to invest in the business, particularly for planned capacity increases and Frutarom integrations. Our capital expenditures as a percentage of sales in the first quarter of 2020 was 3.6%, and this was versus last year's 4.5%. And I will touch on our outlook for the balance of the year in a moment. 
The net impact on our free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less CapEx, was a negative $31 million. As a reminder, Q1 is our seasonably lowest quarter of the year, and last year, it was a negative $11 million.
In terms of cash usage, M&A and earn-outs and dividends amounted to $94 million versus $112 million in the prior year's first quarter, and this was all due to lower M&A and earn-outs. 
As Andreas noted before, we are taking steps to preserve our strong financial position at this time. Given the current environment and the possibility that the global economy could face a protracted downturn, we are constantly refining our scenario planning to ensure we are well prepared. This starts with controlling what we can control, targeting reductions in operational and capital expenses. We are being very cautious with hiring, mainly just critical replacement positions and a handful of critical new hires. And we are reducing any and all nonessential spend in the near term, including the likes of travel, entertainment, consulting, et cetera.
COVID-19 does bring some working capital headwind. We have experienced supply chain disruptions as various countries took lockdown action. We value our long-term customer relationships, so we purchased additional raw materials to serve as safety stocks, giving us capability to move manufacturing around and, in general, to help insulate against supply chain disruption as we've seen in India. We are also paying some of our smaller and/or COVID-19-impacted suppliers more promptly if this is warranted. And this could be expected. We're experiencing an increase in receivables, particularly from Food Service and Fine Fragrance customers. 
Of course, we're working to offset these working capital pressures where we can. For inventory, we are constantly balancing the need to ensure business continuity during COVID-19 with the need to not over order. Where we could extend our payables, we are working with suppliers to do so. And we are pursuing collections from customers with over dues and being proactive with those where there is credit risk.
For capital expenditures, we are targeting reductions across the business. Specifically, we are prioritizing the highest-returning projects while delaying longer-term investments that are not absolutely necessary at this time. And of course, practically, COVID-19 is making it much harder to launch our complete projects where significant travel is required. Moving forward, we also have to be smart to ensure that we invest in a flexible and healthy ecosystem.
Turning to Slide 17. As we consider our current capital structure and manage our balance sheet moving forward, we've outlined our upcoming debt maturity schedule, which includes a good balance of short- and long-term tiers. We have strong and ample liquidity, well within our debt covenants as our net debt-to-EBITDA at the end of Q1 2020 was 3.3x. Our cash position at the end of Q1 is strong at $433 million with $1 billion of an untapped credit revolver available should we need it. Looking ahead, following the close of the DuPont N&B transaction, we are committed to maintaining our investment-grade rating. As stated in December, we intend to quickly delever after the close of the transaction to get below 3x net debt-to-EBITDA within the following 24 months.
Now turning to our outlook. To conceptualize our expected sales dynamic in Q2, I wanted to highlight the many moving parts we are seeing and expecting this quarter. COVID-19 presents both opportunities and challenges as we forge ahead. Starting on the left side of the slide, we expect to see continued robust growth in our Taste business, excluding Food Service as well as in our Consumer Fragrance business. The demand and consumption of the products that these businesses are supporting remain high, and we are well positioned with our global footprint to capitalize on this. In the middle box is Fragrance Ingredients where demand is strong. However, we are facing challenges in the supply chain and, in particular, the Indian lockdown. This means that we have to forgo external sales to ensure that we protect our Fragrance compounds business.
The last category is where demand has been adversely impacted by COVID-19. Food Service, with a vast stay-at-home orders across the globe as well as changes in consumer behaviors, have impacted away-from-home consumption. Fine Fragrance and Cosmetic Actives, where the retail channels have been temporarily closed and travel retail is down, both due to COVID-19, as well as these categories being more discretionary in nature.
Now more than ever, IFF's broad-based exposure across the regions, categories and customers positions us to remain resilient through the ongoing challenges. We are fortunate that the majority of our revenues comes from categories exposed to packaged food and beverage and from hygiene and disinfection, so parts of our business are experiencing higher sales volumes in this current environment. Having said this, we're not totally immune. Not surprisingly, April's currency-neutral sales were challenged, with strong Consumer Fragrance and Flavors, offset primarily by weakness in Fine Fragrance and Food Service. For the second quarter, while we are not giving specific guidance, it is worth noting that with the pressure in Fine Fragrances, operating margin mix will be a headwind as well as the additional COVID-19-related costs.
We continue to evaluate what evolving global market dynamics will mean for our business performance and projections moving forward. As the second quarter progresses and we gain greater visibility, as Andreas noted, we'll provide updates as appropriate. While our ability to pivot quickly and modify our daily operation has enabled us to responsibly operate our business, the constantly evolving global responses to COVID-19 have created uncertainties for IFF and for other companies and our partners as well. Given the extent of the current uncertainty globally and the potential for uneven impact on our businesses, we have decided to withdraw our fiscal 2020 guidance. We will continue to manage our business by taking actions to generate strong cash flow and maintain ample liquidity.
With that, let me turn the call back over to Andreas."

I'm also very pleased that today, we're introducing the next step in our planned integration process with N&B. As you know, we are extremely excited to combine our 2 customer-focused and consumer-led organizations with leading positions in high-value categories. Together, our product portfolio will be among the industry most robust and diverse. We have a coveted R&D program with an industry-leading pipeline, and most importantly, we will be poised to redefine our industry by delivering essential solutions to our customers. We remain on target to close the transaction in the first quarter of 2021. Until then, IFF and N&B will remain independent entities and will operate separately.
Since we announced our merger in December 2019, our teams have been hard at work bringing this combination to life. We have formal integration management office, cleared the U.S. regulatory process, filed for regulatory events in Europe and China and filed our initial registration statement. The potential of this combination continues to excite our teams, and we are working diligently to make sure we can hit the ground in full sprint on day 1.
Some of our important highlights over the past 4 months include: completed strategic assessment of the future combined company portfolio, joint cross-function integration program in place and operational, created ideation framework to identify, assess and prioritize synergy opportunities. Today, we took another significant step forward. We have announced our purpose, vision and operating model and Executive Committee for the future combined company. In short, we are announcing who we'll be, what we intend to do and who will lead our incredible team once we combine forces with the N&B business in the first quarter of 2021.
Our purpose is the why that drives everything we do. The combined companies' purpose, applying science and creativity for a better world, we'll focus on our intent to push past traditional industry boundaries and commit to be a force for a better, more sustainable future. We will shape the future of our industry with best-in-class solutions at the intersection of science and creativity. We're passionate organizations made of team members who see their job as so much more. Our collective purpose inspires us every day to strive for better.
It's not just that we are talented scientists and creators, but that we are passionate about using those talents to generate results for our customers and for the world. We need both, the rigor of scientific expertise and the imagination of new possibilities, to create the best results. The fusion of both that will lead us to realizing the full potential of this combination.
Everything we do is for the purpose of improving the world, lengthening life spans, replacing or sustaining resources, enhancing sensorial experiences, solving house problems and more. And together, we can do even more good.
Creative science, scientific art, when science and creativity intersect, the possibilities are better. Here, innovation isn't a department. It's our business. Incredible curiosity, relentless drive, purposeful impact, innovation is simply our way of operating, and now with double the R&D resources, unmatched in the industry. If you are keeping track, our people can't wait to get starting collaborating on something new.
We are shaping the future of the industry for the better. Our vision is our strategy for future success. It articulates our aspirations and guides the development of future strategies and initiatives. It is a filter by which endeavors can be evaluated. Our vision is to be the partner for essential solutions. From day 1, we will bring unmatched innovation and leading-edge insight to anticipate what will be essential to tomorrow's consumers. Helping our customers and consumers need is at the heart of our business.
We are more than a vendor or supplier. Yes, we supply the ingredients, compounds and solutions you require, but we're also united in understanding and meeting the challenges of today and tomorrow. Essential solutions means that we will work to make both our relationship and what we provide invaluable to our customers' business. It pushes us to supply technology and know-how that no one else can. With customers of all sizes across the globe, from start-up to multinational, we have the agility and the expertise to deliver what you need. Unmatched innovation and leading-edge insight means we are already anticipating what will be essential to tomorrow's consumers.  As we come together as one organization, we can help our customers meet consumers' needs faster.
Our new operational model will leverage the capabilities and offerings of both organizations to create a sustainable framework that best position our teams, customers, shareholders for success on day 1 and well into the future. The complementary structure will focus our organization into 4 divisions: Taste, Food and Beverage; Scent; Health & Bioscience; and Pharma Solutions. We carefully examined how each division go to market, including customer overlap, R&D focus and service level requirements. Among other, several factors to make sure we created global divisions that were built for success.
Just as important as our 4 operating divisions will be our global centralized functions. Each of these will work in collaboration across our divisions. I want to call out, in particular, that we will be establishing a new integrated solution Center of Excellence to focus on incubating new business opportunities and total product solutions. We are also creating a Center for Commercial Excellence to support our business and commercial teams through development of best practices, customer insights and analysis, resource deployment and the optimization of pricing strategies and solutions. These 2 are extremely important as it will be instrumental collaborating with the business to achieve our revenue synergy goals.
We also announced the Executive Committee for the combined company, including highly qualified and diverse leaders with deep knowledge and expertise. If you're interested in the team's background, please check out on strongerinnovationtogether.com. I won't go through all of these distinguished leaders here, but I will note that this was a particular challenging process. Most organizations have tremendously talented individuals. We are fortunate that as a significantly large organization, we will be able to create many challenging, exciting new opportunities to further the careers of our employees.
I'm also very encouraged by the world-class Board of Directors we are beginning to assemble. As shared at the deal announcement, DuPont Executive Chairman and CEO, Ed Breen, will join the Board of the combined company as the DuPont designee following the close of a transaction and will serve as lead Independent Director starting in June 1, 2021. 
I'm also pleased to say that Matthias Heinzel, President of Nutrition & Biosciences at Dupont, will be joining the Board of Directors of IFF following the close of the transaction. Under his leadership, Matthias has strategically transformed the N&B business, driving customer-focused innovation, operational effectiveness and multiple business integrations. As an Independent Director, his extensive global management experience and deep knowledge of the industry will support the future company as it unlocks the value of the merger. 
In addition, Carol A. Davidson will also be appointed to join the Board of Directors of the future combined company following the close of the transaction. Mr. Davidson is a CPA with more than 30 years of leadership experience across multiple industries. He has held a variety of leadership roles at Tyco, International TE and Dell Inc. and financial leadership roles at the Eastman Kodak Company. Mr. Davidson is the lead Independent Director of Legg Mason and serves on the Board of TE Connectivity. For this team, both Board and management, I know our combined company will charge a new path forward for our industry and have a powerful impact on the world around us.
Stepping back, I will say that I'm deeply impressed, even more so given COVID-19, by the dedication and focus both the IFF and N&B teams have brought to this effort. We knew early on that these companies would be a strong cultural match, and our excitement and conviction behind the potential of this combination was only grown as our teams begin more and more to cooperate. As we look ahead, we are focused on executing the next key milestones and will do so within the same spend and diligence we have achieved thus far.
In summary, we are pleased with our strong financial performance despite an unprecedented first quarter 2020. We delivered on all of our key metrics and saw broad-based growth in both divisions with mid-single-digit sales and double-digit adjusted EPS ex-amortization growth on a consolidated basis. We continue to make important progress in the integration of Frutarom business and have taken substantial steps forward in bringing on our combination with DuPont and N&B to life. 
I'm also credibly proud of each and every one of my colleagues at IFF for what they have achieved during these challenging times, not just for our business, but for our partners, our customers and our communities. 
While global conditions remain volatile in the near term, our order book for Q2 looks solid as we are successfully navigating through these unprecedented times to emerge as a stronger company. 
I would now like to open the call for questions."

The emerging markets in the first quarter were particularly strong, Latin America by round about 10% and Greater Asia by plus 9%. What we see in terms of the different categories, in particular, the Consumer Fragrance in Latin America in high-teens, as well as Flavors, high single, and Savory Solutions in high-teens as well. So really, really good results. Probably strongest from the multinationals, specifically in the HBC field. In Asia, it was all about Consumer Fragrances as well, so mid-teens, really good. Taste in high single digits. No surprise to COVID-19, I would say. And here in Asia, very much across both multinationals as well as regional and locals. Frutarom, as we said, is probably around about 4% growth with some benefits of smaller M&A, but still a very, very good performance.
I would say, country wise, it depends where the COVID-19 wave has started. We have seen the first impact in Asia, in particular, in China, then it moved to Europe, then to the U.S. and Latin America. So that's probably what you can see in the first quarter.
In terms of the pipeline, our pipeline remains strong also into the second quarter. But having said all of that, it's really different from customer to customer. I can say, also for us, our accretive labs are basically almost all open. They're working on new launches. They're working on, let's say, better, let's say, improvements of some of the products. So all in all, I would say, a very strong picture. Certainly, impact on Fine Fragrance because -- and you heard this from our customer base as well, which is not positive. But all the essential products are really going actually very, very strong.

So combination with the DuPont N&B business is fully on track. And if you look at the product portfolio, it's now among the industry, in particular, in this COVID-19 situation, one of the most robust ones and very diverse. We're in all of the categories, #1 and #2 in the market. We have a great R&D pipeline with a combined spend of around about $550 million, more than 9,000 patents granted. So I believe very, very robust. And as you have seen the N&B results in the first quarter as well, it shows it's an essential business. Probiotics are going gangbusters and many of the other portfolio areas as well.
Coming back to the integration fees. So as you know, we have formed an IMO, so an integration management office. We cleared antitrust in the U.S. We filed in Europe and in China. The combined integration planning can do a lot, which is even in these challenging times, and I'm very, very pleased how they worked together all over Zoom or Skype. Of course, it's very, very interesting. So we really make sure that we are ready for day 1. The next up on the schedule is the shareholder vote in September, then the financing and then the close, hopefully, in the first quarter 2021. So I have to say that this COVID-19 has further solidified our position. Strategic logic is very strong. Very resilient business. Very great market position. And I believe that we're in a very, very good spot right now."

We are fortunate that most of our revenue comes from the packaged Food and Beverage categories as well as hygiene and disinfection, right? Those -- so we have continued strength there. I mean the path that you're referring to is the part that we're not immune, is the categories most exposed to retail end markets where stores closed and travel dropped sharply. And that hasn't changed as of now. So that's Fine Fragrance and Cosmetic Actives as well, right? And also the away-from-home channels. So we're seeing that impact, and we are choosing to be -- try to stay resilient, flexible, close to our customers as we possibly can be. And always, sort of trying to be cognizant of the safety of our employees and well-being as we go forward.
China, regarding the China, part of your question. Fine Fragrance is a very small part of the portfolio, I mean, based on category demand, I mean, less than 2% of total Fine. And although it was quite strong in Q1, I mean, we -- that sea in China is opening up as well. Now Food Service in China was particularly challenged in Q1. That's obviously COVID.

It's hard to disaggregate the underlying demand versus stockpiling. But we talk with many of our customers. And we believe on the Consumer Fragrance side, certainly, the activity in washing clothes and detergent, the softeners, it's very much demand. It's not so much stockpiling here. I think we see this. We see also all the hygiene products are really used. It's not just that people put it in the pantry. But that's what we see. And also on the Food side, when you talk to some of our customers, the yogurts are going like there's no tomorrow, which is probably not a big surprise to all of us because working from home, instead of going to the company cafeteria, you go to the fridge and pull a yogurt and that's your lunch. So we see some categories very much it's consumption. It's moving, but I can't give you all the details. What is for us, right now, really important is on the consumer insight side. We do all of our studies, we know how the consumer behaves right now. And what is sustainable? So that we really can orient ourselves in terms of our R&D and the new product development towards things which might will come. We believe that everything in terms of sanitizing will stay. We believe also that many of the health products, in particular, fortified with vitamins or probiotics will stay. But there's more to come. So that's the work we are doing right now. So in many areas, the consumption is real. By the way, one last one, potato chips are also going like gangbusters. But Rustom, please comment."

I mean the part of your question -- then you also talked about sustainability, right? Sustainability of Consumer Fragrance, we do believe this will continue to be robust. Consumer demand remains high in hygiene and disinfection. And if anyone has been to the store lately, it's just hard to get those products, right?
But let me address one aspect, too. I mean the Scent profitability because of specifics and because of Fine, right? Scent profitability without -- that will still be adversely impacted in Q2. I don't -- I can't get into -- I don't want to get into specifics, but based on our largest -- what our largest Fine Fragrances customers are saying publicly, the category is declining double digits. So I'd expect the same for IFF and our competitors. And being that it is one of our highest-margin categories, well above consolidated average, and with these declines, margins will be down. Then you add in additional COVID costs that we had in Q2, a full quarter's worth then that's just another factor."

You might remember at the beginning, toilet paper was also very precious article around the world in many of the supermarkets. But that's back to normal. So actually, we have seen already quite a normalization, not because COVID is gone, but people see and feel that they can buy whatever they need. There was not a big disruption in the supply chain. So we believe that the inventory has changed. It's different than in pharmaceuticals, for example, where people just keeping their diabetes product better for 3 or 4 months instead of 1 month to make sure that they are covered. But here, I think in many cases, we are already back to normal.
On the plants, it's a bit of a different situation because we are managing the supply chain actually almost by the week because India, which is a big country for raw materials in our industry, has some challenges with lockdown as well. So we really had to make sure that we get enough inventory in all the plants around the world to secure supply for our customers. So here, you probably will see some elevated inventory levels for quite some time. But again, situation is volatile. I expected this actually for the first quarter as well. But we were selling so much, the inventory actually went down. So that's our plan of basically what we assume for now, but it might change because it's very dependent on the demand as well.

You actually were -- you were triangulating in on exactly what the factors were. So in the -- first of all, we are on track with our cost synergies target through Q1, Frutarom, I mean, with more than 25% of our $50 million full year savings coming in Q1. And in terms of geography, it's about 3/4 Taste and the rest in Scent roughly, okay?
The Scent synergies showed through. And as you saw Scent's performance, there's consumer leverage. But Taste, where you're homing in, did benefit some synergies as well. But it also had mix. I mean we went straight there. We also had mid-teens growth in Savory Solutions, which is a lower-margin business. We had the loss CitraSource, and then we have some added costs, right? Manufacturing and procurement, and cost hid up in the balance sheet and everything. But we also had some bad debt as we increased our bad debt provision, not actual bad debts but actually provisions as we did. So there were all offsets in here. 
Now as to your second part of your question about the ongoing plans that we have. I mean, yes, there will be some delays. There's a little bit of disruptions to achieving, in particular, the manufacturing synergies that we expected from Frutarom, right? And that's quite simply because we can't -- the people are not traveling out to various sites. Even we're working from home quite effectively. But as Andreas has mentioned, too, we do prioritize the safety of our people. And people are just not traveling out to site. So there will be some delays in realizing the synergies from Frutarom coming through. And the same thing on procurement. On the procurement then, by the way, because with the huge disruption that we've seen out there in the -- in raw materials and sourcing and all the rest of that, that hasn't shown up in our P&L. But that's because our teams have been sort of pulling in really hard yards, making sure that we handled all this without disrupting our customers, right? But something gives, and that something is -- one of those things that it have given is pushing through some of those other synergies. Andreas, is there anything you want to add there as well?"

And then just more broadly on Frutarom. I was just curious to know kind of what drove the upside in the quarter. Is it sustainable? From what we can see, it looks like Savory was a big part of that. And just is that also -- we talked about some mix dynamic, the areas in Frutarom that are coming through maybe a bit better than expected. Is that also another drive on mix?"

We have seen a couple of elements of the legacy Food business which performed very well and we believe it's sustainable. So everything which is connected to health, we believe, will be sustainable because that's an incredible drive for the sales ingredients. That's number one.
The second one is on food protection because people really want to increase shelf life and make sure that this works out well. So that's going extremely well, double digit, but we believe it will be also sustainable.
And then on Savory, we will see. The Savory Solutions has made actually extreme progress in terms of bringing it together with the legacy flavors. And we have seen good developments. Whether this is -- certainly not sustainable in a double-digit growth rate, it is more dependent on how quickly the economies open up and how much is in the Food Service area because that certainly has more of a negative impact here as well. On the other hand, this is part of this famous butchers business. People in Austria and Germany were eating meat like there's no tomorrow because all the restaurants were closed, and that helped us with our sales as well. So sometimes, it's -- these are interesting, interesting dynamics. But I hope that helps as an explanation. 
And then on the food integration, risk associated was not being done with the integration work before merging with DuPont. It is basically some -- 1 or 2, on our manufacturing plants, we just hold back because we believe with N&B now we have a different way forward where we can use these capacities and can use them for some of the N&B products. So we do note everything, which we have said we are doing. Despite the things where we believe with the N&B combination, we have a better way forward when we have N&B on board as well. So that's it. That's the only thing. And that's on Tilburg in Holland, but that's it. We can't talk more in detail. I hope that helps."

Good morning, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I get into some of the highlights and key accomplishments for the first half of 2020, I would like to take a moment to recognize essential workers around the world, including some of our IFFers who continue to fuel our global supply chain and keep our economy moving forward. Your strength and dedication are truly commendable, and I thank you for your efforts. 
While we continue to operate in challenging times, I'm proud to say that our employees have continued to meet and exceed the needs and expectations of our customers around the world. Today, I will focus my remarks on a review of the highlights from the first half of 2020 as well as an update of business dynamics with regards to COVID-19. Rustom will then provide a more detailed review of our Q2 financial performance. Lastly, we will provide an update on our progress towards completing the previously announced transaction with DuPont N&B. 
There's no question that over the last several months, our business has been operating in a very difficult environment. Nevertheless, we have acted quickly to maintain continuity across our global operations in 44 countries while simultaneously integrating the Frutarom business and establishing the foundation for our pending combination with DuPont N&B. I'm extremely proud of what our teams around the world has accomplished as we continue to move our business forward and tirelessly serve our customers. 
In this uncertain environment, our business has proven to be resilient. Fortunately, approximately 85% of our portfolio serves end markets that remain in high demand for COVID-19, including food, beverage, hygiene and disinfection. Our strong performance and growth in these areas, which in the first half of 2020 was approximately 5% on a currency-neutral basis, helped to particularly offset expected weakness in our segments that have been most affected by the pandemic. These markets, including Fine Fragrance and Food Service, have been particularly sensitive to the downward pressure of the pandemic and have seen a double-digit decline over the first half of 2020. The challenges of 2020 also comes to us that IFF played a vital role in the global CPG supply chain, especially for the world's most important manufacturers in food and beverage as well as essential home, personal care and sanitation supplies. 
IFF's broad-based exposure across regions, categories and customer positions us to be remain resilient to the ongoing challenges brought about by the pandemic. Amid these challenges, we remain on track with our Frutarom integration efforts with only modest delays due to COVID-19, achieving very good cost synergies. We continue to expect to have the majority of the integration completed by the end of this year. 
Similarly, we continue to make significant progress with our efforts to complete our merger with N&B. We have now achieved regulatory clearance in the United States, China, Colombia and Serbia. We have filed our definitive proxy statement and look forward to the shareholder award on August 27. 
We continue to make significant strides in our integration planning, which is very exciting when you consider the long-term potential of the combined businesses. As we shared in our business update in June 8, 2020, we remain cautiously optimistic in our outlook for the remainder of the year. The pandemic continues to be significant and a volatile factor in our lives. It creates uncertainty around the world with rapidly changing operating environment and economic impacts. We are fortunate that a majority of our end markets continue to operate with relative strengths, but as we have discussed before, our business is not totally immune from disruption of the pandemic. 
Turning to Slide 7 and an overview of our financial performance in the first half of 2020. The first 2 quarters, we achieved $2.5 billion in sales with currency-neutral sales growth of 1%, which is largely attributed to the strong growth we saw in the Consumer Fragrances, which grew double digits; and Savory Solutions, which was up mid-single digits. We also generated an adjusted operating profit of $478 million and adjusted EPS of USD 2.99 both excluding amortization. While this performance is moderately down year-over-year, these metrics reflect pressure from lower sales volume and adverse mix as well as higher costs as a result of COVID-19. So the prioritization of CapEx and improving our core working capital, I'm pleased to report that we are able to generate significant free cash flow. For the first half of 2020, cash flow improved double digits. The operating cash flow increased 12% and free cash flow growing a very strong 94%. I'm encouraged by the resilience of our business through incredible challenging environment of the second quarter where we saw the global peak to date of regulatory restrictions. 
Moving to Slide 8. I would like to walk you through IFF's efforts and approach to managing through the pandemic while ensuring the safety of our employees and our continued uninterrupted partnership with our customers around the globe. As our teams have led a truly admirable performance to deliver through the challenging period, we have also begun to look ahead to our operations in this new normal. Like I've said before, ensuring the health and safety of our employees has and always will be our utmost concern and is #1 priority at IFF. As many countries and cities have begun to reopen and are moving out of complete lockdown, we are keeping a close eye on the recommendations of local and global public health officials, especially as it relates to implementing our return-to-work protocols. With each region recovering along varying time lines, our approach is to evaluate each of our facilities and offices on a case-by-case basis. While all of our manufacturing sites are open and operating fully, most remain limited to essential employees only. As for our corporate offices, all of our nonessential employees continue to work from home as of right now. 
Logistics remain on operating challenge with lead times still higher than they would be on a normal basis. But we have been able to adapt fairly quickly to new local policies with minimal incremental expense. On the procurement side, costs remain elevated as there's still some challenges obtaining various raw materials. We are proactively addressing the situation to secure these necessary materials going forward and evaluating opportunities to mend processes of our supply chain for the future. 
Finally, when it comes to our creative centers, I'm proud to say that even if at a global pandemic, in typical IFF fashion, we are creating innovative solutions to support our customers, whether in person or remotely. As restrictions and closures ease, we have already seen significant improvement in our pipeline. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Rustom, who will discuss the Q2 results in greater detail."
281407,678063232,2068771,"International Flavors & Fragrances Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Aug 11, 2020",2020-08-11,"Earnings Calls","International Flavors & Fragrances Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Andreas. Good morning, and good afternoon, everybody. On Slide 9, we've outlined a more detailed look at our financial performance in the last quarter. On a currency-neutral basis, IFF generated $1.2 billion in sales, down 4% when compared to",1612,"Thank you, Andreas. Good morning, and good afternoon, everybody. On Slide 9, we've outlined a more detailed look at our financial performance in the last quarter. 
On a currency-neutral basis, IFF generated $1.2 billion in sales, down 4% when compared to Q2 2019 and primarily driven by weakness in Fine Fragrance and Food Service, which represent approximately 15% of our portfolio. The remainder of our portfolio, which includes food, beverage, hygiene and disinfection products collectively grew 2% in the quarter on a currency-neutral basis, though offset by a 38% decline on a currency-neutral basis in Fine Fragrance and Food Service combined. 
In addition to lower sales volume, we were impacted by an adverse sales mix and unfavorable price to raw material costs in the quarter, which pressured our operating profit, excluding amortization, and offset operational expense savings in the quarter. Despite a lower effective tax rate and more favorable other income, therefore, our adjusted earnings per share, excluding amortization, was similarly impacted in Q2, driven by the decline in operating profit. 
Before moving into the details, I want to take a moment to remind those that are new to the IFF story about the currency-neutral sales growth methodology difference between the way we report our growth and our competitors' report. For a variety of reasons, many of our sales transactions in the emerging markets occur either in U.S. dollars or other hard currencies or are indexed to hard currencies when we have to invoice in local market currencies. When reporting our currency-neutral sales growth, we exclude these foreign exchange-related prices in emerging markets, but this is different from our peers. We believe our reporting standard provides investors with a truer assessment of underlying currency-neutral growth, especially when there are large emerging market devaluations relative to the U.S. dollar or euro. However, it's important to have all of you understand our performance relative to competition. 
During the second quarter of 2020, the stronger USD environment plus significant emerging market devaluations year-over-year in several key markets had approximately a 2 percentage point currency impact on growth if we include emerging market pricing. Factoring in this comparability adjustment, our second quarter sales decline would have been 2% rather than 4%. 
Turning to Slide 10. It's important to take a closer look at the underlying dynamics of our various business segments. In our first quarter 2020 conference call, I presented this slide in the outlook section as I believe it provided a good summary of the many moving parts we saw at that point in time. As we now see, much of what we expected and communicated came to fruition. As we've said before, we remain fortunate that most of IFF's business serves end markets and categories with relative strength. The category that's most exposed to temporary disruption of customer access to retail markets, such as Fine Fragrance and away-from-home channels, such as Food Service, suffered. And yet increased demand for products used in packaged food, beverage, hygiene and disinfection categories has led to strong results in Taste, excluding Food Service, and in Consumer Fragrances. 
In our Fragrance Ingredients business, demand is strong, yet the pandemic created a raw materials headwind as we prioritize the use of our Fragrance Ingredients to support our Fragrance Compounds business, forgoing external sales. I'm happy to report that in the month of July, as restrictions have eased, we have seen that the business has returned to growth, a trend that we expect to continue in the third quarter. As we approach the new normal in many regions across the world, we expect that these supply chain complications will ease and demand for away-from-home products will slowly return. 
Looking at Slide 11. I'd like to review the underlying drivers impacting our profitability in the quarter. COVID-19 has clearly had an impact on profitability, significantly influencing volume, mix and cost. The year-over-year change in profitability is mainly a result of a significant drop in volumes, representing approximately half of our adjusted operating profit decline. Unfavorable price to raw material costs also impacted profitability, primarily in Fragrance Ingredients, where prices were reduced to reflect future commodity cost reductions and where we are working through higher cost inventory. Unfortunately, with the steep decline in Fine Fragrance, sales mix was unfavorable, and we also saw incremental COVID-19 manufacturing and procurement costs. To minimize these impacts, we were focused on disciplined cost management and continued productivity, both helping to protect profitability during this difficult time. We were encouraged by the realization of cost synergies from the Frutarom deal and expect this will remain core to our profitability story as we see revenues return in the coming quarters. 
Now looking at our Scent division on Slide 12. Currency-neutral sales declined 4% in the quarter. I'm happy to share that for the third quarter in a row, we achieved double-digit sales growth in Consumer Fragrance, which can be attributed to robust growth in fabric, home, hair care and personal wash. And while we did benefit from COVID-19 in some areas through higher volume, our commercial performance or new wins was very strong, nearly 50% higher than our previous 5-year average for the second quarter. Also, the new core list where core list where we recently gained access, core to our 2021 strategy, grew more than 85% in the second quarter and represented nearly 20% of our Consumer Fragrance growth. At the BU level, this was offset largely by the 40% sales decline in Fine Fragrance due to the disruption of our consumers' ability to reach retail markets and reduced travel needs. This had an adverse impact on volume in the existing business, which was down double digits as well as new wins, which traditionally are very strong, but are also down as a result of COVID-19. We also saw lower Fragrance Ingredients external sales as we prioritized our Fragrance Compound business due to supply restrictions in India. This has now improved, and we expect performance will continue to improve going forward. Cumulatively, the Scent business had sales of $450 million, down 4% and a segment profit of $70 million, down roughly 25% at a 15.6% profit margin. 
Now moving to Taste on Slide 13. We saw currency-neutral sales declined 5% in the quarter. From a category perspective, as COVID-19 restrictions kept consumers for meeting outside their home, away-from-home channels, such as Food Service, saw a significant 36% decline in the bottom. To put this in context, the decline in Food Service represented about 5 percentage points of the Taste decline, meaning the business would have grown, excluding Food Service. 
From a regional perspective, North America showed resilience, yet emerging markets underperformed, given significant COVID-19-driven regulatory restrictions in places like India and Latin America. India alone, which represents about 4% of total Taste sales, saw sales drop by almost 30%. 
From a customer perspective, we saw weakness across smaller local and regional customers, mainly Food Service. This was most evident in Frutarom, where stand-alone sales declined high single digits in the second quarter. Discontinued Frutarom businesses, which will not be in the comparative periods going forward, remain the headwind in Q2. So for Taste overall, the business had $748 million in sales, down 5% and segment profit of $107 million, down 15% for a 14.3% profit margin. 
Now turning to Slide 14. I'd like to provide an overview of IFF's cash flow performance, and it's probably more useful to look at this year-to-date. The chart on the left is designed to show the reconciliation from reported net income to free cash flow, inclusive of all the drivers. Operating cash flow was up 12% in the first half, which was primarily due to improvements in core working capital levels in Q2. Within core working capital, the improvement was largely driven by days payable outstanding, while the sales outstanding ended better than expected. We will continue to effectively manage our balance sheet by taking actions to generate strong cash flow and to maintain ample liquidity even during a prolonged global downturn. 
We also continue to invest in the business, especially as we work towards completing the Frutarom integration. Our capital expenditure as a percentage of sales was roughly 3.1% compared to 4.6% the previous year. The improvements in core working capital levels, combined with the prioritized CapEx structure, has led to strong free cash flow of $128 million, up 94% from the year ago period. 
Reflecting our confidence in our future cash flow generation, we are pleased to announce that we are raising our quarterly dividend by 3% to $0.77 per share. This marks 11 years of consecutive dividend increases and underscores our confidence in our business, our long-term strategy and strong cash flow generation. Moving forward, we'll continue to take a thoughtful approach to managing cash flow, continuing to prioritize the focus on core working capital and CapEx. 
Before passing back to Andreas, I want to take a moment to provide an update through the first month of the third quarter. On Slide 15, you can see our sales trajectory during the first half of 2020 and the market rebound we have seen unfold in the third quarter so far. We started the year strong in January with mid-single-digit currency-neutral sales growth. And although the emergence of COVID-19 impacted sales from mid-March, we are starting to see a notable performance -- improvement in performance in July. As global mobility is gradually improving and restrictions and closures are eased, the categories and markets impacted in Q2 are showing promising signs of improvement. Should the environment continue to improve, we're quite hopeful that we can regain a more normalized level of growth. 
And with that, let me turn it back to Andreas."

Now as we consider what we -- what the remainder of 2020 will look like for IFF, we are doing our best to anticipate performance in a global environment that remains quite volatile and unpredictable. We're actively evaluating evolving global market dynamics and regulatory conditions to understand and anticipate how these factors will impact our business performance, our people and our customers. We are proud to supply solutions and ingredients for essential products in the food, beverage, hygiene and disinfection product categories, especially as these drive 85% of our current portfolio. 
As Rustom has stated earlier, our July sales performance has improved, growing low single digits. Consumer Fragrance continues to grow double digits, and we are seeing a double-digit trend in Cosmetic Actives. Fragrance Ingredients had also improved as restriction eased, growing mid-single digits in July. In Taste, growth in Flavors in North America, led by Tastepoint, is more than offsetting pressure in Latin America. And we are seeing robust double-digit growth in health-oriented products as well as an improvement in natural colors. We do, however, anticipate Fine Fragrances and Food Services will remain impacted by market pressures in the second half of the year, but expect improving trends versus what we experienced in Q2. A good example of this is that our Gelato Ingredients, a category severely impacted by COVID-19 in the second quarter, is now up low single digits to date in the third quarter. 
As we enter the second half of 2020, we will continue to effectively manage our business by taking actions to generate strong cash flow by targeting reductions in operational and capital expenses. With the positive signs of improvement in our performance that we are beginning to see in third quarter, we remain cautiously optimistic that we will see further market improvements in quarter and beyond. 
Turning to Slide 17. I'm very pleased to share with you now an update on where we stand with the integration planning of our previously announced merger agreement with DuPont N&B. We made a lot of headway in the first half of 2020, reaching key milestones like clearance in the U.S., China, Colombia, Ukraine and Serbia, regulatory processes and announcing our combined companies' purpose, vision, operating model and leadership team. We are well on our way to establishing the foundation and framework that will be essential to achieving the potential of this exciting combination. 
More recently, in July, we filed definitive proxy and set the date for our special shareholders meeting in connection with the merger, which will occur later this month on August 27. We expect to earn our shareholder support for this exciting combination in the coming weeks and remain on track to completing our transaction and uniting our organization in the first quarter of 2021. 
In summary, I'm proud to say that IFF has stayed resilient in the first half 2020 amid the unprecedented circumstances of COVID-19. We've achieved solid financial performance. We're delivering for our 30,000-plus customers globally and executing on the integration processes for Frutarom and N&B. As we have said before, IFF plays a central role in the global CPT supply chain as a vital partner to world renewal brands, regional leaders and new innovators alike. Our position across end markets, customers, with our global reach has created a real resiliency in our business that shines through these difficult times. 
With Frutarom, we are realizing a significant potential with our enhanced capabilities and expanded customer base will have for the IFF's long-term growth. Similarly, we look forward to joining forces DuPont N&B and have made significant advancements in our integration planning and pass the regulatory and shareholder approval. 
I'm deeply grateful to our employees across the globe whose commitment and dedication to IFF and our customers has been unwavering. We have started to see improvements in our performance in July and remain cautiously optimistic about how this may translate into financial performance in the second half of 2020. IFF and our balanced portfolio remain well equipped to that and succeed in this unpredictable global environment. 
With that, I would now like to open the call for questions."

And when should we anticipate those trends to normalize? And you sort of related to that, it would seem maybe to trade back to the Frutarom deal. So if true, what are you doing best practices and such that you're putting in place so as not repeat those when you close the DNB deal early next year?"

As you alluded, certainly, it's good to take the FX reported numbers and compare apples-to-apples. I think that's number one. 
Number two, I would say we should judge our performance beyond just 1 quarter, and we should look at multiple quarters. And if you see, for example, at the first quarter, we led our industry in growth. I think that's the topic. 
The second one is, if you look at Q2, the emerging markets were pretty much under pressure. And you see that we are over-indexed in the emerging markets, for example, India. And we are a market leader in India with our Taste business. For example, that was actually a pretty bad hit on that business, which is, by the way, rebounding. And then we are certainly opening some smaller customers, which plays a role here as well. Fundamentally, I believe both will help us with our long-term growth, the smaller customers and the emerging markets as well as soon as we see the COVID pressures are easing. And if you look at July, I expect actually that the third quarter already will be -- will look much different than the second quarter. That's what we have seen in our numbers for July. I think Rustom has shown it in this slide. We see it, in particular, in some of these areas where we have a good and strong performance on Consumer Fragrances, for example. You see that categories like home care or personal wash are really up in very, very high single digits. We believe that's a trend to stay. So hygiene products will stay even after the, let's say, acute COVID crisis, quite as strong. We see a good rebound already in Fine Fragrances, so not as bad as we have seen it we've seen it before. And the same holds true actually for Food Service. I just looked it up. We were -- April was our worst number, and Food Service was down by 44.1%. In July, it's down by minus 7.7%. Just to tell you that the weak spots, I think, are improving, and the strong pieces of the portfolio are staying strong and helping us to grow our business going forward. It will help us with our mix going forward in the third quarter as well. I hope that helps, Mark."

So I guess I was surprised a bit that June was worse given that most of your customers kind of talked about sequentially improving trends through the second quarter. So maybe why beyond the obvious comparisons for your easier in 3Q, why did you see this improvement beginning in July? Why was June a bit worse? Does it speak to inventory levels for customers? Is it just simply third quarter, people started ordering more product? Where do you think inventory levels are for those customers?

That's certainly helping. and Then some of the emerging markets like India, for example, are performing much, much better. In July, we're actually a double-digit growth going forward, and that helped us a lot. Why June had a little bit of a dip even compared to May? If I look at our daily sales, it's not so much. I think it's a comparable. I would not take this 2 -- I think it depends also on the order pattern. And what we see right now, as I said, July, pretty strong for us.

On the N&B side, as we said, we are progressing actually absolutely according to plan in some of the areas, even a couple of days ahead, which is quite quite interesting during the COVID environment. I think the teams are doing really a fantastic job. 
We see also -- and just as a remark on the N&B business, you have seen, when they reported actually, a bit of growth with 1%, a strong mix. 85% of the portfolio is pretty resilient against the COVID crisis as well.

What we try, because in this very volatile environment, we have doubled down on our consumer insights studies. And we look certainly how the consumer looks like during COVID, and what can we expect after COVID. And we have now drawn down on 3 themes, which we're sharing with our customers as well: it's health, home and hygiene. So we believe that in some of the areas, like, for example, hygiene, and we see it in our Scent products where we are selling there, this is a trend which will stay even post-COVID. And as I said, our Home Care in July, category is up by 27% and personal wash by plus 16%, just to show you what the impact on the business is because these products are so much in demand. On the other hand, it's the home area. We believe that the cocooning at home will stay at least for a couple of months through the winter. So culinary, everything which is culinary products for home cooking, will stay up. We believe that malodor control is an important one. And on the health side, we see that all of our health ingredients, most of them we got through Frutarom, are very much in high demand. That the modulation of sweet is in high demand because governments are again starting to double down on sugar and products. So what I try to say here is that we have looked at the consumer insights quite carefully, and we are basically now looking how we can orient our organization towards these trends where we believe they will stay for a while to make sure that we get more than a fair share of growth out of these categories.

There will still be some continuing manufacturing because, as Andreas has said many times, we have put the safety of our people first. And so there's things that we're doing differently until the max fee incomes in terms of how we manufacture. 
Then the second part of your question, I believe, and if I missed something, take me back. But the second part of your question was really about pricing and raw material costs, right, what we have. So in Q2, it was negative. I mean our pricing actions did not fully recover higher costs. And Fragrance Ingredients, for example, we talked about that as well. Now moving forward, we have the oil-related costs selectively helping us as we move forward. And we should see a benefit from some of those from -- in general, the input costs, we'll see a benefit coming from them, right, definitely. 
However, we'll have a negative on pricing, and that comes a lot from vanilla. I mean vanilla has dropped back. It was in 500. It's dropped back into the 200. I mean it could grow even lower.

But the other biggest one is working capital. And on our working capital, if you remember what we said even a few months ago, we deliberately moved to build up our inventory as to avoid customer disruption. I mean because that -- the 2 things we try to do is keep our people safe and avoid disrupting our customers, right? And so far, we've managed to do both. 
For inventory, we had inventory -- actually because of lags in actually receiving it, we were actually a little bit better in Q1 than we expected, a little bit worse than Q2. We do expect that to start to come down now gradually as we go through Q3 and 4 as we have built it up, right? 
On our DSO, which is the other big area where we flagged that we were expecting an increase, we actually did particularly well in terms of compared to where we expect it to be. And that was just a lot of focused management from the teams, and that should continue. And we would hope as the broad COVID situation abates and things get a little bit better, we hope to do well on that, too.

If you look at many of our big Fine Fragrance customers, you see even worse performance than the minus 20%, 25%. And that's what's driving it because the win rate in our Fine Fragrance business is still pretty good. We see also a good influx of new projects coming. And as we said, the start into the third quarter was actually pretty encouraging, what we have seen for Fine Fragrances. So I would say the main differences is a customer structure and how much the customers are selling of their actual products. But I actually expect that this will normalize over the course of the year. Because in general, I think our win rate in that area is a very, very good one. And we will see the -- Jeff, the most important season is right before the holiday. Before the holidays, that's where we sell most of our Fine Fragrances. So end of third quarter, early fourth quarter is actually -- that's where you win the year. And that's what we have to watch. And I hope when we have the third quarter announcement that we can give you more news on that one as well. I hope that helps."

Absolutely. If I touch on innovation, what we have seen actually when the COVID crisis was on its peak in Europe and in the U.S., so starting in March, April, even parts of May, we've seen a slowdown in our innovation pipeline also driven by the demand of some of the packaged food, for example, or some of the Consumer Fragrances. So everybody was trying to get the existing product on the shelf as fast as they could. Since then, actually, starting with May, we have seen actually a continuous influx of new projects in -- actually across the board in all of our different categories we are playing in. And there's more coming. We saw it first, obviously, in China because that was the first country basically out of the gates in -- after the COVID crisis for them, and they are already almost almost back to normal. So we see that many of the bigger CPGs and also the smaller are now really back to normal. It's certainly depending customer by customer, but many are coming again with new projects, projects to us. So that's on the first one. 
On the second one, on the recovery, we see a recovery. We should look at country-by-country and category-by-category. Let me start with not many countries, but with with regions. Here as well, in the recovery, Asia is now now big. In particular, India, is surging. [After] India was very impacted in the second quarter. It's really coming back. We see a good comeback on Europe as well. The U.S. is very, very good for us, maybe with the exception of the Fine Fragrance business. And we see an impact on on newer projects in Latin America where we see -- in particular, in Brazil and Mexico, the peak of the crisis. 
In terms of the categories, we are happy to report back that not just everybody is looking for solutions on hygiene products, but we see also more demand in new projects on Food Service products, which is really good. I commented already on the Fine Fragrances. Fine Fragrances are coming back as well. On the customer base, we certainly see it with large customers. With smaller customers, it's probably more of a mixed situation where we are in. But some of them are coming back as well. So I hope that helps to picturize how we see the situation right now in terms of innovation, but in terms of recovery as well. 
And as I said, look, I don't want to bank too much on just the July results, but we see that the order book is quite strong as well for the rest of the quarter, and that should help us actually with a positive performance as far as we see it. Rustom?"

If you look at Flavors and if you exclude the impact of India, which recovered in Food Service, right, the big negatives, all our other businesses grew at around 2.5%. And that was mainly due to an increase in North America and Greater Asia, driven by strong commercial performance there and some decrease in EMEA -- in EMA due to some postponed new wins and then, of course, Latin America, where you have the big negative because of COVID. 
Savory was another strong quarter, I mean, comparatively. I mean the in-home consumption channels were up like over 5 -- call it, mid-single digits. And again, strong performance in North America and Greater Asia, offset by some weakness in EMEA, and that was due to Food Service because we have a lot of small Food Service customers in EMEA. And then inclusions, I mean, obviously, impacted a lot by COVID. But this, as Andreas said, I mean, with gelato coming back quite strongly with what we're doing there in the last several weeks.

Good morning, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I get into some of the highlights and key accomplishments for the first half of 2020, I would like to take a moment to recognize essential workers around the world, including some of our IFFers, who continue to fuel our global supply chain and keep our economy moving forward. Your strength and dedication are truly commendable, and I thank you for your efforts.
While we continue to operate in challenging times, I'm proud to say that our employees have continued to meet and exceed the needs and expectations of our customers around the world. Today, I will focus my remarks on a review of the highlights from the first half of 2020 as well as an update of business dynamics with regards to COVID-19. Rustom will then provide a more detailed review of our Q2 financial performance. Lastly, we will provide an update on our progress towards completing the previously announced transaction with DuPont N&B.  
There's no question that over the last several months, our business has been operating in a very difficult environment. Nevertheless, we have acted quickly to maintain continuity across our global operations in 44 countries while simultaneously integrating the Frutarom business and establishing the foundation for our pending combination with DuPont N&B. I'm extremely proud of what our teams around the world has accomplished as we continue to move our business forward and tirelessly serve our customers.  
In this uncertain environment, our business has proven to be resilient. Fortunately, approximately 85% of our portfolio serves end markets that remain in high demand through COVID-19, including food, beverage, hygiene and disinfection. Our strong performance and growth in these areas, which in the first half of 2020 was approximately 5% on a currency-neutral basis, helped to particularly offset expected weakness in our segments that have been most affected by the pandemic. These markets, including Fine Fragrance and Food Service, have been particularly sensitive to the downward pressure of the pandemic and have seen a double-digit decline over the first half of 2020. The challenges of 2020 also affirms to us that IFF plays a vital role in the global CPG supply chain, especially for the world's most important manufacturers in food and beverage as well as essential home, personal care and sanitation supplies.
IFF's broad-based exposure across regions, categories and customer positions us to remain resilient through the ongoing challenges brought about by the pandemic. Amid these challenges, we remain on track with our Frutarom integration efforts with only modest delays due to COVID-19, achieving very good cost synergies. We continue to expect to have the majority of the integration completed by the end of this year.
Similarly, we continue to make significant progress with our efforts to complete our merger with N&B. We have now achieved regulatory clearance in the United States, China, Colombia and Serbia. We have filed our definitive proxy statement and look forward to the shareholder vote on August 27.  
We continue to make significant strides in our integration planning, which is very exciting when you consider the long-term potential of the combined businesses. As we shared in our business update in June 8, 2020, we remain cautiously optimistic in our outlook for the remainder of the year. The pandemic continues to be significant and a volatile factor in our lives. It creates uncertainty around the world with rapidly changing operating environment and economic impacts. We are fortunate that a majority of our end markets continue to operate with relative strengths, but as we have discussed before, our business is not totally immune from disruption of the pandemic.  
Turning to Slide 7 and an overview of our financial performance in the first half of 2020. The first 2 quarters, we achieved $2.5 billion in sales with currency-neutral sales growth of 1%, which is largely attributed to the strong growth we saw in the Consumer Fragrances, which grew double digits; and Savory Solutions, which was up mid-single digits. We also generated an adjusted operating profit of $478 million and adjusted EPS of USD 2.99 both excluding amortization. 
While this performance is moderately down year-over-year, these metrics reflect pressure from lower sales volume and adverse mix as well as higher costs as a result of COVID-19. Through the prioritization of CapEx and improving our core working capital, I'm pleased to report that we are able to generate significant free cash flow. For the first half of 2020, cash flow improved double digits. The operating cash flow increased 12% and free cash flow growing a very strong 94%. I'm encouraged by the resilience of our business through incredible challenging environment of the second quarter where we saw the global peak to date of regulatory restrictions.
Moving to Slide 8. I would like to walk you through IFF's efforts and approach to managing through the pandemic while ensuring the safety of our employees and our continued uninterrupted partnership with our customers around the globe. As our teams have led a truly admirable performance to deliver through the challenging period, we have also begun to look ahead to our operations in this new normal. 
Like I've said before, ensuring the health and safety of our employees has and always will be our utmost concern and is #1 priority at IFF. As many countries and cities have begun to reopen and are moving out of complete lockdown, we are keeping a close eye on the recommendations of local and global public health officials, especially as it relates to implementing our return-to-work protocols. With each region recovering along varying time lines, our approach is to evaluate each of our facilities and offices on a case-by-case basis. While all of our manufacturing sites are open and operating fully, most remain limited to essential employees only. As for our corporate offices, all of our nonessential employees continue to work from home as of right now.  
Logistics remain on operating challenge with lead times still higher than they would be on a normal basis. But we have been able to adapt fairly quickly to new local policies with minimal incremental expense. On the procurement side, costs remain elevated as there's still some challenges in obtaining various raw materials. We are proactively addressing the situation to secure these necessary materials going forward and evaluating opportunities to mend processes of our supply chain for the future.
Finally, when it comes to our creative centers, I'm proud to say that even if at a global pandemic, in typical IFF fashion, we are creating innovative solutions to support our customers, whether in person or remotely. As restrictions and closures ease, we have already seen significant improvement in our pipeline.  
With that, I will turn the call over to Rustom, who will discuss the Q2 results in greater detail."

Good morning, and good afternoon, everybody. On Slide 9, we've outlined a more detailed look at our financial performance in the last quarter.

On Slide 9, we've outlined a more detailed look at our financial performance in the last quarter. On a currency-neutral basis, IFF generated $1.2 billion in sales, down 4% when compared to Q2 2019 and primarily driven by weakness in Fine Fragrance and Food Service, which represent approximately 15% of our portfolio. 
The remainder of our portfolio, which includes food, beverage, hygiene and disinfection products collectively grew 2% in the quarter on a currency-neutral basis, though offset by a 38% decline on a currency-neutral basis in Fine Fragrance and Food Service combined. 
In addition to lower sales volume, we were impacted by an adverse sales mix and unfavorable price to raw material costs in the quarter, which pressured our operating profit, excluding amortization, and offset operational expense savings in the quarter. Despite a lower effective tax rate and more favorable other income, therefore, our adjusted earnings per share, excluding amortization, was similarly impacted in Q2, driven by the decline in operating profit. 
Before moving into the details, I want to take a moment to remind those that are new to the IFF story about the currency-neutral sales growth methodology difference between the way we report our growth and our competitors' report. For a variety of reasons, many of our sales transactions in the emerging markets occur either in U.S. dollars or other hard currencies or are indexed to hard currencies when we have to invoice in local market currencies. When reporting our currency-neutral sales growth, we exclude these foreign exchange-related prices in emerging markets, but this is different from our peers. We believe our reporting standard provides investors with a truer assessment of underlying currency-neutral growth, especially when there are large emerging market devaluations relative to the U.S. dollar or euro. However, it's important to have all of you understand our performance relative to competition. 
During the second quarter of 2020, the stronger USD environment plus significant emerging market devaluations year-over-year in several key markets had approximately a 2 percentage point currency impact on growth if we include emerging market pricing. Factoring in this comparability adjustment, our second quarter sales decline would have been 2% rather than 4%.  
Turning to Slide 10. It's important to take a closer look at the underlying dynamics of our various business segments. In our first quarter 2020 conference call, I presented this slide in the outlook section as I believe it provided a good summary of the many moving parts we saw at that point in time. As we now see, much of what we expected and communicated came to fruition. As we've said before, we remain fortunate that most of IFF's business serves end markets and categories with relative strength. The categories most exposed to temporary disruption of customer access to retail markets, such as Fine Fragrance and away-from-home channels, such as Food Service, suffered. And yet increased demand for products used in packaged food, beverage, hygiene and disinfection categories has led to strong results in Taste, excluding Food Service, and in Consumer Fragrances.  
In our Fragrance Ingredients business, demand is strong, yet the pandemic created a raw materials headwind as we prioritize the use of our Fragrance Ingredients to support our Fragrance Compounds business, forgoing external sales. I'm happy to report that in the month of July, as restrictions have eased, we have seen that the business has returned to growth, a trend that we expect to continue in the third quarter. As we approach the new normal in many regions across the world, we expect that these supply chain complications will ease and demand for away-from-home products will slowly return.  
Looking at Slide 11. I'd like to review the underlying drivers impacting our profitability in the quarter. COVID-19 has clearly had an impact on profitability, significantly influencing volume, mix and cost. The year-over-year change in profitability is mainly a result of a significant drop in volumes, representing approximately half of our adjusted operating profit decline. Unfavorable price to raw material costs also impacted profitability, primarily in Fragrance Ingredients, where prices were reduced to reflect future commodity cost reductions and where we are working through higher cost inventory. 
Unfortunately, with the steep decline in Fine Fragrance, sales mix was unfavorable and we also saw incremental COVID-19 manufacturing and procurement costs. To minimize these impacts, we were focused on disciplined cost management and continued productivity, both helping to protect profitability during this difficult time. We were encouraged by the realization of cost synergies from the Frutarom deal and expect this will remain core to our profitability story as we see revenues return in the coming quarters.  
Now looking at our Scent division on Slide 12. Currency-neutral sales declined 4% in the quarter. I'm happy to share that for the third quarter in a row, we achieved double-digit sales growth in Consumer Fragrance, which can be attributed to robust growth in fabric, home, hair care and personal wash. And while we did benefit from COVID-19 in some areas through higher volume, our commercial performance or new wins was very strong, nearly 50% higher than our previous 5-year average for the second quarter. 
Also, the new core list where -- core list where we recently gained access, core to our 2021 strategy, grew more than 85% in the second quarter and represented nearly 20% of our Consumer Fragrance growth. At the BU level, this was offset largely by the 40% sales decline in Fine Fragrance due to the disruption of our consumers' ability to reach retail markets and reduced travel needs. This had an adverse impact on volume in the existing business, which was down double digits as well as new wins, which traditionally are very strong, but are also down as a result of COVID-19. 
We also saw lower Fragrance Ingredients external sales as we prioritized our Fragrance Compounds business due to supply restrictions in India. This has now improved, and we expect performance will continue to improve going forward. Cumulatively, the Scent business had sales of $450 million, down 4% and a segment profit of $70 million, down roughly 25% at a 15.6% profit margin.
Now moving to Taste on Slide 13. We saw currency-neutral sales declined 5% in the quarter. From a category perspective, as COVID-19 restrictions kept consumers for eating outside their home, away-from-home channels, such as Food Service, saw a significant 36% decline in the bottom. To put this in context, the decline in Food Service represented about 5 percentage points of the Taste decline, meaning the business would have grown, excluding Food Service.  
From a regional perspective, North America showed resilience, yet emerging markets underperformed, given significant COVID-19-driven regulatory restrictions in places like India and Latin America. India alone, which represents about 4% of total Taste sales, saw sales drop by almost 30%. From a customer perspective, we saw weakness across smaller local and regional customers, mainly Food Service. This was most evident in Frutarom, where stand-alone sales declined high single digits in the second quarter. Discontinued Frutarom businesses, which will not be in the comparative periods going forward, remain the headwind in Q2. So for Taste overall, the business had $748 million in sales, down 5% and segment profit of $107 million, down 15% for a 14.3% profit margin.  
Now turning to Slide 14. I'd like to provide an overview of IFF's cash flow performance, and it's probably more useful to look at this year-to-date. The chart on the left is designed to show the reconciliation from reported net income to free cash flow, inclusive of all the drivers. Operating cash flow was up 12% in the first half, which was primarily due to improvements in core working capital levels in Q2. Within core working capital, the improvement was largely driven by days payable outstanding, while day sales outstanding ended better than expected. We will continue to effectively manage our balance sheet by taking actions to generate strong cash flow and to maintain ample liquidity even during a prolonged global downturn.  
We also continue to invest in the business, especially as we work towards completing the Frutarom integration. Our capital expenditure as a percentage of sales was roughly 3.1% compared to 4.6% the previous year. The improvements in core working capital levels, combined with the prioritized CapEx structure, has led to strong free cash flow of $128 million, up 94% from the year ago period.  
Reflecting our confidence in our future cash flow generation, we are pleased to announce that we are raising our quarterly dividend by 3% to $0.77 per share. This marks 11 years of consecutive dividend increases and underscores our confidence in our business, our long-term strategy and strong cash flow generation. Moving forward, we'll continue to take a thoughtful approach to managing cash flow, continuing to prioritize the focus on core working capital and CapEx.  
Before passing back to Andreas, I want to take a moment to provide an update through the first month of the third quarter. On Slide 15, you can see our sales trajectory during the first half of 2020 and the market rebound we have seen unfold in the third quarter so far. We started the year strong in January with mid-single-digit currency-neutral sales growth. And although the emergence of COVID-19 impacted sales from mid-March, we are starting to see a notable performance -- improvement in performance in July. As global mobility is gradually improving and restrictions and closures are eased, the categories and markets impacted in Q2 are showing promising signs of improvement. Should the environment continue to improve, we're quite hopeful that we can regain a more normalized level of growth.  
And with that, let me turn it back to Andreas."

Now as we consider what we -- what the remainder of 2020 will look like for IFF, we are doing our best to anticipate performance in a global environment that remains quite volatile and unpredictable. We're actively evaluating evolving global market dynamics and regulatory conditions to understand and anticipate how these factors will impact our business performance, our people and our customers. We are proud to supply solutions and ingredients for essential products in the food, beverage, hygiene and disinfection product categories, especially as these drive 85% of our current portfolio.
As Rustom has stated earlier, our July sales performance has improved, growing low single digits. Consumer Fragrance continues to grow double digits, and we are seeing a double-digit trend in cosmetic actives. Fragrance Ingredients had also improved as restriction eased, growing mid-single digits in July. In Taste, growth in Flavors in North America, led by Tastepoint, is more than offsetting pressure in Latin America. And we are seeing robust double-digit growth in health-oriented products as well as an improvement in natural colors. 
We do, however, anticipate that Fine Fragrances and Food Services will remain impacted by market pressures in the second half of the year, but expect improving trends versus what we experienced in Q2. A good example of this is that our gelato ingredients, a category severely impacted by COVID-19 in the second quarter, is now up low single digits to date in the third quarter.  
As we enter the second half of 2020, we will continue to effectively manage our business by taking actions to generate strong cash flow by targeting reductions in operational and capital expenses. With the positive signs of improvement in our performance that we are beginning to see in third quarter, we remain cautiously optimistic that we will see further market improvements in the quarter and beyond. 
Turning to Slide 17. I'm very pleased to share with you now an update on where we stand with the integration planning of our previously announced merger agreement with DuPont N&B. we made a lot of headway in the first half of 2020, reaching key milestones like clearance in the U.S., China, Colombia, Ukraine and Serbia, regulatory processes and announcing our combined companies' purpose, vision, operating model and leadership team. We are well on our way to establishing the foundation and framework that will be essential to achieving the potential of this exciting combination.  
More recently, in July, we filed definitive proxy and set the date for our special shareholders meeting in connection with the merger, which will occur later this month on August 27. We expect to earn our shareholder support for this exciting combination in the coming weeks and remain on track to completing our transaction and uniting our organization in the first quarter of 2021.
In summary, I'm proud to say that IFF has stayed resilient in the first half 2020 amid the unprecedented circumstances of COVID-19. We've achieved solid financial performance. We're delivering for our 30,000-plus customers globally and executing on the integration processes for Frutarom and N&B. As we have said before, IFF plays a central role in the global CPG supply chain as a vital partner to world-renowned brands, regional leaders and new innovators alike. Our position across end markets, customers, with our global reach, has created a real resiliency in our business that shines through these difficult times. 
With Frutarom, we are realizing a significant potential with our enhanced capabilities and expanded customer base will have for the IFF's long-term growth. Similarly, we look forward to joining forces with DuPont N&B and have made significant advancements in our integration planning and path to regulatory and shareholder approval.  
I'm deeply grateful to our employees across the globe whose commitment and dedication to IFF and our customers has been unwavering. We have started to see improvements in our performance in July and remain cautiously optimistic about how this may translate into financial performance in the second half of 2020. IFF and our balanced portfolio remain well equipped to depth and succeed in this unpredictable global environment. 
With that, I would now like to open the call for questions."

And then if so, what is driving it? And when should we anticipate those trends to normalize? And you sort of related to that. It would seem maybe to trace back to the Frutarom deal, so if true, what are you doing best practices and such that you're putting in place so as not repeat those when you close the DNB deal early next year?"

As you alluded, certainly, it's good to take the FX reported numbers and compare apples-to-apples. I think that's number one. Number two, I would say we should judge our performance beyond just 1 quarter, and should look at multiple quarters. And if you see, for example, at the first quarter, we led our industry in growth, I think that's the topic. 
The second one is if you look at Q2, the emerging markets were pretty much under pressure. And you see that we are a bit over-indexed in the emerging markets, for example, India. And we are a market leader in India with our Taste business. For example, that was actually a pretty bad hit on that business, which is, by the way, rebounding. And then we are certainly opening some smaller customers, which plays a role here as well. 
Fundamentally, I believe both will help us with our long-term growth, the smaller customers and the emerging markets as well as soon as we see the COVID pressures are easing. And if you look at July, I expect actually that the third quarter already will be -- will look much different than the second quarter. That's what we have seen in our numbers for July. I think Rustom has shown it in his slide. We see it, in particular, in some of these areas where we have a good and strong performance on Consumer Fragrances, for example. You see that categories like home care or personal wash are really up in very, very high single digits. We believe that's a trend to stay. So hygiene products will stay even after the, let's say, acute COVID crisis, quite as strong. We see a good rebound already in Fine Fragrances, so not as bad as we have seen it, we've seen it before. 
And the same holds true actually for Food Service. I just looked it up. We were -- April was our worst number, and Food Service was down by 44.1%. In July, it's down by minus 7.7%. Just to tell you that the weak spots, I think, are improving, and the strong pieces of the portfolio are staying strong and helping us to grow our business going forward, which will help us with our mix going forward in the third quarter as well. I hope that helps, Mark."

That's certainly helping. And then some of the emerging markets like India, for example, are performing much, much better. In July, we've actually a double-digit growth going forward, and that helped us a lot. 
Why June had a little bit of a dip even compared to May? If I look at our daily sales, it's not so much. I think it's a comparable. I would not take this to -- I think it depends also on the order pattern. And what we see right now, as I said, July, pretty strong for us.

What we try, because in this very volatile environment, we have doubled down on our consumer insights studies. And we look certainly how the consumer looks like during COVID, and what can we expect after COVID. And we have never drawn down on 3 themes, which we're sharing with our customers as well: it's health, home and hygiene. So we believe that in some of the areas like for example, hygiene, and we see it in our Scent products where we are selling there, this is a trend which will stay even post-COVID. And as I said, our Home Care in July, category is up by 27% and Personal Wash by plus 16%, just to show you what the impact on the business is because these products are so much in demand. 
On the other hand, it's the home area. We believe that the cocooning at home will stay at least for a couple of months through the winter. So culinary, everything which is culinary products for home cooking will stay up. We believe that malodor control is an important one. And on the health side, we see that all of our health ingredients, most of them we got through Frutarom, are very much in high demand. That the modulation of sweet is in high demand because governments are again starting to double down on sugar and products. So what I try to say here is that we have looked at the consumer insights quite carefully, and we are basically now looking how we can orient our organization towards these trends where we believe they will stay for a while to make sure that we get more than a fair share of growth out of these categories. So that's what we're doing, just to give you a bit of a bigger picture and an outlook beyond the third quarter."

First of all, I'll give you the COVID-related costs, okay, and then primarily procurement, logistics and manufacturing costs. And in Q2, they were about $6 million, okay? $6 million. And we will expect this to start declining as we go through the rest of the year, right? Because Q2, as we've already said, is when we thought we had the highest point. There will still be some continuing manufacturing because, as Andreas has said many times, we have put the safety of our people first. And so there's things that we are doing differently until the vaccine incomes in terms of how we manufacture. 
Then the second part of your question, I believe -- and if I missed something, take me back. But the second part of your question was really about pricing and raw material costs, right, and what we have. So in Q2, it was negative. I mean our pricing actions did not fully recover higher costs, and Fragrance Ingredients, for example, we talked about that as well. Now moving forward, we have the oil-related costs are actively helping us as we move forward. And we should see a benefit from some of those from -- in general, the input costs, we'll see a benefit coming from them, right? Definitely. 
However, we'll have a negative on pricing, and that comes a lot from vanilla. I mean vanilla has dropped back. It was in the 500s, it's dropped back into the 200s. I mean it could grow even lower. And so you will see that impact on pricing. So what we are projecting right now is for the net price to raw material costs for the rest of the year to remain negative. Did I cover your -- both aspects of your question there?"

I mean first of all, on our CapEx, I mean, we've been very focused on our CapEx very early, literally from probably February or so. And we set ourselves the target of spending roughly about 10% less on our CapEx for the year than our budget. And we're running even below that, by the way, at this point in time, but that will continue. That's the CapEx, right? We are watching our cash expenses in general across the board. And some things are obvious, and you'll see that like something that benefit EBITDA like travel, which will keep coming through. 
But the other biggest one is working capital. And on our working capital, if you remember what we said even a few months ago, we deliberately moved to build up our inventory so as to avoid customer disruption. I mean because that -- the 2 things we try to do is keep our people safe and avoid disrupting our customers, right? And so far, we've managed to do both. 
For inventory, we had inventory actually -- because of lags in actually receiving it, we were actually a little bit better in Q1 than we expected, a little bit worse than Q2. We do expect that to start to come down now gradually as we go through Q3 and 4 as we have built it up, right? 
On our DSO, which is the other big area where we flagged that we were expecting an increase, we actually did particularly well in terms of compared to where we expect it to be. And that was just a lot of focused management from the team, and that should continue. And we would hope as the broad economic situation abates and things get a little bit better, we'd hope to do well on that, too. 
And then the last component of it was just payables. I mean we managed that very tightly in terms of making -- sometimes accelerating payments and there's smaller suppliers that we want to keep afloat, and other times, just managing it very tightly, like you'd expect from any company of our size."

So I would say the main differences is a customer structure and how much the customers are selling of their actual products. But I actually expect that this will normalize over the course of the year. Because in general, I think our win rate in that area is a very, very good one. And we will see the -- Jeff, the most important season is right before the holiday. Before the holidays, that's where we sell most of our Fine Fragrances.

Absolutely. If I touch on innovation, what we have seen actually when the COVID crisis was on its peak in Europe and in the U.S., so starting in March, April, even parts of May, we've seen a slowdown in our innovation pipeline also driven by the demand of some of the packaged food, for example, or some of the Consumer Fragrances. So everybody was trying to get the existing product on the shelf as fast as they could. Since then actually, starting with May, we have seen actually a continuous influx of new projects in -- actually across the board in all of our different categories we are playing in. And there's more coming. We saw it first, obviously, in China because that was the first country basically out of the gates in -- after the COVID crisis for them, and they are already almost back to normal. So we see that many of the bigger CPGs and also the smaller are now really back to normal. It's certainly depending customer by customer, but many are coming again with new projects to us. So that's on the first one. 
On the second one, on the recovery, we see a recovery. We should look at country-by-country and category-by-category. Let me start with not by countries, but with regions. Here as well, in the recovery, Asia is now big. In particular, India, is surging after. India was very impacted in the second quarter. It's really coming back. We see a good comeback on Europe as well. The U.S. is very, very good for us, maybe with the exception of the Fine Fragrance business. And we see an impact on newer projects in Latin America where we see in particular in Brazil and Mexico at the peak of the crisis. 
In terms of the categories, we are happy to report back that not just everybody is looking for solutions on hygiene products, but we see also more demand in new projects on Food Service products, which is really good. I commented already on the Fine Fragrances. Fine Fragrances are coming back as well. On the customer base, we certainly see it with large customers. With smaller customers, it's probably more of a mixed situation where we are in. But some of them are coming back as well. So I hope that helps to picturize how we see the situation right now in terms of innovation, but in terms of recovery as well. 
And as I said, look, I don't want to bank too much on just the July results. But we see that the order book is quite strong as well for the rest of the quarter, and that should help us actually with a positive performance as far as we see it. Rustom?"

If you look at Flavors and if you exclude the impact of India, which we've covered and Food Service, right, the big negatives, all our other businesses grew at around 2.5%. And that was mainly due to an increase in North America and Greater Asia, driven by strong commercial performance there and some decrease in EMEA due to some postponed new wins and then, of course, Latin America, where you have the big negative because of COVID. 
Savory was another strong quarter, I mean, comparatively. I mean the in-home consumption channels were up like over 5 -- call it, mid-single digits. And again, strong performance in North America and Greater Asia, offset by some weakness in EMEA, and that was due to Food Service because we have a lot of small Food Service customers in EMEA. And then Inclusions, I mean, obviously, impacted a lot by COVID. But this, as Andreas said, I mean, with gelato coming back quite strongly with what we're doing there in the last several weeks.

Good morning, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I get into some of the highlights and key accomplishments for the first half of 2020, I would like to take a moment to recognize essential workers around the world, including some of our IFFers, who continue to fuel our global supply chain and keep our economy moving forward. Your strength and dedication are truly commendable, and I thank you for your efforts.
While we continue to operate in challenging times, I'm proud to say that our employees have continued to meet and exceed the needs and expectations of our customers around the world. Today, I will focus my remarks on a review of the highlights from the first half of 2020 as well as an update of business dynamics with regards to COVID-19. Rustom will then provide a more detailed review of our Q2 financial performance. Lastly, we will provide an update on our progress towards completing the previously announced transaction with DuPont N&B.  
There's no question that over the last several months, our business has been operating in a very difficult environment. Nevertheless, we have acted quickly to maintain continuity across our global operations in 44 countries while simultaneously integrating the Frutarom business and establishing the foundation for our pending combination with DuPont N&B. I'm extremely proud of what our teams around the world has accomplished as we continue to move our business forward and tirelessly serve our customers.  
In this uncertain environment, our business has proven to be resilient. Fortunately, approximately 85% of our portfolio serves end markets that remain in high demand through COVID-19, including food, beverage, hygiene and disinfection. Our strong performance and growth in these areas, which in the first half of 2020 was approximately 5% on a currency-neutral basis, helped to particularly offset expected weakness in our segments that have been most affected by the pandemic. These markets, including Fine Fragrance and Food Service, have been particularly sensitive to the downward pressure of the pandemic and have seen a double-digit decline over the first half of 2020. The challenges of 2020 also affirms to us that IFF plays a vital role in the global CPG supply chain, especially for the world's most important manufacturers in food and beverage as well as essential home, personal care and sanitation supplies.
IFF's broad-based exposure across regions, categories and customer positions us to remain resilient through the ongoing challenges brought about by the pandemic. Amid these challenges, we remain on track with our Frutarom integration efforts with only modest delays due to COVID-19, achieving very good cost synergies. We continue to expect to have the majority of the integration completed by the end of this year.
Similarly, we continue to make significant progress with our efforts to complete our merger with N&B. We have now achieved regulatory clearance in the United States, China, Colombia and Serbia. We have filed our definitive proxy statement and look forward to the shareholder vote on August 27.  
We continue to make significant strides in our integration planning, which is very exciting when you consider the long-term potential of the combined businesses. As we shared in our business update in June 8, 2020, we remain cautiously optimistic in our outlook for the remainder of the year. The pandemic continues to be significant and a volatile factor in our lives. It creates uncertainty around the world with rapidly changing operating environment and economic impacts. We are fortunate that a majority of our end markets continue to operate with relative strengths, but as we have discussed before, our business is not totally immune from disruption of the pandemic.  
Turning to Slide 7 and an overview of our financial performance in the first half of 2020. The first 2 quarters, we achieved $2.5 billion in sales with currency-neutral sales growth of 1%, which is largely attributed to the strong growth we saw in the Consumer Fragrances, which grew double digits; and Savory Solutions, which was up mid-single digits. We also generated an adjusted operating profit of $478 million and adjusted EPS of USD 2.99 both excluding amortization. 
While this performance is moderately down year-over-year, these metrics reflect pressure from lower sales volume and adverse mix as well as higher costs as a result of COVID-19. Through the prioritization of CapEx and improving our core working capital, I'm pleased to report that we are able to generate significant free cash flow. For the first half of 2020, cash flow improved double digits. The operating cash flow increased 12% and free cash flow growing a very strong 94%. I'm encouraged by the resilience of our business through incredible challenging environment of the second quarter where we saw the global peak to date of regulatory restrictions.
Moving to Slide 8. I would like to walk you through IFF's efforts and approach to managing through the pandemic while ensuring the safety of our employees and our continued uninterrupted partnership with our customers around the globe. As our teams have led a truly admirable performance to deliver through the challenging period, we have also begun to look ahead to our operations in this new normal. 
Like I've said before, ensuring the health and safety of our employees has and always will be our utmost concern and is #1 priority at IFF. As many countries and cities have begun to reopen and are moving out of complete lockdown, we are keeping a close eye on the recommendations of local and global public health officials, especially as it relates to implementing our return-to-work protocols. With each region recovering along varying time lines, our approach is to evaluate each of our facilities and offices on a case-by-case basis. While all of our manufacturing sites are open and operating fully, most remain limited to essential employees only. As for our corporate offices, all of our nonessential employees continue to work from home as of right now.  
Logistics remain on operating challenge with lead times still higher than they would be on a normal basis. But we have been able to adapt fairly quickly to new local policies with minimal incremental expense. On the procurement side, costs remain elevated as there's still some challenges in obtaining various raw materials. We are proactively addressing the situation to secure these necessary materials going forward and evaluating opportunities to mend processes of our supply chain for the future.
Finally, when it comes to our creative centers, I'm proud to say that even if at a global pandemic, in typical IFF fashion, we are creating innovative solutions to support our customers, whether in person or remotely. As restrictions and closures ease, we have already seen significant improvement in our pipeline.  
With that, I will turn the call over to Rustom, who will discuss the Q2 results in greater detail."
281407,678063232,2114984,"International Flavors & Fragrances Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Aug 11, 2020",2020-08-11,"Earnings Calls","International Flavors & Fragrances Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Andreas. Good morning, and good afternoon, everybody. On Slide 9, we've outlined a more detailed look at our financial performance in the last quarter. On a currency-neutral basis, IFF generated $1.2 billion in sales, down 4% when compared to Q",1612,"Thank you, Andreas. Good morning, and good afternoon, everybody. On Slide 9, we've outlined a more detailed look at our financial performance in the last quarter. On a currency-neutral basis, IFF generated $1.2 billion in sales, down 4% when compared to Q2 2019 and primarily driven by weakness in Fine Fragrance and Food Service, which represent approximately 15% of our portfolio. 
The remainder of our portfolio, which includes food, beverage, hygiene and disinfection products collectively grew 2% in the quarter on a currency-neutral basis, though offset by a 38% decline on a currency-neutral basis in Fine Fragrance and Food Service combined. 
In addition to lower sales volume, we were impacted by an adverse sales mix and unfavorable price to raw material costs in the quarter, which pressured our operating profit, excluding amortization, and offset operational expense savings in the quarter. Despite a lower effective tax rate and more favorable other income, therefore, our adjusted earnings per share, excluding amortization, was similarly impacted in Q2, driven by the decline in operating profit. 
Before moving into the details, I want to take a moment to remind those that are new to the IFF story about the currency-neutral sales growth methodology difference between the way we report our growth and our competitors' report. For a variety of reasons, many of our sales transactions in the emerging markets occur either in U.S. dollars or other hard currencies or are indexed to hard currencies when we have to invoice in local market currencies. When reporting our currency-neutral sales growth, we exclude these foreign exchange-related prices in emerging markets, but this is different from our peers. We believe our reporting standard provides investors with a truer assessment of underlying currency-neutral growth, especially when there are large emerging market devaluations relative to the U.S. dollar or euro. However, it's important to have all of you understand our performance relative to competition. 
During the second quarter of 2020, the stronger USD environment plus significant emerging market devaluations year-over-year in several key markets had approximately a 2 percentage point currency impact on growth if we include emerging market pricing. Factoring in this comparability adjustment, our second quarter sales decline would have been 2% rather than 4%.  
Turning to Slide 10. It's important to take a closer look at the underlying dynamics of our various business segments. In our first quarter 2020 conference call, I presented this slide in the outlook section as I believe it provided a good summary of the many moving parts we saw at that point in time. As we now see, much of what we expected and communicated came to fruition. As we've said before, we remain fortunate that most of IFF's business serves end markets and categories with relative strength. The categories most exposed to temporary disruption of customer access to retail markets, such as Fine Fragrance and away-from-home channels, such as Food Service, suffered. And yet increased demand for products used in packaged food, beverage, hygiene and disinfection categories has led to strong results in Taste, excluding Food Service, and in Consumer Fragrances.  
In our Fragrance Ingredients business, demand is strong, yet the pandemic created a raw materials headwind as we prioritize the use of our Fragrance Ingredients to support our Fragrance Compounds business, forgoing external sales. I'm happy to report that in the month of July, as restrictions have eased, we have seen that the business has returned to growth, a trend that we expect to continue in the third quarter. As we approach the new normal in many regions across the world, we expect that these supply chain complications will ease and demand for away-from-home products will slowly return.  
Looking at Slide 11. I'd like to review the underlying drivers impacting our profitability in the quarter. COVID-19 has clearly had an impact on profitability, significantly influencing volume, mix and cost. The year-over-year change in profitability is mainly a result of a significant drop in volumes, representing approximately half of our adjusted operating profit decline. Unfavorable price to raw material costs also impacted profitability, primarily in Fragrance Ingredients, where prices were reduced to reflect future commodity cost reductions and where we are working through higher cost inventory. 
Unfortunately, with the steep decline in Fine Fragrance, sales mix was unfavorable and we also saw incremental COVID-19 manufacturing and procurement costs. To minimize these impacts, we were focused on disciplined cost management and continued productivity, both helping to protect profitability during this difficult time. We were encouraged by the realization of cost synergies from the Frutarom deal and expect this will remain core to our profitability story as we see revenues return in the coming quarters.  
Now looking at our Scent division on Slide 12. Currency-neutral sales declined 4% in the quarter. I'm happy to share that for the third quarter in a row, we achieved double-digit sales growth in Consumer Fragrance, which can be attributed to robust growth in fabric, home, hair care and personal wash. And while we did benefit from COVID-19 in some areas through higher volume, our commercial performance or new wins was very strong, nearly 50% higher than our previous 5-year average for the second quarter. 
Also, the new core list where -- core list where we recently gained access, core to our 2021 strategy, grew more than 85% in the second quarter and represented nearly 20% of our Consumer Fragrance growth. At the BU level, this was offset largely by the 40% sales decline in Fine Fragrance due to the disruption of our consumers' ability to reach retail markets and reduced travel needs. This had an adverse impact on volume in the existing business, which was down double digits as well as new wins, which traditionally are very strong, but are also down as a result of COVID-19. 
We also saw lower Fragrance Ingredients external sales as we prioritized our Fragrance Compounds business due to supply restrictions in India. This has now improved, and we expect performance will continue to improve going forward. Cumulatively, the Scent business had sales of $450 million, down 4% and a segment profit of $70 million, down roughly 25% at a 15.6% profit margin.
Now moving to Taste on Slide 13. We saw currency-neutral sales declined 5% in the quarter. From a category perspective, as COVID-19 restrictions kept consumers for eating outside their home, away-from-home channels, such as Food Service, saw a significant 36% decline in the bottom. To put this in context, the decline in Food Service represented about 5 percentage points of the Taste decline, meaning the business would have grown, excluding Food Service.  
From a regional perspective, North America showed resilience, yet emerging markets underperformed, given significant COVID-19-driven regulatory restrictions in places like India and Latin America. India alone, which represents about 4% of total Taste sales, saw sales drop by almost 30%. From a customer perspective, we saw weakness across smaller local and regional customers, mainly Food Service. This was most evident in Frutarom, where stand-alone sales declined high single digits in the second quarter. Discontinued Frutarom businesses, which will not be in the comparative periods going forward, remain the headwind in Q2. So for Taste overall, the business had $748 million in sales, down 5% and segment profit of $107 million, down 15% for a 14.3% profit margin.  
Now turning to Slide 14. I'd like to provide an overview of IFF's cash flow performance, and it's probably more useful to look at this year-to-date. The chart on the left is designed to show the reconciliation from reported net income to free cash flow, inclusive of all the drivers. Operating cash flow was up 12% in the first half, which was primarily due to improvements in core working capital levels in Q2. Within core working capital, the improvement was largely driven by days payable outstanding, while day sales outstanding ended better than expected. We will continue to effectively manage our balance sheet by taking actions to generate strong cash flow and to maintain ample liquidity even during a prolonged global downturn.  
We also continue to invest in the business, especially as we work towards completing the Frutarom integration. Our capital expenditure as a percentage of sales was roughly 3.1% compared to 4.6% the previous year. The improvements in core working capital levels, combined with the prioritized CapEx structure, has led to strong free cash flow of $128 million, up 94% from the year ago period.  
Reflecting our confidence in our future cash flow generation, we are pleased to announce that we are raising our quarterly dividend by 3% to $0.77 per share. This marks 11 years of consecutive dividend increases and underscores our confidence in our business, our long-term strategy and strong cash flow generation. Moving forward, we'll continue to take a thoughtful approach to managing cash flow, continuing to prioritize the focus on core working capital and CapEx.  
Before passing back to Andreas, I want to take a moment to provide an update through the first month of the third quarter. On Slide 15, you can see our sales trajectory during the first half of 2020 and the market rebound we have seen unfold in the third quarter so far. We started the year strong in January with mid-single-digit currency-neutral sales growth. And although the emergence of COVID-19 impacted sales from mid-March, we are starting to see a notable performance -- improvement in performance in July. As global mobility is gradually improving and restrictions and closures are eased, the categories and markets impacted in Q2 are showing promising signs of improvement. Should the environment continue to improve, we're quite hopeful that we can regain a more normalized level of growth.  
And with that, let me turn it back to Andreas."

Now as we consider what we -- what the remainder of 2020 will look like for IFF, we are doing our best to anticipate performance in a global environment that remains quite volatile and unpredictable. We're actively evaluating evolving global market dynamics and regulatory conditions to understand and anticipate how these factors will impact our business performance, our people and our customers. We are proud to supply solutions and ingredients for essential products in the food, beverage, hygiene and disinfection product categories, especially as these drive 85% of our current portfolio.
As Rustom has stated earlier, our July sales performance has improved, growing low single digits. Consumer Fragrance continues to grow double digits, and we are seeing a double-digit trend in cosmetic actives. Fragrance Ingredients had also improved as restriction eased, growing mid-single digits in July. In Taste, growth in Flavors in North America, led by Tastepoint, is more than offsetting pressure in Latin America. And we are seeing robust double-digit growth in health-oriented products as well as an improvement in natural colors. 
We do, however, anticipate that Fine Fragrances and Food Services will remain impacted by market pressures in the second half of the year, but expect improving trends versus what we experienced in Q2. A good example of this is that our gelato ingredients, a category severely impacted by COVID-19 in the second quarter, is now up low single digits to date in the third quarter.  
As we enter the second half of 2020, we will continue to effectively manage our business by taking actions to generate strong cash flow by targeting reductions in operational and capital expenses. With the positive signs of improvement in our performance that we are beginning to see in third quarter, we remain cautiously optimistic that we will see further market improvements in the quarter and beyond. 
Turning to Slide 17. I'm very pleased to share with you now an update on where we stand with the integration planning of our previously announced merger agreement with DuPont N&B. we made a lot of headway in the first half of 2020, reaching key milestones like clearance in the U.S., China, Colombia, Ukraine and Serbia, regulatory processes and announcing our combined companies' purpose, vision, operating model and leadership team. We are well on our way to establishing the foundation and framework that will be essential to achieving the potential of this exciting combination.  
More recently, in July, we filed definitive proxy and set the date for our special shareholders meeting in connection with the merger, which will occur later this month on August 27. We expect to earn our shareholder support for this exciting combination in the coming weeks and remain on track to completing our transaction and uniting our organization in the first quarter of 2021.
In summary, I'm proud to say that IFF has stayed resilient in the first half 2020 amid the unprecedented circumstances of COVID-19. We've achieved solid financial performance. We're delivering for our 30,000-plus customers globally and executing on the integration processes for Frutarom and N&B. As we have said before, IFF plays a central role in the global CPG supply chain as a vital partner to world-renowned brands, regional leaders and new innovators alike. Our position across end markets, customers, with our global reach, has created a real resiliency in our business that shines through these difficult times. 
With Frutarom, we are realizing a significant potential with our enhanced capabilities and expanded customer base will have for the IFF's long-term growth. Similarly, we look forward to joining forces with DuPont N&B and have made significant advancements in our integration planning and path to regulatory and shareholder approval.  
I'm deeply grateful to our employees across the globe whose commitment and dedication to IFF and our customers has been unwavering. We have started to see improvements in our performance in July and remain cautiously optimistic about how this may translate into financial performance in the second half of 2020. IFF and our balanced portfolio remain well equipped to depth and succeed in this unpredictable global environment. 
With that, I would now like to open the call for questions."

As you alluded, certainly, it's good to take the FX reported numbers and compare apples-to-apples. I think that's number one. Number two, I would say we should judge our performance beyond just 1 quarter, and should look at multiple quarters. And if you see, for example, at the first quarter, we led our industry in growth, I think that's the topic. 
The second one is if you look at Q2, the emerging markets were pretty much under pressure. And you see that we are a bit over-indexed in the emerging markets, for example, India. And we are a market leader in India with our Taste business. For example, that was actually a pretty bad hit on that business, which is, by the way, rebounding. And then we are certainly opening some smaller customers, which plays a role here as well. 
Fundamentally, I believe both will help us with our long-term growth, the smaller customers and the emerging markets as well as soon as we see the COVID pressures are easing. And if you look at July, I expect actually that the third quarter already will be -- will look much different than the second quarter. That's what we have seen in our numbers for July. I think Rustom has shown it in his slide. We see it, in particular, in some of these areas where we have a good and strong performance on Consumer Fragrances, for example. You see that categories like home care or personal wash are really up in very, very high single digits. We believe that's a trend to stay. So hygiene products will stay even after the, let's say, acute COVID crisis, quite as strong. We see a good rebound already in Fine Fragrances, so not as bad as we have seen it, we've seen it before. 
And the same holds true actually for Food Service. I just looked it up. We were -- April was our worst number, and Food Service was down by 44.1%. In July, it's down by minus 7.7%. Just to tell you that the weak spots, I think, are improving, and the strong pieces of the portfolio are staying strong and helping us to grow our business going forward, which will help us with our mix going forward in the third quarter as well. I hope that helps, Mark."

So I'm sure we'll get into it in more detail as time goes on. But I was wondering if you could give us a little bit of a preview of how you are expecting things to play out from here."

On the N&B side, as we said, we are progressing actually absolutely according to plan in some of the areas, even a couple of days ahead, which is quite interesting during the COVID environment. I think the teams are doing really a fantastic job. 
We see also -- and just as a remark on the N&B business, you have seen, when they reported actually, a bit of growth with 1%, a strong mix. 85% of the portfolio is pretty resilient against the COVID crisis as well. So very, very similar. And a good mix in particularly are tilted towards probiotics. But maybe, Rustom, if you can comment as well on Page 17."

Now obviously, we can't work together with the N&B people, but we can plan together at this point in time. And so we are trying to do that. 
Likewise, on the costs. I mean I can sort of put on a functional hat for a second. I mean we are looking at our structure, looking at their structure, looking at our systems, looking at their systems and basically in a very methodical way, going through and trying to identify opportunities to optimize the business and make it stronger and get greater revenue growth without costs and also areas where there's duplication of costs that we can take out.

What we try, because in this very volatile environment, we have doubled down on our consumer insights studies. And we look certainly how the consumer looks like during COVID, and what can we expect after COVID. And we have never drawn down on 3 themes, which we're sharing with our customers as well: it's health, home and hygiene. So we believe that in some of the areas like for example, hygiene, and we see it in our Scent products where we are selling there, this is a trend which will stay even post-COVID. And as I said, our Home Care in July, category is up by 27% and Personal Wash by plus 16%, just to show you what the impact on the business is because these products are so much in demand. 
On the other hand, it's the home area. We believe that the cocooning at home will stay at least for a couple of months through the winter. So culinary, everything which is culinary products for home cooking will stay up. We believe that malodor control is an important one. And on the health side, we see that all of our health ingredients, most of them we got through Frutarom, are very much in high demand. That the modulation of sweet is in high demand because governments are again starting to double down on sugar and products. So what I try to say here is that we have looked at the consumer insights quite carefully, and we are basically now looking how we can orient our organization towards these trends where we believe they will stay for a while to make sure that we get more than a fair share of growth out of these categories. So that's what we're doing, just to give you a bit of a bigger picture and an outlook beyond the third quarter."

First of all, I'll give you the COVID-related costs, okay, and then primarily procurement, logistics and manufacturing costs. And in Q2, they were about $6 million, okay? $6 million. And we will expect this to start declining as we go through the rest of the year, right? Because Q2, as we've already said, is when we thought we had the highest point. There will still be some continuing manufacturing because, as Andreas has said many times, we have put the safety of our people first. And so there's things that we are doing differently until the vaccine incomes in terms of how we manufacture. 
Then the second part of your question, I believe -- and if I missed something, take me back. But the second part of your question was really about pricing and raw material costs, right, and what we have. So in Q2, it was negative. I mean our pricing actions did not fully recover higher costs, and Fragrance Ingredients, for example, we talked about that as well. Now moving forward, we have the oil-related costs are actively helping us as we move forward. And we should see a benefit from some of those from -- in general, the input costs, we'll see a benefit coming from them, right? Definitely. 
However, we'll have a negative on pricing, and that comes a lot from vanilla. I mean vanilla has dropped back. It was in the 500s, it's dropped back into the 200s. I mean it could grow even lower. And so you will see that impact on pricing. So what we are projecting right now is for the net price to raw material costs for the rest of the year to remain negative. Did I cover your -- both aspects of your question there?"

I mean first of all, on our CapEx, I mean, we've been very focused on our CapEx very early, literally from probably February or so. And we set ourselves the target of spending roughly about 10% less on our CapEx for the year than our budget. And we're running even below that, by the way, at this point in time, but that will continue. That's the CapEx, right? We are watching our cash expenses in general across the board. And some things are obvious, and you'll see that like something that benefit EBITDA like travel, which will keep coming through. 
But the other biggest one is working capital. And on our working capital, if you remember what we said even a few months ago, we deliberately moved to build up our inventory so as to avoid customer disruption. I mean because that -- the 2 things we try to do is keep our people safe and avoid disrupting our customers, right? And so far, we've managed to do both. 
For inventory, we had inventory actually -- because of lags in actually receiving it, we were actually a little bit better in Q1 than we expected, a little bit worse than Q2. We do expect that to start to come down now gradually as we go through Q3 and 4 as we have built it up, right? 
On our DSO, which is the other big area where we flagged that we were expecting an increase, we actually did particularly well in terms of compared to where we expect it to be. And that was just a lot of focused management from the team, and that should continue. And we would hope as the broad economic situation abates and things get a little bit better, we'd hope to do well on that, too. 
And then the last component of it was just payables. I mean we managed that very tightly in terms of making -- sometimes accelerating payments and there's smaller suppliers that we want to keep afloat, and other times, just managing it very tightly, like you'd expect from any company of our size."

But I actually expect that this will normalize over the course of the year. Because in general, I think our win rate in that area is a very, very good one. And we will see the -- Jeff, the most important season is right before the holiday. Before the holidays, that's where we sell most of our Fine Fragrances.

You mentioned that you see the project pipeline improving as the restrictions are minimized.

Obviously, we're hearing a lot of CPG company's talk about rationalizing their innovation programs, cutting tail innovations, SKUs, et cetera. So any color you can give on your position, that would be great. 
And then secondly, just on the sort of the recovery momentum you're seeing in July. Can you maybe talk about any sort of differences you're seeing between the momentum in your large customers, your global customers versus your smaller or more local ones?"

Absolutely. If I touch on innovation, what we have seen actually when the COVID crisis was on its peak in Europe and in the U.S., so starting in March, April, even parts of May, we've seen a slowdown in our innovation pipeline also driven by the demand of some of the packaged food, for example, or some of the Consumer Fragrances. So everybody was trying to get the existing product on the shelf as fast as they could. Since then actually, starting with May, we have seen actually a continuous influx of new projects in -- actually across the board in all of our different categories we are playing in. And there's more coming. We saw it first, obviously, in China because that was the first country basically out of the gates in -- after the COVID crisis for them, and they are already almost back to normal. So we see that many of the bigger CPGs and also the smaller are now really back to normal. It's certainly depending customer by customer, but many are coming again with new projects to us. So that's on the first one. 
On the second one, on the recovery, we see a recovery. We should look at country-by-country and category-by-category. Let me start with not by countries, but with regions. Here as well, in the recovery, Asia is now big. In particular, India, is surging after. India was very impacted in the second quarter. It's really coming back. We see a good comeback on Europe as well. The U.S. is very, very good for us, maybe with the exception of the Fine Fragrance business. And we see an impact on newer projects in Latin America where we see in particular in Brazil and Mexico at the peak of the crisis. 
In terms of the categories, we are happy to report back that not just everybody is looking for solutions on hygiene products, but we see also more demand in new projects on Food Service products, which is really good. I commented already on the Fine Fragrances. Fine Fragrances are coming back as well. On the customer base, we certainly see it with large customers. With smaller customers, it's probably more of a mixed situation where we are in. But some of them are coming back as well. So I hope that helps to picturize how we see the situation right now in terms of innovation, but in terms of recovery as well. 
And as I said, look, I don't want to bank too much on just the July results. But we see that the order book is quite strong as well for the rest of the quarter, and that should help us actually with a positive performance as far as we see it. Rustom?"

We talked a fair amount about Scent earlier on and maybe a little bit of color on our Taste categories, right? If you look at Flavors and if you exclude the impact of India, which we've covered and Food Service, right, the big negatives, all our other businesses grew at around 2.5%. And that was mainly due to an increase in North America and Greater Asia, driven by strong commercial performance there and some decrease in EMEA due to some postponed new wins and then, of course, Latin America, where you have the big negative because of COVID. 
Savory was another strong quarter, I mean, comparatively. I mean the in-home consumption channels were up like over 5 -- call it, mid-single digits. And again, strong performance in North America and Greater Asia, offset by some weakness in EMEA, and that was due to Food Service because we have a lot of small Food Service customers in EMEA. And then Inclusions, I mean, obviously, impacted a lot by COVID. But this, as Andreas said, I mean, with gelato coming back quite strongly with what we're doing there in the last several weeks. 
And finally, MPS, mixed performance in there. The health aspects are extremely strong. And then in some of the other food protection areas, there have been some delayed launches and stuff like that. So all in all, I mean, that just gives a bit of additional color that we didn't share earlier."

Good morning, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I get into some of the highlights and key accomplishments for the first half of 2020, I would like to take a moment to recognize essential workers around the world, including some of our IFFers, who continue to fuel our global supply chain and keep our economy moving forward. Your strength and dedication are truly commendable and I thank you for your efforts.
While we continue to operate in challenging times, I'm proud to say that our employees have continued to meet and exceed the needs and expectations of our customers around the world. Today, I will focus my remarks on a review of the highlights from the first half of 2020 as well as an update of business dynamics with regards to COVID-19. Rustom will then provide a more detailed review of our Q2 financial performance. Lastly, we will provide an update on our progress towards completing the previously announced transaction with DuPont N&B.  
There's no question that over the last several months, our business has been operating in a very difficult environment. Nevertheless, we have acted quickly to maintain continuity across our global operations in 44 countries while simultaneously integrating the Frutarom business and establishing the foundation for our pending combination with DuPont N&B. I'm extremely proud of what our teams around the world has accomplished as we continue to move our business forward and tirelessly serve our customers.  
In this uncertain environment, our business has proven to be resilient. Fortunately, approximately 85% of our portfolio serves end markets that remain in high demand through COVID-19, including food, beverage, hygiene and disinfection. Our strong performance and growth in these areas, which in the first half of 2020 was approximately 5% on a currency-neutral basis, helped to particularly offset expected weakness in our segments that have been most affected by the pandemic. These markets, including Fine Fragrance and Food Service, have been particularly sensitive to the downward pressure of the pandemic and have seen a double-digit decline over the first half of 2020. The challenges of 2020 also affirms to us that IFF plays a vital role in the global CPG supply chain, especially for the world's most important manufacturers in food and beverage as well as essential home, personal care and sanitation supplies.
IFF's broad-based exposure across regions, categories and customer positions us to remain resilient through the ongoing challenges brought about by the pandemic. Amid these challenges, we remain on track with our Frutarom integration efforts with only modest delays due to COVID-19, achieving very good cost synergies. We continue to expect to have the majority of the integration completed by the end of this year.
Similarly, we continue to make significant progress with our efforts to complete our merger with N&B. We have now achieved regulatory clearance in the United States, China, Colombia and Serbia. We have filed our definitive proxy statement and look forward to the shareholder vote on August 27.  
We continue to make significant strides in our integration planning, which is very exciting when you consider the long-term potential of the combined businesses. As we shared in our business update in June 8, 2020, we remain cautiously optimistic in our outlook for the remainder of the year. The pandemic continues to be significant and a volatile factor in our lives. It creates uncertainty around the world with rapidly changing operating environment and economic impacts. We are fortunate that a majority of our end markets continue to operate with relative strengths, but as we have discussed before, our business is not totally immune from disruption of the pandemic.  
Turning to Slide 7 and an overview of our financial performance in the first half of 2020. The first 2 quarters, we achieved $2.5 billion in sales with currency-neutral sales growth of 1%, which is largely attributed to the strong growth we saw in the Consumer Fragrances, which grew double digits; and Savory Solutions, which was up mid-single digits. We also generated an adjusted operating profit of $478 million and adjusted EPS of USD 2.99 both excluding amortization. 
While this performance is moderately down year-over-year, these metrics reflect pressure from lower sales volume and adverse mix as well as higher costs as a result of COVID-19. Through the prioritization of CapEx and improving our core working capital, I'm pleased to report that we are able to generate significant free cash flow. For the first half of 2020, cash flow improved double digits. The operating cash flow increased 12% and free cash flow growing a very strong 94%. I'm encouraged by the resilience of our business through incredible challenging environment of the second quarter where we saw the global peak to date of regulatory restrictions.
Moving to Slide 8. I would like to walk you through IFF's efforts and approach to managing through the pandemic while ensuring the safety of our employees and our continued uninterrupted partnership with our customers around the globe. As our teams have led a truly admirable performance to deliver through the challenging period, we have also begun to look ahead to our operations in this new normal. 
Like I've said before, ensuring the health and safety of our employees has and always will be our utmost concern and is #1 priority at IFF. As many countries and cities have begun to reopen and are moving out of complete lockdown, we are keeping a close eye on the recommendations of local and global public health officials, especially as it relates to implementing our return-to-work protocols. With each region recovering along varying time lines, our approach is to evaluate each of our facilities and offices on a case-by-case basis. While all of our manufacturing sites are open and operating fully, most remain limited to essential employees only. As for our corporate offices, all of our nonessential employees continue to work from home as of right now.  
Logistics remain on operating challenge with lead times still higher than they would be on a normal basis. But we have been able to adapt fairly quickly to new local policies with minimal incremental expense. On the procurement side, costs remain elevated as there's still some challenges in obtaining various raw materials. We are proactively addressing the situation to secure these necessary materials going forward and evaluating opportunities to mend processes of our supply chain for the future.
Finally, when it comes to our creative centers, I'm proud to say that even if at a global pandemic, in typical IFF fashion, we are creating innovative solutions to support our customers, whether in person or remotely. As restrictions and closures ease, we have already seen significant improvement in our pipeline.  
With that, I will turn the call over to Rustom, who will discuss the Q2 results in greater detail."
281407,678063232,2115000,"International Flavors & Fragrances Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Aug 11, 2020",2020-08-11,"Earnings Calls","International Flavors & Fragrances Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Andreas. Good morning, and good afternoon, everybody. On Slide 9, we've outlined a more detailed look at our financial performance in the last quarter. On a currency-neutral basis, IFF generated $1.2 billion in sales, down 4% when compared to Q",1612,"Thank you, Andreas. Good morning, and good afternoon, everybody. On Slide 9, we've outlined a more detailed look at our financial performance in the last quarter. On a currency-neutral basis, IFF generated $1.2 billion in sales, down 4% when compared to Q2 2019 and primarily driven by weakness in Fine Fragrance and Food Service, which represent approximately 15% of our portfolio. 
The remainder of our portfolio, which includes food, beverage, hygiene and disinfection products collectively grew 2% in the quarter on a currency-neutral basis, though offset by a 38% decline on a currency-neutral basis in Fine Fragrance and Food Service combined. 
In addition to lower sales volume, we were impacted by an adverse sales mix and unfavorable price to raw material costs in the quarter, which pressured our operating profit, excluding amortization, and offset operational expense savings in the quarter. Despite a lower effective tax rate and more favorable other income, therefore, our adjusted earnings per share, excluding amortization, was similarly impacted in Q2, driven by the decline in operating profit. 
Before moving into the details, I want to take a moment to remind those that are new to the IFF story about the currency-neutral sales growth methodology difference between the way we report our growth and our competitors' report. For a variety of reasons, many of our sales transactions in the emerging markets occur either in U.S. dollars or other hard currencies or are indexed to hard currencies when we have to invoice in local market currencies. When reporting our currency-neutral sales growth, we exclude these foreign exchange-related prices in emerging markets, but this is different from our peers. We believe our reporting standard provides investors with a truer assessment of underlying currency-neutral growth, especially when there are large emerging market devaluations relative to the U.S. dollar or euro. However, it's important to have all of you understand our performance relative to competition. 
During the second quarter of 2020, the stronger USD environment plus significant emerging market devaluations year-over-year in several key markets had approximately a 2 percentage point currency impact on growth if we include emerging market pricing. Factoring in this comparability adjustment, our second quarter sales decline would have been 2% rather than 4%.  
Turning to Slide 10. It's important to take a closer look at the underlying dynamics of our various business segments. In our first quarter 2020 conference call, I presented this slide in the outlook section as I believe it provided a good summary of the many moving parts we saw at that point in time. As we now see, much of what we expected and communicated came to fruition. As we've said before, we remain fortunate that most of IFF's business serves end markets and categories with relative strength. The categories most exposed to temporary disruption of customer access to retail markets, such as Fine Fragrance and away-from-home channels, such as Food Service, suffered. And yet increased demand for products used in packaged food, beverage, hygiene and disinfection categories has led to strong results in Taste, excluding Food Service and in Consumer Fragrances.  
In our Fragrance Ingredients business, demand is strong, yet the pandemic created a raw materials headwind as we prioritize the use of our Fragrance Ingredients to support our Fragrance Compounds business, forgoing external sales. I'm happy to report that in the month of July, as restrictions have eased, we have seen that the business has returned to growth, a trend that we expect to continue in the third quarter. As we approach the new normal in many regions across the world, we expect that these supply chain complications will ease and demand for away-from-home products will slowly return.  
Looking at Slide 11. I'd like to review the underlying drivers impacting our profitability in the quarter. COVID-19 has clearly had an impact on profitability, significantly influencing volume, mix and cost. The year-over-year change in profitability is mainly a result of a significant drop in volumes, representing approximately half of our adjusted operating profit decline. Unfavorable price to raw material costs also impacted profitability, primarily in Fragrance Ingredients, where prices were reduced to reflect future commodity cost reductions and where we are working through higher cost inventory. 
Unfortunately, with the steep decline in Fine Fragrance, sales mix was unfavorable and we also saw incremental COVID-19 manufacturing and procurement costs. To minimize these impacts, we were focused on disciplined cost management and continued productivity, both helping to protect profitability during this difficult time. We were encouraged by the realization of cost synergies from the Frutarom deal and expect this will remain core to our profitability story as we see revenues return in the coming quarters.  
Now looking at our Scent division on Slide 12. Currency-neutral sales declined 4% in the quarter. I'm happy to share that for the third quarter in a row, we achieved double-digit sales growth in Consumer Fragrance, which can be attributed to robust growth in fabric, home, hair care and personal wash. And while we did benefit from COVID-19 in some areas through higher volume, our commercial performance or new wins was very strong, nearly 50% higher than our previous 5-year average for the second quarter. 
Also, the new core list where -- core list where we recently gained access, core to our 2021 strategy, grew more than 85% in the second quarter and represented nearly 20% of our Consumer Fragrance growth. At the BU level, this was offset largely by the 40% sales decline in Fine Fragrance due to the disruption of our consumers' ability to reach retail markets and reduced travel needs. This had an adverse impact on volume in the existing business, which was down double digits as well as new wins, which traditionally are very strong, but are also down as a result of COVID-19. 
We also saw lower Fragrance Ingredients external sales as we prioritized our Fragrance Compounds business due to supply restrictions in India. This has now improved and we expect performance will continue to improve going forward. Cumulatively, the Scent business had sales of $450 million, down 4% and a segment profit of $70 million, down roughly 25% at a 15.6% profit margin.
Now moving to Taste on Slide 13. We saw currency-neutral sales declined 5% in the quarter. From a category perspective, as COVID-19 restrictions kept consumers for eating outside their home, away-from-home channels, such as Food Service, saw a significant 36% decline in the bottom. To put this in context, the decline in Food Service represented about 5 percentage points of the Taste decline, meaning the business would have grown, excluding Food Service.  
From a regional perspective, North America showed resilience, yet emerging markets underperformed, given significant COVID-19-driven regulatory restrictions in places like India and Latin America. India alone, which represents about 4% of total Taste sales, saw sales drop by almost 30%. From a customer perspective, we saw weakness across smaller local and regional customers, mainly Food Service. This was most evident in Frutarom, where stand-alone sales declined high single digits in the second quarter. Discontinued Frutarom businesses, which will not be in the comparative periods going forward, remain the headwind in Q2. So for Taste overall, the business had $748 million in sales, down 5% and segment profit of $107 million, down 15% for a 14.3% profit margin.  
Now turning to Slide 14. I'd like to provide an overview of IFF's cash flow performance, and it's probably more useful to look at this year-to-date. The chart on the left is designed to show the reconciliation from reported net income to free cash flow, inclusive of all the drivers. Operating cash flow was up 12% in the first half, which was primarily due to improvements in core working capital levels in Q2. Within core working capital, the improvement was largely driven by days payable outstanding, while day sales outstanding ended better than expected. We will continue to effectively manage our balance sheet by taking actions to generate strong cash flow and to maintain ample liquidity even during a prolonged global downturn.  
We also continue to invest in the business, especially as we work towards completing the Frutarom integration. Our capital expenditure as a percentage of sales was roughly 3.1% compared to 4.6% the previous year. The improvements in core working capital levels, combined with the prioritized CapEx structure, has led to strong free cash flow of $128 million, up 94% from the year ago period.  
Reflecting our confidence in our future cash flow generation, we are pleased to announce that we are raising our quarterly dividend by 3% to $0.77 per share. This marks 11 years of consecutive dividend increases and underscores our confidence in our business, our long-term strategy and strong cash flow generation. Moving forward, we'll continue to take a thoughtful approach to managing cash flow, continuing to prioritize the focus on core working capital and CapEx.  
Before passing back to Andreas, I want to take a moment to provide an update through the first month of the third quarter. On Slide 15, you can see our sales trajectory during the first half of 2020 and the market rebound we have seen unfold in the third quarter so far. We started the year strong in January with mid-single-digit currency-neutral sales growth. And although the emergence of COVID-19 impacted sales from mid-March, we are starting to see a notable performance -- improvement in performance in July. As global mobility is gradually improving and restrictions and closures are eased, the categories and markets impacted in Q2 are showing promising signs of improvement. Should the environment continue to improve, we're quite hopeful that we can regain a more normalized level of growth.  
And with that, let me turn it back to Andreas."

Now as we consider what we -- what the remainder of 2020 will look like for IFF, we are doing our best to anticipate performance in a global environment that remains quite volatile and unpredictable. We're actively evaluating evolving global market dynamics and regulatory conditions to understand and anticipate how these factors will impact our business performance, our people and our customers. We are proud to supply solutions and ingredients for essential products in the food, beverage, hygiene and disinfection product categories, especially as these drive 85% of our current portfolio.
As Rustom has stated earlier, our July sales performance has improved, growing low single digits. Consumer Fragrance continues to grow double digits and we are seeing a double-digit trend in cosmetic actives. Fragrance Ingredients had also improved as restriction eased, growing mid-single digits in July. In Taste, growth in Flavors in North America, led by Tastepoint, is more than offsetting pressure in Latin America. And we are seeing robust double-digit growth in health-oriented products as well as an improvement in natural colors. 
We do, however, anticipate that Fine Fragrances and Food Services will remain impacted by market pressures in the second half of the year, but expect improving trends versus what we experienced in Q2. A good example of this is that our gelato ingredients, a category severely impacted by COVID-19 in the second quarter, is now up low single digits to date in the third quarter.  
As we enter the second half of 2020, we will continue to effectively manage our business by taking actions to generate strong cash flow by targeting reductions in operational and capital expenses. With the positive signs of improvement in our performance that we are beginning to see in third quarter, we remain cautiously optimistic that we will see further market improvements in the quarter and beyond. 
Turning to Slide 17. I'm very pleased to share with you now an update on where we stand with the integration planning of our previously announced merger agreement with DuPont N&B. we made a lot of headway in the first half of 2020, reaching key milestones like clearance in the U.S., China, Colombia, Ukraine and Serbia, regulatory processes and announcing our combined companies' purpose, vision, operating model and leadership team. We are well on our way to establishing the foundation and framework that will be essential to achieving the potential of this exciting combination.  
More recently, in July, we filed definitive proxy and set the date for our special shareholders meeting in connection with the merger, which will occur later this month on August 27. We expect to earn our shareholder support for this exciting combination in the coming weeks and remain on track to completing our transaction and uniting our organization in the first quarter of 2021.
In summary, I'm proud to say that IFF has stayed resilient in the first half 2020 amid the unprecedented circumstances of COVID-19. We've achieved solid financial performance. We're delivering for our 30,000-plus customers globally and executing on the integration processes for Frutarom and N&B. As we have said before, IFF plays a central role in the global CPG supply chain as a vital partner to world-renowned brands, regional leaders and new innovators alike. Our position across end markets, customers, with our global reach, has created a real resiliency in our business that shines through these difficult times. 
With Frutarom, we are realizing a significant potential with our enhanced capabilities and expanded customer base will have for the IFF's long-term growth. Similarly, we look forward to joining forces with DuPont N&B and have made significant advancements in our integration planning and path to regulatory and shareholder approval.  
I'm deeply grateful to our employees across the globe whose commitment and dedication to IFF and our customers has been unwavering. We have started to see improvements in our performance in July and remain cautiously optimistic about how this may translate into financial performance in the second half of 2020. IFF and our balanced portfolio remain well equipped to depth and succeed in this unpredictable global environment. 
With that, I would now like to open the call for questions."

So if you look at the broader share trend, even normalizing for how you're accounting for FX relative to peers, it seems there's a bit of an increasing divergence in your results for sales versus those with the largest F&F peers. I guess I'm curious, do you see the same thing? It seems somewhat obvious to folks from the outside in, so I'd be curious of that perspective. 
And then if so, what is driving it? And when should we anticipate those trends to normalize? And you sort of related to that. It would seem maybe to trace back to the Frutarom deal, so if true, what are you doing best practices and such that you're putting in place so as not repeat those when you close the DNB deal early next year?"

As you alluded, certainly, it's good to take the FX reported numbers and compare apples-to-apples. I think that's number one. Number two, I would say we should judge our performance beyond just 1 quarter and should look at multiple quarters. And if you see, for example, at the first quarter, we led our industry in growth, I think that's the topic. 
The second one is if you look at Q2, the emerging markets were pretty much under pressure. And you see that we are a bit over-indexed in the emerging markets, for example, India. And we are a market leader in India with our Taste business. For example, that was actually a pretty bad hit on that business, which is, by the way, rebounding. And then we are certainly opening some smaller customers, which plays a role here as well. 
Fundamentally, I believe both will help us with our long-term growth, the smaller customers and the emerging markets as well as soon as we see the COVID pressures are easing. And if you look at July, I expect actually that the third quarter already will be -- will look much different than the second quarter. That's what we have seen in our numbers for July. I think Rustom has shown it in his slide. We see it, in particular, in some of these areas where we have a good and strong performance on Consumer Fragrances, for example. You see that categories like home care or personal wash are really up in very, very high single digits. We believe that's a trend to stay. So hygiene products will stay even after the, let's say, acute COVID crisis, quite as strong. We see a good rebound already in Fine Fragrances, so not as bad as we have seen it, we've seen it before. 
And the same holds true actually for Food Service. I just looked it up. We were -- April was our worst number, and Food Service was down by 44.1%. In July, it's down by minus 7.7%. Just to tell you that the weak spots, I think, are improving, and the strong pieces of the portfolio are staying strong and helping us to grow our business going forward, which will help us with our mix going forward in the third quarter as well. I hope that helps, Mark."

So maybe why beyond the obvious, the comparisons for your [ easier ] in 3Q, why did you see this improvement beginning in July? Why was June a bit worse? Does it speak to inventory levels for customers? Is it just simply third quarter people started ordering more product? Where do you think inventory levels are for those customers?

That's certainly helping. And then some of the emerging markets like India, for example, are performing much, much better. In July, we've actually a double-digit growth going forward and that helped us a lot. 
Why June had a little bit of a dip even compared to May? If I look at our daily sales, it's not so much. I think it's a comparable. I would not take this to -- I think it depends also on the order pattern. And what we see right now, as I said, July, pretty strong for us.

On the N&B side, as we said, we are progressing actually absolutely according to plan in some of the areas, even a couple of days ahead, which is quite interesting during the COVID environment. I think the teams are doing really a fantastic job. 
We see also -- and just as a remark on the N&B business, you have seen, when they reported actually, a bit of growth with 1%, a strong mix. 85% of the portfolio is pretty resilient against the COVID crisis as well.

What we try, because in this very volatile environment, we have doubled down on our consumer insights studies. And we look certainly how the consumer looks like during COVID and what can we expect after COVID. And we have never drawn down on 3 themes, which we're sharing with our customers as well: it's health, home and hygiene. So we believe that in some of the areas like for example, hygiene, and we see it in our Scent products where we are selling there, this is a trend which will stay even post-COVID. And as I said, our Home Care in July, category is up by 27% and Personal Wash by plus 16%, just to show you what the impact on the business is because these products are so much in demand. 
On the other hand, it's the home area. We believe that the cocooning at home will stay at least for a couple of months through the winter. So culinary, everything which is culinary products for home cooking will stay up. We believe that malodor control is an important one. And on the health side, we see that all of our health ingredients, most of them we got through Frutarom, are very much in high demand. That the modulation of sweet is in high demand because governments are again starting to double down on sugar and products. So what I try to say here is that we have looked at the consumer insights quite carefully, and we are basically now looking how we can orient our organization towards these trends where we believe they will stay for a while to make sure that we get more than a fair share of growth out of these categories. So that's what we're doing, just to give you a bit of a bigger picture and an outlook beyond the third quarter."

And we will expect this to start declining as we go through the rest of the year, right? Because Q2, as we've already said, is when we thought we had the highest point. There will still be some continuing manufacturing because, as Andreas has said many times, we have put the safety of our people first. And so there's things that we are doing differently until the vaccine incomes in terms of how we manufacture. 
Then the second part of your question, I believe -- and if I missed something, take me back. But the second part of your question was really about pricing and raw material costs, right, and what we have. So in Q2, it was negative. I mean our pricing actions did not fully recover higher costs, and Fragrance Ingredients, for example, we talked about that as well. Now moving forward, we have the oil-related costs are actively helping us as we move forward. And we should see a benefit from some of those from -- in general, the input costs, we'll see a benefit coming from them, right? Definitely. 
However, we'll have a negative on pricing, and that comes a lot from vanilla. I mean vanilla has dropped back. It was in the 500s, it's dropped back into the 200s. I mean it could grow even lower. And so you will see that impact on pricing. So what we are projecting right now is for the net price to raw material costs for the rest of the year to remain negative.

I mean first of all, on our CapEx, I mean, we've been very focused on our CapEx very early, literally from probably February or so.

And we're running even below that, by the way, at this point in time, but that will continue. That's the CapEx, right? We are watching our cash expenses in general across the board. And some things are obvious, and you'll see that like something that benefit EBITDA like travel, which will keep coming through. 
But the other biggest one is working capital. And on our working capital, if you remember what we said even a few months ago, we deliberately moved to build up our inventory so as to avoid customer disruption. I mean because that -- the 2 things we try to do is keep our people safe and avoid disrupting our customers, right? And so far, we've managed to do both. 
For inventory, we had inventory actually -- because of lags in actually receiving it, we were actually a little bit better in Q1 than we expected, a little bit worse than Q2. We do expect that to start to come down now gradually as we go through Q3 and 4 as we have built it up, right? 
On our DSO, which is the other big area where we flagged that we were expecting an increase, we actually did particularly well in terms of compared to where we expect it to be. And that was just a lot of focused management from the team, and that should continue. And we would hope as the broad economic situation abates and things get a little bit better, we'd hope to do well on that, too. 
And then the last component of it was just payables. I mean we managed that very tightly in terms of making -- sometimes accelerating payments and there's smaller suppliers that we want to keep afloat, and other times, just managing it very tightly, like you'd expect from any company of our size."

If you look at many of our big Fine Fragrance customers, you see even worse performance than the minus 20%, 25%. And that's what's driving it because the win rate in our Fine Fragrance business is still pretty good. We see also a good influx of new projects coming. And as we said, the start into the third quarter was actually pretty encouraging, what we have seen for Fine Fragrances. So I would say the main differences is a customer structure and how much the customers are selling of their actual products. But I actually expect that this will normalize over the course of the year. Because in general, I think our win rate in that area is a very, very good one. And we will see the -- Jeff, the most important season is right before the holiday. Before the holidays, that's where we sell most of our Fine Fragrances.

Absolutely. If I touch on innovation, what we have seen actually when the COVID crisis was on its peak in Europe and in the U.S., so starting in March, April, even parts of May, we've seen a slowdown in our innovation pipeline also driven by the demand of some of the packaged food, for example, or some of the Consumer Fragrances. So everybody was trying to get the existing product on the shelf as fast as they could. Since then actually, starting with May, we have seen actually a continuous influx of new projects in -- actually across the board in all of our different categories we are playing in. And there's more coming. We saw it first, obviously, in China because that was the first country basically out of the gates in -- after the COVID crisis for them, and they are already almost back to normal. So we see that many of the bigger CPGs and also the smaller are now really back to normal. It's certainly depending customer by customer, but many are coming again with new projects to us. So that's on the first one. 
On the second one, on the recovery, we see a recovery. We should look at country-by-country and category-by-category. Let me start with not by countries, but with regions. Here as well, in the recovery, Asia is now big. In particular, India, is surging after. India was very impacted in the second quarter. It's really coming back. We see a good comeback on Europe as well. The U.S. is very, very good for us, maybe with the exception of the Fine Fragrance business. And we see an impact on newer projects in Latin America where we see in particular in Brazil and Mexico at the peak of the crisis. 
In terms of the categories, we are happy to report back that not just everybody is looking for solutions on hygiene products, but we see also more demand in new projects on Food Service products, which is really good. I commented already on the Fine Fragrances. Fine Fragrances are coming back as well. On the customer base, we certainly see it with large customers. With smaller customers, it's probably more of a mixed situation where we are in. But some of them are coming back as well. So I hope that helps to picturize how we see the situation right now in terms of innovation, but in terms of recovery as well. 
And as I said, look, I don't want to bank too much on just the July results. But we see that the order book is quite strong as well for the rest of the quarter, and that should help us actually with a positive performance as far as we see it. Rustom?"

We talked a fair amount about Scent earlier on and maybe a little bit of color on our Taste categories, right? If you look at Flavors and if you exclude the impact of India, which we've covered and Food Service, right, the big negatives, all our other businesses grew at around 2.5%. And that was mainly due to an increase in North America and Greater Asia, driven by strong commercial performance there and some decrease in EMEA due to some postponed new wins and then, of course, Latin America, where you have the big negative because of COVID. 
Savory was another strong quarter, I mean, comparatively. I mean the in-home consumption channels were up like over 5 -- call it, mid-single digits. And again, strong performance in North America and Greater Asia, offset by some weakness in EMEA, and that was due to Food Service because we have a lot of small Food Service customers in EMEA. And then Inclusions, I mean, obviously, impacted a lot by COVID. But this, as Andreas said, I mean, with gelato coming back quite strongly with what we're doing there in the last several weeks. 
And finally, MPS, mixed performance in there. The health aspects are extremely strong. And then in some of the other food protection areas, there have been some delayed launches and stuff like that. So all in all, I mean, that just gives a bit of additional color that we didn't share earlier."

Good morning, good afternoon, everyone. Before I dive into our third quarter performance, I would like to, once again, take a moment to thank all of our frontline workers and dedicated colleagues around the world who have worked tirelessly throughout the course of this year to continue fueling our global supply chain and meeting our customers' needs. But every business is built to weather pandemic. But over the last few months, we have continued to show that our business is well equipped to navigate the most unpredictable of storms. I can't thank each and every one of our passionate employees enough of their continued hard work, dedication and focus to this difficult year. 
On today's call, I will start, as usually, by reviewing IFF's recent third quarter performance and summarizing the trends that we are experiencing across the business before providing a more in-depth review of our year-to-date performance. Rustom will then provide a more detailed look at our third quarter financials. I will then provide an outlook on the road ahead for our business and provide data on our merger with Grupo NMB and the integration planning efforts that are well underway. Despite the COVID-related headwinds, we saw a strong sequential improvement across all key financial metrics in Q3. We achieved 1% currency-neutral sales growth in the third quarter, a 500 bps improvement relative to our second quarter 2020 results. Outside of Fine Fragrance at Food Service, IFF's portfolio remains resilient with growth of 3% in the quarter on a currency-neutral basis and 4% year-to-date. Nearly every category, including Fine Fragrance and Food Service growing, led by a third consecutive quarter of double-digit currency-neutral growth in consumer fragrance. We continue to experience challenges in Fine Fragrance and Food Service, which saw improved relatively in Q2 sales, declined 14% this quarter on a currency-neutral basis. These segments continue to be the most affected among our portfolio by pandemic-driven trends in retail and away-from-home channels. 
On our second quarter earnings call, we presented this monthly chart to provide increased transparency during the uncertain period. At the time, July finished was about 2% growth. In the subsequent months of August and September, we saw a modest deceleration in sales performance versus July, actually, largely due to weakness in Fine Fragrance and Food Service. 
Now let's turn to Slide 7. I would like to review our year-to-date performance 2020 basis. Our flavors category, excluding Food Service as resilient, growing low single digits. Outside of Food Service, all categories are growing. Inclusions led the segment with impressive double-digit growth, followed by mid single-digit growth in natural product solutions and savory solutions, again, all excluding Food Service. From a regional perspective, growth was led by a double-digit improvement in North America and Greater Asia, where new wind performance is strong. In EMI, results were challenged, which is in an area where we are focused on improving as we move forward. 
I want to take a moment to formally welcome our new Taste division leader, Kathi Portman. On October 1, Kathy took over leadership of our Taste division. She is now standing executive with experience across our industry and joined IFF early in 2020 as part of our succession planning for IFF as well as post our combination with L&B. In the short-term with IFF, Casey's already brought tremendous expertise and insights to our team, leading IFF integration of Taste with N&B food and beverage platform. With a proven track record of delivering growth and innovation at global food and beverage ingredients organizations, I'm confident Casey will do an exceptional job leading our Taste business now and the taste, food and beverage division following transaction close. 
I also want to thank Matthias Henny was retired from IFF after 30 years in our industry. He had a long and successful career. And during his tenure with IFS he advance our position as a leader within the taste industry. I wish him the very best for his next chapter. 
Overall, IFF Scent division continues to perform very well. I'm proud to share that we have achieved double-digit sales growth in consumer fragrance, with double-digit growth in Fabric, Care, Home Care, Air Care and Personal Wash. Our new core list customers where we recently gained access, core to our 2021 strategy are growing more than 50% this year. In the third quarter provided a double-digit contribution to consumer fragrance growth. Particularly, I want to note that our entire consumer fragrance team have worked diligently through the pandemic to differentiate our offerings, win new business and achieved strong market share gains. 
In our Fragrances Ingredients business, demand is strong, yet the pandemic created a raw material headwind in Q2 as we prioritize the use of our Fragrance Ingredients to support our fragrance compounds business foregoing external sales. As restrictions has eased, the business improved sequentially, but on a year-to-year basis remains down slightly. The areas most impacted by COVID-19 have been Food Service and Fine Fragrance. On a year-to-date base, Food Service and Fine Fragrance are down almost 20% as COVID-related actions impacted consumer behavior as well as retail channels have been temporarily closed, and travel retail is down. As I stated earlier, we are encouraged that the Fine Fragrance and Food Service improved the relative to Q2 sales on a currency-neutral basis, yet we remain cautious about trends given the increase in COVID-19 infections more recently. 
Excluding Fine Fragrance, Scent has achieved strong currency-neutral growth rate of plus 8% year-to-date, while Taste has improved 2% on a currency-neutral basis, excluding Food Service. 
With that, I would like to pass it over to Rustom to provide more details on the third quarter."

Slide 8 provides a high-level overview of Q3's financial performance. On a currency-neutral basis, IFF generated $1.3 billion in sales, a 1% increase from 2019's third quarter.

On a currency-neutral basis, IFF generated $1.3 billion in sales, a 1% increase from 2019's third quarter. Scent was up 4% and Taste down 1%, and I'll provide additional divisional color in a few minutes. 
As Andreas noted, Q3 sales recovered from Q2's low point and over 3/4 of our $69 million sequential improvement came from Scent and total IFF sales improved in all 4 regions. In the third quarter, our adjusted operating profit, excluding amortization, increased 1% to $241 million on a currency-neutral basis from 2019's Q3. Our gross profit and gross margin were both higher than the third quarter of 2019 despite higher COVID-19-related manufacturing expenses and logistics costs. Continued OpEx controls and lower C&E essentially offset additional personnel-related COVID-19 costs and other inflationary increases. On a currency-neutral basis, interest, other income and expenses, taxes and noncontrolling interests together amounted to an additional $1 million headwind versus last Q3, and adjusted, excluding amortization, was $1.40, up 1%. 
Note that FX movements adversely impacted our reported numbers. On a reported basis, Q3 sales were flat and adjusted operating profit, excluding amortization, was down 4%. Balance sheet revaluation FX losses had a large negative impact in other income and expenses as a result, both of weaker emerging market currencies against the dollar and a stronger euro. Currency volatility has impacted OIE all year, with Q1 and Q3 negative and Q2 positive. 
We believe our reporting standard provides investors with a truer assessment of underlying currency-neutral growth, especially when there are large emerging market currency devaluations relative to the U.S. dollar or euro. However, it's important to help all of you understand our performance relative to competition. So on Slide 9, I want to take a moment to show what our currency-neutral growth in the third quarter would be using the same calculation methodology of our peers. For a variety of reasons, many of our sales transactions in the emerging markets occur either in U.S. dollars or other hard currencies or are indexed to hard currencies when we have to invoice in local currencies. So when reporting our currency-neutral sales growth, we exclude those foreign exchange-related price changes in emerging markets, but this is different from our peers. 
During the third quarter of 2020, continued currency devaluations year-over-year in several key emerging markets would have added approximately 2 percentage points to growth if we include those foreign exchange-related price changes in our emerging market pricing. Factoring in this comparability adjustment, we estimate that our third quarter currency-neutral sales growth would have been 3% versus the 1% we have shared. And using this methodology Scent with its strong LatAm businesses would have 8% plus Q3 growth, while Taste would have been flat. 
Moving on to Slide 10. It is worth taking a closer look at the underlying business and market dynamics influencing our overall profitability in the quarter. In the third quarter of 2020, our sequential improvement in sales was accompanied by a strong rebound in profitability relative to our Q2 performance. Our currency-neutral adjusted operating profit, excluding amortization, grew 1% in Q3, clearly not what we want, but substantially better than the year-on-year decrease of 19% we reported in the second quarter. As expected, price to raw material costs with a gross margin headwind as was unfavorable mix due to our Fine Fragrance business. Also affecting profitability for the third quarter were incremental COVID-19 costs, which essentially doubled from Q2. The incremental manufacturing and logistics expenses related to COVID-19 that we had incurred in Q2 flowed into the P&L in Q3 as inventories were used. And we also paid a bonus to our essential workers around the world as they continued their exceptional service to our customers during this unprecedented time. In the end, we were able to offset these negatives through a combination of productivity initiatives in Scent and Frutarom cost synergies in Taste and tight cost management throughout We have been very careful with hiring, with headcount down over the course of the year, have been tighter in general within expenses and, of course, have had lower T&E costs like most businesses. Overall, adjusted operating expenses were up less than 1% despite absorbing the usual inflationary increases and COVID-19-related costs. As we forge ahead, especially in this uncertain environment, we will continue to drive growth but also review our cost structure to find additional opportunities to support overall profitability levels. 
Now turning to Slide 11. Where we take a closer look at the performance of the Scent division in the quarter. Scent sales totaling $503 million were up 4% overall as consumer fragrance continues to outperform. Specifically our Fabric, Home, Hair Care and Personal Wash product categories all experienced robust growth and are also benefiting from the pandemic-related increase in global consumer staples purchases. As Andreas noted earlier, it's not all COVID-19 related. We are seeing strong growth from our new core list customers that we recently gained access to. While Fine Fragrance sales remain challenged, Q3's 14% decrease is a significant improvement from last quarter, where sales were down 40%. And importantly, our Fragrance Ingredients business, which was impacted by COVID-19-related supply constraints in Q2 returned to growth, led by double-digit gains in cosmetic actives. These metrics are encouraging and reflect the recovery this summer in global retail markets and consumers' ability to reach them. In addition, the Scent division saw meaningful profit improvement this quarter. As segment profit grew 20% to $101 million. This was driven by higher sales volumes, strong benefits from management, productivity initiatives and cost discipline and tight OpEx controls. 
Moving on to Slide 12, where we focus on the performance of our Taste division. While we saw sequential improvements in Food Service compared with a 36% decline in the second quarter of 2020, this remained under pressure in the third quarter, declining 13% on a currency-neutral basis versus the prior year as the pandemic limited food consumption away from home. To put this in context, Food Service took Taste's overall sales growth down by roughly 2 percentage points. That said, the rest of the sales portfolio, excluding Food Service, delivered positive currency-neutral growth across all global markets. One particular bright spot was North America, where IFF realized double-digit growth in Taste across nearly all categories. We continue to see weaker growth in the other regions due to COVID-19 and related regulatory restrictions such as EMA, Latin America and Greater Asia. Natural Product Solutions, our food ingredients business and our North American businesses were the strongest performing in the quarter, while Savory and Inclusion both more impacted by food service were negative in the quarter. Frutarom declined 2% compared to the prior year as their strong presence in Food Service and customer base of mostly smaller local and regional customers continued to be more adversely impacted by COVID-19. The  Taste overall, the segment achieved a 13.3% profit margin, with $102 million in segment profit on $765 million in sales. Benefits from acquisition-related synergies and tight OpEx controls were more than offset by lower sales volume, unfavorable price to raw materials costs and higher COVID-19-related costs. 
Turning to Slide 13. I'd like to provide an overview of IFF's strong and growing cash flow position. The chart on the left illustrates the reconciliation from reported net income to free cash flow and includes all key drivers. Operating cash flow and free cash flow were up 8% and 30% this quarter, respectively, led by core working capital improvement and stepped up reviews of capital expenditure. Our thoughtful and disciplined approach to investments amid the pandemic has resulted in CapEx of approximately 3.3% of sales versus 4.2% in the prior year. While continuing to support our customers and suppliers, our teams have also been very focused on optimizing working capital, and our cash conversion cycle has improved 8 days year-over-year. We clearly need to generate cash, given our leverage and the impending merger with N&B, so it's good to see the improvements in days payables outstanding and days sales outstanding. Where inventory is concerned, we did see a small improvement in inventory days with more originally projected for Q4. And but now with COVID-19 picking up again, we will increase our safety stocks. Note that we are not expecting to repeat last Q4 strong cash flow performance this year primarily because of the benefit last year from extra sales and collections in the 53rd week. Further, despite continued stress in all industries across the globe, we believe that this quarter's strong balance sheet is a testament to our continued capital allocation focus and discipline. 
Moving to Slide 14. As we look to the remainder of 2020 and into 2021, we will remain laser-focused on maintaining discipline across our balance sheet to ensure that IFF is well positioned as we navigate a prolonged challenging market environment. The situation remains highly uncertain, given the steady increase in global COVID-19 infections and the potential for additional regulatory restrictions in various regions. We're incredibly fortunate that the majority, roughly 85% of IFF's portfolio has remained resilient and essential around the world for food, beverage, hygiene and disinfection products. Unfortunately, the persistence or even worsening of the pandemic will likely translate into continued weakness for Fine Fragrance and Food Service in Q4. I will also remind you that we face a very strong Q4 comparison to last year, which had a 53rd week of sales and profit contributions. As we noted at the time, this represented about 400 basis points of growth in the fourth quarter last year and is a large, roughly $50 million headwind this quarter and will occur all in the last week of December 2020, impacting our monthly performance comparative significantly. This extra week last year also clearly came with a substantial operating profit contribution. And while it is hard to be precise, we estimate that this will represent $15 million to $20 million headwind for us in Q4. 
We began the fourth quarter with low single digits growth in October on a currency-neutral basis, in line with Q3's results. Based on this first month and given the uncertainty, it's unlikely that we will see higher growth for the full fourth quarter than the 1% we achieved in Q3. That is before taking into account the headwinds from the 53rd week. In this uncertain and difficult environment, we are more than ever controlling what we can control such as OpEx and also capital expenditure. And of course, we remain focused on driving strong cash flow and reducing leverage. 
And with that, I'll hand it back to Andreas to discuss the near-term road ahead for IFF."

Before providing an update on our pre-integration work with N&B, I want to spend a moment on the progress we have made on our Frutarom integration. On Slide 15, I'm pleased to share that we have made strong strides with our Frutarom integration work. As of the third quarter 2020, we have complete integration of our business teams and believe that by the first quarter 2021 and will substantially complete our manufacturing optimization plan essentially at 90% of the consolidated -- consolidation complete. As a result, the outbreak of COVID-19 and the related complexity we are delayed about 6 to 8 weeks was our original projection, but remain on track to be largely complete in the first quarter of 2021 around the time of our transaction close with N&B. As a reminder, as part of the Frutarom integration initiative, we expect to close approximately 35 manufacturing sites. So the end of 2020, we are on track to close between 20 to 24 sites around the world and expect to be completely finished by the end of 2021. With the integration of Frutarom, we have learned a lot. This experience has been important for IFF, and we will leverage these experiences and apply lessons learned as we take next step with DuPont N&B. First, we have put our ability to deliver value through cost synergies. We know how to build teams to quickly and efficiently identify and capture these opportunities in ways that create real shareholder value. Second, revenue synergies need to align with the product development life cycle. We need to recognize that our planning that this can mean that these synergies take more time to achieve, but the key takeaways being started early to ensure delivery. As of today, we have a strong pipeline of Frutarom-related cross-selling projects, over 2,000 with a pipeline potential of approximately $235 million, and we believe we are on track to meet or exceed our target for 2021. Third, we need to recognize the potential for sales dis-synergies plan accordingly to properly mitigate and anticipate when it can't be avoided. Fourth, we must build teams and organizational functions that protect base business growth. This was a major consideration how we designed the organization structure at our future combined company. Growth through synergies and innovation have to be incremental to core business growth. And fifth, we need to move with speed and be decisive. There's always an urge to be cautious through integration as 2 cultures learn to work together. We have to break down these barriers with focused accountable leadership towards clear shared goals prioritizing profitable growth. I will also add that moving towards a transformational merger and working through the challenges of a global pandemic has forced all of us at IFF to work in new ways. We have learned quite a bit in these last several months and in many ways, it has forced us to take a fresh look at our business in a way that I think will prove beneficial as we continue in our transformation journey. 
Turning to Slide 16. I'm pleased to share an update on our integration planning process for a previously announced merger with DuPont N&B. As you can see, we have reached all targets for the second half of 2020 and are on track with our targeted close date of February 1, 2021. The 3 notable milestones we achieved in the third quarter 2020 include a successful shareholder award, the completion of the permanent financing and the announcement of the executive team minus 1 leadership teams. I'm pleased to have received a strong support of IFF shareholders who have recognized this unique opportunity to create significant long-term value. With more than 99% of the votes cast in favor, IFF shareholders have overwhelmingly  approved the issuance of shares pursuant to the merger agreement. So which IFF and N&B will combine to create a global leader in high-value ingredients and solutions for global food, beverage, home and personal care and health and wellness markets. We also completed a successful pricing of the 6.25 billion bought offering in September. This financing, together with the previously procured term loan facility will provide N&B for the funding needed to make the special cash payment of USD 7.3 billion to DuPont in connection with the completion of our merger with N&B. I'm happy to report that there was tremendous interest in the bond offering. The interest rates were favorable and the offering was significantly oversubscribed. 
I'm also happy to announce that at the end of last week, we received antitrust approval in Mexico, which was 1 of the 2 remaining jurisdictions where we needed for approval. As we move towards close, we have only a few integration milestones left to reach and are confident in our abilities to execute on our post-closing time line. We anticipate receiving antitrust approval for Europe in December, and will be filing our mandate S-4 with updated pro formas in the coming months. 
I continue to be very excited about the combination between IFF and N&B. I believe we have a significant amount of opportunities to create strong shareholder value in the future. We actively review our portfolios on a constant basis, especially in light of the future combination with N&B to look to maximize our returns by driving growth in accretive categories and deputizing our low-value businesses by reducing allocations of expense and capital fixed or exit completely with divestitures. 
Moving on to Slide 17. In summary, I continue to value the continued resilience of our portfolio during an exceptionally challenging time for all industries and communities across the globe. Despite this unpredictable environment, we have delivered sustained growth across some of our largest segments and returned to growth in others in the third quarter. Our 1% currency-neutral growth for the quarter marks an important sequential improvement from Q2. And excluding Fine Fragrance and Food Service, we are pleased to have delivered 4% and year-to-year currency-neutral growth with a proven across nearly all categories. We also made great progress in our N&B pre-integration planning and remain on track to close the transaction in the first quarter of 2021. As global conditions remain volatile and unpredictable, we will continue to focus on controlling and controllable to drive strong cash flow, maintain strong operational capital discipline and leverage the strength of our portfolio to debt and succeed. I'm proud and grateful to all of our employees across the globe who have gone above and beyond to ensure the continuity and resiliency of our business, all while delivering for our 30,000 customers across the globe and executing on the integration process for Frutarom and N&B. While we recognize we always have opportunities to improve, in particular, on within our Taste division. I'm confident that as we move ahead, we will improve our performance as we did in our Scent division over the past few years, both in terms of sales through new customer, core lists and margins to operational performance programs. I believe that we have the strategy and the team in place to position our organization for long-term success post now and upon uniting with N&B. 
With that, I would now like to open the call for questions."

Look, first of all, on the competitors' performance, I mean, I can't really comment on our competitors' performance. But let me take you through ours and give you some context. So our year-to-date -- on our Q3, our year-to-date adjusted operating profit, excluding amortization, is down 4%, and that's on currency-neutral sales growth of plus 1%. So that's clearly not good, because we are the drivers. So we had a negative We had a negative sales mix. I mean, Fine Fragrance, I mean you've seen the impact in in Q2 in particular and minus 40% and then Q3 as well much lesser, but in there. There's unfavorable price to raw material costs. Now that's mainly Fragrance Ingredients. And that's mainly price reductions in advance of raw material declines. There's COVID-19-related incremental costs. I mean, we put the -- we've shown you the bridge on the slide in the quarter. But if you look at the year, I mean we're talking about almost just a little under $20 million in costs that we've actually incurred on COVID. And incentive comp. I mean incentive comp as well year-on-year, if you remember, we expect the year-on-year headwind where we finish because of everything that had happened last year. And that has played through and into a little extent in the quarter and certainly in the full year as well. And of course, you've got the basic. And then on the other side, some of the positives in the year-to-date, it's been a negative on volume, and that's because of Q2. But in Q3, volume was actually a positive. And synergies. I mean, synergies have been a positive all year-long in what we've seen. And then, of course, there's productivity and cost discipline, right? So I'll come to Frutarom in a second. Earlier in the year, we were unsure as to the severity and the duration of COVID-19. So we choke back hiring. And we acted to control expenses, but we decided against taking costs out of IFF. And now with infections rising and no line of sight as to countermeasures, I mean vaccine comments notwithstanding, we are planning on acting to reduce costs over the coming months. And then Frutarom. You asked about Frutarom. And and look, despite COVID-19, we're still on track to deliver on the procurement and manufacturing optimization cost synergy of $50 million that we outlined earlier this year. We did modify the 10-Q and it's not required to disclose the exact amounts every quarter. But I can tell you, we had 10-plus million of synergies in Q3. So when you combine that with the first half savings of $32 million, that puts us at 42, 43, something like that. And clearly on track to achieve our full year $50 million goal. And Mark, just to remind you, our target was $100 million by year 2 and $145 million by year 3. Did I cover everything in there that you asked?"

And we have to model what we have done over the last, let's say, 2 or 3 years, in North America in other regions as well. So there's a program underway. And I might remind you, a couple of years ago, we had similar questions on our Scent business. We are taking it very seriously. And I think we have turned around the Scent business quite significantly. And I would say in that area, we are outperforming our competition now, in particular, on the consumer fragrance side. So that's what we see. And we will take the action to make sure that we fix what we have to fix here."

On the contrary, we see actually very good results of our Tastepoint business here in the U.S., and we are starting to accelerate again with small customers. And I think what we are seeing is now since the, let's say, supply lines are again very robust and delivering, I think it gets better here as well.

So we will see what that brings for us in terms of Food Service, but Fine Fragrance business as well, which started well in October, but we will see what's happening here.

So still, good start into the quarter, also a good order book, but we remain cautious because of the 53rd week and also about the new lockdowns we have seen in Europe. That's the reason why we are taking a bit more of a conservative stance. But Rustom, please comment on the cost and then the operating profit side."

And yes. Look, I mean, the situation is pretty uncertain. I mean Andreas made that point on the cost end of things, right? And we're fortunate the majority of our portfolio is resilient and essential, the food, beverage, hygiene,",524,"Yes, absolutely, Andreas. And yes. Look, I mean, the situation is pretty uncertain. I mean Andreas made that point on the cost end of things, right? And we're fortunate the majority of our portfolio is resilient and essential, the food, beverage, hygiene, disinfection, all the rest of that. But we are looking right now as far as we can tell that a worsening of the pandemic, and that will likely translate into continued weakness in Q4 in our COVID-19 impacted areas, Fine Fragrance and Food Service, right? So we are kind of not 100% sure how that plays out. But Food Service already, as we think about it, we think that it's going to be probably slightly worse than Q3 was. On COVID costs, by the way, Lauren, I mean, we had -- Q3 was big. I mean, we had close to around $13 million of COVID costs, and that's because we had about several million for the one-off costs for the special payments that were made. In Q4, based on the run rate and how things flow-through from our inventories and all the rest of it, we'll expect a COVID costs, but much smaller number, probably closer to around the $5 million type range. So yes, you're right. And you do remember that last year as well, we talked about the 53rd week and it being 400 basis points in revenue and all the rest of that. That's a roughly $50 million sales headwind when you come around to this Q4. And the extra week also comes with came with a substantial operating profit contribution. And while it's hard to be precise, okay? We estimate that this represents a roughly $15 million to $20 million headwind in Q4. So if you think about that, I mean, that's a big one. And then if you look at the other numbers in there and what we may have, we also have in Q4 last year, we had a in a tax indirect, what is it -- indirect taxes last year that we got. And that was -- and that had been subject to litigation. We disclosed that in our 10-K. That was roughly about $8 million. So if you look at that, I mean, those items between them. And finally was the AIP, okay? We mentioned that the AIP was nothing -- for the whole year we talked about AIP being a $40 million headwind last year for the whole year projections in '20. And  about half of that amount was some in the fourth quarter, the delta year-on-year. There wasn't too much in Q3. But also going in the other directions, you don't think it's all simply negative, right? We have some positives. And last year in Q4 you may remember that we had inventory impacted much lower gross profit margin. And so this year, we fully expect to be at least $10 million better on that account. And then we have the synergies. As Mark asked about the synergies to start with. And so we have a similar positive amount compared to last year's Q4 in synergy and productivity benefits. So I think..."

Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for that. So in summary, I would say, good start, but we are very cautious about the situation we are having. And I think the put and takes on the cost side Rustom explained quite well. Coming back to the S-4",750,"Okay, Rustom. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for that. So in summary, I would say, good start, but we are very cautious about the situation we are having. And I think the put and takes on the cost side Rustom explained quite well. Coming back to the S-4 question. And I think what plays an important role here is first of all, the area where we want to focus on. What we have done a quite extensive, let's say, review of our new portfolio. And there are certainly a couple of areas, which have really a good growth perspective. And I'm not giving you our guidance or budget for next year. But I would like to give you some background how we think about next year in terms of the different categories. So look, the consumer fragrance business has performed very well in the last couple of quarters, and we don't see any change in the fourth quarter, and we don't see too much change for the next year. And that's a quite significant business between $1.1 to $1.2 billion. Because we believe that the demand for Hygiene products will stay high next year and Personal Wash as well. And as Rustom commented in his comments on the earnings, the 3 new callers are really producing now really nice growth and have enough critical mass to give us some additional growth. So that will be a good focus area. Fine Fragrance will come back eventually as soon as COVID is normalizing over the course of next year. And that gives us just technically already a nice growth going forward into the 2021. And then we see actually a good performance on the active cosmetic business and the ingredients business as well. Since we have solved for the, let's say, raw material issues out of India, I think that's working well. So that should give us good growth going forward. On the Taste side, as I said, we have to focus on the most important categories where we can get growth. One of the fastest-growing areas was the beverage area for us, in particular, hard sales in the U.S. We believe that it's a good growth driver for us going forward. We see some of the natural product solutions driving forward, which is -- could be the business, the food protection business and that helps us to grow nicely. And Food Service, over the course of next year, the quick service restaurants should normalize as soon as we see some more regular business after -- in the post COVID period. So we believe that could give us good growth drivers going forward. On the N&B side, even it's not our business now. But what I see from the outside and the pre integration, you have a couple of business like the biorefinery business or microbial control business, which has challenges which should normalize after the COVID crisis as well. And then you see certainly businesses like the probiotics business or the cultures or enzyme business, which are going quite nicely. So we believe that could drive our growth going forward in 2021. You mentioned integrated solutions. That's certainly a growth driver as well. But I would expect this more in year 2 after the integration because it needs a bit of time that our customers not just, let's say, buying the concept, but launching these products in the marketplace as well. And then it will drive quite nice revenue synergies and certainly profit synergies as well going forward. I hope it helps to unpack how we see the different portfolio pieces. Maybe just a remark on the regions. As I said before, we have nice growth in North America and a great momentum on both sides of our business, which is fantastic. I think Latin America is better than you might think. And hopefully, it will go better next year as well. We have a bit of a on Europe, which is certainly driven by COVID because Fine Fragrance has a big footprint in Europe, as you well know, lots comes out of France and the Food Service business as well. So we will focus here to fix as much as we can. And then hopefully, with the, let's say, introduction of the vaccine and the post COVID period that can give us more growth going forward. So I talked a lot, but I hope that gave you a bit of a perspective how we see the world for now."

Thank you, Faiza, for the question. Let me start with your last part. As I said, we have rigorously looked at our portfolio and there are pieces where we really want to accelerate our growth going forward because we believe it's the right thing to do",512,"Yes. Thank you, Faiza, for the question. Let me start with your last part. As I said, we have rigorously looked at our portfolio and there are pieces where we really want to accelerate our growth going forward because we believe it's the right thing to do. And there are pieces which might not fit too much any longer into our portfolio on the IFF side. And it's probably too early to talk about concrete pieces but we are looking actively into it, and we can't make a decision on N&B, but we are looking into the portfolio here as well. I think your read is quite spot on. On the lessons learned, I would say there are a couple of lessons. The first one is that you need some time, if you bring these organizations together. You have to start with an aligned team and do as much work before day 1 as you can. Let me give you an example. Look, we have now announced basically up to the top 150, 170 leaders in the new organizations already. And we are still 2, 2.5 months ahead of closure. And hopefully, we will go down 1 layer further. We didn't do it because it was a shorter time frame with Frutarom. I think that's an incredible important step because we can hit the rubber or we can hit the road much, much faster than the Frutarom. The second thing is we have done an extensive work on the integrated solutions and the cross-selling opportunities. And one of the learnings was, we were even in food, never short of ideas, but it took longer to realize it. And as I said, we will achieve our top line synergies with fruit, but it took longer than we were thinking. And that was mainly driven not just selling these ideas to our customers, but until the customer was launching the actual products. And it just takes a bit of more time. And here, we were, let's say, we started earlier. We tested more robustly our ideas. And we have planned for more time to realize it. I think that's an important one as well. And then I think we have learned a lot in terms of, let's say, optimizing our footprint. And that was going okay and well. On the food side, I think we are even better prepared now for the merge with N&B on this side as well. So a ton of learnings, I could talk even further, but this might be the most important ones. And it was very helpful. I think for us, to take on something like N&B without having had Frutarom before as an integration exercise, would have been a very, very tough one. But I think the key learnings have helped that quite a bit to be very, very well prepared. Now I would say, right now, we are light years ahead of what we had with our last integration. That's what I always hear when I talk to my head of integration. I hope that helps."

So can you just talk about the difference between what you saw then in the order book and what actually came through to lead to the lower growth? That's the first question. And the second one, on the raw material side, Rustom, did I understand you correctly that raw material -- price to raw material was still a headwind, but you included the COVID costs into -- or some of it at least in the raw material cost. If you could clarify that? And how much that would be, if that's right? How much that would be if you strip that out?"

What we've seen in the COVID crisis is that many customers have changed a bit the behavior in terms of orders. We see at the beginning of the quarter, probably more orders than usual because everybody tries to get their stuff they need. And that's true, by the way, for the fourth quarter as well, which is very high, but we are cautious because we don't know how that will, let's say, good over the quarter. That's the reason. So we have seen, let's say, a deterioration also in the third quarter, over the course of the quarter that the order book went down. And you see sales went up a bit in October, again, but who knows what will happen in September -- in December. So sorry for that. And also the comparison is certainly a tough one. So as I said, a bit of a different order behavior of our customers also depending on the region. We see some movements in Europe, which is probably because of the lock down situation. And you sit in London, and we see some movements now for the Brexit, which will now happen probably finally, and you see some movements back and forth as well. So that's the reason for that. But on the raw materials, please Rustom you comment."

That's actually probably 1 of the premier examples for sales dissynergy. We don't expect too many dis-synergies from N&B. But we have built it in. And we said that if we look at the sales synergies, it always has to be a net number as it is on the cost side as well. So we are very aware of that. And we make sure that we really capture in the right way. I hope that example helps."

Good morning, good afternoon, everyone. Before I dive into our third quarter performance, I would like to, once again, take a moment to thank all of our frontline workers and dedicated colleagues around the world who have worked tirelessly throughout the course of this year to continue fueling our global supply chain and meeting our customers' needs. But every business is built to weather pandemic. But over the last few months, we have continued to show that our business is well equipped to navigate the most unpredictable of storms. I can't thank each and every one of our passionate employees enough of their continued hard work, dedication and focus throughout this difficult year. 
On today's call, I will start, as usually, by reviewing IFF's recent third quarter performance and summarizing the trends that we are experiencing across the business before providing a more in-depth review of our year-to-date performance. Rustom will then provide a more detailed look at our third quarter financials. I will then provide an outlook on the road ahead for our business and provide an update on our merger with DuPont N&B and the integration planning efforts that are well underway.
Despite the COVID-related headwinds, we saw a strong sequential improvement across all key financial metrics in Q3. We achieved 1% currency-neutral sales growth in the third quarter, a 500 bps improvement relative to our second quarter 2020 results. Outside of Fine Fragrance and Food Service, IFF's portfolio remains resilient with growth of 3% in the quarter on a currency-neutral basis and 4% year-to-date. Nearly every category, including Fine Fragrance and Food Service, is growing, led by a third consecutive quarter of double-digit currency-neutral growth in Consumer Fragrance.
We continue to experience challenges in Fine Fragrance and Food Service, which saw improve relatively in Q2 sales, declined 14% this quarter on a currency-neutral basis. These segments continue to be the most affected among our portfolio by pandemic-driven trends in retail and away-from-home channels. On our second quarter earnings call, we presented this monthly chart to provide increased transparency during the uncertain period. At the time, July finished was about 2% growth. In the subsequent months of August and September, we saw a modest deceleration in sales performance versus July, actually, largely due to weakness in Fine Fragrance and Food Service. 
Now let's turn to Slide 7, where I would like to review our year-to-date performance 2020 basis. Our Flavors category, excluding Food Service, is resilient, growing low single digits. Outside of Food Service, all categories are growing. Inclusions led the segment with impressive double-digit growth, followed by mid single-digit growth in Natural Product Solutions and Savory Solutions, again, all excluding Food Service. From a regional perspective, growth was led by a double-digit improvement in North America and Greater Asia, where new win performance is strong. In EAME, results were challenged, which is in an area where we are focused on improving as we move forward. 
I want to take a moment to formally welcome our new Taste division leader, Kathy Fortmann. On October 1, Kathy officially took over leadership of our Taste division. She is an outstanding executive with experience across our industry and joined IFF early in 2020 as part of our succession planning for IFF as well as post our combination with N&B. In her short term with IFF, Kathy has already brought tremendous expertise and insights to our team, leading IFF integration of Taste with N&B food and beverage platform. With a proven track record of delivering growth and innovation at global food and beverage ingredients organizations, I'm confident Kathy will do an exceptional job leading our Taste business now and the Taste, Food and Beverage division following transaction close.
I also want to thank Matthias Haeni who has retired from IFF after 30 years in our industry. He had a long and successful career. And during his tenure with IFF he has advanced our position as leader within the taste industry. I wish him the very best for his next chapter. Overall, IFF Scent division continues to perform very well. I'm proud to share that we have achieved double-digit sales growth in Consumer Fragrance, with double-digit growth in Fabric Care, Home Care, Air Care and Personal Wash. Our new core list customers where we recently gained access, core to our 2021 strategy, are growing more than 50% this year, in the third quarter provided a double-digit contribution to Consumer Fragrance growth. Particularly, I want to note that our entire Consumer Fragrance team have worked diligently through the pandemic to differentiate our offerings, win new business and achieve strong market share gains. 
In our Fragrance Ingredients business, demand is strong. Yet the pandemic created a raw material headwind in Q2 as we prioritized the use of our Fragrance Ingredients to support our Fragrance Compounds business foregoing external sales. As restriction has eased, the business improved sequentially, but on a year-to-year basis remains down slightly. The areas most impacted by COVID-19 have been Food Service and Fine Fragrances. On a year-to-date base, Food Service and Fine Fragrances are down almost 20% as COVID-related actions impacted consumer behavior as well as retail channels have been temporarily closed, and travel retail is down.
As I stated earlier, we are encouraged that the Fine Fragrance and Food Service improved in Q3 relative to Q2 sales on a currency-neutral basis. Yet we remain cautious about trends given the increase in COVID-19 infections more recently. Excluding Fine Fragrance, Scent has achieved strong currency-neutral growth rate of plus 8% year-to-date, while Taste has improved 2% on a currency-neutral basis, excluding Food Service. 
With that, I would like to pass it over to Rustom to provide more details on the third quarter."

Slide 8 provides a high-level overview of Q3's financial performance. On a currency-neutral basis, IFF generated $1.3 billion in sales, a 1% increase from 2019's third quarter.

On a currency-neutral basis, IFF generated $1.3 billion in sales, a 1% increase from 2019's third quarter. Scent was up 4% and Taste down 1%, and I'll provide additional divisional color in a few minutes. As Andreas noted, Q3 sales recovered from Q2's low point and over 3/4 of our $69 million sequential improvement came from Scent, and total IFF sales improved in all 4 regions.
In the third quarter, our adjusted operating profit, excluding amortization, increased 1% to $241 million on a currency-neutral basis from 2019's Q3. Our gross profit and gross margin were both higher than the third quarter of 2019 despite higher COVID-19-related manufacturing expenses and logistics costs. Continued OpEx controls and lower T&E essentially offset additional personnel-related COVID-19 costs and other inflationary increases. On a currency-neutral basis, interest, other income and expenses, taxes and noncontrolling interests together amounted to an additional $1 million headwind versus last Q3. And adjusted EPS, excluding amortization, was $1.40, up 1%. 
Note that FX movements adversely impacted our reported numbers. On a reported basis, Q3 sales were flat and adjusted operating profit, excluding amortization, was down 4%. Balance sheet revaluation FX losses had a large negative impact in other income and expenses as a result both of weaker emerging market currencies against the dollar and a stronger euro. Currency volatility has impacted OIE all year, with Q1 and Q3 negative and Q2 positive. 
We believe our reporting standard provides investors with a truer assessment of underlying currency-neutral growth, especially when there are large emerging market currency devaluations relative to the U.S. dollar or euro. However, it's important to help all of you understand our performance relative to competition. So on Slide 9, I want to take a moment to show what our currency-neutral growth in the third quarter would be using the same calculation methodology of our peers. For a variety of reasons, many of our sales transactions in the emerging markets occur either in U.S. dollars or other hard currencies or are indexed to hard currencies when we have to invoice in local currencies.
So when reporting our currency-neutral sales growth, we exclude those foreign exchange-related price changes in emerging markets, but this is different from our peers. During the third quarter of 2020, continued currency devaluations year-over-year in several key emerging markets would have added approximately 2 percentage points to growth if we include those foreign exchange-related price changes in our emerging market pricing. Factoring in this comparability adjustment, we estimate that our third quarter currency-neutral sales growth would have been 3% versus the 1% we have shared. And using this methodology Scent with its strong LatAm businesses would have 8% plus Q3 growth, while Taste would have been flat. 
Moving on to Slide 10. It is worth taking a closer look at the underlying business and market dynamics influencing our overall profitability in the quarter. In the third quarter of 2020, our sequential improvement in sales was accompanied by a strong rebound in profitability relative to our Q2 performance. Our currency-neutral adjusted operating profit, excluding amortization, grew 1% in Q3, clearly not what we want, but substantially better than the year-on-year decrease of 19% we reported in the second quarter. As expected, price to raw material costs was a gross margin headwind as was unfavorable mix due to our Fine Fragrance business.
Also affecting profitability for the third quarter were incremental COVID-19 costs, which essentially doubled from Q2. The incremental manufacturing and logistics expenses related to COVID-19 that we had incurred in Q2 flowed into the P&L in Q3 as inventories were used. And we also paid a bonus to our essential workers around the world as they continued their exceptional service to our customers during this unprecedented time. In the end, we were able to offset these negatives through a combination of productivity initiatives in Scent and Frutarom cost synergies in Taste and tight cost management throughout IFF.
We have been very careful with hiring, with headcount down over the course of the year, have been tighter in general within expenses and, of course, have had lower T&E costs like most businesses. Overall, adjusted operating expenses were up less than 1% despite absorbing the usual inflationary increases and COVID-19-related costs. As we forge ahead, especially in this uncertain environment, we will continue to drive growth but also review our cost structure to find additional opportunities to support overall profitability levels. 
Now turning to Slide 11, where we take a closer look at the performance of the Scent division in the quarter. Scent sales totaling $503 million were up 4% overall as Consumer Fragrance continues to outperform. Specifically our Fabric, Home, Hair Care and Personal Wash product categories all experienced robust growth and are also benefiting from the pandemic-related increase in global consumer staples purchases. As Andreas noted earlier, it's not all COVID-19 related. We are seeing strong growth from our new core list customers that we recently gained access to.
While Fine Fragrance sales remain challenged, Q3's 14% decrease is a significant improvement from last quarter, where sales were down 40%. Importantly, our Fragrance Ingredients business, which was impacted by COVID-19-related supply constraints in Q2, returned to growth, led by double-digit gains in Cosmetic Actives. These metrics are encouraging and reflect the recovery this summer in global retail markets and consumers' ability to reach them. In addition, the Scent division saw meaningful profit improvement this quarter, as segment profit grew 20% to $101 million. This was driven by higher sales volumes, strong benefits from management productivity initiatives and cost discipline and tight OpEx controls. 
Moving on to Slide 12, where we focus on the performance of our Taste division. While we saw sequential improvements in Food Service compared with a 36% decline in the second quarter of 2020, this remained under pressure in the third quarter, declining 13% on a currency-neutral basis versus the prior year as the pandemic limited food consumption away from home. To put this in context, Food Service took Taste's overall sales growth down by roughly 2 percentage points. That said, the rest of the Taste portfolio, excluding Food Service, delivered positive currency-neutral growth across all global markets. One particular bright spot was North America, where IFF realized double-digit growth in Taste across nearly all categories.
We continue to see weaker growth in the other regions due to COVID-19 and related regulatory restrictions such as EAME, Latin America and Greater Asia. Natural Product Solutions, our food ingredients business, and our North American Flavors businesses were the strongest performing in the quarter, while Savory and Inclusion both more impacted by Food Service were negative in the quarter. Frutarom declined 2% compared to the prior year as their strong presence in Food Service and customer base of mostly smaller local and regional customers continued to be more adversely impacted by COVID-19. For  Taste overall, the segment achieved a 13.3% profit margin, with $102 million in segment profit on $765 million in sales. Benefits from acquisition-related synergies and tight OpEx controls were more than offset by lower sales volume, unfavorable price to raw materials costs and higher COVID-19-related costs.
Turning to Slide 13. I'd like to provide an overview of IFF's strong and growing cash flow position. The chart on the left illustrates the reconciliation from reported net income to free cash flow and includes all key drivers. Operating cash flow and free cash flow were up 8% and 30% this quarter, respectively, led by core working capital improvements and stepped up reviews of capital expenditure. Our thoughtful and disciplined approach to investments amid the pandemic has resulted in CapEx of approximately 3.3% of sales versus 4.2% the prior year.
While continuing to support our customers and suppliers, our teams have also been very focused on optimizing working capital, and our cash conversion cycle has improved 8 days year-over-year. We clearly need to generate cash, given our leverage and the impending merger with N&B. So it's good to see the improvements in days payables outstanding and days sales outstanding. Where inventory is concerned, we did see a small improvement in inventory days with more originally projected for Q4. But now with COVID-19 picking up again, we will increase our safety stocks. Note that we are not expecting to repeat last Q4's strong cash flow performance this year, primarily because of the benefit last year from extra sales and collections in the 53rd week. Further, despite continued stress in all industries across the globe, we believe that this quarter's strong balance sheet is a testament to our continued capital allocation focus and discipline. 
Moving to Slide 14. As we look to remainder of 2020 and into 2021, we will remain laser-focused on maintaining discipline across our balance sheet to ensure that IFF is well positioned as we navigate a prolonged challenging market environment. The situation remains highly uncertain, given the steady increase in global COVID-19 infections and the potential for additional regulatory restrictions in various regions. We're incredibly fortunate that the majority, roughly 85% of IFF's portfolio, has remained resilient and essential around the world for food, beverage, hygiene and disinfection products. Unfortunately, the persistence or even worsening of the pandemic will likely translate into continued weakness for Fine Fragrance and Food Service in Q4.
I will also remind you that we face a very strong Q4 comparison to last year, which had a 53rd week of sales and profit contributions. As we noted at the time, this represented about 400 basis points of growth in the fourth quarter last year and is a large, roughly $50 million headwind, this quarter and will occur all in the last week of December 2020, impacting our monthly performance comparative significantly. This extra week last year also clearly came with a substantial operating profit contribution. And while it is hard to be precise, we estimate that this will represent a $15 million to $20 million headwind for us in Q4. 
We began the fourth quarter with low single digits growth in October on a currency-neutral basis, in line with Q3's results. Based on this first month and given the uncertainty, it's unlikely that we will see higher growth for the full fourth quarter than the 1% we achieved in Q3. That is before taking into account the headwinds from the 53rd week. In this uncertain and difficult environment, we are more than ever controlling what we can control such as OpEx and also capital expenditure. And of course, we remain focused on driving strong cash flow and reducing leverage. 
And with that, I'll hand it back to Andreas to discuss the near-term road ahead for IFF."

Before providing an update on our pre-integration work with N&B, I want to spend a moment on the progress we have made on our Frutarom integration. On Slide 15, I'm pleased to share that we have made strong strides with our Frutarom integration work. As of the third quarter 2020, we have complete integration of our business teams and believe that by the first quarter 2021 we will substantially complete our manufacturing optimization plan essentially at 90% of the consolidated -- consolidation complete. As a result of the outbreak of COVID-19 and the related complexity, we are delayed about 6 to 8 weeks was our original projection, but remain on track to be largely complete in the first quarter of 2021 around the time of our transaction close with N&B.
As a reminder, as part of the Frutarom integration initiative, we expect to close approximately 35 manufacturing sites. For the end of 2020, we are on track to close between 20 to 24 sites around the world and expect to be completely finished by the end of 2021. With the integration of Frutarom, we have learned a lot. This experience has been important for IFF, and we will leverage these experiences and apply lessons learned as we take next step with DuPont N&B. First, we have put more ability to deliver value through cost synergies. We know how to build teams to quickly and efficiently identify and capture these opportunities in ways that create real shareholder value.
Second, revenue synergies need to align with the product development life cycle. We need to recognize in our planning that this can mean that these synergies take more time to achieve, but the key takeaways being start early to ensure delivery. As of today, we have a strong pipeline of Frutarom-related cross-selling projects, over 2,000 with a pipeline potential of approximately $235 million, and we believe we are on track to meet or exceed our target for 2021. Third, we need to recognize the potential for sales dis-synergies plan accordingly to properly mitigate and anticipate when it can't be avoided. Fourth, we must build teams and organizational functions that protect base business growth. This was a major consideration how we designed the organization structure at our future combined company. Growth through synergies and innovation have to be incremental to core business growth.
And fifth, we need to move with speed and be decisive. There's always an urge to be cautious through integration as 2 cultures learn to work together. We have to break down these barriers with focused, accountable leadership towards clear shared goals prioritizing profitable growth. I will also add that moving towards a transformational merger and working through the challenges of a global pandemic has forced all of us at IFF to work in new ways. We have learned quite a bit in these last several months and in many ways it has forced us to take a fresh look at our business in a way that I think will prove beneficial as we continue in our transformation journey. 
Turning to Slide 16. I'm pleased to share an update on our integration planning process for our previously announced merger with DuPont N&B. As you can see, we have reached all targets for the second half of 2020 and are on track with our targeted close date of February 1, 2021. The 3 notable milestones we achieved in the third quarter 2020 include a successful shareholder award, the completion of the permanent financing and the announcement of the executive team minus 1 leadership teams. I'm pleased to have received a strong support of IFF shareholders who have recognized this unique opportunity to create significant long-term value.
With more than 99% of the votes cast in favor, IFF shareholders have overwhelmingly approved the issuance of shares pursuant to the merger agreement, through which IFF and N&B will combine to create a global leader in high-value ingredients and solutions for global food, beverage, home and personal care and health and wellness markets. We also completed a successful pricing of the $6.25 billion bond offering in September. This financing, together with the previously procured term loan facility, will provide N&B with the funding needed to make the special cash payment of USD 7.3 billion to DuPont in connection with the completion of our merger with N&B. I'm happy to report that there was tremendous interest in the bond offering. The interest rates were favorable and the offering was significantly oversubscribed. 
I'm also happy to announce that at the end of last week, we received antitrust approval in Mexico, which was 1 of the 2 remaining jurisdictions where we needed for approval. As we move towards close, we have only a few integration milestones left to reach and are confident in our abilities to execute on our post-closing time line. We anticipate receiving antitrust approval for Europe in December and will be filing our amended S-4 with updated pro formas in the coming months. 
I continue to be very excited about the combination between IFF and N&B. I believe we have a significant amount of opportunities to create strong shareholder value in the future. We actively review our portfolios on a constant basis, especially in light of the future combination with N&B to look to maximize our returns by driving growth in accretive categories and deprioritizing our low-value businesses by reducing allocations of expense and capital fixed or exit completely with divestitures. 
Moving on to Slide 17. In summary, I continue to value the continued resilience of our portfolio during an exceptionally challenging time for all industries and communities across the globe. Despite this unpredictable environment, we have delivered sustained growth across some of our largest segments and returned to growth in others in the third quarter. Our 1% currency-neutral growth for the quarter marks an important sequential improvement from Q2. And excluding Fine Fragrance and Food Service, we are pleased to have delivered 4% year-to-year currency-neutral growth with improvement across nearly all categories. We also made great progress in our N&B pre-integration planning and remain on track to close the transaction in the first quarter of 2021.
As global conditions remain volatile and unpredictable, we will continue to focus on controlling the controllable, to drive strong cash flow, maintain strong operational capital discipline and leverage the strength of our portfolio to depth and succeed. I'm proud and grateful to all of our employees across the globe who have gone above and beyond to ensure the continuity and resiliency of our business, all while delivering for our 30,000 customers across the globe and executing on the integration process for Frutarom and N&B. While we recognize we always have opportunities to improve, in particular, on within our Taste division, I'm confident that as we move ahead, we will improve our performance as we did in our Scent division over the past few years, both in terms of sales through new customer, core lists and margins through operational performance programs. I believe that we have the strategy and the team in place to position our organization for long-term success both now and upon uniting with N&B. 
With that, I would now like to open the call for questions."

Look, first of all, on the competitors' performance, I mean, I can't really comment on our competitors' performance. But let me take you through ours and give you some context. So our year-to-date -- so, see not Q3, our year-to-date adjusted operating profit, excluding amortization, is down 4%, and that's on currency-neutral sales growth of plus 1%. So that's clearly not good, but here are the drivers. So we had a negative type this quarter. We had a negative sales mix. I mean, Fine Fragrance -- I mean you've seen the impact in Q2 in particular and minus 40% and then Q3 as well, much lesser, but you've seen it in there. There's unfavorable price to raw material costs. Now that's mainly Fragrance Ingredients, and that's mainly price reductions in advance of raw material declines. There's COVID-19-related incremental costs. I mean, we put the -- we've shown you the bridge on the slides in the quarter.
But if you look at the year, I mean we're talking about almost just a little under $20 million in costs that we've actually incurred on COVID. And incentive comp, I mean incentive comp as well year-on-year, if you remember, we expected a year-on-year headwind when we finish because of everything that had happened last year. And that has played through and to a little extent in the quarter and certainly in the full year as well. Then, of course, you've got the basic. And then on the other side, some of the positives in the year-to-date, it's been a negative on volume, and that's because of Q2. But in Q3, volume was actually a positive. And synergies, I mean, synergies have been a positive all year-long in what we've seen. And then, of course, there's productivity and cost discipline, right? So I'll come to Frutarom in a second.
Earlier in the year, we were unsure as to the severity and the duration of COVID-19. So we choke back hiring. And we acted to control expenses, but we decided against taking costs out of IFF. And now with infections rising and no line of sight as to countermeasures, I mean vaccine comments notwithstanding, we are planning on acting to reduce costs over the coming months. And then Frutarom. You asked about Frutarom. And look, despite COVID-19, we're still on track to deliver on the procurement and manufacturing optimization cost synergy of $50 million that we outlined earlier this year. We did modify the 10-Q and it's not required to disclose the exact amounts every quarter. But I can tell you, we had $10-plus million of synergies in Q3. So when you combine that with the first half savings of $32 million, that puts us at $42 million, $43 million, something like that, and clearly on track to achieve our full year $50 million goal. And Mark, just to remind you, our target was $100 million by year 2 and $145 million by year 3. Did I cover everything in there that you asked?"

We see if you zero down, in particular, some weakness in Europe, where we have to dig in and figure out how we go forward. We see actually a very strong performance in North America. And we have to model what we have done over the last, let's say, 2 or 3 years in North America, in other regions as well. So there's a program underway. And I might remind you, a couple of years ago, we had similar questions on our Scent business. We are taking it very seriously. And I think we have turned around the Scent business quite significantly. And I would say in that area, we are outperforming our competition now, in particular, on the Consumer Fragrance side. So that's what we see. And we will take the action to make sure that we fix what we have to fix here."

We see right now still quite a bit of an impact on the small customers in India, for example, where we are market leader with our Taste business, so that has an impact on our business.
On the contrary, we see actually very good results of our Tastepoint business here in the U.S., and we are starting to accelerate again with small customers. And I think what we are seeing is now since the, let's say, supply lines are again very robust and delivering, I think it gets better here as well. So you see, it depends on the region, it depends on the country, but we believe in the long-term that this is a customer base we would like to keep it because we believe we will get some good growth out of it.

And then the second thing was just looking back at the July S-4, the management projections that are shared there for the N&B transaction. It just struck us as interesting that you're pegging growth for IFF at 5% and for N&B at 4%. And for sure, IFF was delivering at that level before Frutarom, but not since. And N&B, I don't think has hit that number, I'm not sure, ever. So I just wanted to hear a little bit about the buildup of that projection. How much of that already assumes what you think you can do in terms of integrated solutions, but I am curious what those kind of baseline projections for the business is?"

Look, Lauren, in all honesty, it's tough on the fourth quarter. As Rustom said, we had a good start into the fourth quarter basically on all measures, in particular also on the Scent business, very, very strong start into it. But we are cautious for a couple of reasons. First of all, we see now in Europe, again, many of these, let's say, lockdowns, even if they call it soft lockdowns. So we will see what that brings for us in terms of Food Service, but Fine Fragrance business as well, which started well in October, but we will see what's happening here. But what we know is that we are running against a very strong fourth quarter last year, first of all, good growth but then also driven by the 53rd week. So still, good start into the quarter, also a good order book, but we remain cautious because of the 53rd week and also about the new lockdowns we have seen in Europe. That's the reason why we are taking a bit more of a conservative stance. But Rustom, please comment on the cost and then the operating profit side."

I mean Andreas made that point on the cost end of things, right? And we're fortunate the majority of our portfolio is resilient and essential, the food, beverage, hygiene, disinfection, all the rest of that. But we are looking right now as far as we can tell that a worsening of the pandemic, and that will likely translate into continued weakness in Q4 in our COVID-19 impacted areas, Fine Fragrance and Food Service, right? So we are kind of not 100% sure how that plays out. But Food Service already, as we think about it, we think that it's going to be probably slightly worse than Q3 was.
On COVID costs, by the way, Lauren, I mean, we had -- Q3 was big. I mean, we had close to around $13 million of COVID costs, and that's because we had about several million for the one-off costs, for the special payments that were made. In Q4, based on the run rate and how things flow-through from our inventories and all the rest of it, we'll expect a COVID cost, but much smaller number, probably closer to around the $5 million type range. So yes, you're right. And you do remember that last year as well, we talked about the 53rd week and it being 400 basis points in revenue and all the rest of that. That's a roughly $50 million sales headwind when you come around to this Q4. And the extra week also comes with a -- came with a substantial operating profit contribution. And while it's hard to be precise, okay, we estimate that this represents a roughly $15 million to $20 million headwind in Q4. So if you think about that, I mean, that's a big one.
And then if you look at the other numbers in there and what we may have, we also have in Q4 last year -- we had a Brazilian tax indirect, what is it -- indirect taxes last year that we got. And that was -- and that had been subject to litigation. We disclosed that in our 10-K. That was roughly about $8 million. So if you look at that, I mean, those items between them. And finally was the AIP, okay? We mentioned that the AIP was nothing -- for the whole year we talked about AIP being a $40 million headwind last year for the whole year projections in '20. And  about half of that amount will come in the fourth quarter, the delta year-on-year. There wasn't too much in Q3. But also going in the other directions, you don't think it's all simply negative, right? We have some positives. And last year in Q4 you may remember that we had inventory impacted much lower gross profit margin. And so this year, we fully expect to be at least $10 million better on that account. And then we have the synergies, as Mark asked about the synergies to start with. And so we'll have a similar positive amount compared to last year's Q4 in synergy and productivity benefits. So I think that..."

And I think the put and takes on the cost side Rustom explained quite well. Coming back to the S-4 question. And I think what plays an important role here is, first of all, the area where we want to focus on. What we have done a quite extensive, let's say, review of our new portfolio. And there are certainly a couple of areas, which have really good growth perspective. And I'm not giving you our guidance or budget for next year. But I would like to give you some background how we think about next year in terms of the different categories. So look, the Consumer Fragrance business has performed very well in the last couple of quarters, and we don't see any change in the fourth quarter, and we don't see too much change for the next year.
And that's a quite significant business between $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion, because we believe that the demand for hygiene products will stay high next year and Personal Wash as well. And as Rustom commented in his comments on the earnings, the 3 new callers are really producing now really nice growth and have enough critical mass to give us some additional growth. So that will be a good focus area. Fine Fragrance will come back eventually as soon as COVID is normalizing over the course of next year. And that gives us just technically already a nice growth going forward into the 2021. And then we see actually a good performance on the Active Cosmetic business and the Ingredients business as well. Since we have solved for the, let's say, raw material issues out of India, I think that's working well. So that should give us good growth going forward.
On the Taste side, as I said, we have to focus on the most important categories where we can get growth. One of the fastest-growing areas was the beverage area for us, in particular, hard sales in the U.S. We believe that it's a good growth driver for us going forward. We see some of the Natural Product Solutions driving forward, which is -- could be the INFAT business, the food protection business and that helps us to grow nicely. And Food Service, over the course of next year, the quick-service restaurants should normalize as soon as we see some more regular business after -- in the post COVID period. So we believe that could give us good growth drivers going forward.
On the N&B side, even it's not our business now, but what I see from the outside and the pre-integration, you have a couple of business like the biorefinery business or microbial control business, which has challenges which should normalize after the COVID crisis as well. And then you see certainly businesses like the probiotics business or the cultures or enzyme business, which are going quite nicely. So we believe that could drive our growth going forward in 2021. You mentioned integrated solutions. That's certainly a growth driver as well. But I would expect this more in year 2 after the integration because it needs a bit of time that our customers not just, let's say, buying the concept, but launching these products in the marketplace as well. And then it will drive quite nice revenue synergies and certainly profit synergies as well going forward.
I hope it helps to unpack how we see the different portfolio pieces. Maybe just a remark on the regions. As I said before, we have nice growth in North America and a great momentum on both sides of our business, which is fantastic. I think Latin America is better than you might think. And hopefully, it will go better next year as well. We have a bit of a topic on Europe, which is certainly driven by COVID because Fine Fragrance has a big footprint in Europe, as you well know. Lots comes out of France and the Food Service business as well. So we will focus here to fix as much as we can. And then, hopefully, with the, let's say, introduction of the vaccine and the post-COVID period that can give us more growth going forward. So I talked a lot, but I hope that gave you a bit of a perspective how we see the world for now."

Thank you, Faiza, for the question. Let me start with your last part. As I said, we have rigorously looked at our portfolio and there are pieces where we really want to accelerate our growth going forward because we believe it's the right thing to do",513,"Yes. Thank you, Faiza, for the question. Let me start with your last part. As I said, we have rigorously looked at our portfolio and there are pieces where we really want to accelerate our growth going forward because we believe it's the right thing to do. And there are pieces which might not fit too much any longer into our portfolio on the IFF side. And it's probably too early to talk about concrete pieces but we are looking actively into it, and we can't make a decision on N&B, but we are looking into the portfolio here as well. I think your read is quite spot on.
On the lessons learned, I would say there are a couple of lessons. The first one is that you need some time, if you bring these organizations together. You have to start with an aligned team and do as much work before day 1 as you can. Let me give you an example. Look, we have now announced basically up to the top 150, 170 leaders in the new organizations already. And we are still 2, 2.5 months ahead of closure. And hopefully, we will go down 1 layer further. We didn't do it because it was a shorter time frame with Frutarom. I think that's an incredible important step because we can hit the rubber or we can hit the road much, much faster than the Frutarom.
The second thing is we have done an extensive work on the integrated solutions and the cross-selling opportunities. And one of the learnings was, we were, even in food, never short of ideas, but it took longer to realize it. And as I said, we will achieve our top line synergies with food, but it took longer than we were thinking. And that was mainly driven not just selling these ideas to our customers, but until the customer was launching the actual products. And it just takes a bit of more time. And here, we were -- let's say, we started earlier. We tested more robustly our ideas. And we have planned for more time to realize it. I think that's an important one as well.
And then I think we have learned a lot in terms of, let's say, optimizing our footprint. And that was going okay and well. On the food side, I think we are even better prepared now for the merge with N&B on this side as well. So a ton of learnings. I could talk even further, but this might be the most important ones. And it was very helpful. I think for us, to take on something like N&B without having had Frutarom before as an integration exercise, would have been a very, very tough one. But I think the key learnings have helped that quite a bit to be very, very well prepared. And I would say, right now, we are light years ahead of what we had with our last integration. That's what I always hear when I talk to my head of integration. I hope that helps."

What we've seen in the COVID crisis is that many customers have changed a bit their behavior in terms of orders.

So we have seen, let's say, a deterioration also in the third quarter over the course of the quarter that the order book went down.
And you see sales went up a bit in October, again, but who knows what will happen in September -- in December. Sorry for that. And also the comparison is certainly a tough one. So as I said, a bit of a different order behavior of our customers, also depending on the region. We see now some movements in Europe, which is probably because of the lockdown situation. And you sit in London, and we see some movements now for the Brexit, which will now happen probably finally. And you see some movements back and forth as well. So that's the reason for that.

If you think about the COVID costs coming through, we saw that the roughly $5 million of extra costs that we incurred in the quarter flowed through, and it was much more in Taste than it was in Scent when we had. I mean there was also -- Scent benefited -- you are comparing Scent and Taste implicitly and Scent benefited from Fine Fragrance coming back, I mean, like a minus 17% at the end and the minus 14% in the quarter. Those numbers is considerably better than the minus 40% that we had in Q2. So you saw the benefit plus a lot of productivity and cost discipline coming through the numbers. Taste was good in terms of its cost control -- of its OpEx cost control as well. But just the combination of the Food Service and the different businesses, I mean, on the gross margin, we had a tough quarter."

What we have seen actually is stronger sales on Fine Fragrances, which was positive in October, which is actually -- it's great. We will see how it pans out over the rest of the quarter. It's an important season for us because it's ahead of the holiday season. So that's important. That's what we have seen. And we have seen still a double-digit growth on Consumer Fragrances, which is great as well, but not too much of a change, as was some said of the previous quarter. And as I said, we are really looking here from week-to-week how we are moving forward. And Gunther's question was the same as how is the order book? The order book is strong, but we will see whether it deteriorates over the course of the quarter. And that's the reason why we are cautious. In terms of regions, I think Rustom is right. Europe is our focal area right now. I think it's good for North America. North America is good. Latin America is probably better than you would expect. Asia is okay because now we see that India is coming back, which is great. But Europe is still a focus area. And that's certainly driven by the new lockdowns we see all over Europe."

It's certainly one of our focus areas because I believe we are exceptionally strong positioned in that area going forward because we have all the ingredients to satisfy by the market here. What we see is that basically, many companies are now moving into that area. The category was suffering at the beginning a bit from quick-service restaurants being down. That is coming back now in some of the geographies, which is good. But you see more and more that these products are going into supermarkets like Whole Foods and others alike. So what I want to say here is they had a bit of a hard time at the beginning of the pandemics with the quick-service restaurants. They are coming back. We see more companies moving into that area, and we see that the whole category is growing, and that's our expectations for the years to come as well. I hope it helps, John."
