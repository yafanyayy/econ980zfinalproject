As announced earlier today, we finished 2019 strong, with revenue for the quarter increasing 18% over the prior year to $1.1 billion. Fitness, Aviation, Marine and Outdoor collectively increased 24% over the prior year. 
Gross margin was 58% compared to 58.9% during the prior year. Operating margin improved to 25.1%, and operating income increased 24% over the prior year. These results generated GAAP EPS of $1.89 and pro forma EPS of $1.29 in the quarter, an increase of 26%. 
Looking briefly at our full year performance. 2019 was a remarkable year of accomplishments. Revenue increased 12% to over $3.7 billion, representing a new record for Garmin. Combined revenue from Fitness, Aviation, Marine and Outdoor increased 18%. 
Gross margin improved to 59.5%. Operating margin improved to 25.2%, and operating income increased 21% to $946 million, another record achievement. This resulted in GAAP EPS of $4.99 and pro forma EPS of $4.45, an increase of 21% over the prior year. 
In light of these strong results, at our upcoming annual meeting, we'll be asking shareholders to approve an annual dividend of $2.44 a share, representing a 7% increase. Doug will discuss financial results in greater detail in a few minutes, but first, I'd like to highlight some achievements from the past year and our outlook in each of our 5 business segments. 
2019 was an outstanding year for our Fitness segment, with each product category performing well. During the year, we launched sweeping updates to our running, wellness and cycling product lines, and these products were strong contributors in the final quarter of the year. In addition, our recent acquisition of Tacx brought new revenue to the segment and expanded our ability to serve cycling customers indoors and outdoors all year long. 
For the year, revenue from Fitness increased 22%, exceeding the $1 billion threshold for the first time. Gross and operating margins were 51% and 18%, respectively, and operating income increased 6% over prior year. 
In 2020, we plan to build on this momentum by launching new feature-rich products while also expanding the distribution of Tacx products. As a result, we anticipate revenue from the Fitness segment will increase approximately 10% for the year. 
2019 was an extraordinary year for our Aviation segment. ADS-B was a significant contributor to growth. But on a combined basis, other categories contributed even more. We experienced growth in aftermarket systems as customers recognize the strong value proposition of modern cockpit electronics. We also experienced growth in OEM systems driven by popular new aircraft and from increasing demand for trainer aircraft. 
For the year, revenue from Aviation increased 22%. Gross and operating margins were 74% and 34%, respectively, and operating income increased 24% over the prior year. For 2020, we anticipate that revenue for Aviation will be comparable to that of 2019 as growth in aftermarket systems is offset by declining ADS-B revenues. 
Trends in the broader OEM market should be in line with those of 2019. We anticipate that the early part of the year will be the strongest driven by residual ADS-B demand, followed by a weaker back half as we move past the inevitable peak of the ADS-B cycle. We are focused on opportunities that lie ahead, and we are confident in the long-term growth prospects for our Aviation business. 
Our Marine segment delivered another year of impressive results, and market growth and market share gains boosted our performance. From time to time, we've highlighted our halo products and technologies, achievements that speak for themselves and cast a positive glow across the entire Garmin brand. 
Our Panoptix LiveScope sonar system is one example that is generating excitement and strong sales across a broad range of products. We also introduced our first electric trolling motor, which is a new product category for us and bring game-changing new features to the market. 
For the year, revenue for Marine increased 15%, exceeding the $500 million threshold for the first time. Gross and operating margins improved to 60% and 22%, respectively, and operating income increased 73%. 
Looking forward, interest in our products remained very strong entering the 2020 boating season. In addition, our market share in the OEM category will grow as some of the most respected boat brands adopt our products as standard equipment on their 2020 models. With this in mind, we anticipate revenue from the Marine segment will increase approximately 10% for the year. 
Outdoor delivered another strong year of product achievements and revenue growth. During the year, we launched the MARQ luxury watch series, and we completely refreshed the fenix adventure watch series. We also introduced versions of the fenix with passive solar returning technology, which has resonated positively with the market. 
For the year, revenue from outdoor increased 13%. Gross and operating margins were 65% and 36%, respectively, and operating income increased 15% over the prior year. Looking ahead, we believe that the adventure watch category will continue to grow driven by further innovation in new utility. We also believe that inReach will continue to grow as more people appreciate the convenience and life-saving potential of 2-way remote communication. With these things in mind, we anticipate revenue from the Outdoor segment will increase approximately 10% for the year. 
Our Auto segment also delivered many strong achievements in 2019. We integrated the Alexa digital assistant into our P&D product line. And we entered a new product category with the launch of the Overlander navigation device. 
At the recent Consumer Electronics Show, we announced the new Dash Cam Tandem that captures quality video, both inside and outside the vehicle, regardless of lighting conditions. During the year, we also secured a significant backlog of new business as a Tier 1 supplier to the world's most respected automakers. 
For the year, revenue from Auto decreased 14%. Gross and operating margins improved to 47% and 10%, respectively, and operating income increased 50% over the prior year. Looking ahead, we believe that the negative trends in Auto will moderate as contributions from specialty categories increase and as previously announced OEM programs contribute in the back half of the year. 
2020 will also be a year of accelerated investment to support recently awarded programs. We are equipping our manufacturing facility in Olathe for auto OEM production. We are opening a new manufacturing facility in Europe that will be dedicated to auto OEM production. We also plan to hire additional resources in engineering and operations to support these complex, intensive development programs. With these things in mind, we anticipate that revenue from the Auto segment will decrease 5% for the year. 
In summary, we are excited about the opportunities we see in every business segment. For 2020, we anticipate consolidated revenue will reach approximately $4 billion, up 6% year-over-year as growth in Fitness, Outdoor and Marine more than offset a slight decline in the Auto segment. We anticipate that revenue in Aviation will be comparable to that of 2019. 
We anticipate gross margin of approximately 59.2% and operating margin of approximately 23.5%, reflecting our plans for an increased level of investment to support long-term growth initiatives. We anticipate a full year pro forma effective tax rate of approximately 10%, resulting in a pro forma earnings per share of approximately $4.60. 
Our estimated tax rate will be favorably impacted by an intercompany transaction to migrate the ownership of a consumer intellectual property from Switzerland to the United States over the next several years. Doug will be providing more details on this in a few moments. 
So that concludes my remarks. Next, Doug will walk you through additional details on our financial results and outlook. Doug?"

Let's begin by reviewing our fourth quarter and full year financial results, move to comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes.

Let's begin by reviewing our fourth quarter and full year financial results, move to comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. 
We posted revenue over $1.1 billion for the fourth quarter, representing 18% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 58%, a 90 basis point decrease from the prior year. Operating expense as a percentage of sales was 32.9%, 210 basis point decrease from the prior year. Operating income was $277 million, a 24% increase for the prior year. Operating margin was 25.1%, 120 basis point increase from the prior year. Our GAAP EPS was $1.89, and pro forma EPS was $1.29, a 26% increase from the prior year. 
Looking at the full year results, we posted a revenue of over $3.7 billion, representing a 12% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 59.5%, 40 basis point increase from the prior year. Operating expense as a percentage of sales was 34.3%, 160 basis point decrease from the prior year. Operating income was $946 million, a 21% increase over the prior year. Operating margin was 25.2%, increase of 190 basis points from the prior year. Our GAAP EPS was $4.99. Pro forma EPS was $4.45, a 21% increase from the prior year. 
Next, look at fourth quarter and full year revenue by segment. During the fourth quarter, we achieved strong double-digit growth in 4 of our 5 segments led by the Fitness segment at 34% growth, followed by the Aviation and Marine segments with growth of 22% and Outdoor with growth of 16%. For the full year 2019, we achieved 12% consolidated growth, double-digit growth in 4 of our 5 segments. 
Looking next to fourth quarter revenue and operating income. On a combined basis, Fitness, Aviation, Marine and Outdoor segments contributed 89% of total revenue in the fourth quarter 2019 compared to 84% in the prior year quarter. Fitness grew from 30% to 34%. Aviation grew from 17% to 18%. 
These charts illustrate our profit mix by segment. Fitness, Aviation, Marine and outdoor segments collectively delivered 99% of operating income in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to 97% in the fourth quarter of 2018. All segments besides the Auto segment had year-over-year increases in operating income dollars. 
Looking next to full year charts. For the full year, Fitness, Aviation, Marine and Outdoor segments made up 85% of total revenue compared to 81% in 2018. All segments had year-over-year increases in operating income dollars. 
Looking next to operating expenses. Fourth quarter operating expenses increased by $36 million or 11%. Research and development increased $17 million year-over-year due to investments in engineering resources, incremental costs associated with recent acquisitions. 
Our advertising expense increased approximately $8 million from the prior year quarter due to higher Fitness and Outdoor expenses, represented 5.7% of sales, 20 basis point decrease compared to prior year. S&A increased $12 million compared to prior year quarter but decreased as a percentage of sales to 12.5%, 100 basis point decrease compared to prior year. The increase was primarily due to personnel-related expenses, incremental costs associated with the recent acquisitions. 
A few highlights on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and dividend payments. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $2.6 billion. Accounts receivable increased sequentially year-over-year to $707 million due to strong sales in the holiday quarter. Inventory balance increased year-over-year to $753 million. The increase is due to our strategy to increase data supply to support our increasingly diversified product lines and the acquisition of Tacx. 
During the fourth quarter 2019, we generated free cash flow of $208 million. For the full year 2019, we generated free cash flow of approximately $581 million, $183 million decrease from the prior year due to increased working capital needs. 
For 2020, we expect free cash flow to be approximately $750 million, approximately $225 million of capital expenditures. We announced our plans to seek shareholder approval for an increase in our dividend beginning with the June 2020 payment. Proposal, cash dividend of $2.44 per share or $0.61 per share per quarter, a 7% increase from the current quarterly dividend of $0.57 per share. 
For full year 2019, we reported income tax expense of $35 million, which includes an income tax benefit of $118 million due to revaluation and step-up of certain Switzerland deferred tax assets as a result of the Switzerland tax reform. Excluding the $118 million income tax benefit, full year 2019 pro forma effective tax rate was 15.5%, a 20 basis point decrease from the prior year. 
The fiscal year 2020 forma effective tax rate decreased 10%, primarily due to the migration of intellectual property ownership from Switzerland to United States, take consideration the recent tax reform to Switzerland, United States, migration maintained an efficient tax structure in response to the changing global tax landscape. Migration includes an intercompany license agreement that shift intellectual property ownership for our consumer products from Switzerland to United States through royalty payments. This results in a favorable shift of income by jurisdiction, reduces our level expense related to uncertain tax positions. In the multiyear license agreement, higher percentage of income we recognized in the United States. 
This concludes our formal remarks. Mike, can you please open the line for Q&A?"

So as we exited the year, there were approximately 118,000 airplanes that had been equipped out of a total park, if you will, of about 160,000. So ideally, that would mean there's something over 40,000 aircraft that could be left to equip. We don't",258,"Yes. So as we exited the year, there were approximately 118,000 airplanes that had been equipped out of a total park, if you will, of about 160,000. So ideally, that would mean there's something over 40,000 aircraft that could be left to equip. 
We don't think that all of those will be. Some of those are probably airplanes that maybe aren't in the best shape and might be scrapped. So there's going to be some fallout from those, for sure. 
We expect that most of the activity would take place in Q1 and some in Q2. And then the activity would tend to go down in Q3 and 4. 
In terms of the retrofit activity, while it's true that ADS-B probably prompted people to come in and look at other things as we got towards the end of the mandate, particularly most of '19, I would say, shop capacity has been a real issue. So as a result, people may not have been able to do everything that they wanted to. 
And meanwhile, we've been introducing a lot of great new products, and these are generating a lot of interest. So we would expect that people will come back and do more. And the reality is that not everybody wants to put down the big bill for all of their retrofit needs at one time, too. So they may shop and continue to watch and then do more later. 
So we're optimistic about the retrofit market. We think that it still has a lot of room to grow."

We do see that the market will continue to decline in 2020, although it a moderated pace as specialty products become a bigger part of the mix. And we also see a shift in terms of buying behaviors to the more advanced products that we offer. So that's all good news in our view.

So what's driving that is exactly what Cliff mentioned. We're making some investments relating to our Auto OEM business. So we are equipping our facility here in Olathe to handle OEM. So we'll be opening a European facility, manufacturing facility for OEM. Also, we are building a new manufacturing facility for Tacx in Netherlands for that acquisition. 
Another piece relates to our overall Olathe facility expansion. If you remember, we built a new facility for our manufacturing as well as our distribution. We're complete with that. What we're doing now is actually renovating our previous manufacturing and operation facility there. We're renovating that to increase our work space because of increased headcount to support our R&D expansion as well as innovation, the big drivers we have."

First, on advertising. For advertising a percentage of sales, we would expect our advertising to be relatively consistent year-over-year. We'll probably spend more advertising dollars, but we try to keep that in line with our sales growth. 
As it relates to R&D, yes, there will be increased R&D as a percentage of sales year-over-year. Expect that to probably be up maybe about 100 basis points. 
And then as it relates to SG&A as a percentage of sales, we expect that to be up about 50 basis points or so. What's really driving that increased offering expenses really is support our increased revenue growth, so one of which the situation as we talked about for our OEM business. So we make some investments there. It occur -- increase R&D operations as well as it for different systems there. 
From an R&D front, overall, we'll continue to invest in R&D to make sure that we have innovation in our products. And lastly, I would say is that there is some full year impact to some acquisitions, most notably Tacx that we did in 2019, and we'll have the full year impact of those items.

So yes, 2019, we did have some significant capital -- working capital needs, primarily in inventory area. That situation, as previously talked about, for 2019, we basically made a strategy to increase our days supply, to increase our safety stock because of Tacx, mitigate Brexit, all those type of things as well as we had increased AR just because of the increase in our sales year-over-year. 
Now turning to page to 2020. We expect our free cash flow to bounce back. Our current estimates for free cash flow for 2020 are about $750 million. So with that, we're not anticipating to have the same type of year-over-year working capital needs that we had in 2019 and 2020. 
I should say it relates to inventory, we would expect inventory -- year-end inventory 2020 to increase from 2019 levels, but probably more in line with what the sales increase, not the type of a step function that we have. So we'll get some benefit in 2020 relating to that situation I have in working capital. 
As it relates to how it falls out through the year, the situation is we were building inventory throughout the year. So there'll probably be a situation where we may have a situation where we have inventory year-over-year higher than just the level of sales as we get through the year in the first few quarters. But by the end of the year, hopefully, it will be in line with that as we go forward. 
But then also, CapEx plays into that also. That's partially offsetting that to increased CapEx we have, which we previously talked about. So to go back to it, we're making some increased investments in there for building us for the revenue for the future."

As announced earlier today, we finished 2019 strong, with revenue for the quarter increasing 18% over the prior year to $1.1 billion.

As announced earlier today, we finished 2019 strong, with revenue for the quarter increasing 18% over the prior year to $1.1 billion. Fitness, aviation, marine and outdoor collectively increased 24% over the prior year. 
Gross margin was 58% compared to 58.9% during the prior year. Operating margin improved to 25.1%, and operating income increased 24% over the prior year. These results generated GAAP EPS of $1.89 and pro forma EPS of $1.29 in the quarter, an increase of 26%. 
Looking briefly at our full year performance. 2019 was a remarkable year of accomplishments. Revenue increased 12% to over $3.7 billion, representing a new record for Garmin. Combined revenue from fitness, aviation, marine and outdoor increased 18%. Gross margin improved to 59.5%. Operating margin improved to 25.2%, and operating income increased 21% to $946 million, another record achievement. This resulted in GAAP EPS of $4.99 and pro forma EPS of $4.45, an increase of 21% over the prior year. 
In light of these strong results, at our upcoming annual meeting, we'll be asking shareholders to approve an annual dividend of $2.44 a share, representing a 7% increase. Doug will discuss financial results in greater detail in a few minutes, but first, I'd like to highlight some achievements from the past year and our outlook in each of our 5 business segments. 
2019 was an outstanding year for our fitness segment, with each product category performing well. During the year, we launched sweeping updates to our running, wellness and cycling product lines, and these products were strong contributors in the final quarter of the year. In addition, our recent acquisition of Tacx brought new revenue to the segment and expanded our ability to serve cycling customers indoors and outdoors all year long. 
For the year, revenue from fitness increased 22%, exceeding the $1 billion threshold for the first time. Gross and operating margins were 51% and 18%, respectively, and operating income increased 6% over prior year. 
In 2020, we plan to build on this momentum by launching new feature-rich products while also expanding the distribution of Tacx products. As a result, we anticipate revenue from the fitness segment will increase approximately 10% for the year. 
2019 was an extraordinary year for our aviation segment. ADS-B was a significant contributor to growth, but on a combined basis, other categories contributed even more. We experienced growth in aftermarket systems as customers recognize the strong value proposition of modern cockpit electronics. We also experienced growth in OEM systems driven by popular new aircraft and from increasing demand for trainer aircraft. 
For the year, revenue from aviation increased 22%. Gross and operating margins were 74% and 34%, respectively, and operating income increased 24% over the prior year. For 2020, we anticipate that revenue for aviation will be comparable to that of 2019 as growth in aftermarket systems is offset by declining ADS-B revenues. 
Trends in the broader OEM market should be in line with those of 2019. We anticipate that the early part of the year will be the strongest driven by residual ADS-B demand, followed by a weaker back half as we move past the inevitable peak of the ADS-B cycle. We are focused on opportunities that lie ahead, and we are confident in the long-term growth prospects for our aviation business. 
Our marine segment delivered another year of impressive results, and market growth and market share gains boosted our performance. From time to time, we've highlighted our HALO products and technologies, achievements that speak for themselves and cast a positive glow across the entire Garmin brand. Our Panoptix LiveScope sonar system is one example that is generating excitement and strong sales across a broad range of products. We also introduced our first electric trolling motor, which is a new product category for us and bring game-changing new features to the market. 
For the year, revenue from marine increased 15%, exceeding the $500 million threshold for the first time. Gross and operating margins improved to 60% and 22%, respectively, and operating income increased 73%. 
Looking forward, interest in our products remained very strong, entering the 2020 boating season. In addition, our market share in the OEM category will grow as some of the most respected boat brands adopt our products as standard equipment on their 2020 models. With this in mind, we anticipate revenue from the marine segment will increase approximately 10% for the year. 
Outdoor delivered another strong year of product achievements and revenue growth. During the year, we launched the MARQ luxury watch series, and we completely refreshed the fenix adventure watch series. We also introduced versions of the fenix with passive solar recharging technology, which has resonated positively with the market. 
For the year, revenue from outdoor increased 13%. Gross and operating margins were 65% and 36%, respectively, and operating income increased 15% over the prior year. Looking ahead, we believe that the adventure watch category will continue to grow driven by further innovation in new utility. We also believe that inReach will continue to grow as more people appreciate the convenience and life-saving potential of 2-way remote communication. With these things in mind, we anticipate revenue from the outdoor segment will increase approximately 10% for the year. 
Our auto segment also delivered many strong achievements in 2019. We integrated the Alexa digital assistant into our PND product line, and we entered a new product category with the launch of the Overlander navigation device. 
At the recent Consumer Electronics Show, we announced the new Dash Cam Tandem that captures quality video both inside and outside the vehicle, regardless of lighting conditions. During the year, we also secured a significant backlog of new business as a Tier 1 supplier to the world's most respected automakers. 
For the year, revenue from auto decreased 14%. Gross and operating margins improved to 47% and 10%, respectively, and operating income increased 50% over the prior year. Looking ahead, we believe that the negative trends in auto will moderate as contributions from specialty categories increase and as previously announced OEM programs contribute in the back half of the year. 
2020 will also be a year of accelerated investment to support recently awarded programs. We are equipping our manufacturing facility in Olathe for auto OEM production. We are opening a new manufacturing facility in Europe that will be dedicated to auto OEM production. We also plan to hire additional resources in engineering and operations to support these complex, intensive development programs. With these things in mind, we anticipate that revenue from the auto segment will decrease 5% for the year. 
In summary, we are excited about the opportunities we see in every business segment. For 2020, we anticipate consolidated revenue will reach approximately $4 billion, up 6% year-over-year as growth in fitness, outdoor and marine more than offset a slight decline in the auto segment. We anticipate that revenue in aviation will be comparable to that of 2019. 
We anticipate gross margin of approximately 59.2% and operating margin of approximately 23.5%, reflecting our plans for an increased level of investment to support long-term growth initiatives. We anticipate a full year pro forma effective tax rate of approximately 10%, resulting in a pro forma earnings per share of approximately $4.60. 
Our estimated tax rate will be favorably impacted by an intercompany transaction to migrate the ownership of a consumer intellectual property from Switzerland to the United States over the next several years. Doug will be providing more details on this in a few moments. 
So that concludes my remarks. Next, Doug will walk you through additional details on our financial results and outlook. Doug?"

Let's begin by reviewing our fourth quarter and full year financial results and give comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. We posted revenue over $1.1 billion for the fourth quarter, represe",881,"Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. Let's begin by reviewing our fourth quarter and full year financial results and give comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. 
We posted revenue over $1.1 billion for the fourth quarter, representing 18% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 58%, a 90 basis point decrease from the prior year. Operating expense as a percentage of sales was 32.9%, 210 basis point decrease from the prior year. Operating income was $277 million, a 24% increase from the prior year. Operating margin was 25.1%, 120 basis point increase from the prior year. Our GAAP EPS was $1.89, and pro forma EPS was $1.29, a 26% increase from the prior year. 
Looking at the full year results, we posted revenue of over $3.7 billion, representing a 12% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 59.5%, 40 basis point increase from the prior year. Operating expense as a percentage of sales was 34.3%, 160 basis point decrease from the prior year. Operating income was $946 million, a 21% increase over the prior year. Operating margin was 25.2%, increase of 190 basis points from the prior year. Our GAAP EPS was $4.99. Pro forma EPS was $4.45, a 21% increase from prior year. 
Next, look at fourth quarter and full year revenue by segment. During the fourth quarter, we achieved strong double-digit growth in 4 of our 5 segments led by fitness segment at 34% growth, followed by the aviation and marine segments with growth of 22% and outdoor with growth of 16%. For the full year 2019, we achieved 12% consolidated growth, double-digit growth in 4 of our 5 segments. 
Looking next to fourth quarter revenue and operating income. On a combined basis, the fitness, aviation, marine and outdoor segments contributed 89% of total revenue in the fourth quarter 2019 compared to 84% in the prior year quarter. Fitness grew from 30% to 34%. Aviation grew from 17% to 18%. 
Let's see these charts to illustrate our profit mix by segment. Fitness, aviation, marine and outdoor segments collectively delivered 99% of operating income in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to 97% in the fourth quarter of 2018. All segments besides the auto segment had year-over-year increases in operating income dollars. 
Looking next to full year charts. For the full year, fitness, aviation, marine and outdoor segments made up 85% of total revenue compared to 81% in 2018. All segments had year-over-year increases in operating income dollars. 
Looking next to operating expenses. Fourth quarter operating expenses increased by $36 million or 11%. Research and development increased $17 million year-over-year due to investments in engineering resources, incremental costs associated with recent acquisitions. 
Our advertising expense increased approximately $8 million from the prior year quarter due to higher fitness and outdoor expenses, represented 5.7% of sales, 20 basis point decrease compared to prior year. SG&A increased $12 million compared to prior year quarter but decreased as a percentage of sales to 12.5%, 100 basis point decrease compared to prior year. Increase was primarily due to personnel-related expenses, incremental costs associated with the recent acquisitions. 
A few highlights on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and dividend payments. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $2.6 billion. Accounts receivable increased sequentially year-over-year to $707 million due to strong sales in the holiday quarter. Inventory balance increased year-over-year to $753 million. Increase is due to our strategy to increase data supply to support our increasingly diversified product lines and the acquisition of Tacx. 
During the fourth quarter 2019, we generated free cash flow of $208 million. For the full year 2019, we generated free cash flow of approximately $581 million, $183 million decrease from the prior year due to increased working capital needs. 
For 2020, we expect free cash flow to be approximately $750 million, approximately $225 million of capital expenditures. We announced our plans to seek shareholder approval for an increase in our dividend beginning with the June 2020 payment. Proposal, the cash dividend of $2.44 per share or $0.61 per share per quarter, it's a 7% increase from the current quarterly dividend of $0.57 per share. 
For full year 2019, we reported income tax expense of $35 million, which includes an income tax benefit of $118 million due to revaluation and step-up of certain Switzerland deferred tax assets as a result of the Switzerland tax reform. Excluding the $118 million income tax benefit, the full year 2019 pro forma effective tax rate was 15.5%, 20 basis point decrease from the prior year. 
The fiscal year 2020 forma effective tax rate is expected to decrease 10%, primarily due to the migration of intellectual property ownership from Switzerland to United States. Taking into consideration the recent major tax reform in Switzerland and United States, the migration maintained an efficient tax structure and responds to the changing global tax landscape. Migration includes an intercompany license agreement that shifts intellectual property ownership for our consumer products from Switzerland to United States through royalty payments. This results in a favorable shift of income by jurisdiction, reduces our level expense related to uncertain tax positions. And at the multiyear license agreement, higher percentage of income were recognized in the United States, which concludes our formal remarks.

So as we exited the year, there were approximately 118,000 airplanes that had been equipped out of a total park, if you will, of about 160,000.

So as we exited the year, there were approximately 118,000 airplanes that had been equipped out of a total park, if you will, of about 160,000. So ideally, that would mean there's something over 40,000 aircraft that could be left to equip. 
We don't think that all of those will be. Some of those are probably airplanes that maybe aren't in the best shape and might be scrapped, so there's going to be some fallout from those, for sure. 
We expect that most of the activity would take place in Q1 and some in Q2. And then the activity would tend to go down in Q3 and 4. 
In terms of the retrofit activity, while it's true that ADS-B probably prompted people to come in and look at other things as we got towards the end of the mandate, particularly most of '19, I would say, shop capacity has been a real issue. So as a result, people may not have been able to do everything that they wanted to. 
And meanwhile, we've been introducing a lot of great new products, and these are generating a lot of interest. So we would expect that people will come back and do more. And the reality is that not everybody wants to put down the big bill for all of their retrofit needs at one time, too. So they may shop and continue to watch and then do more later. So we're optimistic about the retrofit market. We think that it still has a lot of room to grow."

So in terms of the lower operating income in Q4, there was a mix of some onetime items there as well as increased R&D associated with noncapitalized projects.

We do see that the market will continue to decline in 2020, although at a moderated pace as specialty products become a bigger part of the mix. And we also see a shift in terms of buying behaviors to the more advanced products that we offer. So that's all good news in our view. 
In terms of the production plan in the U.S., we're equipping our factory here to be able to supply the BMW program that we won a few years back for North American production. And then the European investment is for the most recent BMW win that will supply the European factories for BMW."

As it relates to R&D, yes, there will be increased R&D as a percentage of sales year-over-year. We expect that to probably be up maybe about 100 basis points. 
And then as it relates to SG&A as a percentage of sales, we expect that to be up about 50 basis points or so. So what's really driving that increased operating expenses really is to support our increased revenue growth, so one of which is the situation that we talked about for OEM business. So we're making some investments there. It occur -- increased R&D operations as well as IT for different systems there. 
From an R&D front, overall, we'll continue to invest in R&D to make sure that we have innovation in our products.

But while -- from a high-level perspective is while we have the license agreement in that place, we will see that favorable income mix by jurisdiction. Then when we no longer have a license agreement at that point in time, we'll have a higher percentage of our income going to U.S. So that's directionally what it is. But like I said, there's a lot of puts and takes in that tax rate, but it's something that we looked at to make sure that we do maintain as efficient of a tax structure as possible."

So yes, 2019, we did have some significant capital -- working capital needs, primarily in inventory area. That situation, as previously talked about, for 2019, we basically made a strategy to increase our days of supply, to increase our safety stock because of Tacx, mitigate Brexit, all those type of things as well as we had increased AR just because of the increase in our sales year-over-year. 
Now turning to page to 2020. We expect our free cash flow to bounce back. Our current estimates for free cash flow for 2020 are about $750 million. So with that, we're not anticipating to have the same type of year-over-year working capital needs that we had in 2019 and 2020. 
I should say, as it relates to inventory, we would expect inventory -- year-end inventory 2020 to increase from 2019 levels, but probably more in line with [ what the ] sales increase, not the type of a step function that we have. So we'll get some benefit in 2020 relating to that situation I have in working cap. 
As it relates to how it falls out through the year, the situation is we were building inventory throughout the year. So there'll probably be a situation where we may have -- a situation where we have inventory year-over-year higher than just the level of sales as we get through the year in the first few quarters. But by the end of the year, hopefully, it will be in line with that as we go forward. 
But then also, CapEx plays into that also. That's partially offsetting that to increased CapEx we have, which we previously talked about. So to go back to it, we're making some increased investments in there for building us for the revenue for the future."

As announced earlier today, we finished 2019 strong, with revenue for the quarter increasing 18% over the prior year to $1.1 billion. Fitness, aviation, marine and outdoor collectively increased 24% over the prior year. 
Gross margin was 58% compared to 58.9% during the prior year. Operating margin improved to 25.1%, and operating income increased 24% over the prior year. These results generated GAAP EPS of $1.89 and pro forma EPS of $1.29 in the quarter, an increase of 26%. 
Looking briefly at our full year performance. 2019 was a remarkable year of accomplishments. Revenue increased 12% to over $3.7 billion, representing a new record for Garmin. Combined revenue from fitness, aviation, marine and outdoor increased 18%. Gross margin improved to 59.5%. Operating margin improved to 25.2%, and operating income increased 21% to $946 million, another record achievement. This resulted in GAAP EPS of $4.99 and pro forma EPS of $4.45, an increase of 21% over the prior year. 
In light of these strong results, at our upcoming annual meeting, we'll be asking shareholders to approve an annual dividend of $2.44 a share, representing a 7% increase. Doug will discuss financial results in greater detail in a few minutes, but first, I'd like to highlight some achievements from the past year and our outlook in each of our 5 business segments. 
2019 was an outstanding year for our fitness segment, with each product category performing well. During the year, we launched sweeping updates to our running, wellness and cycling product lines, and these products were strong contributors in the final quarter of the year. In addition, our recent acquisition of Tacx brought new revenue to the segment and expanded our ability to serve cycling customers indoors and outdoors all year long. 
For the year, revenue from fitness increased 22%, exceeding the $1 billion threshold for the first time. Gross and operating margins were 51% and 18%, respectively, and operating income increased 6% over prior year. 
In 2020, we plan to build on this momentum by launching new feature-rich products while also expanding the distribution of Tacx products. As a result, we anticipate revenue from the fitness segment will increase approximately 10% for the year. 
2019 was an extraordinary year for our aviation segment. ADS-B was a significant contributor to growth, but on a combined basis, other categories contributed even more. We experienced growth in aftermarket systems as customers recognize the strong value proposition of modern cockpit electronics. We also experienced growth in OEM systems driven by popular new aircraft and from increasing demand for trainer aircraft. 
For the year, revenue from aviation increased 22%. Gross and operating margins were 74% and 34%, respectively, and operating income increased 24% over the prior year. For 2020, we anticipate that revenue for aviation will be comparable to that of 2019 as growth in aftermarket systems is offset by declining ADS-B revenues. 
Trends in the broader OEM market should be in line with those of 2019. We anticipate that the early part of the year will be the strongest driven by residual ADS-B demand, followed by a weaker back half as we move past the inevitable peak of the ADS-B cycle. We are focused on opportunities that lie ahead, and we are confident in the long-term growth prospects for our aviation business. 
Our marine segment delivered another year of impressive results, and market growth and market share gains boosted our performance. From time to time, we've highlighted our HALO products and technologies, achievements that speak for themselves and cast a positive glow across the entire Garmin brand. Our Panoptix LiveScope sonar system is one example that is generating excitement and strong sales across a broad range of products. We also introduced our first electric trolling motor, which is a new product category for us and bring game-changing new features to the market. 
For the year, revenue from marine increased 15%, exceeding the $500 million threshold for the first time. Gross and operating margins improved to 60% and 22%, respectively, and operating income increased 73%. 
Looking forward, interest in our products remained very strong, entering the 2020 boating season. In addition, our market share in the OEM category will grow as some of the most respected boat brands adopt our products as standard equipment on their 2020 models. With this in mind, we anticipate revenue from the marine segment will increase approximately 10% for the year. 
Outdoor delivered another strong year of product achievements and revenue growth. During the year, we launched the MARQ luxury watch series, and we completely refreshed the fenix adventure watch series. We also introduced versions of the fenix with passive solar recharging technology, which has resonated positively with the market. 
For the year, revenue from outdoor increased 13%. Gross and operating margins were 65% and 36%, respectively, and operating income increased 15% over the prior year. Looking ahead, we believe that the adventure watch category will continue to grow driven by further innovation in new utility. We also believe that inReach will continue to grow as more people appreciate the convenience and life-saving potential of 2-way remote communication. With these things in mind, we anticipate revenue from the outdoor segment will increase approximately 10% for the year. 
Our auto segment also delivered many strong achievements in 2019. We integrated the Alexa digital assistant into our PND product line, and we entered a new product category with the launch of the Overlander navigation device. 
At the recent Consumer Electronics Show, we announced the new Dash Cam Tandem that captures quality video both inside and outside the vehicle, regardless of lighting conditions. During the year, we also secured a significant backlog of new business as a Tier 1 supplier to the world's most respected automakers. 
For the year, revenue from auto decreased 14%. Gross and operating margins improved to 47% and 10%, respectively, and operating income increased 50% over the prior year. Looking ahead, we believe that the negative trends in auto will moderate as contributions from specialty categories increase and as previously announced OEM programs contribute in the back half of the year. 
2020 will also be a year of accelerated investment to support recently awarded programs. We are equipping our manufacturing facility in Olathe for auto OEM production. We are opening a new manufacturing facility in Europe that will be dedicated to auto OEM production. We also plan to hire additional resources in engineering and operations to support these complex, intensive development programs. With these things in mind, we anticipate that revenue from the auto segment will decrease 5% for the year. 
In summary, we are excited about the opportunities we see in every business segment. For 2020, we anticipate consolidated revenue will reach approximately $4 billion, up 6% year-over-year as growth in fitness, outdoor and marine more than offset a slight decline in the auto segment. We anticipate that revenue in aviation will be comparable to that of 2019. 
We anticipate gross margin of approximately 59.2% and operating margin of approximately 23.5%, reflecting our plans for an increased level of investment to support long-term growth initiatives. We anticipate a full year pro forma effective tax rate of approximately 10%, resulting in a pro forma earnings per share of approximately $4.60. 
Our estimated tax rate will be favorably impacted by an intercompany transaction to migrate the ownership of a consumer intellectual property from Switzerland to the United States over the next several years. Doug will be providing more details on this in a few moments. So that concludes my remarks. 
Next, Doug will walk you through additional details on our financial results and outlook. Doug?"

Let's begin by reviewing our fourth quarter and full year financial results and give comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. 
We posted revenue over $1.1 billion for the fourth quarter, representing 18% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 58%, a 90 basis point decrease from the prior year. Operating expense as a percentage of sales was 32.9%, 210 basis point decrease from the prior year. Operating income was $277 million, a 24% increase from the prior year. Operating margin was 25.1%, 120 basis point increase from the prior year. Our GAAP EPS was $1.89, and pro forma EPS was $1.29, a 26% increase from the prior year. 
Looking at the full year results, we posted revenue of over $3.7 billion, representing a 12% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 59.5%, 40 basis point increase from the prior year. Operating expense as a percentage of sales was 34.3%, 160 basis point decrease from the prior year. Operating income was $946 million, a 21% increase over the prior year. Operating margin was 25.2%, increase of 190 basis points from the prior year. Our GAAP EPS was $4.99. Pro forma EPS was $4.45, a 21% increase from prior year. 
Next, look at fourth quarter and full year revenue by segment. During the fourth quarter, we achieved strong double-digit growth in 4 of our 5 segments led by fitness segment at 34% growth, followed by the aviation and marine segments with growth of 22% and outdoor with growth of 16%. For the full year 2019, we achieved 12% consolidated growth, double-digit growth in 4 of our 5 segments. 
Looking next to fourth quarter revenue and operating income. On a combined basis, the fitness, aviation, marine and outdoor segments contributed 89% of total revenue in the fourth quarter 2019 compared to 84% in the prior year quarter. Fitness grew from 30% to 34%. Aviation grew from 17% to 18%. 
Let's see these charts to illustrate our profit mix by segment. Fitness, aviation, marine and outdoor segments collectively delivered 99% of operating income in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to 97% in the fourth quarter of 2018. All segments besides the auto segment had year-over-year increases in operating income dollars. 
Looking next to full year charts. For the full year, fitness, aviation, marine and outdoor segments made up 85% of total revenue compared to 81% in 2018. All segments had year-over-year increases in operating income dollars. 
Looking next to operating expenses. Fourth quarter operating expenses increased by $36 million or 11%. Research and development increased $17 million year-over-year due to investments in engineering resources, incremental costs associated with recent acquisitions. 
Our advertising expense increased approximately $8 million from the prior year quarter due to higher fitness and outdoor expenses, represented 5.7% of sales, 20 basis point decrease compared to prior year. SG&A increased $12 million compared to prior year quarter but decreased as a percentage of sales to 12.5%, 100 basis point decrease compared to prior year. Increase was primarily due to personnel-related expenses, incremental costs associated with the recent acquisitions. 
A few highlights on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and dividend payments. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $2.6 billion. Accounts receivable increased sequentially year-over-year to $707 million due to strong sales in the holiday quarter. Inventory balance increased year-over-year to $753 million. Increase is due to our strategy to increase data supply to support our increasingly diversified product lines and the acquisition of Tacx. 
During the fourth quarter 2019, we generated free cash flow of $208 million. For the full year 2019, we generated free cash flow of approximately $581 million, $183 million decrease from the prior year due to increased working capital needs. 
For 2020, we expect free cash flow to be approximately $750 million, approximately $225 million of capital expenditures. We announced our plans to seek shareholder approval for an increase in our dividend beginning with the June 2020 payment. Proposal, the cash dividend of $2.44 per share or $0.61 per share per quarter, it's a 7% increase from the current quarterly dividend of $0.57 per share. 
For full year 2019, we reported income tax expense of $35 million, which includes an income tax benefit of $118 million due to revaluation and step-up of certain Switzerland deferred tax assets as a result of the Switzerland tax reform. Excluding the $118 million income tax benefit, the full year 2019 pro forma effective tax rate was 15.5%, 20 basis point decrease from the prior year. 
The fiscal year 2020 forma effective tax rate is expected to decrease 10%, primarily due to the migration of intellectual property ownership from Switzerland to United States. Taking into consideration the recent major tax reform in Switzerland and United States, the migration maintained an efficient tax structure and responds to the changing global tax landscape. Migration includes an intercompany license agreement that shifts intellectual property ownership for our consumer products from Switzerland to United States through royalty payments. This results in a favorable shift of income by jurisdiction, reduces our level expense related to uncertain tax positions. And at the multiyear license agreement, higher percentage of income were recognized in the United States, which concludes our formal remarks.

So as we exited the year, there were approximately 118,000 airplanes that had been equipped out of a total park, if you will, of about 160,000. So ideally, that would mean there's something over 40,000 aircraft that could be left to equip. We don't",258,"Yes. So as we exited the year, there were approximately 118,000 airplanes that had been equipped out of a total park, if you will, of about 160,000. So ideally, that would mean there's something over 40,000 aircraft that could be left to equip. 
We don't think that all of those will be. Some of those are probably airplanes that maybe aren't in the best shape and might be scrapped, so there's going to be some fallout from those, for sure. We expect that most of the activity would take place in Q1 and some in Q2. And then the activity would tend to go down in Q3 and 4. 
In terms of the retrofit activity, while it's true that ADS-B probably prompted people to come in and look at other things as we got towards the end of the mandate, particularly most of '19, I would say, shop capacity has been a real issue. So as a result, people may not have been able to do everything that they wanted to. 
And meanwhile, we've been introducing a lot of great new products, and these are generating a lot of interest. So we would expect that people will come back and do more. And the reality is that not everybody wants to put down the big bill for all of their retrofit needs at one time, too. So they may shop and continue to watch and then do more later. So we're optimistic about the retrofit market. We think that it still has a lot of room to grow."

We do see that the market will continue to decline in 2020, although at a moderated pace as specialty products become a bigger part of the mix. And we also see a shift in terms of buying behaviors to the more advanced products that we offer. So that's all good news in our view.

And then as it relates to SG&A as a percentage of sales, we expect that to be up about 50 basis points or so. So what's really driving that increased operating expenses really is to support our increased revenue growth, so one of which is the situation that we talked about for OEM business. So we're making some investments there. It occur -- increased R&D operations as well as IT for different systems there. 
From an R&D front, overall, we'll continue to invest in R&D to make sure that we have innovation in our products.

That situation, as previously talked about, for 2019, we basically made a strategy to increase our days of supply, to increase our safety stock because of Tacx, mitigate Brexit, all those type of things as well as we had increased AR just because of the increase in our sales year-over-year. 
Now turning to page to 2020. We expect our free cash flow to bounce back. Our current estimates for free cash flow for 2020 are about $750 million. So with that, we're not anticipating to have the same type of year-over-year working capital needs that we had in 2019 and 2020. 
I should say, as it relates to inventory, we would expect inventory -- year-end inventory 2020 to increase from 2019 levels, but probably more in line with [ what the ] sales increase, not the type of a step function that we have. So we'll get some benefit in 2020 relating to that situation I have in working cap. 
As it relates to how it falls out through the year, the situation is we were building inventory throughout the year. So there'll probably be a situation where we may have -- a situation where we have inventory year-over-year higher than just the level of sales as we get through the year in the first few quarters. But by the end of the year, hopefully, it will be in line with that as we go forward. 
But then also, CapEx plays into that also. That's partially offsetting that to increased CapEx we have, which we previously talked about. So to go back to it, we're making some increased investments in there for building us for the revenue for the future."

As announced earlier today, we finished 2019 strong, with revenue for the quarter increasing 18% over the prior year to $1.1 billion. Fitness, aviation, marine and outdoor collectively increased 24% over the prior year. 
Gross margin was 58% compared to 58.9% during the prior year. Operating margin improved to 25.1%, and operating income increased 24% over the prior year. These results generated GAAP EPS of $1.89 and pro forma EPS of $1.29 in the quarter, an increase of 26%. 
Looking briefly at our full year performance. 2019 was a remarkable year of accomplishments. Revenue increased 12% to over $3.7 billion, representing a new record for Garmin. Combined revenue from fitness, aviation, marine and outdoor increased 18%. Gross margin improved to 59.5%. Operating margin improved to 25.2%, and operating income increased 21% to $946 million, another record achievement. This resulted in GAAP EPS of $4.99 and pro forma EPS of $4.45, an increase of 21% over the prior year. 
In light of these strong results, at our upcoming annual meeting, we'll be asking shareholders to approve an annual dividend of $2.44 a share, representing a 7% increase. Doug will discuss financial results in greater detail in a few minutes, but first, I'd like to highlight some achievements from the past year and our outlook in each of our 5 business segments. 
2019 was an outstanding year for our fitness segment, with each product category performing well. During the year, we launched sweeping updates to our running, wellness and cycling product lines, and these products were strong contributors in the final quarter of the year. In addition, our recent acquisition of Tacx brought new revenue to the segment and expanded our ability to serve cycling customers indoors and outdoors all year long. 
For the year, revenue from fitness increased 22%, exceeding the $1 billion threshold for the first time. Gross and operating margins were 51% and 18%, respectively, and operating income increased 6% over prior year. 
In 2020, we plan to build on this momentum by launching new feature-rich products while also expanding the distribution of Tacx products. As a result, we anticipate revenue from the fitness segment will increase approximately 10% for the year. 
2019 was an extraordinary year for our aviation segment. ADS-B was a significant contributor to growth, but on a combined basis, other categories contributed even more. We experienced growth in aftermarket systems as customers recognize the strong value proposition of modern cockpit electronics. We also experienced growth in OEM systems driven by popular new aircraft and from increasing demand for trainer aircraft. 
For the year, revenue from aviation increased 22%. Gross and operating margins were 74% and 34%, respectively, and operating income increased 24% over the prior year. For 2020, we anticipate that revenue for aviation will be comparable to that of 2019 as growth in aftermarket systems is offset by declining ADS-B revenues. 
Trends in the broader OEM market should be in line with those of 2019. We anticipate that the early part of the year will be the strongest driven by residual ADS-B demand, followed by a weaker back half as we move past the inevitable peak of the ADS-B cycle. We are focused on opportunities that lie ahead, and we are confident in the long-term growth prospects for our aviation business. 
Our marine segment delivered another year of impressive results, and market growth and market share gains boosted our performance. From time to time, we've highlighted our HALO products and technologies, achievements that speak for themselves and cast a positive glow across the entire Garmin brand. Our Panoptix LiveScope sonar system is one example that is generating excitement and strong sales across a broad range of products. We also introduced our first electric trolling motor, which is a new product category for us and bring game-changing new features to the market. 
For the year, revenue from marine increased 15%, exceeding the $500 million threshold for the first time. Gross and operating margins improved to 60% and 22%, respectively, and operating income increased 73%. 
Looking forward, interest in our products remained very strong, entering the 2020 boating season. In addition, our market share in the OEM category will grow as some of the most respected boat brands adopt our products as standard equipment on their 2020 models. With this in mind, we anticipate revenue from the marine segment will increase approximately 10% for the year. 
Outdoor delivered another strong year of product achievements and revenue growth. During the year, we launched the MARQ luxury watch series, and we completely refreshed the fenix adventure watch series. We also introduced versions of the fenix with passive solar recharging technology, which has resonated positively with the market. 
For the year, revenue from outdoor increased 13%. Gross and operating margins were 65% and 36%, respectively, and operating income increased 15% over the prior year. Looking ahead, we believe that the adventure watch category will continue to grow driven by further innovation in new utility. We also believe that inReach will continue to grow as more people appreciate the convenience and life-saving potential of 2-way remote communication. With these things in mind, we anticipate revenue from the outdoor segment will increase approximately 10% for the year. 
Our auto segment also delivered many strong achievements in 2019. We integrated the Alexa digital assistant into our PND product line, and we entered a new product category with the launch of the Overlander navigation device. 
At the recent Consumer Electronics Show, we announced the new Dash Cam Tandem that captures quality video both inside and outside the vehicle, regardless of lighting conditions. During the year, we also secured a significant backlog of new business as a Tier 1 supplier to the world's most respected automakers. 
For the year, revenue from auto decreased 14%. Gross and operating margins improved to 47% and 10%, respectively, and operating income increased 50% over the prior year. Looking ahead, we believe that the negative trends in auto will moderate as contributions from specialty categories increase and as previously announced OEM programs contribute in the back half of the year. 
2020 will also be a year of accelerated investment to support recently awarded programs. We are equipping our manufacturing facility in Olathe for auto OEM production. We are opening a new manufacturing facility in Europe that will be dedicated to auto OEM production. We also plan to hire additional resources in engineering and operations to support these complex, intensive development programs. With these things in mind, we anticipate that revenue from the auto segment will decrease 5% for the year. 
In summary, we are excited about the opportunities we see in every business segment. For 2020, we anticipate consolidated revenue will reach approximately $4 billion, up 6% year-over-year as growth in fitness, outdoor and marine more than offset a slight decline in the auto segment. We anticipate that revenue in aviation will be comparable to that of 2019. 
We anticipate gross margin of approximately 59.2% and operating margin of approximately 23.5%, reflecting our plans for an increased level of investment to support long-term growth initiatives. We anticipate a full year pro forma effective tax rate of approximately 10%, resulting in a pro forma earnings per share of approximately $4.60. 
Our estimated tax rate will be favorably impacted by an intercompany transaction to migrate the ownership of a consumer intellectual property from Switzerland to the United States over the next several years. Doug will be providing more details on this in a few moments. So that concludes my remarks. 
Next, Doug will walk you through additional details on our financial results and outlook. Doug?"
598655,651110800,1930880,"Garmin Ltd., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Feb 19, 2020",2020-02-19,"Earnings Calls","Garmin Ltd.","Executives","Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone.

Let's begin by reviewing our fourth quarter and full year financial results and give comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. 
We posted revenue over $1.1 billion for the fourth quarter, representing 18% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 58%, a 90 basis point decrease from the prior year. Operating expense as a percentage of sales was 32.9%, 210 basis point decrease from the prior year. Operating income was $277 million, a 24% increase from the prior year. Operating margin was 25.1%, 120 basis point increase from the prior year. Our GAAP EPS was $1.89, and pro forma EPS was $1.29, a 26% increase from the prior year. 
Looking at the full year results, we posted revenue of over $3.7 billion, representing a 12% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 59.5%, 40 basis point increase from the prior year. Operating expense as a percentage of sales was 34.3%, 160 basis point decrease from the prior year. Operating income was $946 million, a 21% increase over the prior year. Operating margin was 25.2%, increase of 190 basis points from the prior year. Our GAAP EPS was $4.99. Pro forma EPS was $4.45, a 21% increase from prior year. 
Next, look at fourth quarter and full year revenue by segment. During the fourth quarter, we achieved strong double-digit growth in 4 of our 5 segments led by fitness segment at 34% growth, followed by the aviation and marine segments with growth of 22% and outdoor with growth of 16%. For the full year 2019, we achieved 12% consolidated growth, double-digit growth in 4 of our 5 segments. 
Looking next to fourth quarter revenue and operating income. On a combined basis, the fitness, aviation, marine and outdoor segments contributed 89% of total revenue in the fourth quarter 2019 compared to 84% in the prior year quarter. Fitness grew from 30% to 34%. Aviation grew from 17% to 18%. 
Let's see these charts to illustrate our profit mix by segment. Fitness, aviation, marine and outdoor segments collectively delivered 99% of operating income in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to 97% in the fourth quarter of 2018. All segments besides the auto segment had year-over-year increases in operating income dollars. 
Looking next to full year charts. For the full year, fitness, aviation, marine and outdoor segments made up 85% of total revenue compared to 81% in 2018. All segments had year-over-year increases in operating income dollars. 
Looking next to operating expenses. Fourth quarter operating expenses increased by $36 million or 11%. Research and development increased $17 million year-over-year due to investments in engineering resources, incremental costs associated with recent acquisitions. 
Our advertising expense increased approximately $8 million from the prior year quarter due to higher fitness and outdoor expenses, represented 5.7% of sales, 20 basis point decrease compared to prior year. SG&A increased $12 million compared to prior year quarter but decreased as a percentage of sales to 12.5%, 100 basis point decrease compared to prior year. Increase was primarily due to personnel-related expenses, incremental costs associated with the recent acquisitions. 
A few highlights on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and dividend payments. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $2.6 billion. Accounts receivable increased sequentially year-over-year to $707 million due to strong sales in the holiday quarter. Inventory balance increased year-over-year to $753 million. Increase is due to our strategy to increase data supply to support our increasingly diversified product lines and the acquisition of Tacx. 
During the fourth quarter 2019, we generated free cash flow of $208 million. For the full year 2019, we generated free cash flow of approximately $581 million, $183 million decrease from the prior year due to increased working capital needs. 
For 2020, we expect free cash flow to be approximately $750 million, approximately $225 million of capital expenditures. We announced our plans to seek shareholder approval for an increase in our dividend beginning with the June 2020 payment. Proposal, the cash dividend of $2.44 per share or $0.61 per share per quarter, it's a 7% increase from the current quarterly dividend of $0.57 per share. 
For full year 2019, we reported income tax expense of $35 million, which includes an income tax benefit of $118 million due to revaluation and step-up of certain Switzerland deferred tax assets as a result of the Switzerland tax reform. Excluding the $118 million income tax benefit, the full year 2019 pro forma effective tax rate was 15.5%, 20 basis point decrease from the prior year. 
The fiscal year 2020 forma effective tax rate is expected to decrease 10%, primarily due to the migration of intellectual property ownership from Switzerland to United States. Taking into consideration the recent major tax reform in Switzerland and United States, the migration maintained an efficient tax structure and responds to the changing global tax landscape. Migration includes an intercompany license agreement that shifts intellectual property ownership for our consumer products from Switzerland to United States through royalty payments. This results in a favorable shift of income by jurisdiction, reduces our level expense related to uncertain tax positions. And at the multiyear license agreement, higher percentage of income were recognized in the United States, which concludes our formal remarks.

So as we exited the year, there were approximately 118,000 airplanes that had been equipped out of a total park, if you will, of about 160,000. So ideally, that would mean there's something over 40,000 aircraft that could be left to equip. We don't",258,"Yes. So as we exited the year, there were approximately 118,000 airplanes that had been equipped out of a total park, if you will, of about 160,000. So ideally, that would mean there's something over 40,000 aircraft that could be left to equip. 
We don't think that all of those will be. Some of those are probably airplanes that maybe aren't in the best shape and might be scrapped, so there's going to be some fallout from those, for sure. We expect that most of the activity would take place in Q1 and some in Q2. And then the activity would tend to go down in Q3 and 4. 
In terms of the retrofit activity, while it's true that ADS-B probably prompted people to come in and look at other things as we got towards the end of the mandate, particularly most of '19, I would say, shop capacity has been a real issue. So as a result, people may not have been able to do everything that they wanted to. 
And meanwhile, we've been introducing a lot of great new products, and these are generating a lot of interest. So we would expect that people will come back and do more. And the reality is that not everybody wants to put down the big bill for all of their retrofit needs at one time, too. So they may shop and continue to watch and then do more later. So we're optimistic about the retrofit market. We think that it still has a lot of room to grow."

We do see that the market will continue to decline in 2020, although at a moderated pace as specialty products become a bigger part of the mix. And we also see a shift in terms of buying behaviors to the more advanced products that we offer. So that's all good news in our view.

So during the license period, the situation is that a higher percentage of the income will be going to the U.S."

And in the fourth quarter, we had a lot of products that were sold, obviously, for the holiday season, particularly promotional. Products and tax itself is a product line, as we've said before, that is slightly dilutive to the overall gross margins of the segment. And so just under 50% was obviously a result of all of that mix. We would expect that to go up and down as the year progresses depending on the seasonality and the kind of products that we offer. And generally, we're targeting around a 50% gross margin for the segment. And mid- to high-teens operating margin for the segment."

So what's driving that is exactly what Cliff mentioned. We're making some investments relating to our auto OEM business. So we are equipping our facility here in Olathe to handle OEM. Also, we'll be opening a European facility, manufacturing facility for OEM. Also, we are building a new manufacturing facility for Tacx in Netherlands for that acquisition. 
Another piece relates to our overall Olathe facility expansion. If you remember, we built a new facility for our manufacturing as well as our distribution. We're complete with that. What we're doing now is actually renovating our previous manufacturing and operation facility there. We're renovating that to increase our work space because of increased headcount to support our R&D expansion as well as innovation, the big drivers we have."

So as it relates to 2020 operating expense, to give you a little bit a flavor of that by category. 
First, on advertising. For advertising, a percentage of sales, we would expect our advertising to be relatively consistent year-over-year. We'll probably spend more advertising dollars, but we try to keep that in line with our sales growth. As it relates to R&D, yes, there will be increased R&D as a percentage of sales year-over-year. We expect that to probably be up maybe about 100 basis points. 
And then as it relates to SG&A as a percentage of sales, we expect that to be up about 50 basis points or so. So what's really driving that increased operating expenses really is to support our increased revenue growth, so one of which is the situation that we talked about for OEM business. So we're making some investments there. It occur -- increased R&D operations as well as IT for different systems there. 
From an R&D front, overall, we'll continue to invest in R&D to make sure that we have innovation in our products. And lastly, I would say is that there is some full year impact to some acquisitions, most notably Tacx that we did in 2019, and we'll have the full year impact of those items. So all of the expense items as well as the CapEx we talked about is really to support our increased top line growth into revenue."

And then separately, we got very promotional with some of the previous generation products, which drove a lot of sales activity in the holiday quarter. 
In terms of just drivers around the competitive landscape, I would say that we feel like the landscape has generally narrowed a lot. Of course, Apple is a big one out there just in terms of total wearables market share. We believe that we differentiate from Apple and others with our products that are built specifically for active lifestyles.

That situation, as previously talked about, for 2019, we basically made a strategy to increase our days of supply, to increase our safety stock because of Tacx, mitigate Brexit, all those type of things as well as we had increased AR just because of the increase in our sales year-over-year. 
Now turning to page to 2020. We expect our free cash flow to bounce back. Our current estimates for free cash flow for 2020 are about $750 million. So with that, we're not anticipating to have the same type of year-over-year working capital needs that we had in 2019 and 2020. 
I should say, as it relates to inventory, we would expect inventory -- year-end inventory 2020 to increase from 2019 levels, but probably more in line with [ what the ] sales increase, not the type of a step function that we have. So we'll get some benefit in 2020 relating to that situation I have in working cap. 
As it relates to how it falls out through the year, the situation is we were building inventory throughout the year. So there'll probably be a situation where we may have -- a situation where we have inventory year-over-year higher than just the level of sales as we get through the year in the first few quarters. But by the end of the year, hopefully, it will be in line with that as we go forward. 
But then also, CapEx plays into that also. That's partially offsetting that to increased CapEx we have, which we previously talked about. So to go back to it, we're making some increased investments in there for building us for the revenue for the future."

Gross margin was stable to last year, an",1736,"Thank you, Teri, and good morning, everyone. First quarter of 2020 continued the strong momentum we experienced in the back half of last year. Revenue increased 12%, resulting in a new record for the first quarter. Gross margin was stable to last year, and operating margin expanded, resulting in operating income growth of 17%. Late in the quarter, the landscape changed as the COVID-19 outbreak became a global pandemic, and governments responded with drastic measures to slow the spread of the virus. This resulted in unprecedented economic changes affecting every company, and Garmin is no exception. Accordingly, we are withdrawing our fiscal 2020 guidance. However, we are optimistic for the long term as the markets we serve and the products we offer are well positioned to succeed in a post-pandemic world. I'll explain why we are optimistic in just a moment.  But first, I want to share a few insights on how Garmin is approaching the most significant health and economic crisis of our time. 
First, I'll highlight our business priorities. The global awareness of the coronavirus is recent, but its impact was felt much earlier and parts of Asia were dramatically affected by its emergence and rapid spread. Since the beginning, employee safety has been our top priority, starting in Asia and expanding as the virus spread to other regions of the world. Most of our employees can work from home. And we've taken steps to protect those who continue to work within our facilities. Our employees adapted to these new circumstances with speed and resilience, and I'm super proud of their response to this challenge. 
Our second priority has been to strengthen our supply chain. In the early days of the virus outbreak, our supply chain teams were working hard to ensure we would not be affected by the widespread industrial shutdowns that were occurring in Asia. I'm pleased to report that our supply chain is healthy, and we've not missed any opportunities due to COVID-19-related disruptions. This is remarkable considering the unprecedented disruption occurring in global supply chains. 
Our third priority is to focus on opportunities. The crisis is often defined by its challenges, but we are looking through the lens of opportunity. We've accelerated efforts to increase our mix of online sales with business partners and on garmin.com. We have plenty of inventory, allowing us to capture market share. 
And finally, we'll be using this opportunity to refine our product road map priorities to make sure we have the right products now and after the crisis fades. 
Next, I will talk about the leadership model we've embraced during this time of global crisis and unprecedented disruption. First, we think to choose positively. In the contrast, constant rumble of negative unthinkable headlines, there are positive thinking, things happening all over Garmin. All of us wonder what the new normal will be. No matter what happens, I feel good about the markets we serve and the product lines we offer. We believe every business segment has a bright future. 
Second, we are responding accordingly. We recognize the world is facing the most significant health and economic crisis of our time. We understand it could take some time before the global economy recovers from the effects of the virus and the actions taken to control its spread. With this in mind, we're taking pragmatic steps to maintain our strong financial position. 
And finally, we're focused on the long term. In this dynamic environment, aiming at what we see today will only cause us to miss the target. Instead, we're aiming for where we want to be when the crisis fades. Paraphrasing our company mission, we aspire to be an enduring company by creating superior products that are an essential part of our customers' lives. Our vision is to be a globally respected leader in every market we serve. We expect to emerge from this crisis as a stronger and more capable company. This isn't the first global crisis we faced, and it won't be our last. During each test, pass and present, we rely on a set of unique strengths that help us through times of crisis. 
First, our highly diverse business model provides a rich set of opportunities and reduces our reliance on single markets and product lines. Each market we serve and each product line we offer has an important role to play, both now and in the future. We are also well diversified geographically with roughly half of our revenue generated in the Americas, 1/3 in Europe and the remainder from Asia Pacific. Our revenue diversity will help us capture opportunities as the pandemic evolves from region to region. 
Second, we are a vertically integrated company. We control our own supply chain and are not overly reliant on outside partners to produce and distribute our products. This gives us a high degree of flexibility, efficiency and effectiveness while operating in a highly dynamic business environment. 
And finally, we have a strong balance sheet with no debt and over $2.6 billion in cash and marketable securities. 
We're often asked why we maintain such a strong balance sheet, and our answer remains the same. Our balance sheet provides stability to our investors through our commitment to an attractive dividend and allows us to invest for the future when others are pulling back. 
In summary, our balance sheet is the cornerstone of our ability to face a crisis such as this. With these things in mind, I'd like to spend a few minutes providing a market update for each of our segments. 
Fitness had a strong quarter, driven by advanced wearables and our Tacx indoor bike trainers, which continue to experience strong demand during the current stay-at-home orders. A positive outcome of this crisis is the increasing focus on personal fitness, health and wellness. People recognize that good health is an important defense against contracting the virus. And they're looking for tools that can help them improve their health. Our fitness products are highly relevant today and will remain so in the future. 
Marine posted a strong first quarter, driven by our strong lineup of chartplotters and game-changing sonar technology. We were recognized as Supplier of the Year by Independent Boat Builders, Inc. for the second year in a row, and our sponsored Angler swept the top 3 spots at the recent 2020 Best Master Classic. Boating is an active lifestyle pursuit that promotes family time, relaxation and a sense of freedom. In the long term, we believe that the current crisis will increase consumer interest in boating and fishing. Certain restrictions have prevented some boats from coming out of storage as planned, which could impact the marine season. Once restrictions are eased, we expect to see strong demand for our products. Regardless of how things play out, we believe compelling innovation is driving market share gains, and we will continue to deliver innovation for the future. 
Outdoor posted strong operating results driven by adventure watches. Time in the outdoors is highly compatible with healthy social distancing. And we believe that interest in outdoor activities will increase in the future. We already have a great lineup of products that support a broad range of outdoor activities. And in coming months, we will strengthen our position by introducing compelling new products and new categories. 
Aviation delivered strong operating results for the first quarter. We saw additional growth in the ADS-B category but at a lower rate than last year, which was expected. Retrofit systems were strong, while OEM categories were roughly flat. The aviation market has been significantly impacted by the pandemic and economic damage caused by measures to contain the spread. 
First, travel has been brought to a near standstill by stay-at-home orders and international border closings. This has impacted both commercial and general aviation. Business confidence has been shaken by stock market volatility and rapidly declining economic activity. From history, we know that aviation takes longer to recover from severe economic shocks. Even so, we are optimistic about the future. We believe more people will seek transportation options that are secure, flexible and convenient. These are the enduring qualities that general aviation has been known for throughout the decades. We are ready for this opportunity with industry-leading cockpit systems for every aircraft from light sport airplanes to large business jets. We will continue to invest for the future. And disruptive new cockpit technologies are on the way. 
Revenue from auto decreased 17% in the first quarter, and the segment was essentially breakeven. The first quarter of the year is seasonally slower for our consumer products, and some of our top-performing OEM products are at a mature point of their life cycle. As I mentioned earlier, people will seek transportation options that are secure, flexible and convenient. For this reason, we believe personal autos will remain an important part of the future. To prepare for this opportunity, we've been making significant progress transforming ourselves to be a Tier 1 auto supplier. New vehicles are launching this year with Garmin hardware and software solutions, which will lead to revenue growth for the OEM category. In addition, we will be introducing new specialty product categories that will appeal to automotive adventures. 
Finally, I want to make a few remarks about our plans for guidance. The impact of the coronavirus and the economic damage caused by efforts to contain its spread are unprecedented. The ultimate outcome remains unpredictable, causing us to withdraw our fiscal 2020 guidance, as I mentioned earlier. While the long-term is difficult to predict, we want to share insights on what we have seen so far in Q2. 
On a consolidated basis, our April sales are trending about 40% lower than last year, as many retailers have curtailed operations and consumer activity has been severely limited by government restrictions. We expect these trends to continue throughout the second quarter as restrictions remain in place across much of the globe. We anticipate being profitable in Q2, provided that our revenue development follows the trends we've been seeing so far. We've taken near-term measures to defer discretionary expenses, prioritize uses of cash for critical CapEx and acquisitions, and we've sharpened our focus in R&D. We look forward to providing annual guidance once economic volatility subsides and when consumer behaviors are better understood after restrictions are eased and the crisis passes. 
That concludes my remarks. Next, Doug will walk us through additional details on our financial results. Doug?"

I'd like to begin by reviewing our first quarter financial results, move to comments on balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes.

I'd like to begin by reviewing our first quarter financial results, move to comments on balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. We posted revenue of $856 million for the first quarter, representing a 12% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 59.2%, a 20 basis point increase from the prior year. Operating expense as a percentage of sales was 38.5%, a 70 basis point decrease from the prior year. Operating income was $177 million, a 17% increase year-over-year. Operating margin was 20.7%, a 90 basis point increase from the prior year. Our GAAP EPS was $0.84 and pro forma EPS was $0.91. 
Next, to look at our first quarter revenue by segment, we achieved record first quarter revenue of $856 million, with 4 of our 5 segments posting double-digit growth. As seen in the charts, we have a diversified business model from both a segment and geography perspective. 
Looking next, operating expenses. First quarter operating expenses increased by $29 million or 10%. Research and development increased [ $19 ] million year-over-year, investments in engineering resources, incremental costs associated with recent acquisitions. Advertising expense decreased approximately $1 million for the prior year quarter. SG&A increased $10 million compared to prior year quarter, but decreased as a percentage of sales to 16%, 60 basis point decrease compared to the prior year. Increase was primarily due to personnel-related expenses, incremental costs associated with recent acquisitions. As Cliff mentioned, we're implementing expense control measures to defer discretionary spending and sharpening our focus in R&D. 
A few highlights on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $2.6 billion and no debt. Accounts receivable decreased sequentially to $500 million on a seasonally strong fourth quarter, increased year-over-year in line with first quarter sales. Inventory balance increased on both a sequential year-over-year basis as we have been preparing for the seasonally strong second quarter. We are aligning production levels and inventory with anticipated demand. However, we expect incremental increases in inventory in the near term as it takes time to scale supply chain around near-term demand. 
During the first quarter of 2020, we generated free cash flow of  [ $185 ] million, $50 million increase for the prior year quarter. We took another look at our capital expenditures now expected 2020 annual cap expenditures to be approximately $140 million. 2 key capital expenditure projects for 2020 were the tax manufacturing facility and the auto OEM manufacturing facility in Europe. Also during the quarter, we paid dividends of $109 million. Turning attractive dividend to our shareholders is one of current priorities for cash. 
In the first quarter of 2020, we reported an effective tax rate of 9.3% compared to 15.7% in the prior year quarter. The decrease is primarily due to the migration of intellectual property ownership from Switzerland to United States. 
This concludes our formal remarks. Jonathan, can you please open the line for Q&A."

About 70-plus percent of our revenue came from literally 1 product line. And we were not as well diversified then as we are now in terms of facing a crisis. So we had a lot to worry about at that time, and we were facing also not only an economic crisis, but a declining market. I feel like things are totally different now. Our company is very well diversified. And our product lines target all of the areas where we believe people are going to have a lot of interest in, especially as these restrictions are removed. 
So one thing we learned in the past is that, certainly, you have to have great new products. You have to be able to continue to invest. We're doing all of those things today, but we're a much different company than we were back then. 
In terms of how things develop for guidance, as I mentioned, we're going to be looking for changes around these restrictions. I think there's still a lot of uncertainty that's happening as every local seems to have a different approach to removing restrictions. And every local has a different approach when it comes to how much things they allow so all of these things probably impact consumer behavior. That's a big wildcard. And then just trying to see how the economic volatility shakes out once we get a feel for that, we believe we'll be in a good position to be able to predict the business going forward."

Depending on the local and the retailer, some retailers are doing very well and some have had to operate under more restrictive circumstances even closing their stores. So this has hindered the access to marine products. And generally, we've seen very strong end-user demand for the products. Some of our top products, even on our own website, are our marine products, which is somewhat counterintuitive because they're more complex and require installation, but people are buying those. 
So again, it's kind of a mixed bag. We would expect things to get better, as you say, as states open up for boating. Michigan has been a big one. You mentioned New York. That's also been a big one. We hope that boats can come out of storage soon. And we are hearing from the field that customers are excited about equipping their boats and getting them on the water. 
In terms of the opportunity going forward, we're very optimistic about marine. It's a great market. I think a crisis like this when people are evaluating priorities, they tend to turn to things that inspire them, and I think boating and fishing is one of those things that we'll see a benefit in the future from people's evaluation of their priorities."

In '08 and '09, the production capacity was so high that when the pullback occurred, there was simply no way to sustain that kind of production capacity in marine products. And so the marine market, especially the OEMs, felt a significant impact from the reduction in demand. There was also a lot of crazy financing going on with boats. And so the overall financial situation of people buying boats and the financiers that were financing the boats was very, very precarious. Rolling forward to where we are today, the boat market has slowly recovered from those lows. And so it hasn't overbuilt in the same way that it was back in '08 and '09. And the kinds of products that are being offered are in the bell curve of where demand still exists, tends to be in those mid-range center console type of boats that still remain popular. And many of our OEM partners that are shut down right now are very anxious to go back to work because they have customers that want their boats that have ordered them and are anxious to get them. 
So we're optimistic about that. We don't think it's the same situation. But I would also say that anytime there's economic shots, that will take a certain number of customers out of the market. So there's bound to be some impact, but we hope it's not as bad as what it was before."

Gross margin was stable to last year, an",1736,"Thank you, Teri, and good morning, everyone. First quarter of 2020 continued the strong momentum we experienced in the back half of last year. Revenue increased 12%, resulting in a new record for the first quarter. Gross margin was stable to last year, and operating margin expanded, resulting in operating income growth of 17%. Late in the quarter, the landscape changed as the COVID-19 outbreak became a global pandemic and governments responded with drastic measures to slow the spread of the virus. This resulted in unprecedented economic changes affecting every company, and Garmin is no exception. Accordingly, we are withdrawing our fiscal 2020 guidance. However, we are optimistic for the long-term as the markets we serve and the products we offer are well positioned to succeed in a post pandemic world. I'll explain why we are optimistic in just a moment. But first, I want to share a few insights on how Garmin is approaching the most significant health and economic crisis of our time. First, I'll highlight our business priorities. The global awareness of the coronavirus is recent, but its impact was felt much earlier when parts of Asia were dramatically affected by its emergence and rapid spread. Since the beginning, employee safety has been our top priority, starting in Asia and expanding as the virus spread to other regions of the world. Most of our employees can work from home. And we've taken steps to protect those who continue to work within our facilities. Our employees adapted to these new circumstances with speed and resilience, and I'm super proud of their response to this challenge.  
Our second priority has been to strengthen our supply chain. In the early days of the virus outbreak, our supply chain teams were working hard to ensure we would not be affected by the widespread industrial shutdowns that were occurring in Asia. I'm pleased to report that our supply chain is healthy, and we've not missed any opportunities due to COVID-19-related disruptions. This is remarkable considering the unprecedented disruption occurring in global supply chains.  
Our third priority is to focus on opportunities. The crisis is often defined by its challenges, but we are looking through the lens of opportunity. We've accelerated efforts to increase our mix of online sales with business partners and on garmin.com. We have plenty of inventory, allowing us to capture market share.
And finally, we'll be using this opportunity to refine our product road map priorities to make sure we have the right products now and after the crisis fades.  
Next, I will talk about the leadership model we've embraced during this time of global crisis and unprecedented disruption. First, we think to choose positively. In the contrast -- constant rumble of negative unthinkable headlines, there are positive thinking, things happening all over Garmin. All of us wonder what the new normal will be. No matter what happens, I feel good about the markets we serve and the product lines we offer. We believe every business segment has a bright future.  
Second, we are responding accordingly. We recognize the world is facing the most significant health and economic crisis of our time. We understand it could take some time before the global economy recovers from the effects of the virus and the actions taken to control its spread. With this in mind, we're taking pragmatic steps to maintain our strong financial position.  
And finally, we're focused on the long term. In this dynamic environment, aiming at what we see today will only cause us to miss the target. Instead, we're aiming for where we want to be when the crisis fades. Paraphrasing our company mission, we aspire to be an enduring company by creating superior products that are an essential part of our customers' lives. Our vision is to be a globally respected leader in every market we serve. We expect to emerge from this crisis as a stronger and more capable company. This isn't the first global crisis we faced, and it won't be our last. During each test, past and present, we rely on a set of unique strengths that help us through times of crisis.  
First, our highly diverse business model provides a rich set of opportunities and reduces our reliance on single markets and product lines. Each market we serve and each product line we offer has an important role to play, both now and in the future. We are also well diversified geographically with roughly half of our revenue generated in the Americas, 1/3 in Europe and the remainder from Asia Pacific. Our revenue diversity will help us capture opportunities as the pandemic evolves from region to region.  
Second, we are a vertically integrated company. We control our own supply chain and are not overly reliant on outside partners to produce and distribute our products. This gives us a high degree of flexibility, efficiency and effectiveness while operating in a highly dynamic business environment.  
And finally, we have a strong balance sheet with no debt and over $2.6 billion in cash and marketable securities.  
We're often asked why we maintain such a strong balance sheet, and our answer remains the same. Our balance sheet provides stability to our investors through our commitment to an attractive dividend and allows us to invest for the future when others are pulling back.  
In summary, our balance sheet is the cornerstone of our ability to face a crisis such as this. With these things in mind, I'd like to spend a few minutes providing a market update for each of our segments.  
Fitness had a strong quarter, driven by advanced wearables and our Tacx indoor bike trainers, which continue to experience strong demand during the   
current stay-at-home orders. A positive outcome of this crisis is the increasing focus on personal fitness, health and wellness. People recognize that good health is an important defense against contracting the virus. And they're looking for tools that can help them improve their health. Our fitness products are highly relevant today and will remain so in the future.  
Marine posted a strong first quarter, driven by our strong lineup of chartplotters and game-changing sonar technology. We were recognized as Supplier of the Year by Independent Boat Builders, Inc. for the second year in a row, and our sponsored anglers swept the top 3 spots at the recent 2020 Bassmaster Classic. Boating is an active lifestyle pursuit that promotes family time, relaxation and a sense of freedom. In the long term, we believe that the current crisis will increase consumer interest in boating and fishing. Certain restrictions have prevented some boats from coming out of storage as planned, which could impact the marine season. Once restrictions are eased, we expect to see strong demand for our products. Regardless of how things play out, we believe compelling innovation is driving market share gains, and we will continue to deliver innovation for the future.  
Outdoor posted strong operating results driven by adventure watches. Time in the outdoors is highly compatible with healthy social distancing. And we believe that interest in outdoor activities will increase in the future. We already have a great lineup of products that support a broad range of outdoor activities. And in coming months, we will strengthen our position by introducing compelling new products and new categories.  
Aviation delivered strong operating results for the first quarter. We saw additional growth in the ADS-B category but at a lower rate than last year, which was expected. Retrofit systems were strong, while OEM categories were roughly flat. The aviation market has been significantly impacted by the pandemic and economic damage caused by measures to contain the spread.  
First, travel has been brought to a near standstill by stay-at-home orders and international border closings. This has impacted both commercial and general aviation. Business confidence has been shaken by stock market volatility and rapidly declining economic activity. From history, we know that aviation takes longer to recover from severe economic shocks. Even so, we are optimistic about the future. We believe more people will seek transportation options that are secure, flexible and convenient. These are the enduring qualities that general aviation has been known for throughout the decades. We are ready for this opportunity with industry-leading cockpit systems for every aircraft from light sport airplanes to large business jets. We will continue to invest for the future. And disruptive new cockpit technologies are on the way.  
Revenue from auto decreased 17% in the first quarter, and the segment was essentially breakeven. The first quarter of the year is seasonally slower for our consumer products, and some of our top-performing OEM products are at a mature point of their life cycle. As I mentioned earlier, people will seek transportation options that are secure, flexible and convenient. For this reason, we believe personal autos will remain an important part of the future. To prepare for this opportunity, we've been making significant progress transforming ourselves to be a Tier 1 auto supplier. New vehicles are launching this year with Garmin hardware and software solutions, which will lead to revenue growth for the OEM category.  
In addition, we will be introducing new specialty product categories that will appeal to automotive adventurers.
Finally, I want to make a few remarks about our plans for guidance. The impact of the coronavirus and the economic damage caused by efforts to contain its spread are unprecedented. The ultimate outcome remains unpredictable, causing us to withdraw our fiscal 2020 guidance, as I mentioned earlier. While the long-term is difficult to predict, we want to share insights on what we have seen so far in Q2.  
On a consolidated basis, our April sales are trending about 40% lower than last year, as many retailers have curtailed operations and consumer activity has been severely limited by government restrictions. We expect these trends to continue throughout the second quarter as restrictions remain in place across much of the globe. We anticipate being profitable in Q2, provided that our revenue development follows the trends we've been seeing so far. We've taken near-term measures to defer discretionary expenses, prioritize uses of cash for critical CapEx and acquisitions, and we've sharpened our focus in R&D. We look forward to providing annual guidance once economic volatility subsides and when consumer behaviors are better understood after restrictions are eased and the crisis passes.  
That concludes my remarks. Next, Doug will walk us through additional details on our financial results. Doug?"

I'd like to begin by reviewing our first quarter financial results, move to comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes.

I'd like to begin by reviewing our first quarter financial results, move to comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. We posted revenue of $856 million for the first quarter, representing a 12% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 59.2%, a 20 basis point increase from the prior year. Operating expense as a percentage of sales was 38.5%, a 70 basis point decrease from the prior year. Operating income was $177 million, a 17% increase year-over-year. Operating margin was 20.7%, a 90 basis point increase from the prior year. Our GAAP EPS was $0.84 and pro forma EPS was $0.91.  
Next, to look at our first quarter revenue by segment, we achieved record first quarter revenue of $856 million, with 4 of our 5 segments posting double-digit growth. As seen in the charts, we have a diversified business model from both a segment and geography perspective.  
Looking next, operating expenses. First quarter operating expenses increased by $29 million or 10%. Research and development increased $19 million year-over-year, investments in engineering resources, incremental costs associated with recent acquisitions. Advertising expense decreased approximately $1 million from the prior year quarter. SG&A increased $10 million compared to prior year quarter, but decreased as a percentage of sales to 16%, 60 basis point decrease compared to the prior year. Increase was primarily due to personnel-related expenses, incremental costs associated with recent acquisitions. As Cliff mentioned, we're implementing expense control measures to defer discretionary spending and sharpening our focus in R&D.  
A few highlights on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $2.6 billion and no debt. Accounts receivable decreased sequentially to $500 million on a seasonally strong fourth quarter, increased year-over-year in line with first quarter sales. Inventory balance increased on both a sequential year-over-year basis as we have been preparing for the seasonally strong second quarter. We are aligning production levels and inventory with anticipated demand. However, we expect incremental increases in inventory in the near term as it takes time to scale supply chain around near-term demand.  
During the first quarter of 2020, we generated free cash flow of $185 million, $50 million increase for the prior year quarter. We took another look at our capital expenditures and now expect 2020 annual cap expenditures to be approximately $140 million. 2 key capital expenditure projects for 2020 were the Tacx manufacturing facility and the auto OEM manufacturing facility in Europe. Also during the quarter, we paid dividends of $109 million. Turning an attractive dividend to our shareholders is one of current priorities for cash.  
In the first quarter of 2020, we reported an effective tax rate of 9.3% compared to 15.7% in the prior year quarter. The decrease is primarily due to the migration of intellectual property ownership from Switzerland to United States.  
This concludes our formal remarks. Jonathan, can you please open the line for Q&A."

About 70-plus percent of our revenue came from literally one product line. And we were not as well diversified then as we are now in terms of facing a crisis. So we had a lot to worry about at that time, and we were facing also not only an economic crisis, but a declining market. I feel like things are totally different now. Our company is very well diversified. And our product lines target all of the areas where we believe people are going to have a lot of interest in, especially as these restrictions are removed.  
So one thing we learned in the past is that, certainly, you have to have great new products. You have to be able to continue to invest. We're doing all of those things today, but we're a much different company than we were back then.  
In terms of how things develop for guidance, as I mentioned, we're going to be looking for changes around these restrictions. I think there's still a lot of uncertainty that's happening as every locale seems to have a different approach to removing restrictions. And every locale has a different approach when it comes to how much things they allow so all of these things probably impact consumer behavior. That's a big wildcard. And then just trying to see how the economic volatility shakes out once we get a feel for that, we believe we'll be in a good position to be able to predict the business going forward."

Sell-out, again, as I mentioned earlier, our indications from our product registrations on Garmin Connect are strong in those regions where restrictions allow the kinds of activities our products are known for. So we're encouraged by that. And because of that, we believe that the channel inventory is being depleted in some of those places as customers are looking for products and trying to find whatever they can. 
In terms of segment by segment, we're seeing right now in terms of the sell-in stronger results in outdoor and fitness compared to the trends that I mentioned. Marine is about where we expect. And then aviation and auto are trending behind."

Depending on the locale and the retailer, some retailers are doing very well and some have had to operate under more restrictive circumstances even closing their stores. So this has hindered the access to marine products. And generally, we've seen very strong end-user demand for the products. Some of our top products, even on our own website, are our marine products, which is somewhat counterintuitive because they're more complex and require installation, but people are buying those. 
So again, it's kind of a mixed bag. We would expect things to get better, as you say, as states open up for boating. Michigan has been a big one. You mentioned New York. That's also been a big one. We hope that boats can come out of storage soon. And we are hearing from the field that customers are excited about equipping their boats and getting them on the water. 
In terms of the opportunity going forward, we're very optimistic about marine. It's a great market. I think a crisis like this when people are evaluating priorities, they tend to turn to things that inspire them, and I think boating and fishing is one of those things that we'll see a benefit in the future from people's evaluation of their priorities."

In '08 and '09, the production capacity was so high that when the pullback occurred, there was simply no way to sustain that kind of production capacity in marine products. And so the marine market, especially the OEMs, felt a significant impact from the reduction in demand. There was also a lot of crazy financing going on with boats. And so the overall financial situation of people buying boats and the financers that were financing the boats was very, very precarious. Rolling forward to where we are today, the boat market has slowly recovered from those lows. And so it hasn't overbuilt in the same way that it was back in '08 and '09. And the kinds of products that are being offered are in the bell curve of where demand still exists, tends to be in those mid-range center console type of boats that still remain popular. And many of our OEM partners that are shut down right now are very anxious to go back to work because they have customers that want their boats, that have ordered them and are anxious to get them. 
So we're optimistic about that. We don't think it's the same situation. But I would also say that anytime there's economic shocks, that will take a certain number of customers out of the market. So there's bound to be some impact, but we hope it's not as bad as what it was before."

Gross margin was stable to last year, an",1736,"Thank you, Teri, and good morning, everyone. First quarter of 2020 continued the strong momentum we experienced in the back half of last year. Revenue increased 12%, resulting in a new record for the first quarter. Gross margin was stable to last year, and operating margin expanded, resulting in operating income growth of 17%. Late in the quarter, the landscape changed as the COVID-19 outbreak became a global pandemic and governments responded with drastic measures to slow the spread of the virus. This resulted in unprecedented economic changes affecting every company, and Garmin is no exception. Accordingly, we are withdrawing our fiscal 2020 guidance. However, we are optimistic for the long-term as the markets we serve and the products we offer are well positioned to succeed in a post pandemic world. I'll explain why we are optimistic in just a moment. But first, I want to share a few insights on how Garmin is approaching the most significant health and economic crisis of our time. First, I'll highlight our business priorities. The global awareness of the coronavirus is recent, but its impact was felt much earlier when parts of Asia were dramatically affected by its emergence and rapid spread. Since the beginning, employee safety has been our top priority, starting in Asia and expanding as the virus spread to other regions of the world. Most of our employees can work from home. And we've taken steps to protect those who continue to work within our facilities. Our employees adapted to these new circumstances with speed and resilience, and I'm super proud of their response to this challenge.  
Our second priority has been to strengthen our supply chain. In the early days of the virus outbreak, our supply chain teams were working hard to ensure we would not be affected by the widespread industrial shutdowns that were occurring in Asia. I'm pleased to report that our supply chain is healthy, and we've not missed any opportunities due to COVID-19-related disruptions. This is remarkable considering the unprecedented disruption occurring in global supply chains.  
Our third priority is to focus on opportunities. The crisis is often defined by its challenges, but we are looking through the lens of opportunity. We've accelerated efforts to increase our mix of online sales with business partners and on garmin.com. We have plenty of inventory, allowing us to capture market share.
And finally, we'll be using this opportunity to refine our product road map priorities to make sure we have the right products now and after the crisis fades.  
Next, I will talk about the leadership model we've embraced during this time of global crisis and unprecedented disruption. First, we think to choose positively. In the contrast -- constant rumble of negative unthinkable headlines, there are positive thinking, things happening all over Garmin. All of us wonder what the new normal will be. No matter what happens, I feel good about the markets we serve and the product lines we offer. We believe every business segment has a bright future.  
Second, we are responding accordingly. We recognize the world is facing the most significant health and economic crisis of our time. We understand it could take some time before the global economy recovers from the effects of the virus and the actions taken to control its spread. With this in mind, we're taking pragmatic steps to maintain our strong financial position.  
And finally, we're focused on the long term. In this dynamic environment, aiming at what we see today will only cause us to miss the target. Instead, we're aiming for where we want to be when the crisis fades. Paraphrasing our company mission, we aspire to be an enduring company by creating superior products that are an essential part of our customers' lives. Our vision is to be a globally respected leader in every market we serve. We expect to emerge from this crisis as a stronger and more capable company. This isn't the first global crisis we faced, and it won't be our last. During each test, past and present, we rely on a set of unique strengths that help us through times of crisis.  
First, our highly diverse business model provides a rich set of opportunities and reduces our reliance on single markets and product lines. Each market we serve and each product line we offer has an important role to play, both now and in the future. We are also well diversified geographically with roughly half of our revenue generated in the Americas, 1/3 in Europe and the remainder from Asia Pacific. Our revenue diversity will help us capture opportunities as the pandemic evolves from region to region.  
Second, we are a vertically integrated company. We control our own supply chain and are not overly reliant on outside partners to produce and distribute our products. This gives us a high degree of flexibility, efficiency and effectiveness while operating in a highly dynamic business environment.  
And finally, we have a strong balance sheet with no debt and over $2.6 billion in cash and marketable securities.  
We're often asked why we maintain such a strong balance sheet, and our answer remains the same. Our balance sheet provides stability to our investors through our commitment to an attractive dividend and allows us to invest for the future when others are pulling back.  
In summary, our balance sheet is the cornerstone of our ability to face a crisis such as this. With these things in mind, I'd like to spend a few minutes providing a market update for each of our segments.  
Fitness had a strong quarter, driven by advanced wearables and our Tacx indoor bike trainers, which continue to experience strong demand during the current stay-at-home orders. A positive outcome of this crisis is the increasing focus on personal fitness, health and wellness. People recognize that good health is an important defense against contracting the virus. And they're looking for tools that can help them improve their health. Our fitness products are highly relevant today and will remain so in the future.  
Marine posted a strong first quarter, driven by our strong lineup of chartplotters and game-changing sonar technology. We were recognized as Supplier of the Year by Independent Boat Builders, Inc. for the second year in a row, and our sponsored anglers swept the top 3 spots at the recent 2020 Bassmaster Classic. Boating is an active lifestyle pursuit that promotes family time, relaxation and a sense of freedom. In the long term, we believe that the current crisis will increase consumer interest in boating and fishing. Certain restrictions have prevented some boats from coming out of storage as planned, which could impact the marine season. Once restrictions are eased, we expect to see strong demand for our products. Regardless of how things play out, we believe compelling innovation is driving market share gains, and we will continue to deliver innovation for the future.  
Outdoor posted strong operating results driven by adventure watches. Time in the outdoors is highly compatible with healthy social distancing. And we believe that interest in outdoor activities will increase in the future. We already have a great lineup of products that support a broad range of outdoor activities. And in coming months, we will strengthen our position by introducing compelling new products and new categories.  
Aviation delivered strong operating results for the first quarter. We saw additional growth in the ADS-B category but at a lower rate than last year, which was expected. Retrofit systems were strong, while OEM categories were roughly flat. The aviation market has been significantly impacted by the pandemic and economic damage caused by measures to contain the spread.  
First, travel has been brought to a near standstill by stay-at-home orders and international border closings. This has impacted both commercial and general aviation. Business confidence has been shaken by stock market volatility and rapidly declining economic activity. From history, we know that aviation takes longer to recover from severe economic shocks. Even so, we are optimistic about the future. We believe more people will seek transportation options that are secure, flexible and convenient. These are the enduring qualities that general aviation has been known for throughout the decades. We are ready for this opportunity with industry-leading cockpit systems for every aircraft from light sport airplanes to large business jets. We will continue to invest for the future. And disruptive new cockpit technologies are on the way.  
Revenue from auto decreased 17% in the first quarter, and the segment was essentially breakeven. The first quarter of the year is seasonally slower for our consumer products, and some of our top-performing OEM products are at a mature point of their life cycle. As I mentioned earlier, people will seek transportation options that are secure, flexible and convenient. For this reason, we believe personal autos will remain an important part of the future. To prepare for this opportunity, we've been making significant progress transforming ourselves to be a Tier 1 auto supplier. New vehicles are launching this year with Garmin hardware and software solutions, which will lead to revenue growth for the OEM category.  
In addition, we will be introducing new specialty product categories that will appeal to automotive adventurers.
Finally, I want to make a few remarks about our plans for guidance. The impact of the coronavirus and the economic damage caused by efforts to contain its spread are unprecedented. The ultimate outcome remains unpredictable, causing us to withdraw our fiscal 2020 guidance, as I mentioned earlier. While the long-term is difficult to predict, we want to share insights on what we have seen so far in Q2.  
On a consolidated basis, our April sales are trending about 40% lower than last year, as many retailers have curtailed operations and consumer activity has been severely limited by government restrictions. We expect these trends to continue throughout the second quarter as restrictions remain in place across much of the globe. We anticipate being profitable in Q2, provided that our revenue development follows the trends we've been seeing so far. We've taken near-term measures to defer discretionary expenses, prioritize uses of cash for critical CapEx and acquisitions, and we've sharpened our focus in R&D. We look forward to providing annual guidance once economic volatility subsides and when consumer behaviors are better understood after restrictions are eased and the crisis passes.  
That concludes my remarks. Next, Doug will walk us through additional details on our financial results. Doug?"

I'd like to begin by reviewing our first quarter financial results, move to comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. We posted revenue of $856 million for the first quarter, representing a 12% in",493,"Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin by reviewing our first quarter financial results, move to comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. We posted revenue of $856 million for the first quarter, representing a 12% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 59.2%, a 20 basis point increase from the prior year. Operating expense as a percentage of sales was 38.5%, a 70 basis point decrease from the prior year. Operating income was $177 million, a 17% increase year-over-year. Operating margin was 20.7%, a 90 basis point increase from the prior year. Our GAAP EPS was $0.84 and pro forma EPS was $0.91.  
Next, to look at our first quarter revenue by segment, we achieved record first quarter revenue of $856 million, with 4 of our 5 segments posting double-digit growth. As seen in the charts, we have a diversified business model from both a segment and geography perspective.  
Looking next, operating expenses. First quarter operating expenses increased by $29 million or 10%. Research and development increased $19 million year-over-year, investments in engineering resources, incremental costs associated with recent acquisitions. Advertising expense decreased approximately $1 million from the prior year quarter. SG&A increased $10 million compared to prior year quarter, but decreased as a percentage of sales to 16%, 60 basis point decrease compared to the prior year. Increase was primarily due to personnel-related expenses, incremental costs associated with recent acquisitions. As Cliff mentioned, we're implementing expense control measures to defer discretionary spending and sharpening our focus in R&D.  
A few highlights on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $2.6 billion and no debt. Accounts receivable decreased sequentially to $500 million on a seasonally strong fourth quarter, increased year-over-year in line with first quarter sales. Inventory balance increased on both a sequential year-over-year basis as we have been preparing for the seasonally strong second quarter. We are aligning production levels and inventory with anticipated demand. However, we expect incremental increases in inventory in the near term as it takes time to scale supply chain around near-term demand.  
During the first quarter of 2020, we generated free cash flow of $185 million, $50 million increase for the prior year quarter. We took another look at our capital expenditures and now expect 2020 annual cap expenditures to be approximately $140 million. 2 key capital expenditure projects for 2020 were the Tacx manufacturing facility and the auto OEM manufacturing facility in Europe. Also during the quarter, we paid dividends of $109 million. Turning an attractive dividend to our shareholders is one of current priorities for cash.  
In the first quarter of 2020, we reported an effective tax rate of 9.3% compared to 15.7% in the prior year quarter. The decrease is primarily due to the migration of intellectual property ownership from Switzerland to United States.  
This concludes our formal remarks. Jonathan, can you please open the line for Q&A."

About 70-plus percent of our revenue came from literally one product line. And we were not as well diversified then as we are now in terms of facing a crisis. So we had a lot to worry about at that time, and we were facing also not only an economic crisis, but a declining market. I feel like things are totally different now. Our company is very well diversified. And our product lines target all of the areas where we believe people are going to have a lot of interest in, especially as these restrictions are removed.  
So one thing we learned in the past is that, certainly, you have to have great new products. You have to be able to continue to invest. We're doing all of those things today, but we're a much different company than we were back then.  
In terms of how things develop for guidance, as I mentioned, we're going to be looking for changes around these restrictions. I think there's still a lot of uncertainty that's happening as every locale seems to have a different approach to removing restrictions. And every locale has a different approach when it comes to how much things they allow so all of these things probably impact consumer behavior. That's a big wildcard. And then just trying to see how the economic volatility shakes out once we get a feel for that, we believe we'll be in a good position to be able to predict the business going forward."

And also as it relates to advertising, with the lower demand there, we're flexing our advertising down in response to some of that lower demand that's out there. 
And as it relates to CapEx, it was previously mentioned that we took a look at all of our CapEx also and making sure that's all the critical CapEx we have. So relates to Q2, looking at each one of those, probably R&D and SG&A, I probably expect that to probably be up dollar amount year-over-year just due to our analyzing -- or annualizing some of the 2019 headcount additions.

So we're encouraged by that.

So this has hindered the access to marine products. And generally, we've seen very strong end-user demand for the products.

So again, it's kind of a mixed bag. We would expect things to get better, as you say, as states open up for boating. Michigan has been a big one. You mentioned New York. That's also been a big one. We hope that boats can come out of storage soon. And we are hearing from the field that customers are excited about equipping their boats and getting them on the water. 
In terms of the opportunity going forward, we're very optimistic about marine. It's a great market.

So we were super strong. We believe that's encouraging because, again, our product lines are very strong, and our business in general had a lot of momentum. 
In terms of retailer behavior, even when times are good, they don't try to over index on inventory. I think they're very cautious. They have a certain amount of open-to-buy dollars. So it isn't as if they had stocked up with a significant amount of inventory. I would say it was fairly manageable inventory levels.

Even now, many communities are actually losing their commercial airline service as airliners scale back. And so the only options for getting certain kinds of transportation is through general aviation.

In '08 and '09, the production capacity was so high that when the pullback occurred, there was simply no way to sustain that kind of production capacity in marine products. And so the marine market, especially the OEMs, felt a significant impact from the reduction in demand. There was also a lot of crazy financing going on with boats. And so the overall financial situation of people buying boats and the financers that were financing the boats was very, very precarious. Rolling forward to where we are today, the boat market has slowly recovered from those lows. And so it hasn't overbuilt in the same way that it was back in '08 and '09. And the kinds of products that are being offered are in the bell curve of where demand still exists, tends to be in those mid-range center console type of boats that still remain popular. And many of our OEM partners that are shut down right now are very anxious to go back to work because they have customers that want their boats, that have ordered them and are anxious to get them. 
So we're optimistic about that. We don't think it's the same situation. But I would also say that anytime there's economic shocks, that will take a certain number of customers out of the market. So there's bound to be some impact, but we hope it's not as bad as what it was before."

Gross margin was stable to last year, an",1736,"Thank you, Teri, and good morning, everyone. First quarter of 2020 continued the strong momentum we experienced in the back half of last year. Revenue increased 12%, resulting in a new record for the first quarter. Gross margin was stable to last year, and operating margin expanded, resulting in operating income growth of 17%. Late in the quarter, the landscape changed as the COVID-19 outbreak became a global pandemic and governments responded with drastic measures to slow the spread of the virus. This resulted in unprecedented economic changes affecting every company, and Garmin is no exception. Accordingly, we are withdrawing our fiscal 2020 guidance. However, we are optimistic for the long-term as the markets we serve and the products we offer are well positioned to succeed in a post pandemic world. I'll explain why we are optimistic in just a moment. But first, I want to share a few insights on how Garmin is approaching the most significant health and economic crisis of our time. First, I'll highlight our business priorities. The global awareness of the coronavirus is recent, but its impact was felt much earlier when parts of Asia were dramatically affected by its emergence and rapid spread. Since the beginning, employee safety has been our top priority, starting in Asia and expanding as the virus spread to other regions of the world. Most of our employees can work from home. And we've taken steps to protect those who continue to work within our facilities. Our employees adapted to these new circumstances with speed and resilience, and I'm super proud of their response to this challenge.  
Our second priority has been to strengthen our supply chain. In the early days of the virus outbreak, our supply chain teams were working hard to ensure we would not be affected by the widespread industrial shutdowns that were occurring in Asia. I'm pleased to report that our supply chain is healthy, and we've not missed any opportunities due to COVID-19-related disruptions. This is remarkable considering the unprecedented disruption occurring in global supply chains.  
Our third priority is to focus on opportunities. The crisis is often defined by its challenges, but we are looking through the lens of opportunity. We've accelerated efforts to increase our mix of online sales with business partners and on garmin.com. We have plenty of inventory, allowing us to capture market share.
And finally, we'll be using this opportunity to refine our product road map priorities to make sure we have the right products now and after the crisis fades.  
Next, I will talk about the leadership model we've embraced during this time of global crisis and unprecedented disruption. First, we think to choose positively. In the contrast -- constant rumble of negative unthinkable headlines, there are positive thinking, things happening all over Garmin. All of us wonder what the new normal will be. No matter what happens, I feel good about the markets we serve and the product lines we offer. We believe every business segment has a bright future.  
Second, we are responding accordingly. We recognize the world is facing the most significant health and economic crisis of our time. We understand it could take some time before the global economy recovers from the effects of the virus and the actions taken to control its spread. With this in mind, we're taking pragmatic steps to maintain our strong financial position.  
And finally, we're focused on the long term. In this dynamic environment, aiming at what we see today will only cause us to miss the target. Instead, we're aiming for where we want to be when the crisis fades. Paraphrasing our company mission, we aspire to be an enduring company by creating superior products that are an essential part of our customers' lives. Our vision is to be a globally respected leader in every market we serve. We expect to emerge from this crisis as a stronger and more capable company. This isn't the first global crisis we faced, and it won't be our last. During each test, past and present, we rely on a set of unique strengths that help us through times of crisis.  
First, our highly diverse business model provides a rich set of opportunities and reduces our reliance on single markets and product lines. Each market we serve and each product line we offer has an important role to play, both now and in the future. We are also well diversified geographically with roughly half of our revenue generated in the Americas, 1/3 in Europe and the remainder from Asia Pacific. Our revenue diversity will help us capture opportunities as the pandemic evolves from region to region.  
Second, we are a vertically integrated company. We control our own supply chain and are not overly reliant on outside partners to produce and distribute our products. This gives us a high degree of flexibility, efficiency and effectiveness while operating in a highly dynamic business environment.  
And finally, we have a strong balance sheet with no debt and over $2.6 billion in cash and marketable securities.  
We're often asked why we maintain such a strong balance sheet, and our answer remains the same. Our balance sheet provides stability to our investors through our commitment to an attractive dividend and allows us to invest for the future when others are pulling back.  
In summary, our balance sheet is the cornerstone of our ability to face a crisis such as this. With these things in mind, I'd like to spend a few minutes providing a market update for each of our segments.  
Fitness had a strong quarter, driven by advanced wearables and our Tacx indoor bike trainers, which continue to experience strong demand during the current stay-at-home orders. A positive outcome of this crisis is the increasing focus on personal fitness, health and wellness. People recognize that good health is an important defense against contracting the virus. And they're looking for tools that can help them improve their health. Our fitness products are highly relevant today and will remain so in the future.  
Marine posted a strong first quarter, driven by our strong lineup of chartplotters and game-changing sonar technology. We were recognized as Supplier of the Year by Independent Boat Builders, Inc. for the second year in a row, and our sponsored anglers swept the top 3 spots at the recent 2020 Bassmaster Classic. Boating is an active lifestyle pursuit that promotes family time, relaxation and a sense of freedom. In the long term, we believe that the current crisis will increase consumer interest in boating and fishing. Certain restrictions have prevented some boats from coming out of storage as planned, which could impact the marine season. Once restrictions are eased, we expect to see strong demand for our products. Regardless of how things play out, we believe compelling innovation is driving market share gains, and we will continue to deliver innovation for the future.  
Outdoor posted strong operating results driven by adventure watches. Time in the outdoors is highly compatible with healthy social distancing. And we believe that interest in outdoor activities will increase in the future. We already have a great lineup of products that support a broad range of outdoor activities. And in coming months, we will strengthen our position by introducing compelling new products and new categories.  
Aviation delivered strong operating results for the first quarter. We saw additional growth in the ADS-B category but at a lower rate than last year, which was expected. Retrofit systems were strong, while OEM categories were roughly flat. The aviation market has been significantly impacted by the pandemic and economic damage caused by measures to contain the spread.  
First, travel has been brought to a near standstill by stay-at-home orders and international border closings. This has impacted both commercial and general aviation. Business confidence has been shaken by stock market volatility and rapidly declining economic activity. From history, we know that aviation takes longer to recover from severe economic shocks. Even so, we are optimistic about the future. We believe more people will seek transportation options that are secure, flexible and convenient. These are the enduring qualities that general aviation has been known for throughout the decades. We are ready for this opportunity with industry-leading cockpit systems for every aircraft from light sport airplanes to large business jets. We will continue to invest for the future. And disruptive new cockpit technologies are on the way.  
Revenue from auto decreased 17% in the first quarter, and the segment was essentially breakeven. The first quarter of the year is seasonally slower for our consumer products, and some of our top-performing OEM products are at a mature point of their life cycle. As I mentioned earlier, people will seek transportation options that are secure, flexible and convenient. For this reason, we believe personal autos will remain an important part of the future. To prepare for this opportunity, we've been making significant progress transforming ourselves to be a Tier 1 auto supplier. New vehicles are launching this year with Garmin hardware and software solutions, which will lead to revenue growth for the OEM category.  
In addition, we will be introducing new specialty product categories that will appeal to automotive adventurers.
Finally, I want to make a few remarks about our plans for guidance. The impact of the coronavirus and the economic damage caused by efforts to contain its spread are unprecedented. The ultimate outcome remains unpredictable, causing us to withdraw our fiscal 2020 guidance, as I mentioned earlier. While the long-term is difficult to predict, we want to share insights on what we have seen so far in Q2.  
On a consolidated basis, our April sales are trending about 40% lower than last year, as many retailers have curtailed operations and consumer activity has been severely limited by government restrictions. We expect these trends to continue throughout the second quarter as restrictions remain in place across much of the globe. We anticipate being profitable in Q2, provided that our revenue development follows the trends we've been seeing so far. We've taken near-term measures to defer discretionary expenses, prioritize uses of cash for critical CapEx and acquisitions, and we've sharpened our focus in R&D. We look forward to providing annual guidance once economic volatility subsides and when consumer behaviors are better understood after restrictions are eased and the crisis passes.  
That concludes my remarks. Next, Doug will walk us through additional details on our financial results. Doug?"

We posted revenue of $856 million for the first quarter, representing a 12% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 59.2%, a 20 basis point increase from the prior year. Operating expense as a percentage of sales was 38.5%, a 70 basis point decrease from the prior year. Operating income was $177 million, a 17% increase year-over-year. Operating margin was 20.7%, a 90 basis point increase from the prior year. Our GAAP EPS was $0.84 and pro forma EPS was $0.91.  
Next, to look at our first quarter revenue by segment, we achieved record first quarter revenue of $856 million, with 4 of our 5 segments posting double-digit growth. As seen in the charts, we have a diversified business model from both a segment and geography perspective.  
Looking next, operating expenses. First quarter operating expenses increased by $29 million or 10%. Research and development increased $19 million year-over-year, investments in engineering resources, incremental costs associated with recent acquisitions. Advertising expense decreased approximately $1 million from the prior year quarter. SG&A increased $10 million compared to prior year quarter, but decreased as a percentage of sales to 16%, 60 basis point decrease compared to the prior year. Increase was primarily due to personnel-related expenses, incremental costs associated with recent acquisitions. As Cliff mentioned, we're implementing expense control measures to defer discretionary spending and sharpening our focus in R&D.  
A few highlights on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $2.6 billion and no debt. Accounts receivable decreased sequentially to $500 million on a seasonally strong fourth quarter, increased year-over-year in line with first quarter sales. Inventory balance increased on both a sequential year-over-year basis as we have been preparing for the seasonally strong second quarter. We are aligning production levels and inventory with anticipated demand. However, we expect incremental increases in inventory in the near term as it takes time to scale supply chain around near-term demand.  
During the first quarter of 2020, we generated free cash flow of $185 million, $50 million increase for the prior year quarter. We took another look at our capital expenditures and now expect 2020 annual cap expenditures to be approximately $140 million. 2 key capital expenditure projects for 2020 were the Tacx manufacturing facility and the auto OEM manufacturing facility in Europe. Also during the quarter, we paid dividends of $109 million. Turning an attractive dividend to our shareholders is one of current priorities for cash.  
In the first quarter of 2020, we reported an effective tax rate of 9.3% compared to 15.7% in the prior year quarter. The decrease is primarily due to the migration of intellectual property ownership from Switzerland to United States.  
This concludes our formal remarks. Jonathan, can you please open the line for Q&A."

About 70-plus percent of our revenue came from literally one product line. And we were not as well diversified then as we are now in terms of facing a crisis. So we had a lot to worry about at that time, and we were facing also not only an economic crisis, but a declining market. I feel like things are totally different now. Our company is very well diversified. And our product lines target all of the areas where we believe people are going to have a lot of interest in, especially as these restrictions are removed.  
So one thing we learned in the past is that, certainly, you have to have great new products. You have to be able to continue to invest. We're doing all of those things today, but we're a much different company than we were back then.  
In terms of how things develop for guidance, as I mentioned, we're going to be looking for changes around these restrictions. I think there's still a lot of uncertainty that's happening as every locale seems to have a different approach to removing restrictions. And every locale has a different approach when it comes to how much things they allow so all of these things probably impact consumer behavior. That's a big wildcard. And then just trying to see how the economic volatility shakes out once we get a feel for that, we believe we'll be in a good position to be able to predict the business going forward."

And as it relates to CapEx, it was previously mentioned that we took a look at all of our CapEx also and making sure that's all the critical CapEx we have. So relates to Q2, looking at each one of those, probably R&D and SG&A, I probably expect that to probably be up dollar amount year-over-year just due to our analyzing -- or annualizing some of the 2019 headcount additions.

Some of our top products, even on our own website, are our marine products, which is somewhat counterintuitive because they're more complex and require installation, but people are buying those. 
So again, it's kind of a mixed bag. We would expect things to get better, as you say, as states open up for boating. Michigan has been a big one. You mentioned New York. That's also been a big one. We hope that boats can come out of storage soon. And we are hearing from the field that customers are excited about equipping their boats and getting them on the water. 
In terms of the opportunity going forward, we're very optimistic about marine. It's a great market.

In '08 and '09, the production capacity was so high that when the pullback occurred, there was simply no way to sustain that kind of production capacity in marine products. And so the marine market, especially the OEMs, felt a significant impact from the reduction in demand. There was also a lot of crazy financing going on with boats. And so the overall financial situation of people buying boats and the financers that were financing the boats was very, very precarious. Rolling forward to where we are today, the boat market has slowly recovered from those lows. And so it hasn't overbuilt in the same way that it was back in '08 and '09. And the kinds of products that are being offered are in the bell curve of where demand still exists, tends to be in those mid-range center console type of boats that still remain popular. And many of our OEM partners that are shut down right now are very anxious to go back to work because they have customers that want their boats, that have ordered them and are anxious to get them. 
So we're optimistic about that. We don't think it's the same situation. But I would also say that anytime there's economic shocks, that will take a certain number of customers out of the market. So there's bound to be some impact, but we hope it's not as bad as what it was before."

Revenue increased 12%, resulting in a new record for the first quarter. Gross margin was stable to last year, and operating margin expanded, resulting in operating income growth of 17%. Late in the quarter, the landscape changed as the COVID-19 outbreak became a global pandemic and governments responded with drastic measures to slow the spread of the virus. This resulted in unprecedented economic changes affecting every company, and Garmin is no exception. Accordingly, we are withdrawing our fiscal 2020 guidance. However, we are optimistic for the long-term as the markets we serve and the products we offer are well positioned to succeed in a post pandemic world.

First, I'll highlight our business priorities. The global awareness of the coronavirus is recent, but its impact was felt much earlier when parts of Asia were dramatically affected by its emergence and rapid spread. Since the beginning, employee safety has been our top priority, starting in Asia and expanding as the virus spread to other regions of the world. Most of our employees can work from home. And we've taken steps to protect those who continue to work within our facilities. Our employees adapted to these new circumstances with speed and resilience, and I'm super proud of their response to this challenge.  
Our second priority has been to strengthen our supply chain. In the early days of the virus outbreak, our supply chain teams were working hard to ensure we would not be affected by the widespread industrial shutdowns that were occurring in Asia. I'm pleased to report that our supply chain is healthy, and we've not missed any opportunities due to COVID-19-related disruptions. This is remarkable considering the unprecedented disruption occurring in global supply chains.  
Our third priority is to focus on opportunities. The crisis is often defined by its challenges, but we are looking through the lens of opportunity. We've accelerated efforts to increase our mix of online sales with business partners and on garmin.com. We have plenty of inventory, allowing us to capture market share.
And finally, we'll be using this opportunity to refine our product road map priorities to make sure we have the right products now and after the crisis fades.  
Next, I will talk about the leadership model we've embraced during this time of global crisis and unprecedented disruption. First, we think to choose positively. In the contrast -- constant rumble of negative unthinkable headlines, there are positive thinking, things happening all over Garmin. All of us wonder what the new normal will be. No matter what happens, I feel good about the markets we serve and the product lines we offer. We believe every business segment has a bright future.  
Second, we are responding accordingly. We recognize the world is facing the most significant health and economic crisis of our time. We understand it could take some time before the global economy recovers from the effects of the virus and the actions taken to control its spread. With this in mind, we're taking pragmatic steps to maintain our strong financial position.  
And finally, we're focused on the long term. In this dynamic environment, aiming at what we see today will only cause us to miss the target. Instead, we're aiming for where we want to be when the crisis fades. Paraphrasing our company mission, we aspire to be an enduring company by creating superior products that are an essential part of our customers' lives. Our vision is to be a globally respected leader in every market we serve. We expect to emerge from this crisis as a stronger and more capable company. This isn't the first global crisis we faced, and it won't be our last. During each test, past and present, we rely on a set of unique strengths that help us through times of crisis.  
First, our highly diverse business model provides a rich set of opportunities and reduces our reliance on single markets and product lines. Each market we serve and each product line we offer has an important role to play, both now and in the future. We are also well diversified geographically with roughly half of our revenue generated in the Americas, 1/3 in Europe and the remainder from Asia Pacific. Our revenue diversity will help us capture opportunities as the pandemic evolves from region to region.  
Second, we are a vertically integrated company. We control our own supply chain and are not overly reliant on outside partners to produce and distribute our products. This gives us a high degree of flexibility, efficiency and effectiveness while operating in a highly dynamic business environment.  
And finally, we have a strong balance sheet with no debt and over $2.6 billion in cash and marketable securities.  
We're often asked why we maintain such a strong balance sheet, and our answer remains the same. Our balance sheet provides stability to our investors through our commitment to an attractive dividend and allows us to invest for the future when others are pulling back.  
In summary, our balance sheet is the cornerstone of our ability to face a crisis such as this. With these things in mind, I'd like to spend a few minutes providing a market update for each of our segments.  
Fitness had a strong quarter, driven by advanced wearables and our Tacx indoor bike trainers, which continue to experience strong demand during the current stay-at-home orders. A positive outcome of this crisis is the increasing focus on personal fitness, health and wellness. People recognize that good health is an important defense against contracting the virus. And they're looking for tools that can help them improve their health. Our fitness products are highly relevant today and will remain so in the future.  
Marine posted a strong first quarter, driven by our strong lineup of chartplotters and game-changing sonar technology. We were recognized as Supplier of the Year by Independent Boat Builders, Inc. for the second year in a row, and our sponsored anglers swept the top 3 spots at the recent 2020 Bassmaster Classic. Boating is an active lifestyle pursuit that promotes family time, relaxation and a sense of freedom. In the long term, we believe that the current crisis will increase consumer interest in boating and fishing. Certain restrictions have prevented some boats from coming out of storage as planned, which could impact the marine season. Once restrictions are eased, we expect to see strong demand for our products. Regardless of how things play out, we believe compelling innovation is driving market share gains, and we will continue to deliver innovation for the future.  
Outdoor posted strong operating results driven by adventure watches. Time in the outdoors is highly compatible with healthy social distancing. And we believe that interest in outdoor activities will increase in the future. We already have a great lineup of products that support a broad range of outdoor activities. And in coming months, we will strengthen our position by introducing compelling new products and new categories.  
Aviation delivered strong operating results for the first quarter. We saw additional growth in the ADS-B category but at a lower rate than last year, which was expected. Retrofit systems were strong, while OEM categories were roughly flat. The aviation market has been significantly impacted by the pandemic and economic damage caused by measures to contain the spread.  
First, travel has been brought to a near standstill by stay-at-home orders and international border closings. This has impacted both commercial and general aviation. Business confidence has been shaken by stock market volatility and rapidly declining economic activity. From history, we know that aviation takes longer to recover from severe economic shocks. Even so, we are optimistic about the future. We believe more people will seek transportation options that are secure, flexible and convenient. These are the enduring qualities that general aviation has been known for throughout the decades. We are ready for this opportunity with industry-leading cockpit systems for every aircraft from light sport airplanes to large business jets. We will continue to invest for the future. And disruptive new cockpit technologies are on the way.  
Revenue from auto decreased 17% in the first quarter, and the segment was essentially breakeven. The first quarter of the year is seasonally slower for our consumer products, and some of our top-performing OEM products are at a mature point of their life cycle. As I mentioned earlier, people will seek transportation options that are secure, flexible and convenient. For this reason, we believe personal autos will remain an important part of the future. To prepare for this opportunity, we've been making significant progress transforming ourselves to be a Tier 1 auto supplier. New vehicles are launching this year with Garmin hardware and software solutions, which will lead to revenue growth for the OEM category.  
In addition, we will be introducing new specialty product categories that will appeal to automotive adventurers.
Finally, I want to make a few remarks about our plans for guidance. The impact of the coronavirus and the economic damage caused by efforts to contain its spread are unprecedented. The ultimate outcome remains unpredictable, causing us to withdraw our fiscal 2020 guidance, as I mentioned earlier. While the long-term is difficult to predict, we want to share insights on what we have seen so far in Q2.  
On a consolidated basis, our April sales are trending about 40% lower than last year, as many retailers have curtailed operations and consumer activity has been severely limited by government restrictions. We expect these trends to continue throughout the second quarter as restrictions remain in place across much of the globe. We anticipate being profitable in Q2, provided that our revenue development follows the trends we've been seeing so far. We've taken near-term measures to defer discretionary expenses, prioritize uses of cash for critical CapEx and acquisitions, and we've sharpened our focus in R&D. We look forward to providing annual guidance once economic volatility subsides and when consumer behaviors are better understood after restrictions are eased and the crisis passes.  
That concludes my remarks. Next, Doug will walk us through additional details on our financial results. Doug?"

I'd like to begin by reviewing our first quarter financial results, move to comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes.

I'd like to begin by reviewing our first quarter financial results, move to comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. We posted revenue of $856 million for the first quarter, representing a 12% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 59.2%, a 20 basis point increase from the prior year. Operating expense as a percentage of sales was 38.5%, a 70 basis point decrease from the prior year. Operating income was $177 million, a 17% increase year-over-year. Operating margin was 20.7%, a 90 basis point increase from the prior year. Our GAAP EPS was $0.84 and pro forma EPS was $0.91.  
Next, to look at our first quarter revenue by segment, we achieved record first quarter revenue of $856 million, with 4 of our 5 segments posting double-digit growth. As seen in the charts, we have a diversified business model from both a segment and geography perspective.  
Looking next, operating expenses. First quarter operating expenses increased by $29 million or 10%. Research and development increased $19 million year-over-year, investments in engineering resources, incremental costs associated with recent acquisitions. Advertising expense decreased approximately $1 million from the prior year quarter. SG&A increased $10 million compared to prior year quarter, but decreased as a percentage of sales to 16%, 60 basis point decrease compared to the prior year. Increase was primarily due to personnel-related expenses, incremental costs associated with recent acquisitions. As Cliff mentioned, we're implementing expense control measures to defer discretionary spending and sharpening our focus in R&D.  
A few highlights on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $2.6 billion and no debt. Accounts receivable decreased sequentially to $500 million on a seasonally strong fourth quarter, increased year-over-year in line with first quarter sales. Inventory balance increased on both a sequential year-over-year basis as we have been preparing for the seasonally strong second quarter. We are aligning production levels and inventory with anticipated demand. However, we expect incremental increases in inventory in the near term as it takes time to scale supply chain around near-term demand.  
During the first quarter of 2020, we generated free cash flow of $185 million, $50 million increase for the prior year quarter. We took another look at our capital expenditures and now expect 2020 annual cap expenditures to be approximately $140 million. 2 key capital expenditure projects for 2020 were the Tacx manufacturing facility and the auto OEM manufacturing facility in Europe. Also during the quarter, we paid dividends of $109 million. Turning an attractive dividend to our shareholders is one of current priorities for cash.  
In the first quarter of 2020, we reported an effective tax rate of 9.3% compared to 15.7% in the prior year quarter. The decrease is primarily due to the migration of intellectual property ownership from Switzerland to United States.  
This concludes our formal remarks. Jonathan, can you please open the line for Q&A."

About 70-plus percent of our revenue came from literally one product line. And we were not as well diversified then as we are now in terms of facing a crisis. So we had a lot to worry about at that time, and we were facing also not only an economic crisis, but a declining market. I feel like things are totally different now. Our company is very well diversified. And our product lines target all of the areas where we believe people are going to have a lot of interest in, especially as these restrictions are removed.  
So one thing we learned in the past is that, certainly, you have to have great new products. You have to be able to continue to invest. We're doing all of those things today, but we're a much different company than we were back then.  
In terms of how things develop for guidance, as I mentioned, we're going to be looking for changes around these restrictions. I think there's still a lot of uncertainty that's happening as every locale seems to have a different approach to removing restrictions. And every locale has a different approach when it comes to how much things they allow so all of these things probably impact consumer behavior. That's a big wildcard. And then just trying to see how the economic volatility shakes out once we get a feel for that, we believe we'll be in a good position to be able to predict the business going forward."

And as it relates to CapEx, it was previously mentioned that we took a look at all of our CapEx also and making sure that's all the critical CapEx we have.

But we see encouraging signs in those countries where the virus has either been well controlled and restrictions are lifting or they haven't yet had the kind of spread that other countries have had."

Depending on the locale and the retailer, some retailers are doing very well and some have had to operate under more restrictive circumstances even closing their stores. So this has hindered the access to marine products. And generally, we've seen very strong end-user demand for the products. Some of our top products, even on our own website, are our marine products, which is somewhat counterintuitive because they're more complex and require installation, but people are buying those. 
So again, it's kind of a mixed bag. We would expect things to get better, as you say, as states open up for boating. Michigan has been a big one. You mentioned New York. That's also been a big one. We hope that boats can come out of storage soon. And we are hearing from the field that customers are excited about equipping their boats and getting them on the water. 
In terms of the opportunity going forward, we're very optimistic about marine. It's a great market. I think a crisis like this when people are evaluating priorities, they tend to turn to things that inspire them, and I think boating and fishing is one of those things that we'll see a benefit in the future from people's evaluation of their priorities."

And the kinds of products that are being offered are in the bell curve of where demand still exists, tends to be in those mid-range center console type of boats that still remain popular. And many of our OEM partners that are shut down right now are very anxious to go back to work because they have customers that want their boats, that have ordered them and are anxious to get them. 
So we're optimistic about that. We don't think it's the same situation. But I would also say that anytime there's economic shocks, that will take a certain number of customers out of the market. So there's bound to be some impact, but we hope it's not as bad as what it was before."

As announced earlier today, Garmin reported strong second quarter financial results during a period of extreme uncertainty created by the COVID-19 pandemic. As reported last time, the onset of the coronavirus pandemic and measures taken to control the spread of the virus had a significant impact on the economy, on retailers and consumers. The month of April was particularly challenging for every business, including Garmin. However, conditions steadily improved, and we ended the quarter with significant growth momentum. 
Consolidated revenue came in at $870 million, down only 9% on a year-over-year basis. We experienced strong growth from certain online channels, including garmin.com, which partially offset weakness from retailers who were disrupted during the early phases of the pandemic. We also delivered strong profitability. Gross margin was 59.3%. Operating margin was 21.7%, with operating income of $188 million for the quarter. This resulted in GAAP EPS of $0.96 and pro forma EPS of $0.91 for the quarter. Doug will provide additional financial details in a moment, but first, I'd like to make a few remarks on the performance of our business segments. 
Starting with the fitness segment, revenue increased 17%, driven by strong consumer interest in health and fitness. Sales of advanced wearables and cycling products were very strong in the quarter. Gross and operating margins were 53% and 24%, respectively. 
We recently acquired Firstbeat Analytics, our long time partner and leading provider of physiological analytics technology for health, fitness and athletic performance. This acquisition will help us achieve even greater levels of innovation that will benefit consumers. Looking forward, we expect that the interest in health and fitness will remain very strong. We are ready to see this opportunity with a great lineup of new products with more new products on the way. 
Looking next at Marine. Revenue increased 4% as boating and fishing became popular past times during pandemic. Many boat builders were idle during the quarter, which tempered our growth, but retail sales were very strong, led by Chartplotters and Panoptix sonars. Gross and operating margins were 59% and 28%, respectively. During the quarter, we launched Quatix Solar, our first Marine smartwatch featuring solar charging technology. Looking forward, interest in our marine products remains very strong. We anticipate an extended marine season this year as boaters maximize their time on the water and boat builders work through production backlogs. Additionally, we intend to leverage our compelling product lineup to capture additional market share. 
Turning next to the outdoor segment. Revenue decreased 2%. Weakness in traditional handheld categories was mostly offset by growth in adventure watches. Gross margin and operating margin were 65% and 33%, respectively. We recently incorporated solar charging technology into the fenix 6, the 6S, the Instinct line and Tactix delta smartwatches. The Instinct solar sets a new standard in low power technology by achieving unlimited smartwatch operation using only the energy harvested from the sun. We expect that our solar harvesting technology will be a significant differentiator for us in the smartwatch market. 
Interest in Adventure and outdoor activity remains very strong. We are ready to seize this opportunity with a great lineup of recently introduced products with more new products and new categories on the pad. 
Turning next to the aviation segment. Revenue decreased 31% as the pandemic created economic uncertainty that negatively impacted OEM partners and retrofit activity. In addition, sales of ADS-B products rapidly declined, as we expected, after the U.S. mandate passed and the market matured. Gross and operating margins were 73% and 12%, respectively. 
During the quarter, Autoland was certified, marking the beginning of a new era for general aviation safety technology. Autoland is already available and flying on the Piper M600 and Daher TVN 940, and additional certifications are on the way. For the remainder of the year, we anticipate aviation will continue to face challenging headwinds. However, we remain confident in the long-term outlook for the segment as interest in general aviation remains high and we are prepared with a strong lineup of products for every aircraft application. In addition, we believe that advanced safety technologies such as Autoland will make general aviation accessible to more people, which in turn is expected to grow the market. 
Finally, for the auto segment, revenue decreased 46% as automakers idle their factories and driving activity decreased significantly. Gross margin was 47%, with an operating loss of $10 million in the quarter, driven by the investment we are making to complete several significant programs. Specialty RV and truck categories were a bright spot during the quarter. We launched several products, including new diesel navigators with oversized displays and enhanced routing features and our new RB 890 Navigator designed specifically for the needs of the RV and camping lifestyle. Looking forward, we anticipate that revenue from OEM products will grow in the back half of the year as we complete several OEM programs. Additionally, we continue to invest in specialty products and expect to enter new market verticals soon. 
And finally, most of you are aware of the recent cyber attack that led to a network outage affecting much of our website and consumer-facing applications. We immediately assess the nature of the attack and started remediation efforts. We have no indication that any customer data was accessed, lost or stolen. Additionally, the functionality of Garmin products was not affected other than the ability to access some online services. Critical affected business systems have been restored, and we expect to restore remaining systems in the coming days. We appreciate the patience and kind words of support we've received from customers and friends during this challenge. 
So that concludes my remarks. Next, Doug will walk us through additional details on financial results. Doug?"

Good morning, everyone. I begin by reviewing our second quarter financial results, [ due to ] comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes posted revenue of $870 million for the second quarter, representing a 9% decrease year-over-year. Gross margin was 59.3%, 100 basis point decrease in the prior year. Operating expense as a percentage of sales was 37.6%, [ 420 ] basis point increase from the prior year. Operating income was $188 million, a 26% decrease year-over-year. Operating margin was 21.7%, 510 basis point decrease from the prior year. Our GAAP EPS was $0.96. Pro forma EPS was $0.91. 
Next, we look at our second quarter revenue by segment. We achieved revenue of $870 million with 2 of our 5 segments posting growth, led by the fitness segment with strong revenue growth of In 17%. In the similar charts, we have a diversified business model for both a segment and geography perspective. 
Looking at our year-to-date revenue for the first 6 months of 2020. Our consolidated revenue was flat to the prior year, with [ 2 ] of our segments posting growth, led by fitness with 20% growth; marine, with 12% growth. Our geography, EMEA is up 6%; Americas is flat compared to the prior year. 
Looking next, operating expenses. Our second quarter operating expenses increased by $8 million or 2%. Research and development increased $17 million year-over-year, primarily due to investments in engineering resources. Advertising expenses decreased approximately $12 million from the prior year quarter due to lower media spend. SG&A increased $3 million compared to the prior year quarter, primarily due to increases in personnel-related expenses. 
A few highlights on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. We ended the quarter with cash, marketable securities of approximately $2.7 billion and no debt. Accounts receivable increased sequentially to $524 million, a decrease year-over-year in line with second quarter sales. Inventory balance increased on both a sequential year-over-year basis in our strategy to increase data supply, spore increasingly diversified product lines, timing of product launches, the transition to a higher percentage of ocean shipments compared to air. In the second quarter of 2020, we generated free cash flow of $142 million, $62 million increase from the prior quarter. In the second quarter 2020, we report an effective tax rate of 6.8%. Excluding the impact of a [ $14 ] million income tax benefit due to the release of uncertain tax position reserves associated with the 2014 intercompany restructuring, pro forma effective tax rate was 14% compared to 18.9% prior year quarter. The increase is primarily due to intellectual property migration transaction. 
This concludes our formal remarks. May, can you please open the line for Q&A.?"

From the boat builder side, they're not necessarily a source of inventory. They take products as they need them. But on the retail side of marine, sales have been very strong, and we've been working hard with our retail partners on the marine side to keep up with demand."

Of course, as a production and distribution business, there are certain people that always have to be here. But for the most part, they were at home. We've since transitioned to about 1/3 of our associates being on site, and we've implemented protocols as we work here in our buildings across the world really for keeping safety. We're anticipating that this is a long-term deal. We're not rushing to get people back. But at the same time, we're also trying to focus on rotating people in and out of the facility to get them with their teammates to be able to interact and enjoy the dynamic environment that we have here at Garmin. 
In terms of OpEx impact, it's difficult to quantify, but I would say there's increased pressure for expenses, of course, as we provided more benefits for our associates to be able to manage some of the difficulties they've had in their personal life with schools and family members and also concerns for their own health. But in general, we feel like that's manageable, and we're happy and we're very pleased actually with how we've been able to work through this crisis so far."

And that's part of what we've mentioned in terms of gross margin. The freight costs were higher as we work to get products in place for retailers and opportunities that needed them. Specifically around cycling, definitely that has been an area of constraint when it comes to product availability, especially in tax products. Again, we have a strong backlog of those.

And as I mentioned in the earlier question that interest around charter and ownership in those class of aircraft is remaining firm. So we're excited about that. And we think even in the small aircraft side of things, there's more potential as people consider traveling by private aircraft as opposed to commercial aircraft. 
And then on your question with ADS-B, what inning are we in? We actually were in extra innings. So we felt like ADS-B performed in terms of overall market adaptation, much better than anyone predicted at the very beginning stages. And as we go forward, it doesn't mean that we sell 0 ADS-B products. We'll continue to sell ADS-B products to new aircraft. Of course, they all need that. And also as in the aftermarket, we expect that competitive systems will be upgraded. That's a market opportunity for us to take share. And of course, products, repairs and things that happen that require new systems. So it will be just an ongoing business going forward."

As announced earlier today, Garmin reported strong second quarter financial results during a period of extreme uncertainty created by the COVID-19 pandemic.

As announced earlier today, Garmin reported strong second quarter financial results during a period of extreme uncertainty created by the COVID-19 pandemic. As reported last time, the onset of the coronavirus pandemic and measures taken to control the spread of the virus had a significant impact on the economy, on retailers and our consumers. The month of April was particularly challenging for every business, including Garmin. However, conditions steadily improved, and we ended the quarter with significant growth momentum.  
Consolidated revenue came in at $870 million, down only 9% on a year-over-year basis. We experienced strong growth from certain online channels, including garmin.com, which partially offset weakness from retailers who were disrupted during the early phases of the pandemic. We also delivered strong profitability. Gross margin was 59.3%. Operating margin was 21.7%, with operating income of $188 million for the quarter. This resulted in GAAP EPS of $0.96 and pro forma EPS of $0.91 for the quarter. Doug will provide additional financial details in a moment, but first, I'd like to make a few remarks on the performance of our business segments.
Starting with the fitness segment, revenue increased 17%, driven by strong consumer interest in health and fitness. Sales of advanced wearables and cycling products were very strong in the quarter. Gross and operating margins were 53% and 24%, respectively.  
We recently acquired Firstbeat Analytics, our long time partner and leading provider of physiological analytics technology for health, fitness and athletic performance. This acquisition will help us achieve even greater levels of innovation that will benefit consumers. Looking forward, we expect that the interest in health and fitness will remain very strong. We are ready to see this opportunity with a great lineup of new products with more new products on the way.
Looking next at marine. Revenue increased 4% as boating and fishing became popular pastimes during the pandemic. Many boat builders were idle during the quarter, which tempered our growth, but retail sales were very strong, led by chartplotters and Panoptix sonars. Gross and operating margins were 59% and 28%, respectively. During the quarter, we launched quatix solar, our first marine smartwatch featuring solar charging technology. Looking forward, interest in our marine products remains very strong. We anticipate an extended marine season this year as boaters maximize their time on the water and boat builders work through production backlogs. Additionally, we intend to leverage our compelling product lineup to capture additional market share.
Turning next to the outdoor segment. Revenue decreased 2%. Weakness in traditional handheld categories was mostly offset by growth in adventure watches. Gross margin and operating margin were 65% and 33%, respectively. We recently incorporated solar charging technology into the fenix 6, the 6S, the Instinct line and tactix Delta smartwatches. The Instinct Solar sets a new standard in low power technology by achieving unlimited smartwatch operation using only the energy harvested from the sun. We expect that our solar harvesting technology will be a significant differentiator for us in the smartwatch market. Interest in adventure and outdoor activity remains very strong. We are ready to seize this opportunity with a great lineup of recently introduced products with more new products and new categories on the way.  
Turning next to the aviation segment. Revenue decreased 31% as the pandemic created economic uncertainty that negatively impacted OEM partners and retrofit activity. In addition, sales of ADS-B products rapidly declined, as we expected, after the U.S. mandate passed and the market matured. Gross and operating margins were 73% and 12%, respectively. During the quarter, Autoland was certified, marking the beginning of a new era for general aviation safety technology. Autoland is already available and flying on the Piper M600 and Daher TBM 940, and additional certifications are on the way. For the remainder of the year, we anticipate aviation will continue to face challenging headwinds. However, we remain confident in the long-term outlook for this segment as interest in general aviation remains high and we are prepared with a strong lineup of products for every aircraft application. In addition, we believe that advanced safety technologies such as Autoland will make general aviation accessible to more people, which in turn is expected to grow the market.
Finally, for the auto segment, revenue decreased 46% as automakers idled their factories and driving activity decreased significantly. Gross margin was 47%, with an operating loss of $10 million in the quarter, driven by the investment we are making to complete several significant programs. Specialty RV and truck categories were a bright spot during the quarter. We launched several products, including new diesel navigators with oversized displays and enhanced routing features and our new RV 890 navigator designed specifically for the needs of the RV and camping lifestyle. Looking forward, we anticipate that revenue from OEM products will grow in the back half of the year as we complete several OEM programs. Additionally, we continue to invest in specialty products and expect to enter new market verticals soon.
And finally, most of you are aware of the recent cyber attack that led to a network outage affecting much of our website and consumer-facing applications. We immediately assessed the nature of the attack and started remediation efforts. We have no indication that any customer data was accessed, lost or stolen. Additionally, the functionality of Garmin products was not affected other than the ability to access some online services. Critical affected business systems have been restored, and we expect to restore remaining systems in the coming days. We appreciate the patience and kind words of support we've received from customers and friends during this challenge. 
So that concludes my remarks. Next, Doug will walk us through additional details on financial results. Doug?"

I'll begin by reviewing our second quarter financial results, move to comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes.

I'll begin by reviewing our second quarter financial results, move to comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. We posted revenue of $870 million for the second quarter, representing a 9% decrease year-over-year. Gross margin was 59.3%, 100 basis point decrease in the prior year. Operating expense as a percentage of sales was 37.6%, a [ 220 ] basis point increase from the prior year. Operating income was $188 million, a 26% decrease year-over-year. Operating margin was 21.7%, a 510 basis point decrease from the prior year. Our GAAP EPS was $0.96. Pro forma EPS was $0.91.  
Next, we look at our second quarter revenue by segment. We achieved revenue of $870 million with 2 of our 5 segments posting growth, led by the fitness segment with strong revenue growth of 17%. As seen in the charts, we have a diversified business model from both a segment and geography perspective.  
Looking at our year-to-date revenue for the first 6 months of 2020. Our consolidated revenue was flat to the prior year, with 2 of our segments posting growth, led by fitness with 20% growth; marine, with 12% growth. Our geography, EMEA is up 6%; Americas is flat compared to the prior year.  
Looking next, operating expenses. Our second quarter operating expenses increased by $8 million or 2%. Research and development increased $17 million year-over-year, primarily due to investments in engineering resources. Advertising expenses decreased approximately $12 million from the prior year quarter due to lower media spend. SG&A increased $3 million compared to the prior year quarter, primarily due to increases in personnel-related expenses.  
A few highlights on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $2.7 billion and no debt. Accounts receivable increased sequentially to $524 million, but decreased year-over-year in line with second quarter sales. Inventory balance increased on both a sequential year-over-year basis due to our strategy to increase data supply, sport increasingly diversified product lines, timing of product launches, the transition to a higher percentage of ocean shipments compared to air. In the second quarter of 2020, we generated free cash flow of $142 million, $62 million increase from the prior quarter. In the second quarter 2020, we report an effective tax rate of 6.8%. Excluding the impact of a $14 million income tax benefit due to the release of uncertain tax position reserves associated with the 2014 intercompany restructuring, our pro forma effective tax rate was 14% compared to 18.9% in the prior year quarter. The decrease is primarily due to intellectual property migration transaction.
This concludes our formal remarks. May, can you please open the line for Q&A?"

So we have been very careful as we've gone through this process to try to maintain a very safe workplace. At the beginning, we had most of our people at home. Of course, as a production and distribution business, there are certain people that always have to be here. But for the most part, they were at home. We've since transitioned to about 1/3 of our associates being on site, and we've implemented protocols as we work here in our buildings across the world really for keeping safety. We're anticipating that this is a long-term deal. We're not rushing to get people back. But at the same time, we're also trying to focus on rotating people in and out of the facility to get them with their teammates to be able to interact and enjoy the dynamic environment that we have here at Garmin.
In terms of OpEx impact, it's difficult to quantify, but I would say there's increased pressure for expenses, of course, as we provided more benefits for our associates to be able to manage some of the difficulties they've had in their personal life with schools and family members and also concerns for their own health. But in general, we feel like that's manageable, and we're happy and we're very pleased actually with how we've been able to work through this crisis so far."

As the pandemic evolved, of course, then everyone worried about the economic downturn. As things have come back, if anything, where we've had challenges in supply chain is keeping up with the demand. And that's part of what we've mentioned in terms of gross margin. The freight costs were higher as we work to get products in place for retailers and opportunities that needed them. Specifically around cycling, definitely that has been an area of constraint when it comes to product availability, especially in Tacx products. Again, we have a strong backlog of those. And also with cycling computers and those kinds of products, we are spending more on air freight as we try to get those into place at retailers.

In Americas, I would say that aviation impacted us more there than the consumer side of things. So Americas' performance, I feel, was very good.

So I would say the similarities to 2008 and '09 with regard to aviation business performance, in both cases, there was an economic shock that impacted the segment. But I think that's probably where the similarity ends. Back in 2008 and 2009, there was a significant oversupply of every kind of business jet. And so as the financial crisis developed and companies were pulling back, individuals we're pulling back, there's a lot of used aircraft on the market, which impacted valuations. And even to this day, there's probably still impact from that more than 10 years on. And I would say that this time, though, one of the positive things that we see is that activity in the light jet side of things, probably light and up to light medium jet is still very strong. And as I mentioned in the earlier question that interest around charter and ownership in those class of aircraft is remaining firm. So we're excited about that. And we think even in the small aircraft side of things, there's more potential as people consider traveling by private aircraft as opposed to commercial aircraft.
And then on your question with ADS-B, what inning are we in? We -- actually we're in the extra innings. So we felt like ADS-B performed in terms of overall market adaptation, much better than anyone predicted at the very beginning stages. And as we go forward, it doesn't mean that we sell 0 ADS-B products. We'll continue to sell ADS-B products to new aircraft. Of course, they all need that. And also as in the aftermarket, we expect that competitive systems will be upgraded. That's a market opportunity for us to take share. And of course, products, repairs and things that happen that require new systems. So it will be just an ongoing business going forward."

As announced earlier today, Garmin reported strong second quarter financial results during a period of extreme uncertainty created by the COVID-19 pandemic. As reported last time, the onset of the coronavirus pandemic and measures taken to control the spread of the virus had a significant impact on the economy, on retailers and our consumers. The month of April was particularly challenging for every business, including Garmin. However, conditions steadily improved, and we ended the quarter with significant growth momentum.  
Consolidated revenue came in at $870 million, down only 9% on a year-over-year basis. We experienced strong growth from certain online channels, including garmin.com, which partially offset weakness from retailers who were disrupted during the early phases of the pandemic. We also delivered strong profitability. Gross margin was 59.3%. Operating margin was 21.7%, with operating income of $188 million for the quarter. This resulted in GAAP EPS of $0.96 and pro forma EPS of $0.91 for the quarter. Doug will provide additional financial details in a moment, but first, I'd like to make a few remarks on the performance of our business segments.
Starting with the fitness segment, revenue increased 17%, driven by strong consumer interest in health and fitness. Sales of advanced wearables and cycling products were very strong in the quarter. Gross and operating margins were 53% and 24%, respectively.  
We recently acquired Firstbeat Analytics, our longtime partner and leading provider of physiological analytics technology for health, fitness and athletic performance. This acquisition will help us achieve even greater levels of innovation that will benefit consumers. Looking forward, we expect that the interest in health and fitness will remain very strong. We are ready to see this opportunity with a great lineup of new products with more new products on the way.
Looking next at marine. Revenue increased 4% as boating and fishing became popular pastimes during the pandemic. Many boat builders were idle during the quarter, which tempered our growth, but retail sales were very strong, led by chartplotters and Panoptix sonars. Gross and operating margins were 59% and 28%, respectively. During the quarter, we launched quatix solar, our first marine smartwatch featuring solar charging technology. Looking forward, interest in our marine products remains very strong. We anticipate an extended marine season this year as boaters maximize their time on the water and boat builders work through production backlogs. Additionally, we intend to leverage our compelling product lineup to capture additional market share.
Turning next to the outdoor segment. Revenue decreased 2%. Weakness in traditional handheld categories was mostly offset by growth in adventure watches. Gross margin and operating margin were 65% and 33%, respectively. We recently incorporated solar charging technology into the fenix 6, the 6S, the Instinct line and tactix Delta smartwatches. The Instinct Solar sets a new standard in low power technology by achieving unlimited smartwatch operation using only the energy harvested from the sun. We expect that our solar harvesting technology will be a significant differentiator for us in the smartwatch market. Interest in adventure and outdoor activity remains very strong. We are ready to seize this opportunity with a great lineup of recently introduced products with more new products and new categories on the way.  
Turning next to the aviation segment. Revenue decreased 31% as the pandemic created economic uncertainty that negatively impacted OEM partners and retrofit activity. In addition, sales of ADS-B products rapidly declined, as we expected, after the U.S. mandate passed and the market matured. Gross and operating margins were 73% and 12%, respectively. During the quarter, Autoland was certified, marking the beginning of a new era for general aviation safety technology. Autoland is already available and flying on the Piper M600 and Daher TBM 940, and additional certifications are on the way. For the remainder of the year, we anticipate aviation will continue to face challenging headwinds. However, we remain confident in the long-term outlook for this segment as interest in general aviation remains high and we are prepared with a strong lineup of products for every aircraft application. In addition, we believe that advanced safety technologies such as Autoland will make general aviation accessible to more people, which in turn is expected to grow the market.
Finally, for the auto segment, revenue decreased 46% as automakers idled their factories and driving activity decreased significantly. Gross margin was 47%, with an operating loss of $10 million in the quarter, driven by the investment we are making to complete several significant programs. Specialty RV and truck categories were a bright spot during the quarter. We launched several products, including new diesel navigators with oversized displays and enhanced routing features and our new RV 890 navigator designed specifically for the needs of the RV and camping lifestyle. Looking forward, we anticipate that revenue from OEM products will grow in the back half of the year as we complete several OEM programs. Additionally, we continue to invest in specialty products and expect to enter new market verticals soon.
And finally, most of you are aware of the recent cyber attack that led to a network outage affecting much of our website and consumer-facing applications. We immediately assessed the nature of the attack and started remediation efforts. We have no indication that any customer data was accessed, lost or stolen. Additionally, the functionality of Garmin products was not affected other than the ability to access some online services. Critical affected business systems have been restored, and we expect to restore remaining systems in the coming days. We appreciate the patience and kind words of support we've received from customers and friends during this challenge. 
So that concludes my remarks. Next, Doug will walk us through additional details on financial results. Doug?"

I'll begin by reviewing our second quarter financial results, move to comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes.

I'll begin by reviewing our second quarter financial results, move to comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. We posted revenue of $870 million for the second quarter, representing a 9% decrease year-over-year. Gross margin was 59.3%, 100 basis point decrease in the prior year. Operating expense as a percentage of sales was 37.6%, a [ 220 ] basis point increase from the prior year. Operating income was $188 million, a 26% decrease year-over-year. Operating margin was 21.7%, a 510 basis point decrease from the prior year. Our GAAP EPS was $0.96. Pro forma EPS was $0.91.  
Next, we look at our second quarter revenue by segment. We achieved revenue of $870 million with 2 of our 5 segments posting growth, led by the fitness segment with strong revenue growth of 17%. As seen in the charts, we have a diversified business model from both a segment and geography perspective.  
Looking at our year-to-date revenue for the first 6 months of 2020. Our consolidated revenue was flat to the prior year, with 2 of our segments posting growth, led by fitness with 20% growth; marine, with 12% growth. Our geography, EMEA is up 6%; Americas is flat compared to the prior year.  
Looking next, operating expenses. Our second quarter operating expenses increased by $8 million or 2%. Research and development increased $17 million year-over-year, primarily due to investments in engineering resources. Advertising expenses decreased approximately $12 million from the prior year quarter due to lower media spend. SG&A increased $3 million compared to the prior year quarter, primarily due to increases in personnel-related expenses.  
A few highlights on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $2.7 billion and no debt. Accounts receivable increased sequentially to $524 million, but decreased year-over-year in line with second quarter sales. Inventory balance increased on both a sequential year-over-year basis due to our strategy to increase data supply, sport increasingly diversified product lines, timing of product launches, the transition to a higher percentage of ocean shipments compared to air. In the second quarter of 2020, we generated free cash flow of $142 million, $62 million increase from the prior quarter. In the second quarter 2020, we report an effective tax rate of 6.8%. Excluding the impact of a $14 million income tax benefit due to the release of uncertain tax position reserves associated with the 2014 intercompany restructuring, our pro forma effective tax rate was 14% compared to 18.9% in the prior year quarter. The decrease is primarily due to intellectual property migration transaction.
This concludes our formal remarks. May, can you please open the line for Q&A?"

So we have been very careful as we've gone through this process to try to maintain a very safe workplace. At the beginning, we had most of our people at home. Of course, as a production and distribution business, there are certain people that always have to be here. But for the most part, they were at home. We've since transitioned to about 1/3 of our associates being on site, and we've implemented protocols as we work here in our buildings across the world really for keeping safety. We're anticipating that this is a long-term deal. We're not rushing to get people back. But at the same time, we're also trying to focus on rotating people in and out of the facility to get them with their teammates to be able to interact and enjoy the dynamic environment that we have here at Garmin.
In terms of OpEx impact, it's difficult to quantify, but I would say there's increased pressure for expenses, of course, as we provided more benefits for our associates to be able to manage some of the difficulties they've had in their personal life with schools and family members and also concerns for their own health. But in general, we feel like that's manageable, and we're happy and we're very pleased actually with how we've been able to work through this crisis so far."

As the pandemic evolved, of course, then everyone worried about the economic downturn. As things have come back, if anything, where we've had challenges in supply chain is keeping up with the demand. And that's part of what we've mentioned in terms of gross margin. The freight costs were higher as we work to get products in place for retailers and opportunities that needed them. Specifically around cycling, definitely that has been an area of constraint when it comes to product availability, especially in Tacx products. Again, we have a strong backlog of those. And also with cycling computers and those kinds of products, we are spending more on air freight as we try to get those into place at retailers. Cycling activities have been very popular with customers."

So APAC kind of is a different narrative from the other geographies. 
In Americas, I would say that aviation impacted us more there than the consumer side of things. So Americas' performance, I feel, was very good.

There was certainly impact because of the pandemic and everyone just pulling back because for a while, everyone was glued to news channels and websites, staying indoors and not doing much.

So I would say the similarities to 2008 and '09 with regard to aviation business performance, in both cases, there was an economic shock that impacted the segment. But I think that's probably where the similarity ends. Back in 2008 and 2009, there was a significant oversupply of every kind of business jet. And so as the financial crisis developed and companies were pulling back, individuals we're pulling back, there's a lot of used aircraft on the market, which impacted valuations. And even to this day, there's probably still impact from that more than 10 years on. And I would say that this time, though, one of the positive things that we see is that activity in the light jet side of things, probably light and up to light medium jet is still very strong. And as I mentioned in the earlier question that interest around charter and ownership in those class of aircraft is remaining firm. So we're excited about that. And we think even in the small aircraft side of things, there's more potential as people consider traveling by private aircraft as opposed to commercial aircraft.
And then on your question with ADS-B, what inning are we in? We -- actually we're in the extra innings. So we felt like ADS-B performed in terms of overall market adaptation, much better than anyone predicted at the very beginning stages. And as we go forward, it doesn't mean that we sell 0 ADS-B products. We'll continue to sell ADS-B products to new aircraft. Of course, they all need that. And also as in the aftermarket, we expect that competitive systems will be upgraded. That's a market opportunity for us to take share.

As announced earlier today, Garmin reported strong second quarter financial results during a period of extreme uncertainty created by the COVID-19 pandemic. As reported last time, the onset of the coronavirus pandemic and measures taken to control the spread of the virus had a significant impact on the economy, on retailers and our consumers. The month of April was particularly challenging for every business, including Garmin. However, conditions steadily improved, and we ended the quarter with significant growth momentum.  
Consolidated revenue came in at $870 million, down only 9% on a year-over-year basis. We experienced strong growth from certain online channels, including garmin.com, which partially offset weakness from retailers who were disrupted during the early phases of the pandemic. We also delivered strong profitability. Gross margin was 59.3%. Operating margin was 21.7%, with operating income of $188 million for the quarter. This resulted in GAAP EPS of $0.96 and pro forma EPS of $0.91 for the quarter. Doug will provide additional financial details in a moment, but first, I'd like to make a few remarks on the performance of our business segments.
Starting with the fitness segment, revenue increased 17%, driven by strong consumer interest in health and fitness. Sales of advanced wearables and cycling products were very strong in the quarter. Gross and operating margins were 53% and 24%, respectively.  
We recently acquired Firstbeat Analytics, our longtime partner and leading provider of physiological analytics technology for health, fitness and athletic performance. This acquisition will help us achieve even greater levels of innovation that will benefit consumers. Looking forward, we expect that the interest in health and fitness will remain very strong. We are ready to see this opportunity with a great lineup of new products with more new products on the way.
Looking next at marine. Revenue increased 4% as boating and fishing became popular pastimes during the pandemic. Many boat builders were idle during the quarter, which tempered our growth, but retail sales were very strong, led by chartplotters and Panoptix sonars. Gross and operating margins were 59% and 28%, respectively. During the quarter, we launched quatix solar, our first marine smartwatch featuring solar charging technology. Looking forward, interest in our marine products remains very strong. We anticipate an extended marine season this year as boaters maximize their time on the water and boat builders work through production backlogs. Additionally, we intend to leverage our compelling product lineup to capture additional market share.
Turning next to the outdoor segment. Revenue decreased 2%. Weakness in traditional handheld categories was mostly offset by growth in adventure watches. Gross margin and operating margin were 65% and 33%, respectively. We recently incorporated solar charging technology into the fenix 6, the 6S, the Instinct line and tactix Delta smartwatches. The Instinct Solar sets a new standard in low power technology by achieving unlimited smartwatch operation using only the energy harvested from the sun. We expect that our solar harvesting technology will be a significant differentiator for us in the smartwatch market. Interest in adventure and outdoor activity remains very strong. We are ready to seize this opportunity with a great lineup of recently introduced products with more new products and new categories on the way.  
Turning next to the aviation segment. Revenue decreased 31% as the pandemic created economic uncertainty that negatively impacted OEM partners and retrofit activity. In addition, sales of ADS-B products rapidly declined, as we expected, after the U.S. mandate passed and the market matured. Gross and operating margins were 73% and 12%, respectively. During the quarter, Autoland was certified, marking the beginning of a new era for general aviation safety technology. Autoland is already available and flying on the Piper M600 and Daher TBM 940, and additional certifications are on the way. For the remainder of the year, we anticipate aviation will continue to face challenging headwinds. However, we remain confident in the long-term outlook for this segment as interest in general aviation remains high and we are prepared with a strong lineup of products for every aircraft application. In addition, we believe that advanced safety technologies such as Autoland will make general aviation accessible to more people, which in turn is expected to grow the market.
Finally, for the auto segment, revenue decreased 46% as automakers idled their factories and driving activity decreased significantly. Gross margin was 47%, with an operating loss of $10 million in the quarter, driven by the investment we are making to complete several significant programs. Specialty RV and truck categories were a bright spot during the quarter. We launched several products, including new diesel navigators with oversized displays and enhanced routing features and our new RV 890 navigator designed specifically for the needs of the RV and camping lifestyle. Looking forward, we anticipate that revenue from OEM products will grow in the back half of the year as we complete several OEM programs. Additionally, we continue to invest in specialty products and expect to enter new market verticals soon.
And finally, most of you are aware of the recent cyber attack that led to a network outage affecting much of our website and consumer-facing applications. We immediately assessed the nature of the attack and started remediation efforts. We have no indication that any customer data was accessed, lost or stolen. Additionally, the functionality of Garmin products was not affected other than the ability to access some online services. Critical affected business systems have been restored, and we expect to restore remaining systems in the coming days. We appreciate the patience and kind words of support we've received from customers and friends during this challenge. 
So that concludes my remarks. Next, Doug will walk us through additional details on financial results. Doug?"

I'll begin by reviewing our second quarter financial results, move to comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes.

I'll begin by reviewing our second quarter financial results, move to comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. We posted revenue of $870 million for the second quarter, representing a 9% decrease year-over-year. Gross margin was 59.3%, 100 basis point decrease in the prior year. Operating expense as a percentage of sales was 37.6%, a [ 220 ] basis point increase from the prior year. Operating income was $188 million, a 26% decrease year-over-year. Operating margin was 21.7%, a 510 basis point decrease from the prior year. Our GAAP EPS was $0.96. Pro forma EPS was $0.91.  
Next, we look at our second quarter revenue by segment. We achieved revenue of $870 million with 2 of our 5 segments posting growth, led by the fitness segment with strong revenue growth of 17%. As seen in the charts, we have a diversified business model from both a segment and geography perspective.  
Looking at our year-to-date revenue for the first 6 months of 2020. Our consolidated revenue was flat to the prior year, with 2 of our segments posting growth, led by fitness with 20% growth; marine, with 12% growth. Our geography, EMEA is up 6%; Americas is flat compared to the prior year.  
Looking next, operating expenses. Our second quarter operating expenses increased by $8 million or 2%. Research and development increased $17 million year-over-year, primarily due to investments in engineering resources. Advertising expenses decreased approximately $12 million from the prior year quarter due to lower media spend. SG&A increased $3 million compared to the prior year quarter, primarily due to increases in personnel-related expenses.  
A few highlights on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $2.7 billion and no debt. Accounts receivable increased sequentially to $524 million, but decreased year-over-year in line with second quarter sales. Inventory balance increased on both a sequential year-over-year basis due to our strategy to increase data supply, sport increasingly diversified product lines, timing of product launches, the transition to a higher percentage of ocean shipments compared to air. In the second quarter of 2020, we generated free cash flow of $142 million, $62 million increase from the prior quarter. In the second quarter 2020, we report an effective tax rate of 6.8%. Excluding the impact of a $14 million income tax benefit due to the release of uncertain tax position reserves associated with the 2014 intercompany restructuring, our pro forma effective tax rate was 14% compared to 18.9% in the prior year quarter. The decrease is primarily due to intellectual property migration transaction.
This concludes our formal remarks. May, can you please open the line for Q&A?"

So we have been very careful as we've gone through this process to try to maintain a very safe workplace. At the beginning, we had most of our people at home. Of course, as a production and distribution business, there are certain people that always have to be here. But for the most part, they were at home. We've since transitioned to about 1/3 of our associates being on site, and we've implemented protocols as we work here in our buildings across the world really for keeping safety. We're anticipating that this is a long-term deal. We're not rushing to get people back. But at the same time, we're also trying to focus on rotating people in and out of the facility to get them with their teammates to be able to interact and enjoy the dynamic environment that we have here at Garmin.
In terms of OpEx impact, it's difficult to quantify, but I would say there's increased pressure for expenses, of course, as we provided more benefits for our associates to be able to manage some of the difficulties they've had in their personal life with schools and family members and also concerns for their own health. But in general, we feel like that's manageable, and we're happy and we're very pleased actually with how we've been able to work through this crisis so far."

So supply chain wise, I think the -- early in the pandemic, the focus was on supply chain continuity and maintaining the flow of components we needed for our business. As the pandemic evolved, of course, then everyone worried about the economic downturn. As things have come back, if anything, where we've had challenges in supply chain is keeping up with the demand. And that's part of what we've mentioned in terms of gross margin. The freight costs were higher as we work to get products in place for retailers and opportunities that needed them. Specifically around cycling, definitely that has been an area of constraint when it comes to product availability, especially in Tacx products. Again, we have a strong backlog of those. And also with cycling computers and those kinds of products, we are spending more on air freight as we try to get those into place at retailers. Cycling activities have been very popular with customers."

So APAC kind of is a different narrative from the other geographies. 
In Americas, I would say that aviation impacted us more there than the consumer side of things. So Americas' performance, I feel, was very good. And a similar story in Europe, although aviation's impact is lower there, but still was an impact. But in general, when you exclude that, I'm very pleased with the performance of those geographies."

In terms of advertising and what the dynamics are there, there are really 2 things. There was certainly impact because of the pandemic and everyone just pulling back because for a while, everyone was glued to news channels and websites, staying indoors and not doing much. But as things evolve, that quickly changed.

So I would say the similarities to 2008 and '09 with regard to aviation business performance, in both cases, there was an economic shock that impacted the segment. But I think that's probably where the similarity ends. Back in 2008 and 2009, there was a significant oversupply of every kind of business jet. And so as the financial crisis developed and companies were pulling back, individuals we're pulling back, there's a lot of used aircraft on the market, which impacted valuations. And even to this day, there's probably still impact from that more than 10 years on. And I would say that this time, though, one of the positive things that we see is that activity in the light jet side of things, probably light and up to light medium jet is still very strong. And as I mentioned in the earlier question that interest around charter and ownership in those class of aircraft is remaining firm. So we're excited about that. And we think even in the small aircraft side of things, there's more potential as people consider traveling by private aircraft as opposed to commercial aircraft.
And then on your question with ADS-B, what inning are we in? We -- actually we're in the extra innings. So we felt like ADS-B performed in terms of overall market adaptation, much better than anyone predicted at the very beginning stages. And as we go forward, it doesn't mean that we sell 0 ADS-B products. We'll continue to sell ADS-B products to new aircraft. Of course, they all need that. And also as in the aftermarket, we expect that competitive systems will be upgraded. That's a market opportunity for us to take share.

Earlier today, Garmin reported record third quarter operating results. Consolidated revenue exceeded $1.1 billion as strong demand for active lifestyle products fueled growth of 19% over the prior year. Gross margin was 60.2%. Operating income increased 21% year-over-year to $317 million and operating margin expanded to 28.6%. This resulted in GAAP EPS of $1.63 and pro forma EPS of $1.58 for the quarter, up 24% over the prior year. 
We are pleased with our performance so far in 2020, especially considering the unprecedented challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Trends in the business are stabilizing, which gives us confidence to provide fiscal 2020 guidance, which I will cover shortly. First, I'd like to offer a few remarks on the performance of each of our business segments. 
Starting with Marine. Revenue increased 54% as we experienced growth in multiple product categories, led by strong demand for chartplotters. Gross and operating margins were 61% and 31%, respectively, resulting in operating income growth of over 150%. There are 2 key factors driving these results. First, the market is expanding as new customers embrace boating and fishing. Second, our strong lineup of products and game-changing technologies are driving market share gains. 
We continue to be recognized for our innovation and achievements in the marine industry. For the sixth consecutive year, the National Marine Electronics Association named Garmin Manufacturer of the Year and we received 4 Product of Excellence awards. We were also recognized as one of the top 10 most innovative marine companies by Soundings Trade Only, a B2B news and information provider for the recreational boating industry. 
Looking forward, we anticipate that interest in boating and fishing will remain strong. We plan to capitalize on these trends by offering a compelling lineup of products with innovative features and disruptive technologies. 
Turning next to the Fitness segment. Revenue increased 35%, driven by strong demand for advanced wearables and cycling products. Gross and operating margins were 54% and 27%, respectively, resulting in operating income growth of 75% over the prior year. The pandemic continues to highlight the importance of living a healthy life, and our Fitness segment benefited from this trend. 
During the quarter, we launched the new Forerunner 745, expanding the features offered in our mid-tier multisport product range. We also launched Clipboard, an app that facilitates team training and performance monitoring using Garmin devices. 
In the Advanced Wellness category, we launched the Venu Sq, an entry-level smartwatch that combines daily wear style with industry-leading activity tracking and health monitoring features. 
Looking forward, we expect a broader trends in fitness and wellness to continue. We plan to leverage our recent acquisition of First Suite to offer products with unique health, wellness and fitness features. In addition, we intend to capitalize on the indoor cycling opportunity with our Tacx product line. 
Turning next to the Outdoor segment. Revenue increased 30% with strength in all major categories, led by strong demand for venture watches. Gross and operating margins were 67% and 44%, respectively, resulting in 40% operating income growth. The segment benefited from increased consumer interest in outdoor activities. 
inReach is an important technology that provides critical emergency and communication services in places where cell phones simply don't work. We recently added inReach to our popular Montana series and we announced that inReach has facilitated over 5,000 SOS incidents since its launch in 2011. This is a significant milestone, reflecting the important role inReach technology can play in changing outcomes. 
Looking forward, we expect the broader trends in outdoor to continue. We plan to leverage this opportunity by offering unique products that maximize the enjoyment of outdoor activity and adventure. 
Turning next to the Auto segment. Revenue decreased 6% as the decline in consumer P&D was partially offset by growth in specialty categories and revenue from new OEM programs. Gross and operating margins were 45% and 3%, respectively. The Auto segment continues to transform as we launch new specialty products like the Garmin Catalyst, an industry first real-time coaching tool designed to optimize track racing performance. New OEM projects are also making contributions and will further diversify the revenue mix in the segment. 
During the quarter, we began production shipments of the MGU 2020 computing module, marking the beginning of our relationship with BMW Automobiles as a Tier 1 supplier. In addition, we began shipments of the complete infotainment solution for the Daimler Vito van. 
Looking forward, we will continue to pursue growth opportunities in specialty product categories. In addition, we will be making major investments to complete OEM projects we have won in recent years, and we will continue to pursue new opportunities as a Tier 1 supplier of innovative electronic solutions for a broad range of vehicles. 
Looking finally at the Aviation segment, revenue decreased 19% due to lower revenue from OEM product categories and the expected decline of the ADS-B market. Gross and operating margins were 71% and 19%, respectively. While the OEM market has experienced some headwinds, we see positive signs in the smaller aircraft segment, especially in owner flown aircraft. In addition, when adjusting for the impact of ADS-B, we see encouraging sign lines in the retrofit market as aircraft owners take advantage of the latest cockpit technologies. 
During the quarter, Autoland achieved FAA certification on the Cirrus Vision Jet, which is the first jet aircraft to incorporate Autoland technology. This latest certification brings the Autoland equipped aircraft to 3 models, including the previously certified Piper M600 and the Daher TBM 940. 
Autoland is receiving notable recognition as an important new safety technology for general aviation. And Aviation Week Network recently selected Autoland as the Grand Laureate Winner for its achievement in the category of business aviation. 
Looking forward, we believe that the general aviation market will stabilize as impacts from the pandemic, the associated economic fallout, and the ADS-B mandate began to fade. We will continue to invest in compelling new products and technology in anticipation of the next chapter of growth for the general aviation market. 
In summary, I'm very proud of what Garmin associates have accomplished so far in 2020, while facing circumstances that no 1 could have anticipated just 1 year ago. Considering our growing confidence and business trends, we are issuing full year 2020 guidance. We now project revenue of approximately $4 billion as growth in marine, fitness and outdoor more than offset the expected declines in aviation and auto. We anticipate gross margin of approximately 59% and operating margin of approximately 24%, assuming a pro forma effective tax rate of 10%, pro forma earnings per share are expected to be approximately $4.70. 
Looking at full year 2020 revenue guidance by segment. We expect the Marine segment to grow 25%, the Fitness segment to grow 20% and the Outdoor segment to grow 15%. We expect the Aviation segment to decline 17%, and the Auto segment to decline 20%. 
So that concludes my remarks this morning. Next, Doug will discuss additional details on our financial results. Doug?"

I begin by reviewing our third quarter financial results, move to comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. We posted record revenue over $1.1 billion for the third quarter, representing 19% growth year-over-year. Gross margin was 60.2%, a 15 basis point decrease from the prior year. 
Operating expense as a percentage of sales was 31.6%, 110 basis point decrease from the prior year. Operating income was $317 million, a 21% increase year-over-year. Operating margin was 28.6%, 60 basis point increase from the prior year. Our GAAP EPS was $1.63 and pro forma EPS was $1.58, a 24% increase from the prior year period. 
Next, we look at our third quarter revenue by segment. We achieved revenue of over $1.1 billion with 3 of our 5 segments posting growth of 30% or more, led by the Marine segment with robust revenue growth of 54%. The by geography, we achieved 19% growth in Americas, EMEA and APAC. 
Looking at our year-to-date revenue for the first 3 quarters of 2020. Our consolidated revenue is up 7% with the prior year with 3 of 5 segments posting double-digit growth, led by the Fitness segment of 25% growth, followed closely by Marine segment with 24% growth. 
Looking next, operating expenses. Our third quarter operating expenses increased by $45 million or 15%. Research and development increased $26 million year-over-year, primarily due to investments in engineering resources. Our advertising expense increased by approximately $1 million due to higher spend in our Outdoor segment. SG&A increased $17 million compared to prior year quarter, primarily due to increases in information technology costs and personnel-related expenses. 
Let me highlight on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $2.7 billion and no debt. Accounts receivable increased sequentially to $658 million, an increase year-over-year in line with third quarter sales. Inventory balance increased on simple to sequential yearly basis compared for the seasonally strong fourth quarter, split on increasingly diversified product lines. 
During the third quarter of 2020, we generated free cash flow of $236 million, a $78 million increase from the prior year quarter. For full year 2020, we expect free cash flow to be approximately $750 million, approximately $175 million of capital expenditures. Also during the quarter, we paid dividends of $170 million. 
In third quarter 2020, we reported an effective tax rate of 6.9% compared to the effective tax rate of 11.6% in the prior year quarter. The decrease is primarily due to intellectual property migration transaction. We expect our full year 2020 pro forma effective tax rate to be approximately 10%. 
This concludes our formal remarks. So Al, could you please open the line for Q&A?"

The demand has been strong, and we did make adjustments coming out of the significant drop in activity associated with Q2 when all of the lockdowns took place. And since that time, we've been working hard to ramp back up to the levels needed to fill demand. I think we're doing okay. But the backlogs are very strong for us right now. So we're working hard to fill those. 
In terms of raw materials, we've mostly been okay. I would say there's a few shortages here and there. And especially as our forecast change to the upside, we have to deal with that situation within lead times from our suppliers, but we've had very good cooperation. We've been able to mostly get everything that we need. We rely on our safety stock, of course, in our business. So we do have inventories of things that we can continue to build products. And our vertical integration model is something that allows us to be flexible in what we build and when."

Earlier today, Garmin reported record third quarter operating results. Consolidated revenue exceeded $1.1 billion, as strong demand for active lifestyle products fueled growth of 19% over the prior year. Gross margin was 60.2%. Operating income increased 21% year-over-year to $317 million and operating margin expanded to 28.6%. This resulted in GAAP EPS of $1.63 and pro forma EPS of $1.58 for the quarter, up 24% over the prior year.
We are pleased with our performance so far in 2020, especially considering the unprecedented challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Trends in the business are stabilizing, which gives us confidence to provide fiscal 2020 guidance, which I will cover shortly. First, I'd like to offer a few remarks on the performance of each of our business segments. 
Starting with marine. Revenue increased 54%, as we experienced growth in multiple product categories, led by strong demand for chartplotters. Gross and operating margins were 61% and 31%, respectively, resulting in operating income growth of over 150%. There are 2 key factors driving these results. First, the market is expanding as new customers embrace boating and fishing. Second, our strong lineup of products and game-changing technologies are driving market share gains. 
We continue to be recognized for our innovation and achievements in the marine industry. For the sixth consecutive year, the National Marine Electronics Association named Garmin Manufacturer of the Year and we received 4 Product of Excellence awards. We were also recognized as one of the top 10 most innovative marine companies by Soundings Trade Only, a B2B news and information provider for the recreational boating industry. 
Looking forward, we anticipate that interest in boating and fishing will remain strong. We plan to capitalize on these trends by offering a compelling lineup of products with innovative features and disruptive technologies.
Turning next to the fitness segment. Revenue increased 35%, driven by strong demand for advanced wearables and cycling products. Gross and operating margins were 54% and 27%, respectively, resulting in operating income growth of 75% over the prior year. The pandemic continues to highlight the importance of living a healthy life, and our fitness segment benefited from this trend. 
During the quarter, we launched the new Forerunner 745, expanding the features offered in our mid-tier multisport product range. We also launched Clipboard, an app that facilitates team training and performance monitoring using Garmin devices. 
In the advanced wellness category, we launched the Venu Sq, an entry-level smart watch that combines daily wear style with industry-leading activity tracking and health monitoring features. 
Looking forward, we expect a broader trends in fitness and wellness to continue. We plan to leverage our recent acquisition of Firstbeat to offer products with unique health, wellness and fitness features. In addition, we intend to capitalize on the indoor cycling opportunity with our Tacx product line. 
Turning next to the outdoor segment. Revenue increased 30% with strength in all major categories, led by strong demand for adventure watches. Gross and operating margins were 67% and 44%, respectively, resulting in 40% operating income growth. The segment benefited from increased consumer interest in outdoor activities.
inReach is an important technology that provides critical emergency and communication services in places where cell phones simply don't work. We recently added inReach to our popular Montana series, and we announced that inReach has facilitated over 5,000 SOS incidents since its launch in 2011. This is a significant milestone, reflecting the important role inReach technology can play in changing outcomes. 
Looking forward, we expect the broader trends in outdoor to continue. We plan to leverage this opportunity by offering unique products that maximize the enjoyment of outdoor activity and adventure. 
Turning next to the auto segment. Revenue decreased 6% as the decline in consumer P&D was partially offset by growth in specialty categories and revenue from new OEM programs. Gross and operating margins were 45% and 3%, respectively. The Auto segment continues to transform as we launch new specialty products, like the Garmin Catalyst, an industry first real-time coaching tool designed to optimize track racing performance. New OEM projects are also making contributions and will further diversify the revenue mix in the segment.
During the quarter, we began production shipments of the MGU 2020 computing module, marking the beginning of our relationship with BMW automobiles as a Tier 1 supplier. In addition, we began shipments of the complete infotainment solution for the Daimler Vito van. 
Looking forward, we will continue to pursue growth opportunities in specialty product categories. In addition, we will be making major investments to complete OEM projects we have won in recent years, and we will continue to pursue new opportunities as a Tier 1 supplier of innovative electronic solutions for a broad range of vehicles. 
Looking finally at the aviation segment, revenue decreased 19% due to lower revenue from OEM product categories and the expected decline of the ADS-B market. Gross and operating margins were 71% and 19%, respectively. While the OEM market has experienced some headwinds, we see positive signs in the smaller aircraft segment, especially in owner flown aircraft. In addition, when adjusting for the impact of ADS-B, we see encouraging sign lines in the retrofit market as aircraft owners take advantage of the latest cockpit technologies. 
During the quarter, Autoland achieved FAA certification on the Cirrus Vision Jet, which is the first jet aircraft to incorporate Autoland technology. This latest certification brings the Autoland equipped aircraft to 3 models, including the previously certified Piper M600 and the Daher TBM 940. 
Autoland is receiving notable recognition as an important new safety technology for general aviation. And Aviation Week Network recently selected Autoland as the Grand Laureate Winner for its achievement in the category of business aviation. 
Looking forward, we believe that the general aviation market will stabilize as impacts from the pandemic, the associated economic fallout, and the ADS-B mandate began to fade. We will continue to invest in compelling new products and technology in anticipation of the next chapter of growth for the general aviation market. 
In summary, I'm very proud of what Garmin associates have accomplished so far in 2020, while facing circumstances that no one could have anticipated just 1 year ago. Considering our growing confidence and business trends, we are issuing full year 2020 guidance. We now project revenue of approximately $4 billion as growth in marine, fitness and outdoor more than offset the expected declines in aviation and auto. We anticipate gross margin of approximately 59% and operating margin of approximately 24%, assuming a pro forma effective tax rate of 10%, pro forma earnings per share are expected to be approximately $4.70.
Looking at full year 2020 revenue guidance by segment. We expect the marine segment to grow 25%, the fitness segment to grow 20% and the outdoor segment to grow 15%. We expect the aviation segment to decline 17% and the auto segment to decline 20%. 
So that concludes my remarks this morning. Next, Doug will discuss additional details on our financial results. Doug?"

I'd begin by reviewing our third quarter financial results, move comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. We posted record revenue over $1.1 billion for the third quarter, representing 19% growth",457,"Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. I'd begin by reviewing our third quarter financial results, move comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. We posted record revenue over $1.1 billion for the third quarter, representing 19% growth year-over-year. Gross margin was 60.2%, a 15 basis point decrease from the prior year. 
Operating expense as a percentage of sales was 31.6%, 110 basis point decrease from the prior year. 
Operating income was $317 million, a 21% increase year-over-year. Operating margin was 28.6%, 60 basis point increase from the prior year. Our GAAP EPS was $1.63 and pro forma EPS was $1.58, a 24% increase from the prior year period.
Next, we look at our third quarter revenue by segment. We achieved revenue of over $1.1 billion with 3 of our 5 segments posting growth of 30% or more, led by the marine segment with robust revenue growth of 54%. By geography, we achieved 19% growth in Americas, EMEA and APAC. 
Looking at our year-to-date revenue for the first 3 quarters of 2020. Our consolidated revenue is up 7% with the prior year with 3 of our 5 segments posting double-digit growth, led by the fitness segment, a 25% growth, followed closely by marine segment with 24% growth. 
Looking next, operating expenses. Our third quarter operating expenses increased by $45 million or 15%. Research and development increased $26 million year-over-year, primarily due to investments in engineering resources. Our advertising expense increased by approximately $1 million due to higher spend in our outdoor segment. SG&A increased $17 million compared to prior year quarter, primarily due to increases in information technology costs and personnel-related expenses.
Let me highlight on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $2.7 billion and no debt. Accounts receivable increased sequentially to $658 million, an increase year-over-year in line with third quarter sales. Inventory balance increased on both a sequential yearly basis compared for the seasonally strong fourth quarter, split on increasingly diversified product lines. 
During the third quarter of 2020, we generated free cash flow of $236 million, a $78 million increase from the prior year quarter. For full year 2020, we expect free cash flow to be approximately $750 million, approximately $175 million of capital expenditures. Also during the quarter, we paid dividends of $170 million. 
During third quarter 2020, we reported an effective tax rate of 6.9% compared to the effective tax rate of 11.6% in the prior year quarter. The decrease is primarily due to intellectual property migration transaction. We expect our full year 2020 pro forma effective tax rate to be approximately 10%.
This concludes our formal remarks. So Al, could you please open the line for Q&A?"

Earlier today, Garmin reported record third quarter operating results. Consolidated revenue exceeded $1.1 billion, as strong demand for active lifestyle products fueled growth of 19% over the prior year. Gross margin was 60.2%. Operating income increased 21% year-over-year to $317 million and operating margin expanded to 28.6%. This resulted in GAAP EPS of $1.63 and pro forma EPS of $1.58 for the quarter, up 24% over the prior year.
We are pleased with our performance so far in 2020, especially considering the unprecedented challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Trends in the business are stabilizing, which gives us confidence to provide fiscal 2020 guidance, which I will cover shortly. First, I'd like to offer a few remarks on the performance of each of our business segments. 
Starting with marine. Revenue increased 54%, as we experienced growth in multiple product categories, led by strong demand for chartplotters. Gross and operating margins were 61% and 31%, respectively, resulting in operating income growth of over 150%. There are 2 key factors driving these results. First, the market is expanding as new customers embrace boating and fishing. Second, our strong lineup of products and game-changing technologies are driving market share gains. 
We continue to be recognized for our innovation and achievements in the marine industry. For the sixth consecutive year, the National Marine Electronics Association named Garmin Manufacturer of the Year and we received 4 Product of Excellence awards. We were also recognized as one of the top 10 most innovative marine companies by Soundings Trade Only, a B2B news and information provider for the recreational boating industry. 
Looking forward, we anticipate that interest in boating and fishing will remain strong. We plan to capitalize on these trends by offering a compelling lineup of products with innovative features and disruptive technologies.
Turning next to the fitness segment. Revenue increased 35%, driven by strong demand for advanced wearables and cycling products. Gross and operating margins were 54% and 27%, respectively, resulting in operating income growth of 75% over the prior year. The pandemic continues to highlight the importance of living a healthy life, and our fitness segment benefited from this trend. 
During the quarter, we launched the new Forerunner 745, expanding the features offered in our mid-tier multisport product range. We also launched Clipboard, an app that facilitates team training and performance monitoring using Garmin devices. 
In the advanced wellness category, we launched the Venu Sq, an entry-level smart watch that combines daily wear style with industry-leading activity tracking and health monitoring features. 
Looking forward, we expect a broader trends in fitness and wellness to continue. We plan to leverage our recent acquisition of Firstbeat to offer products with unique health, wellness and fitness features. In addition, we intend to capitalize on the indoor cycling opportunity with our Tacx product line. 
Turning next to the outdoor segment. Revenue increased 30% with strength in all major categories, led by strong demand for adventure watches. Gross and operating margins were 67% and 44%, respectively, resulting in 40% operating income growth. The segment benefited from increased consumer interest in outdoor activities.
inReach is an important technology that provides critical emergency and communication services in places where cell phones simply don't work. We recently added inReach to our popular Montana series, and we announced that inReach has facilitated over 5,000 SOS incidents since its launch in 2011. This is a significant milestone, reflecting the important role inReach technology can play in changing outcomes. 
Looking forward, we expect the broader trends in outdoor to continue. We plan to leverage this opportunity by offering unique products that maximize the enjoyment of outdoor activity and adventure. 
Turning next to the auto segment. Revenue decreased 6% as the decline in consumer P&D was partially offset by growth in specialty categories and revenue from new OEM programs. Gross and operating margins were 45% and 3%, respectively. The Auto segment continues to transform as we launch new specialty products, like the Garmin Catalyst, an industry first real-time coaching tool designed to optimize track racing performance. New OEM projects are also making contributions and will further diversify the revenue mix in the segment.
During the quarter, we began production shipments of the MGU 2020 computing module, marking the beginning of our relationship with BMW automobiles as a Tier 1 supplier. In addition, we began shipments of the complete infotainment solution for the Daimler Vito van. 
Looking forward, we will continue to pursue growth opportunities in specialty product categories. In addition, we will be making major investments to complete OEM projects we have won in recent years, and we will continue to pursue new opportunities as a Tier 1 supplier of innovative electronic solutions for a broad range of vehicles. 
Looking finally at the aviation segment, revenue decreased 19% due to lower revenue from OEM product categories and the expected decline of the ADS-B market. Gross and operating margins were 71% and 19%, respectively. While the OEM market has experienced some headwinds, we see positive signs in the smaller aircraft segment, especially in owner flown aircraft. In addition, when adjusting for the impact of ADS-B, we see encouraging sign lines in the retrofit market as aircraft owners take advantage of the latest cockpit technologies. 
During the quarter, Autoland achieved FAA certification on the Cirrus Vision Jet, which is the first jet aircraft to incorporate Autoland technology. This latest certification brings the Autoland equipped aircraft to 3 models, including the previously certified Piper M600 and the Daher TBM 940. 
Autoland is receiving notable recognition as an important new safety technology for general aviation. And Aviation Week Network recently selected Autoland as the Grand Laureate Winner for its achievement in the category of business aviation. 
Looking forward, we believe that the general aviation market will stabilize as impacts from the pandemic, the associated economic fallout, and the ADS-B mandate began to fade. We will continue to invest in compelling new products and technology in anticipation of the next chapter of growth for the general aviation market. 
In summary, I'm very proud of what Garmin associates have accomplished so far in 2020, while facing circumstances that no one could have anticipated just 1 year ago. Considering our growing confidence and business trends, we are issuing full year 2020 guidance. We now project revenue of approximately $4 billion as growth in marine, fitness and outdoor more than offset the expected declines in aviation and auto. We anticipate gross margin of approximately 59% and operating margin of approximately 24%, assuming a pro forma effective tax rate of 10%, pro forma earnings per share are expected to be approximately $4.70.
Looking at full year 2020 revenue guidance by segment. We expect the marine segment to grow 25%, the fitness segment to grow 20% and the outdoor segment to grow 15%. We expect the aviation segment to decline 17% and the auto segment to decline 20%. 
So that concludes my remarks this morning. Next, Doug will discuss additional details on our financial results. Doug?"

I'd begin by reviewing our third quarter financial results, move comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. We posted record revenue over $1.1 billion for the third quarter, representing 19% growth",457,"Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. I'd begin by reviewing our third quarter financial results, move comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. We posted record revenue over $1.1 billion for the third quarter, representing 19% growth year-over-year. Gross margin was 60.2%, a 15 basis point decrease from the prior year. 
Operating expense as a percentage of sales was 31.6%, 110 basis point decrease from the prior year. 
Operating income was $317 million, a 21% increase year-over-year. Operating margin was 28.6%, 60 basis point increase from the prior year. Our GAAP EPS was $1.63 and pro forma EPS was $1.58, a 24% increase from the prior year period.
Next, we look at our third quarter revenue by segment. We achieved revenue of over $1.1 billion with 3 of our 5 segments posting growth of 30% or more, led by the marine segment with robust revenue growth of 54%. By geography, we achieved 19% growth in Americas, EMEA and APAC. 
Looking at our year-to-date revenue for the first 3 quarters of 2020. Our consolidated revenue is up 7% with the prior year with 3 of our 5 segments posting double-digit growth, led by the fitness segment, a 25% growth, followed closely by marine segment with 24% growth. 
Looking next, operating expenses. Our third quarter operating expenses increased by $45 million or 15%. Research and development increased $26 million year-over-year, primarily due to investments in engineering resources. Our advertising expense increased by approximately $1 million due to higher spend in our outdoor segment. SG&A increased $17 million compared to prior year quarter, primarily due to increases in information technology costs and personnel-related expenses.
Let me highlight on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $2.7 billion and no debt. Accounts receivable increased sequentially to $658 million, an increase year-over-year in line with third quarter sales. Inventory balance increased on both a sequential yearly basis compared for the seasonally strong fourth quarter, split on increasingly diversified product lines. 
During the third quarter of 2020, we generated free cash flow of $236 million, a $78 million increase from the prior year quarter. For full year 2020, we expect free cash flow to be approximately $750 million, approximately $175 million of capital expenditures. Also during the quarter, we paid dividends of $170 million. 
During third quarter 2020, we reported an effective tax rate of 6.9% compared to the effective tax rate of 11.6% in the prior year quarter. The decrease is primarily due to intellectual property migration transaction. We expect our full year 2020 pro forma effective tax rate to be approximately 10%.
This concludes our formal remarks. So Al, could you please open the line for Q&A?"

So it's an extraordinary year as people take advantage of time on the water.

And so we should also see a very strong Q4 for marine, unlike we've seen in past years as well."

Earlier today, Garmin reported record third quarter operating results. Consolidated revenue exceeded $1.1 billion, as strong demand for active lifestyle products fueled growth of 19% over the prior year. Gross margin was 60.2%. Operating income increased 21% year-over-year to $317 million and operating margin expanded to 28.6%. This resulted in GAAP EPS of $1.63 and pro forma EPS of $1.58 for the quarter, up 24% over the prior year.
We are pleased with our performance so far in 2020, especially considering the unprecedented challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Trends in the business are stabilizing, which gives us confidence to provide fiscal 2020 guidance, which I will cover shortly. First, I'd like to offer a few remarks on the performance of each of our business segments. 
Starting with marine. Revenue increased 54%, as we experienced growth in multiple product categories, led by strong demand for chartplotters. Gross and operating margins were 61% and 31%, respectively, resulting in operating income growth of over 150%. There are 2 key factors driving these results. First, the market is expanding as new customers embrace boating and fishing. Second, our strong lineup of products and game-changing technologies are driving market share gains. 
We continue to be recognized for our innovation and achievements in the marine industry. For the sixth consecutive year, the National Marine Electronics Association named Garmin Manufacturer of the Year and we received 4 Product of Excellence awards. We were also recognized as one of the top 10 most innovative marine companies by Soundings Trade Only, a B2B news and information provider for the recreational boating industry. 
Looking forward, we anticipate that interest in boating and fishing will remain strong. We plan to capitalize on these trends by offering a compelling lineup of products with innovative features and disruptive technologies.
Turning next to the fitness segment. Revenue increased 35%, driven by strong demand for advanced wearables and cycling products. Gross and operating margins were 54% and 27%, respectively, resulting in operating income growth of 75% over the prior year. The pandemic continues to highlight the importance of living a healthy life, and our fitness segment benefited from this trend. 
During the quarter, we launched the new Forerunner 745, expanding the features offered in our mid-tier multisport product range. We also launched Clipboard, an app that facilitates team training and performance monitoring using Garmin devices. 
In the advanced wellness category, we launched the Venu Sq, an entry-level smart watch that combines daily wear style with industry-leading activity tracking and health monitoring features. 
Looking forward, we expect a broader trends in fitness and wellness to continue. We plan to leverage our recent acquisition of Firstbeat to offer products with unique health, wellness and fitness features. In addition, we intend to capitalize on the indoor cycling opportunity with our Tacx product line. 
Turning next to the outdoor segment. Revenue increased 30% with strength in all major categories, led by strong demand for adventure watches. Gross and operating margins were 67% and 44%, respectively, resulting in 40% operating income growth. The segment benefited from increased consumer interest in outdoor activities.
inReach is an important technology that provides critical emergency and communication services in places where cell phones simply don't work. We recently added inReach to our popular Montana series, and we announced that inReach has facilitated over 5,000 SOS incidents since its launch in 2011. This is a significant milestone, reflecting the important role inReach technology can play in changing outcomes. 
Looking forward, we expect the broader trends in outdoor to continue. We plan to leverage this opportunity by offering unique products that maximize the enjoyment of outdoor activity and adventure. 
Turning next to the auto segment. Revenue decreased 6% as the decline in consumer P&D was partially offset by growth in specialty categories and revenue from new OEM programs. Gross and operating margins were 45% and 3%, respectively. The Auto segment continues to transform as we launch new specialty products, like the Garmin Catalyst, an industry first real-time coaching tool designed to optimize track racing performance. New OEM projects are also making contributions and will further diversify the revenue mix in the segment.
During the quarter, we began production shipments of the MGU 2020 computing module, marking the beginning of our relationship with BMW automobiles as a Tier 1 supplier. In addition, we began shipments of the complete infotainment solution for the Daimler Vito van. 
Looking forward, we will continue to pursue growth opportunities in specialty product categories. In addition, we will be making major investments to complete OEM projects we have won in recent years, and we will continue to pursue new opportunities as a Tier 1 supplier of innovative electronic solutions for a broad range of vehicles. 
Looking finally at the aviation segment, revenue decreased 19% due to lower revenue from OEM product categories and the expected decline of the ADS-B market. Gross and operating margins were 71% and 19%, respectively. While the OEM market has experienced some headwinds, we see positive signs in the smaller aircraft segment, especially in owner flown aircraft. In addition, when adjusting for the impact of ADS-B, we see encouraging sign lines in the retrofit market as aircraft owners take advantage of the latest cockpit technologies. 
During the quarter, Autoland achieved FAA certification on the Cirrus Vision Jet, which is the first jet aircraft to incorporate Autoland technology. This latest certification brings the Autoland equipped aircraft to 3 models, including the previously certified Piper M600 and the Daher TBM 940. 
Autoland is receiving notable recognition as an important new safety technology for general aviation. And Aviation Week Network recently selected Autoland as the Grand Laureate Winner for its achievement in the category of business aviation. 
Looking forward, we believe that the general aviation market will stabilize as impacts from the pandemic, the associated economic fallout, and the ADS-B mandate began to fade. We will continue to invest in compelling new products and technology in anticipation of the next chapter of growth for the general aviation market. 
In summary, I'm very proud of what Garmin associates have accomplished so far in 2020, while facing circumstances that no one could have anticipated just 1 year ago. Considering our growing confidence and business trends, we are issuing full year 2020 guidance. We now project revenue of approximately $4 billion as growth in marine, fitness and outdoor more than offset the expected declines in aviation and auto. We anticipate gross margin of approximately 59% and operating margin of approximately 24%, assuming a pro forma effective tax rate of 10%, pro forma earnings per share are expected to be approximately $4.70.
Looking at full year 2020 revenue guidance by segment. We expect the marine segment to grow 25%, the fitness segment to grow 20% and the outdoor segment to grow 15%. We expect the aviation segment to decline 17% and the auto segment to decline 20%. 
So that concludes my remarks this morning. Next, Doug will discuss additional details on our financial results. Doug?"

I'd begin by reviewing our third quarter financial results, move comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. We posted record revenue over $1.1 billion for the third quarter, representing 19% growth",457,"Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. I'd begin by reviewing our third quarter financial results, move comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. We posted record revenue over $1.1 billion for the third quarter, representing 19% growth year-over-year. Gross margin was 60.2%, a 15 basis point decrease from the prior year. 
Operating expense as a percentage of sales was 31.6%, 110 basis point decrease from the prior year. 
Operating income was $317 million, a 21% increase year-over-year. Operating margin was 28.6%, 60 basis point increase from the prior year. Our GAAP EPS was $1.63 and pro forma EPS was $1.58, a 24% increase from the prior year period.
Next, we look at our third quarter revenue by segment. We achieved revenue of over $1.1 billion with 3 of our 5 segments posting growth of 30% or more, led by the marine segment with robust revenue growth of 54%. By geography, we achieved 19% growth in Americas, EMEA and APAC. 
Looking at our year-to-date revenue for the first 3 quarters of 2020. Our consolidated revenue is up 7% with the prior year with 3 of our 5 segments posting double-digit growth, led by the fitness segment, a 25% growth, followed closely by marine segment with 24% growth. 
Looking next, operating expenses. Our third quarter operating expenses increased by $45 million or 15%. Research and development increased $26 million year-over-year, primarily due to investments in engineering resources. Our advertising expense increased by approximately $1 million due to higher spend in our outdoor segment. SG&A increased $17 million compared to prior year quarter, primarily due to increases in information technology costs and personnel-related expenses.
Let me highlight on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $2.7 billion and no debt. Accounts receivable increased sequentially to $658 million, an increase year-over-year in line with third quarter sales. Inventory balance increased on both a sequential yearly basis compared for the seasonally strong fourth quarter, split on increasingly diversified product lines. 
During the third quarter of 2020, we generated free cash flow of $236 million, a $78 million increase from the prior year quarter. For full year 2020, we expect free cash flow to be approximately $750 million, approximately $175 million of capital expenditures. Also during the quarter, we paid dividends of $170 million. 
During third quarter 2020, we reported an effective tax rate of 6.9% compared to the effective tax rate of 11.6% in the prior year quarter. The decrease is primarily due to intellectual property migration transaction. We expect our full year 2020 pro forma effective tax rate to be approximately 10%.
This concludes our formal remarks. So Al, could you please open the line for Q&A?"
