Let's start on Slide 5. We reported full year GAAP earnings of $2.79 per share compared to $2.50 per share earned in 2018. Adjusted earnings per share were $2.89 in 2019 compared to $2.54 per share a year ago. Th",1497,"Thanks, Lori, and good morning, everybody. Let's start on Slide 5. We reported full year GAAP earnings of $2.79 per share compared to $2.50 per share earned in 2018. Adjusted earnings per share were $2.89 in 2019 compared to $2.54 per share a year ago. The federal results were driven by reducing operating expenses, fewer shares outstanding and rate case outcomes, partially offset by higher depreciation and unfavorable weather. Our ability to overcome headwinds and execute our merger plan, particularly through the disciplined cost management allowed us to deliver consistently throughout the year. 2019 was successful on many fronts. Let me touch on a few of the highlights. We exceeded our 2019 net merger savings target of $110 million, ending the year at $150 million or 36% above target and drove our adjusted O&M down over 9% on a year-over-year basis. We raised our dividend by 6.3% to an indicated annual rate of $2.02 per share. We executed our capital allocation plan by investing $1.2 billion in infrastructure to maintain customer liability as well as continued our share repurchase program that was announced as part of our merger plan. We returned almost $2.1 billion in capital to our shareholders with $1.6 billion coming through share repurchases and another $463 million in the form of dividends. We elected plant and service accounting, or pizza in Missouri and initiated infrastructure spending that is incentivized by the legislation. We rebranded our operating utilities to provide consistency across our service territory and now all customers across Kansas and Missouri, know us as Evergy. We advanced our long-standing commitment to environmental stewardship and announced the new carbon reduction commitment that will reduce CO2 emissions 80% by 2050 from 2005 levels. We maintained our strong customer reliability metrics; and lastly, and importantly, we continue to build the Evergy culture by staying 2 of our 4 core values of safety, integrity, ownership and adaptability. I want to thank our entire team for their continued focus and teamwork on these accomplishments. 
Now looking at Slide 6. As discussed on our third quarter earnings call in November, we have been evaluating additional capital investment opportunities and believe that there were significant additional infrastructure investment opportunities in Missouri. With a full year of post-merger capital planning under our belts, we've used a rigorous allocation process to identify and prioritize projects that enhance grid reliability while reducing operations and maintenance expense. As a result of our work, we are announcing $1.5 billion of incremental infrastructure spending opportunities through 2024 in areas including renewable generation and grid modernization. This raises our 5-year CapEx plan from $6.1 billion to $7.6 billion. With pizza enacted in Missouri, which is designed to encourage enhanced infrastructure investment, majority of the incremental spend or approximately $1 billion will be directed towards pizza qualified project. This update to our capital plan will increase our rate base growth to 3% to 4% over this period relative to our prior guidance of 2% to 3%. This enables us to undertake critical investments that will improve the service we provide to our customers, while also delivering what we believe is a more attractive and balanced growth profile for our shareholders. With the increased capital investment, we have elected to halt the remainder of our share repurchase program. As of the end of 2019, we had completed 75% of our repurchase program, repurchasing $45 million of the 60 million share authorization, halting the final 15 million shares is expected to be credit positive and creates balance sheet capacity to make infrastructure investments. I want to reiterate that our overall objective of targeting competitive shareholder returns, maintaining reliability and keeping customer rights competitive has not changed. We believe our updated capital allocation strategy will drive greater benefits for our customers and communities from enhanced reliability and grid resiliency, while aligning with Missouri's initiative of building infrastructure and creating jobs. This is a true win-win across the board. 
Moving on to Slide 7. I'll update you on our merger savings. A large part of our merger thesis was built upon leveraging the synergies of neighboring service territories and creating value for all shareholders. At the time of our merger, both legacy companies had room for improvement from a cost perspective. Our progress, thus far, has already surpassed our original benchmarking. As I mentioned earlier, we've exceeded our estimated 2019 $110 million original net merger savings target by 36%, and we'll continue to focus on overachieving these original targets, which were established during our merger regulatory proceeding. We've identified additional opportunities for performance improvement. We've evaluated our benchmarking performance in 2018 and now have 2019 results. This has yielded a positive trend in our cost performance as we've seen a significant decline in our costs, particularly when adjusting for cost that were a result of the merger. To maintain the momentum of our positive cost trajectory, we'll continue to focus on opportunities to streamline, automate, digitize and otherwise enhance our processes and performance execution. While the merger provided a platform for synergies, our intensity around cost management remains paramount, as evidenced by our expected 5% to 8% OEM reduction in 2020. We continue to execute on the opportunities that were identified in the merger, and we'll continue to focus on future cost reduction opportunities. Our team is engaged in ongoing continuous improvement to drive value for our stakeholders through aggressive cost management. 
Now looking at Slide 8. Beyond our strong financial and operations results, we're continuing our focus on being good stewards of the environment. We've already reduced carbon emissions by 45% from the 2005 levels. And as we announced on our third quarter call, we expect to achieve at least 80% carbon reduction through natural retirements. However, we'll continue to evaluate and consider additional opportunities to execute on these plans sooner if possible and appropriate. As part of providing [indiscernible] energy to customers, we're continuously looking for new ways to make renewable energy available. As you may have seen in our recent press release, we've contracted 660 megawatts of wind to fulfill a large commercial and industrial customer demand on new special grain tariffs that we worked hard to put in place during our 2018 rate cases. The 4 announced Wind farms which were originally identified through the RFP process conducted right after our merger in late '18 will be added via purchase power agreement consistent with the tariffs in Missouri and Kansas. Again, as evidenced by our carbon target, we will continuously decarbonize our generation mix, consistent with providing reliable and affordable service to our customers and currently have included 500 million of rate-base renewables in our 5-year plan. Our next triennial, IRP filing in both changes and Missouri, is scheduled for 2021. This will be our first long filing as Evergy as well as our first time filing in Kansas. The green tariffs are an important economic development tool that our team has been marketing in order to retain top customers and attract large customers that otherwise may not locate in our service territory. Before I turn it over to Tony, I'd like to discuss the agreement we announced this morning with Elliott Management. As part of the agreement, Paul Keglevic, former Chief Executive Officer; Energy Future Holdings and Kirk Andrews, current Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of NRG Energy, have been appointed to the board as new independent directors. At the time of the 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders in May. The, size of the board will be reduced to 13 directors, following the retirement of 4 current Evergy directors. We will provide additional information regarding the 13 directors who will stand for election at the 2020 annual meeting in our proxy in the coming weeks. Further, we're forming a strategic review and operations committee, I will be on the committee along with [indiscernible], Paul Keglevic and Kirk Andrews, the committee will explore ways to enhance shareholder value. The committee plans to complete its review and make any relevant recommendations to the Evergy board in the first half of 2020. Given the mandate of the strategic review and operations committee, we will hold off on issuing current year and long-term earnings guidance while the committee conducts its review. While we expect to provide comprehensive updated guidance at the conclusion of the committee's work, we'll provide more details today regarding some of our expected 2020 drivers, including the enhanced capital plan. We welcome the new directors and the vast experience they bring in the utility and power industry to support the work we have underway and enhance long-term shareholder value and serve our customers, communities and employees. And Elliot recognizes our commitment to serve the best interest of all Evergy's stakeholders. We have an exciting opportunity in front of us as we look to build upon the momentum we've created since the merger closed in June of 2018, and we look forward to executing on the plan. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Tony."

I'll start with results on Slide 10 of the presentation. This morning, we reported fourth quarter 2019 GAAP earnings of $0.28 per share compared to $0.07 per share in the fourth quarter of 2018. Increase in EPS i",741,"Thanks, Terry, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with results on Slide 10 of the presentation. This morning, we reported fourth quarter 2019 GAAP earnings of $0.28 per share compared to $0.07 per share in the fourth quarter of 2018. Increase in EPS is primarily due to lower O&M, lower shares outstanding and tax benefits from higher amortization of accumulated deferred income taxes which were partially offset by higher depreciation expense. Adjusted non-GAAP earnings were $0.32 per share compared to $0.15 per share in the same period a year ago. As shown in the chart on Slide 11, adjusted EPS was driven primarily by fewer shares outstanding and lower O&M and was partially offset by unfavorable weather and higher depreciation expense. For the quarter, residential sales were down 3%, while commercial and industrial sales fell 1% and 1.8%, respectively. Lower sales in the quarter were primarily due to weather, which we estimate naval impacted earnings by $0.04 compared to last year and about $0.01 when compared to normal. .
Moving on to Slide 12. I'll touch on full year results. For the year, GAAP earnings were $670 million or $2.79 per share compared to the $536 million or $2.50 per share last year. 2019 GAAP results were driven by the full year impact of Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West results for lower operating and maintenance expenses, partially offset by higher depreciation expense and lower retail sales, driven by unfavorable weather compared to 2018. Adjusted earnings were $694 million or $2.89 per share compared to 2018 adjusted earnings of $681 million or $2.50 per share. As detailed on the slide, the increase in adjusted earnings when compared to last year was primarily driven by a reduction in O&M was about $120 million, a decrease of more than 9%, new retail rates and accretion from career shares outstanding. Partially offsetting this increase was higher depreciation expense of around $84 million and lower sales due to less favorable weather. The 2019 weather impact was less favorable in 2018, and pro forma retail sales declined as a result. Residential sales fell 4.3% and commercial sales were down 1.7%. We estimate weather costs us $0.22 when compared to last year, but was a benefit of about $0.10 when compared to normal. Pro forma industrial sales were down 8% compared to last year, due primarily to 2 large customers in the chemical and oil sectors, that saw decreased demand at their plans throughout the year. If we remove the impact of these 2 large low-margin customers, industrial sales were up 20 basis points. Overall, growth in the number of customers continued making the ninth straight year of customer growth for our company. 
Moving on to Slide 13, let me touch on our latest financing activities. As Terry mentioned, we have [indiscernible] future share repurchases given our identification of incremental capital projects that drive value for customers. Since initiating the program in August of 2018, we have repurchased just over 45 million shares. This program was put in place to rebalance the consolidated capital structure and was a key driver of EPS growth on the front end of our merger plan as we've been working through our rate stay out period. Looking forward to financing activities this year, Evergy Central Kansas has $250 million, a 5.1% first mortgage bonds maturing in July, that we'll look to refinance we expect this will be the only long-term debt financing activity in 2020. Wrapping up on Slide 14, let me give some details on our 2020 drivers. As Terry mentioned, we're not issuing 2020 EPS guidance today. I'd like to provide you with a few drivers for the year. Consistent with 2019, we're expecting weather-normalized sales to be between flat and 50 basis points of growth. On the back of strong O&M cost performance in 2019, we're targeting an additional 5% to 8% reduction in adjusted O&M in 2020. Our continued infrastructure spending will drive depreciation and amortization expense, $10 million to $20 million higher. We're expecting COLI proceeds to be approximately $20 million. We're forecasting an effective income tax rate of 12% to 14%. And lastly, our year-end 2019 share count was 227 million shares. We remain confident in the opportunities in front of us, our team will keep our eye on the ball of running the business, while the strategic review and operations committee conducts its evaluation. With that, I will turn the call back over to Terry."

Let's start on Slide 5. .We reported full year GAAP earnings of $2.79 per share compared to $2.50 per share earned in 2018. Adjusted earnings per share were $2.89 in 2019 compared to $2.54 per share a year ago.",1497,"Thanks, Lori, and good morning, everybody. Let's start on Slide 5. .
We reported full year GAAP earnings of $2.79 per share compared to $2.50 per share earned in 2018. Adjusted earnings per share were $2.89 in 2019 compared to $2.54 per share a year ago. The fair results were driven by reducing operating expenses, fewer shares outstanding and rate case outcomes, partially offset by higher depreciation and unfavorable weather. Our ability to overcome headwinds and execute our merger plan, particularly through the disciplined cost management allowed us to deliver consistently throughout the year. 
2019 was successful on many fronts. Let me touch on a few of the highlights. We exceeded our 2019 net merger savings target of $110 million, ending the year at $150 million or 36% above target and drove our adjusted O&M down over 9% on a year-over-year basis. We raised our dividend by 6.3% to an indicated annual rate of $2.02 per share. We executed our capital allocation plan by investing $1.2 billion in infrastructure to maintain customer liability as well as continued our share repurchase program that was announced as part of our merger plan. We returned almost $2.1 billion in capital to our shareholders with $1.6 billion coming through share repurchases and another $463 million in the form of dividends. We elected Plant in Service Accounting, or PISA, in Missouri and initiated infrastructure spending that is incentivized by the legislation. We rebranded our operating utilities to provide consistency across our service territory. And now all customers across Kansas and Missouri, know us as Evergy. 
We advanced our long-standing commitment to environmental stewardship and announced the new carbon reduction commitment that will reduce CO2 emissions 80% by 2050 from 2005 levels. We maintained our strong customer reliability metrics, and lastly and importantly, we continue to build the Evergy culture by staying true our 4 core values of safety, integrity, ownership and adaptability. I want to thank our entire team for their continued focus and teamwork on these accomplishments. 
Now looking at Slide 6. As discussed on our third quarter earnings call in November, we have been evaluating additional capital investment opportunities and believe that there were significant additional infrastructure investment opportunities in Missouri. With a full year of post merger capital planning under our belts, we've used a rigorous allocation process to identify and prioritize projects that enhance grid reliability while reducing operations and maintenance expense. As a result of our work, we're announcing $1.5 billion of incremental infrastructure spending opportunities through 2024 in areas including renewable generation and grid modernization. This raises our 5-year CapEx plan from $6.1 billion to $7.6 billion. 
With PISA enacted in Missouri, which is designed to encourage enhanced infrastructure investment, majority of the incremental spend or approximately $1 billion will be directed towards PISA-qualified projects. This update to our capital plan will increase our rate base growth to 3% to 4% over this period relative to our prior guidance of 2% to 3%. This enables us to undertake critical investments that will improve the service we provide to our customers while also delivering what we believe is a more attractive and balanced growth profile for our shareholders. 
With the increased capital investment, we have elected to halt the remainder of our share repurchase program. As of the end of 2019, we had completed 75% of our repurchase program, repurchasing 45 million of the 60 million share authorization. Halting the final 15 million shares is expected to be credit positive and creates balance sheet capacity to make infrastructure investments. 
I want to reiterate that our overall objective of targeting competitive shareholder returns, maintaining reliability and keeping customer rights competitive has not changed. We believe our updated capital allocation strategy will drive greater benefits for our customers and communities from enhanced reliability and grid resiliency while aligning with Missouri's initiative of building infrastructure and creating jobs. This is a true win-win across the board. 
Moving on to Slide 7. I'll update you on our merger savings. A large part of our merger thesis was built upon leveraging the synergies of neighboring service territories and creating value for all shareholders. At the time of our merger, both legacy companies had room for improvement from a cost perspective. Our progress thus far has already surpassed our original benchmarking. As I mentioned earlier, we've exceeded our estimated 2019 $110 million original net merger savings target by 36%, and we'll continue to focus on overachieving these original targets, which were established during our merger regulatory proceeding. 
We've identified additional opportunities for performance improvement. We've evaluated our benchmarking performance in 2018 and now have 2019 results. This has yielded a positive trend in our cost performance as we've seen a significant decline in our costs, particularly when adjusting for cost that were a result of the merger. To maintain the momentum of our positive cost trajectory, we'll continue to focus on opportunities to streamline, automate, digitize and otherwise enhance our processes and performance execution. 
While the merger provided a platform for synergies, our intensity around cost management remains paramount, as evidenced by our expected 5% to 8% O&M reduction in 2020. We continue to execute on the opportunities that were identified in the merger, and we'll continue to focus on future cost reduction opportunities. Our team is engaged in ongoing continuous improvement to drive value for our stakeholders through aggressive cost management. 
Now looking at Slide 8. Beyond our strong financial and operations results, we're continuing our focus on being good stewards of the environment. We've already reduced carbon emissions by 45% from the 2005 levels. And as we announced on our third quarter call, we expect to achieve at least 80% carbon reduction through natural retirements. However, we'll continue to evaluate and consider additional opportunities to execute on these plans sooner if possible and appropriate. 
As part of providing [indiscernible] energy to customers, we're continuously looking for new ways to make renewable energy available. As you may have seen in our recent press release, we've contracted 660 megawatts of wind to fulfill a large commercial and industrial customer demand on new special green tariffs that we worked hard to put in place during our 2018 rate cases. The 4 announced wind farms, which were originally identified through the RFP process, conducted right after our merger in late '18 will be added via purchase power agreement consistent with the tariffs in Missouri and Kansas. Again, as evidenced by our carbon target, we will continuously decarbonize our generation mix, consistent with providing reliable and affordable service to our customers and currently have included 500 million of rate base renewables in our 5-year plan. 
Our next triennial IRP filing in both Kansas and Missouri is scheduled for 2021. This will be our first long filing as Evergy as well as our first-time's filing in Kansas. 
The green tariffs are an important economic development tool that our team has been marketing in order to retain top customers and attract large customers that otherwise may not locate in our service territory. 
Before I turn it over to Tony, I'd like to discuss the agreement we announced this morning with Elliott Management. As part of the agreement, Paul Keglevic, former Chief Executive Officer; Energy Future Holdings and Kirk Andrews, current Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of NRG Energy, have been appointed to the board as new independent directors. At the time of the 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders in May, the size of the board will be reduced to 13 directors, following the retirement of 4 current Evergy directors. We will provide additional information regarding the 13 directors who will stand for election at the 2020 Annual Meeting in our proxy in the coming weeks. 
Further, we're forming a strategic review and operations committee, I will be on the committee along with Art Stall, Paul Keglevic and Kirk Andrews, the committee will explore ways to enhance shareholder value. The committee plans to complete its review and make any relevant recommendations to the Evergy board in the first half of 2020. 
Given the mandate of the strategic review and operations committee, we will hold off on issuing current year and long-term earnings guidance while the committee conducts its review. While we expect to provide comprehensive updated guidance at the conclusion of the committee's work, we'll provide more details today regarding some of our expected 2020 drivers, including the enhanced capital plan. We welcome the new directors and the vast experience they bring in the utility and power industry to support the work we have underway and enhance long-term shareholder value and serve our customers, communities and employees. And Elliot recognizes our commitment to serve the best interest of all Evergy's stakeholders. We have an exciting opportunity in front of us as we look to build upon the momentum we've created since the merger closed in June of 2018, and we look forward to executing on the plan. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Tony."

I'll start with results on Slide 10 of the presentation. This morning, we reported fourth quarter 2019 GAAP earnings of $0.28 per share compared to $0.07 per share in the fourth quarter of 2018. Increase in EPS",746,"Thanks, Terry, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with results on Slide 10 of the presentation. 
This morning, we reported fourth quarter 2019 GAAP earnings of $0.28 per share compared to $0.07 per share in the fourth quarter of 2018. Increase in EPS is primarily due to lower O&M, lower shares outstands and tax benefits from higher amortization of accumulated deferred income taxes, which were partially offset by higher depreciation expense. Adjusted non-GAAP earnings were $0.32 per share compared to $0.15 per share in the same period a year ago. 
As shown in the chart on Slide 11, adjusted EPS was driven primarily by fewer shares outstanding and lower O&M and was partially offset by unfavorable weather and higher depreciation expense. 
For the quarter, residential sales were down 3%, while commercial and industrial sales fell 1% and 1.8%, respectively. Lower sales in the quarter were primarily due to weather, which we estimate natively impacted earnings by $0.04 compared to last year and about $0.01 when compared to normal.
Moving on to Slide 12. I'll touch on full year results. For the year, GAAP earnings were $670 million or $2.79 per share compared to the $536 million or $2.50 per share last year. 2019 GAAP results were driven by the full year impact of Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West results and lower operating and maintenance expenses, partially offset by higher depreciation expense and lower retail sales, driven by unfavorable weather compared to 2018. 
Adjusted earnings were $694 million or $2.89 per share compared to 2018 adjusted earnings of $681 million or $2.50 per share. As detailed on the slide, the increase in adjusted earnings when compared to last year was primarily driven by a reduction in O&M of about $120 million; a decrease of more than 9%, new retail rates and accretion from fewer shares outstanding. Partially offsetting this increase was higher depreciation expense of around $84 million and lower sales due to less favorable weather. 
The 2019 weather impact was less favorable than 2018, and pro forma retail sales declined as a result. Residential sales fell 4.3%, and commercial sales were down 1.7%. We estimate weather costs us $0.22 when compared to last year but was a benefit of about $0.10 when compared to normal. 
Pro forma industrial sales were down 1% compared to last year, due primarily to 2 large customers in the chemical and oil sectors that saw decreased demand at their plants throughout the year. If we remove the impact of these 2 large low-margin customers, industrial sales were up 20 basis points. 
Overall, growth in the number of customers continued, making the ninth straight year of customer growth for our company. 
Moving on to Slide 13, let me touch on our latest financing activities. As Terry mentioned, we have ceased future share repurchases, given our identification of incremental capital projects that drive value for customers. Since initiating the program in August of 2018, we have repurchased just over 45 million shares. This program was put in place to rebalance the consolidated capital structure and was a key driver of EPS growth on the front end of our merger plan as we've been working through our rate stay-out period. 
Looking forward to financing activities this year, Evergy Central Kansas (sic) [ Evergy Kansas Central ] has $250 million, a 5.1% first mortgage bonds maturing in July that we'll look to refinance. We expect this will be the only long-term debt financing activity in 2020. 
Wrapping up on Slide 14, let me give some details on our 2020 drivers. As Terry mentioned, we are not issuing 2020 EPS guidance today, I'd like to provide you with a few drivers for the year. Consistent with 2019, we're expecting weather-normalized sales to be between flat and 50 basis points of growth. On the back of strong O&M cost performance in 2019, we're targeting an additional 5% to 8% reduction in adjusted O&M in 2020. Our continued infrastructure spending will drive depreciation and amortization expense $10 million to $20 million higher. We're expecting COLI proceeds to be approximately $20 million. We're forecasting an effective income tax rate of 12% to 14%. And lastly, our year-end 2019 share count was 227 million shares. 
We remain confident in the opportunities in front of us, our team will keep our eye on the ball of running the business while the strategic review and operations committee conducts its evaluation. 
With that, I will turn the call back over to Terry."

That's not to say we wouldn't spend additional in Kansas as well, but we obviously want to be more measured, and the immediate focus would be on PISA. .

But as we work through the plan, and again, we're about 75% through that original buyback process, we looked at opportunities for long-term growth. And as PISA kicked in, it became a lot more clear to us, PISA, as a tool, was very helpful. We talked about again as early as our second quarter call about there being up to maybe $1 billion of capacity there that we were evaluating, and we worked on specific projects that we could make as part of that. And so we began to work on the transition from the buyback into additional CapEx spend that would be grid modernization and types of projects that would reduce O&M, all focused on being more efficient and lower cost for our customers. That's kind of the -- that's the high-level version. Does that make sense?"

Let's start on Slide 5. .We reported full year GAAP earnings of $2.79 per share compared to $2.50 per share earned in 2018. Adjusted earnings per share were $2.89 in 2019 compared to $2.54 per share a year ago.",1497,"Thanks, Lori, and good morning, everybody. Let's start on Slide 5. .
We reported full year GAAP earnings of $2.79 per share compared to $2.50 per share earned in 2018. Adjusted earnings per share were $2.89 in 2019 compared to $2.54 per share a year ago. The fair results were driven by reducing operating expenses, fewer shares outstanding and rate case outcomes, partially offset by higher depreciation and unfavorable weather. Our ability to overcome headwinds and execute our merger plan, particularly through the disciplined cost management allowed us to deliver consistently throughout the year. 
2019 was successful on many fronts. Let me touch on a few of the highlights. We exceeded our 2019 net merger savings target of $110 million, ending the year at $150 million or 36% above target and drove our adjusted O&M down over 9% on a year-over-year basis. We raised our dividend by 6.3% to an indicated annual rate of $2.02 per share. We executed our capital allocation plan by investing $1.2 billion in infrastructure to maintain customer liability as well as continued our share repurchase program that was announced as part of our merger plan. We returned almost $2.1 billion in capital to our shareholders with $1.6 billion coming through share repurchases and another $463 million in the form of dividends. We elected Plant in Service Accounting, or PISA, in Missouri and initiated infrastructure spending that is incentivized by the legislation. We rebranded our operating utilities to provide consistency across our service territory. And now all customers across Kansas and Missouri, know us as Evergy. 
We advanced our long-standing commitment to environmental stewardship and announced the new carbon reduction commitment that will reduce CO2 emissions 80% by 2050 from 2005 levels. We maintained our strong customer reliability metrics, and lastly and importantly, we continue to build the Evergy culture by staying true our 4 core values of safety, integrity, ownership and adaptability. I want to thank our entire team for their continued focus and teamwork on these accomplishments. 
Now looking at Slide 6. As discussed on our third quarter earnings call in November, we have been evaluating additional capital investment opportunities and believe that there were significant additional infrastructure investment opportunities in Missouri. With a full year of post merger capital planning under our belts, we've used a rigorous allocation process to identify and prioritize projects that enhance grid reliability while reducing operations and maintenance expense. As a result of our work, we're announcing $1.5 billion of incremental infrastructure spending opportunities through 2024 in areas including renewable generation and grid modernization. This raises our 5-year CapEx plan from $6.1 billion to $7.6 billion. 
With PISA enacted in Missouri, which is designed to encourage enhanced infrastructure investment, majority of the incremental spend or approximately $1 billion will be directed towards PISA-qualified projects. This update to our capital plan will increase our rate base growth to 3% to 4% over this period relative to our prior guidance of 2% to 3%. This enables us to undertake critical investments that will improve the service we provide to our customers while also delivering what we believe is a more attractive and balanced growth profile for our shareholders. 
With the increased capital investment, we have elected to halt the remainder of our share repurchase program. As of the end of 2019, we had completed 75% of our repurchase program, repurchasing 45 million of the 60 million share authorization. Halting the final 15 million shares is expected to be credit positive and creates balance sheet capacity to make infrastructure investments. 
I want to reiterate that our overall objective of targeting competitive shareholder returns, maintaining reliability and keeping customer rights competitive has not changed. We believe our updated capital allocation strategy will drive greater benefits for our customers and communities from enhanced reliability and grid resiliency while aligning with Missouri's initiative of building infrastructure and creating jobs. This is a true win-win across the board. 
Moving on to Slide 7. I'll update you on our merger savings. A large part of our merger thesis was built upon leveraging the synergies of neighboring service territories and creating value for all shareholders. At the time of our merger, both legacy companies had room for improvement from a cost perspective. Our progress thus far has already surpassed our original benchmarking. As I mentioned earlier, we've exceeded our estimated 2019 $110 million original net merger savings target by 36%, and we'll continue to focus on overachieving these original targets, which were established during our merger regulatory proceeding. 
We've identified additional opportunities for performance improvement. We've evaluated our benchmarking performance in 2018 and now have 2019 results. This has yielded a positive trend in our cost performance as we've seen a significant decline in our costs, particularly when adjusting for cost that were a result of the merger. To maintain the momentum of our positive cost trajectory, we'll continue to focus on opportunities to streamline, automate, digitize and otherwise enhance our processes and performance execution. 
While the merger provided a platform for synergies, our intensity around cost management remains paramount, as evidenced by our expected 5% to 8% O&M reduction in 2020. We continue to execute on the opportunities that were identified in the merger, and we'll continue to focus on future cost reduction opportunities. Our team is engaged in ongoing continuous improvement to drive value for our stakeholders through aggressive cost management. 
Now looking at Slide 8. Beyond our strong financial and operations results, we're continuing our focus on being good stewards of the environment. We've already reduced carbon emissions by 45% from the 2005 levels. And as we announced on our third quarter call, we expect to achieve at least 80% carbon reduction through natural retirements. However, we'll continue to evaluate and consider additional opportunities to execute on these plans sooner if possible and appropriate. 
As part of providing [indiscernible] energy to customers, we're continuously looking for new ways to make renewable energy available. As you may have seen in our recent press release, we've contracted 660 megawatts of wind to fulfill a large commercial and industrial customer demand on new special green tariffs that we worked hard to put in place during our 2018 rate cases. The 4 announced wind farms, which were originally identified through the RFP process, conducted right after our merger in late '18 will be added via purchase power agreement consistent with the tariffs in Missouri and Kansas. Again, as evidenced by our carbon target, we will continuously decarbonize our generation mix, consistent with providing reliable and affordable service to our customers and currently have included 500 million of rate base renewables in our 5-year plan. 
Our next triennial IRP filing in both Kansas and Missouri is scheduled for 2021. This will be our first long filing as Evergy as well as our first-time's filing in Kansas. 
The green tariffs are an important economic development tool that our team has been marketing in order to retain top customers and attract large customers that otherwise may not locate in our service territory. 
Before I turn it over to Tony, I'd like to discuss the agreement we announced this morning with Elliott Management. As part of the agreement, Paul Keglevic, former Chief Executive Officer; Energy Future Holdings and Kirk Andrews, current Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of NRG Energy, have been appointed to the board as new independent directors. At the time of the 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders in May, the size of the board will be reduced to 13 directors, following the retirement of 4 current Evergy directors. We will provide additional information regarding the 13 directors who will stand for election at the 2020 Annual Meeting in our proxy in the coming weeks. 
Further, we're forming a strategic review and operations committee, I will be on the committee along with Art Stall, Paul Keglevic and Kirk Andrews, the committee will explore ways to enhance shareholder value. The committee plans to complete its review and make any relevant recommendations to the Evergy board in the first half of 2020. 
Given the mandate of the strategic review and operations committee, we will hold off on issuing current year and long-term earnings guidance while the committee conducts its review. While we expect to provide comprehensive updated guidance at the conclusion of the committee's work, we'll provide more details today regarding some of our expected 2020 drivers, including the enhanced capital plan. We welcome the new directors and the vast experience they bring in the utility and power industry to support the work we have underway and enhance long-term shareholder value and serve our customers, communities and employees. And Elliot recognizes our commitment to serve the best interest of all Evergy's stakeholders. We have an exciting opportunity in front of us as we look to build upon the momentum we've created since the merger closed in June of 2018, and we look forward to executing on the plan. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Tony."

Increase in EPS",746,"Thanks, Terry, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with results on Slide 10 of the presentation. 
This morning, we reported fourth quarter 2019 GAAP earnings of $0.28 per share compared to $0.07 per share in the fourth quarter of 2018. Increase in EPS is primarily due to lower O&M, lower shares outstands and tax benefits from higher amortization of accumulated deferred income taxes, which were partially offset by higher depreciation expense. Adjusted non-GAAP earnings were $0.32 per share compared to $0.15 per share in the same period a year ago. 
As shown in the chart on Slide 11, adjusted EPS was driven primarily by fewer shares outstanding and lower O&M and was partially offset by unfavorable weather and higher depreciation expense. 
For the quarter, residential sales were down 3%, while commercial and industrial sales fell 1% and 1.8%, respectively. Lower sales in the quarter were primarily due to weather, which we estimate natively impacted earnings by $0.04 compared to last year and about $0.01 when compared to normal.
Moving on to Slide 12. I'll touch on full year results. For the year, GAAP earnings were $670 million or $2.79 per share compared to the $536 million or $2.50 per share last year. 2019 GAAP results were driven by the full year impact of Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West results and lower operating and maintenance expenses, partially offset by higher depreciation expense and lower retail sales, driven by unfavorable weather compared to 2018. 
Adjusted earnings were $694 million or $2.89 per share compared to 2018 adjusted earnings of $681 million or $2.50 per share. As detailed on the slide, the increase in adjusted earnings when compared to last year was primarily driven by a reduction in O&M of about $120 million; a decrease of more than 9%, new retail rates and accretion from fewer shares outstanding. Partially offsetting this increase was higher depreciation expense of around $84 million and lower sales due to less favorable weather. 
The 2019 weather impact was less favorable than 2018, and pro forma retail sales declined as a result. Residential sales fell 4.3%, and commercial sales were down 1.7%. We estimate weather costs us $0.22 when compared to last year but was a benefit of about $0.10 when compared to normal. 
Pro forma industrial sales were down 1% compared to last year, due primarily to 2 large customers in the chemical and oil sectors that saw decreased demand at their plants throughout the year. If we remove the impact of these 2 large low-margin customers, industrial sales were up 20 basis points. 
Overall, growth in the number of customers continued, making the ninth straight year of customer growth for our company. 
Moving on to Slide 13, let me touch on our latest financing activities. As Terry mentioned, we have ceased future share repurchases, given our identification of incremental capital projects that drive value for customers. Since initiating the program in August of 2018, we have repurchased just over 45 million shares. This program was put in place to rebalance the consolidated capital structure and was a key driver of EPS growth on the front end of our merger plan as we've been working through our rate stay-out period. 
Looking forward to financing activities this year, Evergy Central Kansas (sic) [ Evergy Kansas Central ] has $250 million, a 5.1% first mortgage bonds maturing in July that we'll look to refinance. We expect this will be the only long-term debt financing activity in 2020. 
Wrapping up on Slide 14, let me give some details on our 2020 drivers. As Terry mentioned, we are not issuing 2020 EPS guidance today, I'd like to provide you with a few drivers for the year. Consistent with 2019, we're expecting weather-normalized sales to be between flat and 50 basis points of growth. On the back of strong O&M cost performance in 2019, we're targeting an additional 5% to 8% reduction in adjusted O&M in 2020. Our continued infrastructure spending will drive depreciation and amortization expense $10 million to $20 million higher. We're expecting COLI proceeds to be approximately $20 million. We're forecasting an effective income tax rate of 12% to 14%. And lastly, our year-end 2019 share count was 227 million shares. 
We remain confident in the opportunities in front of us, our team will keep our eye on the ball of running the business while the strategic review and operations committee conducts its evaluation. 
With that, I will turn the call back over to Terry."

Let's start on Slide 5.We reported full year GAAP earnings of $2.79 per share compared to $2.50 per share earned in 2018. Adjusted earnings per share were $2.89 in 2019 compared to $2.54 per share a year ago. T",1500,"Thanks, Lori, and good morning, everybody. Let's start on Slide 5.
We reported full year GAAP earnings of $2.79 per share compared to $2.50 per share earned in 2018. Adjusted earnings per share were $2.89 in 2019 compared to $2.54 per share a year ago. The fair results were driven by reducing operating expenses, fewer shares outstanding and rate case outcomes, partially offset by higher depreciation and unfavorable weather. Our ability to overcome headwinds and execute our merger plan, particularly through the disciplined cost management allowed us to deliver consistently throughout the year. 
2019 was successful on many fronts. Let me touch on a few of the highlights. We exceeded our 2019 net merger savings target of $110 million, ending the year at $150 million or 36% above target and drove our adjusted O&M down over 9% on a year-over-year basis. We raised our dividend by 6.3% to an indicated annual rate of $2.02 per share. We executed our capital allocation plan by investing $1.2 billion in infrastructure to maintain customer liability as well as continued our share repurchase program that was announced as part of our merger plan. We returned almost $2.1 billion in capital to our shareholders with $1.6 billion coming through share repurchases and another $463 million in the form of dividends. We elected Plant in Service Accounting, or PISA, in Missouri and initiated infrastructure spending that is incentivized by the legislation. We rebranded our operating utilities to provide consistency across our service territory. And now all customers across Kansas and Missouri, know us as Evergy. 
We advanced our long-standing commitment to environmental stewardship and announced a new carbon reduction commitment that will reduce CO2 emissions 80% by 2050 from 2005 levels. We maintained our strong customer reliability metrics, and lastly and importantly, we continue to build the Evergy culture by staying true to our 4 core values of safety, integrity, ownership and adaptability. I want to thank our entire team for their continued focus and teamwork on these accomplishments. 
Now looking at Slide 6. As discussed on our third quarter earnings call in November, we have been evaluating additional capital investment opportunities and believe that there were significant additional infrastructure investment opportunities in Missouri. With a full year of post merger capital planning under our belts, we've used a rigorous allocation process to identify and prioritize projects that enhance grid reliability while reducing operations and maintenance expense. As a result of our work, we're announcing $1.5 billion of incremental infrastructure spending opportunities through 2024 in areas including renewable generation and grid modernization. This raises our 5-year CapEx plan from $6.1 billion to $7.6 billion. 
With PISA enacted in Missouri, which is designed to encourage enhanced infrastructure investment, majority of the incremental spend or approximately $1 billion will be directed towards PISA-qualified projects. This update to our capital plan will increase our rate base growth to 3% to 4% over this period relative to our prior guidance of 2% to 3%. This enables us to undertake critical investments that will improve the service we provide to our customers while also delivering what we believe is a more attractive and balanced growth profile for our shareholders. 
With the increased capital investment, we have elected to halt the remainder of our share repurchase program. As of the end of 2019, we had completed 75% of our repurchase program, repurchasing 45 million of the 60 million share authorization. Halting the final 15 million shares is expected to be credit positive and creates balance sheet capacity to make infrastructure investments. 
I want to reiterate that our overall objective of targeting competitive shareholder returns, maintaining reliability and keeping customer rights competitive has not changed. We believe our updated capital allocation strategy will drive greater benefits for our customers and communities from enhanced reliability and grid resiliency while aligning with Missouri's initiative of building infrastructure and creating jobs. This is a true win-win across the board. 
Moving on to Slide 7. I'll update you on our merger savings. A large part of our merger thesis was built upon leveraging the synergies of neighboring service territories and creating value for all shareholders. At the time of our merger, both legacy companies had room for improvement from a cost perspective. Our progress thus far has already surpassed our original benchmarking. As I mentioned earlier, we've exceeded our estimated 2019 $110 million original net merger savings target by 36%, and we'll continue to focus on overachieving these original targets, which were established during our merger regulatory proceeding. 
We've identified additional opportunities for performance improvement. We've evaluated our benchmarking performance in 2018 and now have 2019 results. This has yielded a positive trend in our cost performance as we've seen a significant decline in our costs, particularly when adjusting for cost that were a result of the merger. To maintain the momentum of our positive cost trajectory, we'll continue to focus on opportunities to streamline, automate, digitize and otherwise enhance our processes and performance execution. 
While the merger provided a platform for synergies, our intensity around cost management remains paramount, as evidenced by our expected 5% to 8% O&M reduction in 2020. We continue to execute on the opportunities that were identified in the merger, and we'll continue to focus on future cost reduction opportunities. Our team is engaged in ongoing continuous improvement to drive value for our stakeholders through aggressive cost management. 
Now looking at Slide 8. Beyond our strong financial and operations results, we're continuing our focus on being good stewards of the environment. We've already reduced carbon emissions by 45% from the 2005 levels. And as we announced on our third quarter call, we expect to achieve at least 80% carbon reduction through natural retirements. However, we'll continue to evaluate and consider additional opportunities to execute on these plans sooner if possible and appropriate. 
As part of providing [indiscernible] energy to customers, we're continuously looking for new ways to make renewable energy available. As you may have seen in our recent press release, we've contracted 660 megawatts of wind to fulfill large commercial and industrial customer demand on new special green tariffs that we worked hard to put in place during our 2018 rate cases. The 4 announced wind farms, which were originally identified through the RFP process conducted right after our merger in late '18, will be added via purchase power agreement consistent with the tariffs in Missouri and Kansas. Again, as evidenced by our carbon target, we will continuously decarbonize our generation mix, consistent with providing reliable and affordable service to our customers and currently have included [ $500 million ] of rate base renewables in our 5-year plan. 
Our next triennial RFP filing in both Kansas and Missouri is scheduled for 2021. This will be our first loan filing as Evergy as well as our first time filing in Kansas. 
The green tariffs are an important economic development tool that our team has been marketing in order to retain top customers and attract large customers that otherwise may not locate in our service territory. 
Before I turn it over to Tony, I'd like to discuss the agreement we announced this morning with Elliott Management. As part of the agreement, Paul Keglevic, former Chief Executive Officer of Energy Future Holdings; and Kirk Andrews, current Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of NRG Energy, have been appointed to the Board as new independent directors. At the time of the 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders in May, the size of the Board will be reduced to 13 directors, following the retirement of 4 current Evergy directors. We will provide additional information regarding the 13 directors who will stand for election at the 2020 Annual Meeting in our proxy in the coming weeks. 
Further, we're forming a strategic review and operations committee. I will be on the committee along with Art Stall, Paul Keglevic and Kirk Andrews. The committee will explore ways to enhance shareholder value. The committee plans to complete its review and make any relevant recommendations to the Evergy Board in the first half of 2020. 
Given the mandate of the strategic review and operations committee, we will hold off on issuing current year and long-term earnings guidance while the committee conducts its review. While we expect to provide comprehensive updated guidance at the conclusion of the committee's work, we'll provide more details today regarding some of our expected 2020 drivers, including the enhanced capital plan. We welcome the new directors and the vast experience they bring in the utility and power industry to support the work we have underway and enhance long-term shareholder value and serve our customers, communities and employees. And Elliot recognizes our commitment to serve the best interest of all Evergy's stakeholders. We have an exciting opportunity in front of us as we look to build upon the momentum we've created since the merger closed in June of 2018, and we look forward to executing on the plan. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Tony."

I'll start with results on Slide 10 of the presentation. This morning, we reported fourth quarter 2019 GAAP earnings of $0.28 per share compared to $0.07 per share in the fourth quarter of 2018. Increase in EPS",746,"Thanks, Terry, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with results on Slide 10 of the presentation. 
This morning, we reported fourth quarter 2019 GAAP earnings of $0.28 per share compared to $0.07 per share in the fourth quarter of 2018. Increase in EPS is primarily due to lower O&M, lower shares outstanding and tax benefits from higher amortization of accumulated deferred income taxes, which were partially offset by higher depreciation expense. Adjusted non-GAAP earnings were $0.32 per share compared to $0.15 per share in the same period a year ago. 
As shown in the chart on Slide 11, adjusted EPS was driven primarily by fewer shares outstanding and lower O&M and was partially offset by unfavorable weather and higher depreciation expense. 
For the quarter, residential sales were down 3%, while commercial and industrial sales fell 1% and 1.8%, respectively. Lower sales in the quarter were primarily due to weather, which we estimate negatively impacted earnings by $0.04 compared to last year and about $0.01 when compared to normal.
Moving on to Slide 12. I'll touch on full year results. For the year, GAAP earnings were $670 million or $2.79 per share compared to the $536 million or $2.50 per share last year. 2019 GAAP results were driven by the full year impact of Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West results and lower operating and maintenance expenses, partially offset by higher depreciation expense and lower retail sales, driven by unfavorable weather compared to 2018. 
Adjusted earnings were $694 million or $2.89 per share compared to 2018 adjusted earnings of $681 million or $2.50 per share. As detailed on the slide, the increase in adjusted earnings when compared to last year was primarily driven by a reduction in O&M of about $120 million, a decrease of more than 9%, new retail rates and accretion from fewer shares outstanding. Partially offsetting this increase was higher depreciation expense of around $84 million and lower sales due to less favorable weather. 
The 2019 weather impact was less favorable than 2018, and pro forma retail sales declined as a result. Residential sales fell 4.3% and commercial sales were down 1.7%. We estimate weather cost us $0.22 when compared to last year but was a benefit of about $0.10 when compared to normal. 
Pro forma industrial sales were down 1% compared to last year, due primarily to 2 large customers in the chemical and oil sectors that saw decreased demand at their plants throughout the year. If we remove the impact of these 2 large low-margin customers, industrial sales were up 20 basis points. Overall growth in the number of customers continued, making the ninth straight year of customer growth for our company. 
Moving on to Slide 13, let me touch on our latest financing activities. As Terry mentioned, we have ceased future share repurchases, given our identification of incremental capital projects that drive value for customers. Since initiating the program in August of 2018, we have repurchased just over 45 million shares. This program was put in place to rebalance the consolidated capital structure and was a key driver of EPS growth on the front end of our merger plan as we've been working through our rate stay-out period. 
Looking forward to financing activities this year, Evergy Central Kansas (sic) [ Evergy Kansas Central ] has $250 million of 5.1% first mortgage bonds maturing in July that we'll look to refinance. We expect this will be the only long-term debt financing activity in 2020. 
Wrapping up on Slide 14, let me give some details on our 2020 drivers. As Terry mentioned, we are not issuing 2020 EPS guidance today. I'd like to provide you with a few drivers for the year. Consistent with 2019, we're expecting weather-normalized sales to be between flat and 50 basis points of growth. On the back of strong O&M cost performance in 2019, we're targeting an additional 5% to 8% reduction in adjusted O&M in 2020. Our continued infrastructure spending will drive depreciation and amortization expense $10 million to $20 million higher. We're expecting COLI proceeds to be approximately $20 million. We're forecasting an effective income tax rate of 12% to 14%. And lastly, our year-end 2019 share count was 227 million shares. 
We remain confident in the opportunities in front of us. Our team will keep our eye on the ball of running the business while the strategic review and operations committee conducts its evaluation. 
With that, I will turn the call back over to Terry."

So it makes more sense to focus on the recovery mechanism there. We have to continue to be cautious in Kansas because of the lag time between spend and recovery. That's not to say we wouldn't spend additional in Kansas as well, but we obviously want to be more measured, and the immediate focus would be on PISA.

Let's start on Slide 5.We reported full year GAAP earnings of $2.79 per share compared to $2.50 per share earned in 2018. Adjusted earnings per share were $2.89 in 2019 compared to $2.54 per share a year ago. T",1500,"Thanks, Lori, and good morning, everybody. Let's start on Slide 5.
We reported full year GAAP earnings of $2.79 per share compared to $2.50 per share earned in 2018. Adjusted earnings per share were $2.89 in 2019 compared to $2.54 per share a year ago. The fair results were driven by reducing operating expenses, fewer shares outstanding and rate case outcomes, partially offset by higher depreciation and unfavorable weather. Our ability to overcome headwinds and execute our merger plan, particularly through the disciplined cost management allowed us to deliver consistently throughout the year. 
2019 was successful on many fronts. Let me touch on a few of the highlights. We exceeded our 2019 net merger savings target of $110 million, ending the year at $150 million or 36% above target and drove our adjusted O&M down over 9% on a year-over-year basis. We raised our dividend by 6.3% to an indicated annual rate of $2.02 per share. We executed our capital allocation plan by investing $1.2 billion in infrastructure to maintain customer liability as well as continued our share repurchase program that was announced as part of our merger plan. We returned almost $2.1 billion in capital to our shareholders with $1.6 billion coming through share repurchases and another $463 million in the form of dividends. We elected Plant in Service Accounting, or PISA, in Missouri and initiated infrastructure spending that is incentivized by the legislation. We rebranded our operating utilities to provide consistency across our service territory. And now all customers across Kansas and Missouri, know us as Evergy. 
We advanced our long-standing commitment to environmental stewardship and announced a new carbon reduction commitment that will reduce CO2 emissions 80% by 2050 from 2005 levels. We maintained our strong customer reliability metrics, and lastly and importantly, we continue to build the Evergy culture by staying true to our 4 core values of safety, integrity, ownership and adaptability. I want to thank our entire team for their continued focus and teamwork on these accomplishments. 
Now looking at Slide 6. As discussed on our third quarter earnings call in November, we have been evaluating additional capital investment opportunities and believe that there were significant additional infrastructure investment opportunities in Missouri. With a full year of post merger capital planning under our belts, we've used a rigorous allocation process to identify and prioritize projects that enhance grid reliability while reducing operations and maintenance expense. As a result of our work, we're announcing $1.5 billion of incremental infrastructure spending opportunities through 2024 in areas including renewable generation and grid modernization. This raises our 5-year CapEx plan from $6.1 billion to $7.6 billion. 
With PISA enacted in Missouri, which is designed to encourage enhanced infrastructure investment, majority of the incremental spend or approximately $1 billion will be directed towards PISA-qualified projects. This update to our capital plan will increase our rate base growth to 3% to 4% over this period relative to our prior guidance of 2% to 3%. This enables us to undertake critical investments that will improve the service we provide to our customers while also delivering what we believe is a more attractive and balanced growth profile for our shareholders. 
With the increased capital investment, we have elected to halt the remainder of our share repurchase program. As of the end of 2019, we had completed 75% of our repurchase program, repurchasing 45 million of the 60 million share authorization. Halting the final 15 million shares is expected to be credit positive and creates balance sheet capacity to make infrastructure investments. 
I want to reiterate that our overall objective of targeting competitive shareholder returns, maintaining reliability and keeping customer rights competitive has not changed. We believe our updated capital allocation strategy will drive greater benefits for our customers and communities from enhanced reliability and grid resiliency while aligning with Missouri's initiative of building infrastructure and creating jobs. This is a true win-win across the board. 
Moving on to Slide 7. I'll update you on our merger savings. A large part of our merger thesis was built upon leveraging the synergies of neighboring service territories and creating value for all shareholders. At the time of our merger, both legacy companies had room for improvement from a cost perspective. Our progress thus far has already surpassed our original benchmarking. As I mentioned earlier, we've exceeded our estimated 2019 $110 million original net merger savings target by 36%, and we'll continue to focus on overachieving these original targets, which were established during our merger regulatory proceeding. 
We've identified additional opportunities for performance improvement. We've evaluated our benchmarking performance in 2018 and now have 2019 results. This has yielded a positive trend in our cost performance as we've seen a significant decline in our costs, particularly when adjusting for cost that were a result of the merger. To maintain the momentum of our positive cost trajectory, we'll continue to focus on opportunities to streamline, automate, digitize and otherwise enhance our processes and performance execution. 
While the merger provided a platform for synergies, our intensity around cost management remains paramount, as evidenced by our expected 5% to 8% O&M reduction in 2020. We continue to execute on the opportunities that were identified in the merger, and we'll continue to focus on future cost reduction opportunities. Our team is engaged in ongoing continuous improvement to drive value for our stakeholders through aggressive cost management. 
Now looking at Slide 8. Beyond our strong financial and operations results, we're continuing our focus on being good stewards of the environment. We've already reduced carbon emissions by 45% from the 2005 levels. And as we announced on our third quarter call, we expect to achieve at least 80% carbon reduction through natural retirements. However, we'll continue to evaluate and consider additional opportunities to execute on these plans sooner if possible and appropriate. 
As part of providing [indiscernible] energy to customers, we're continuously looking for new ways to make renewable energy available. As you may have seen in our recent press release, we've contracted 660 megawatts of wind to fulfill large commercial and industrial customer demand on new special green tariffs that we worked hard to put in place during our 2018 rate cases. The 4 announced wind farms, which were originally identified through the RFP process conducted right after our merger in late '18, will be added via purchase power agreement consistent with the tariffs in Missouri and Kansas. Again, as evidenced by our carbon target, we will continuously decarbonize our generation mix, consistent with providing reliable and affordable service to our customers and currently have included [ $500 million ] of rate base renewables in our 5-year plan. 
Our next triennial RFP filing in both Kansas and Missouri is scheduled for 2021. This will be our first loan filing as Evergy as well as our first time filing in Kansas. 
The green tariffs are an important economic development tool that our team has been marketing in order to retain top customers and attract large customers that otherwise may not locate in our service territory. 
Before I turn it over to Tony, I'd like to discuss the agreement we announced this morning with Elliott Management. As part of the agreement, Paul Keglevic, former Chief Executive Officer of Energy Future Holdings; and Kirk Andrews, current Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of NRG Energy, have been appointed to the Board as new independent directors. At the time of the 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders in May, the size of the Board will be reduced to 13 directors, following the retirement of 4 current Evergy directors. We will provide additional information regarding the 13 directors who will stand for election at the 2020 Annual Meeting in our proxy in the coming weeks. 
Further, we're forming a strategic review and operations committee. I will be on the committee along with Art Stall, Paul Keglevic and Kirk Andrews. The committee will explore ways to enhance shareholder value. The committee plans to complete its review and make any relevant recommendations to the Evergy Board in the first half of 2020. 
Given the mandate of the strategic review and operations committee, we will hold off on issuing current year and long-term earnings guidance while the committee conducts its review. While we expect to provide comprehensive updated guidance at the conclusion of the committee's work, we'll provide more details today regarding some of our expected 2020 drivers, including the enhanced capital plan. We welcome the new directors and the vast experience they bring in the utility and power industry to support the work we have underway and enhance long-term shareholder value and serve our customers, communities and employees. And Elliot recognizes our commitment to serve the best interest of all Evergy's stakeholders. We have an exciting opportunity in front of us as we look to build upon the momentum we've created since the merger closed in June of 2018, and we look forward to executing on the plan. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Tony."

I'll start with results on Slide 10 of the presentation. This morning, we reported fourth quarter 2019 GAAP earnings of $0.28 per share compared to $0.07 per share in the fourth quarter of 2018. Increase in EPS",746,"Thanks, Terry, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with results on Slide 10 of the presentation. 
This morning, we reported fourth quarter 2019 GAAP earnings of $0.28 per share compared to $0.07 per share in the fourth quarter of 2018. Increase in EPS is primarily due to lower O&M, lower shares outstanding and tax benefits from higher amortization of accumulated deferred income taxes, which were partially offset by higher depreciation expense. Adjusted non-GAAP earnings were $0.32 per share compared to $0.15 per share in the same period a year ago. 
As shown in the chart on Slide 11, adjusted EPS was driven primarily by fewer shares outstanding and lower O&M and was partially offset by unfavorable weather and higher depreciation expense. 
For the quarter, residential sales were down 3%, while commercial and industrial sales fell 1% and 1.8%, respectively. Lower sales in the quarter were primarily due to weather, which we estimate negatively impacted earnings by $0.04 compared to last year and about $0.01 when compared to normal.
Moving on to Slide 12. I'll touch on full year results. For the year, GAAP earnings were $670 million or $2.79 per share compared to the $536 million or $2.50 per share last year. 2019 GAAP results were driven by the full year impact of Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West results and lower operating and maintenance expenses, partially offset by higher depreciation expense and lower retail sales, driven by unfavorable weather compared to 2018. 
Adjusted earnings were $694 million or $2.89 per share compared to 2018 adjusted earnings of $681 million or $2.50 per share. As detailed on the slide, the increase in adjusted earnings when compared to last year was primarily driven by a reduction in O&M of about $120 million, a decrease of more than 9%, new retail rates and accretion from fewer shares outstanding. Partially offsetting this increase was higher depreciation expense of around $84 million and lower sales due to less favorable weather. 
The 2019 weather impact was less favorable than 2018, and pro forma retail sales declined as a result. Residential sales fell 4.3% and commercial sales were down 1.7%. We estimate weather cost us $0.22 when compared to last year but was a benefit of about $0.10 when compared to normal. 
Pro forma industrial sales were down 1% compared to last year, due primarily to 2 large customers in the chemical and oil sectors that saw decreased demand at their plants throughout the year. If we remove the impact of these 2 large low-margin customers, industrial sales were up 20 basis points. Overall growth in the number of customers continued, making the ninth straight year of customer growth for our company. 
Moving on to Slide 13, let me touch on our latest financing activities. As Terry mentioned, we have ceased future share repurchases, given our identification of incremental capital projects that drive value for customers. Since initiating the program in August of 2018, we have repurchased just over 45 million shares. This program was put in place to rebalance the consolidated capital structure and was a key driver of EPS growth on the front end of our merger plan as we've been working through our rate stay-out period. 
Looking forward to financing activities this year, Evergy Central Kansas (sic) [ Evergy Kansas Central ] has $250 million of 5.1% first mortgage bonds maturing in July that we'll look to refinance. We expect this will be the only long-term debt financing activity in 2020. 
Wrapping up on Slide 14, let me give some details on our 2020 drivers. As Terry mentioned, we are not issuing 2020 EPS guidance today. I'd like to provide you with a few drivers for the year. Consistent with 2019, we're expecting weather-normalized sales to be between flat and 50 basis points of growth. On the back of strong O&M cost performance in 2019, we're targeting an additional 5% to 8% reduction in adjusted O&M in 2020. Our continued infrastructure spending will drive depreciation and amortization expense $10 million to $20 million higher. We're expecting COLI proceeds to be approximately $20 million. We're forecasting an effective income tax rate of 12% to 14%. And lastly, our year-end 2019 share count was 227 million shares. 
We remain confident in the opportunities in front of us. Our team will keep our eye on the ball of running the business while the strategic review and operations committee conducts its evaluation. 
With that, I will turn the call back over to Terry."

Before I get started, I want to extend my deepest sympathies to those that have been directly impacted by the pandemic. I'd also like to extend my sincere appreciation to those professionals and critical functions who continue to work, especially first responders and frontline medical professionals who have been the real heroes through all of this. .
As I'm sure it's been for everyone, the last couple of months have been unique and challenging. I'm proud to work industry as a whole, and I'm proud of Evergy specifically, what we've done to meet the needs of our customers, employees and shareholders. 
We remain laser-focused on doing our job to deliver safe and uninterrupted power, especially during a time when we all are relying on electricity more than ever to power our increasingly virtual lives. 
I want to thank our entire team for their continued focus on safety, customer service and execution during these trying times. This effort has been a reflection of Evergy's people first culture. 
Now turning to results. As you can imagine, we have a lot to cover this morning, so I'll cover the emerging issues and our response to those and turn it over to Tony. Tony to get into the details of our financial results. Where despite the warmer than normal winter weather, we delivered GAAP earnings per share of $0.31 and non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share of $0.41. 
Also note, the board displayed confidence in the flexibility and stability of our current plan, but occurring dividend in line with previous quarter. 
Now on Slide 5, I'll update you on the latest on our COVID-19 response plans. Being in the Midwest has been an advantage as we face this global pandemic. It only does our service territory include rural areas that naturally provide for easier social distancing. But from a time perspective, we were a couple of weeks later than many other parts of the nation which allowed us to take proactive measures towards the health and safety of our employees, customers and communities. 
Before confirmed cases started to arise in Candid and Missouri, we implemented our pandemic response plan, as outlined in our crisis management plan, which resulted in our employees able to work from home, doing so and those in critical operational functions, taking preventative measures to ensure the continued delivery of safe and reliable power. This included practicing social distancing protocols among federal employees as well as with customers and in the community. And we began implementing remote staging locations to reduce overall contact. Over 1,500 employees were trained to administer temperature testing, and we are administering over 7,000 temperature recordings per week. With over 2,000 employees working from home and with schools and businesses closed, including most childcare providers, we expanded our paid time off policies to increase flexibility to accommodate employees as they deal with these unprecedented times. Our resolute focus on employee safety has strengthened by technology and innovation. Our team developed a mapping tool to actively monitor COVID-19 risk exposure to our people. By tracking these conditions geographically as they worsened, we were able to pinpoint developing hotspots. This up-to-date analysis allowed us to take tactical decisions regarding when and where to elevate pandemic response plans. With these proactive measures and our employees' vigilance, we've been able to thus far minimize the impact to our organization and its operations. 
We've had only 1 confirmed case of COVID-19, and I'm pleased to say that employee has made a full recovery and is back at work. We knew our employees weren't along dealing with uncertainty. So we made commitments to our customers to ease the burden caused by this pandemic. We were one of the first to implement the suspension of disconnections as conditions further deteriorated, we extended the original time line through June 1. 
Additionally, we're waiving late fees and adding new payment options for customers to help individuals and businesses manage the impacts of these hard hitting times. I'm proud of our team's planning, innovation and focus that has significantly limited the impact to our business and the communities and customers we serve. 
Moving on to Slide 6. I'll expand on the operational impact we've seen. There is no doubt that this pandemic has impacted our business, but we believe that we remain well positioned. Our flexible capital plan is focused on critical projects that should increase reliability and drive down future operating costs. The majority of these projects are smaller in nature and diversified across our service territories. 
As a result, our plan has less risk when compared to a plan that includes large projects that not only have regulatory risk, but also carry increased supply chain and human capital risk. We currently don't see a need to reduce our capital program over the 5-year forecast period. We have, however, deferred certain projects due to our commitment to practicing social distancing. These projects have been postponed until later in the year or some have been pushed into 2021. This is a shift in timing and not a reduction in our 5-year infrastructure investment plan. Another benefit of our plan is that it does not require the issuance of additional capital or equity, while it meets market risk. 
Throughout March and April, we've closely monitored our supply chain for availability of labor and materials. Fortunately, we were well positioned with a diverse supplier mix and intentional redundancies in our major supplier categories. As a result, we haven't encountered significant issues and currently don't anticipate availability issues with our supply chain. We conducted regular communication with our Tier 1 and Tier 2 critical suppliers and participate in industry-wide collaboration efforts to stay ahead of potential issues. While we did see some short-term impacts on PPE, mask and sanitation products, we didn't see any significant delays or major inventory issues, and we were also able to leverage several local suppliers who rose to the occasion to fill the gaps. 
Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have remained in close contact with our large commercial industrial customers in order to form a more complete picture of how it is likely to impact demand. As state home orders and business restrictions were put in place, we definitely saw commercial industrial load decline as businesses throughout our service territory began to reduce production, furlough and layout workers and send employees home to work remotely and even shut down. 
Tony will give you some additional details in a bit, but fortunately, as we saw commercial industrial sales decline, residential load had a healthy uptick. As a result, increases in higher-margin residential sales served offset much of the lower margins from commercial industrial sales. However, since the sales impact occurred late in the quarter, it was not a significant driver for margin overall, and we did not see a material impact in the quarter. 
In April, we continued to see commercial and industrial load decline, while residential demand continue to grow. As we evaluate retail sales from April, we see a more complete picture of the full month impact that COVID-19 has had on our sales. Although it's too early to say with certainty that April reflects the greatest impact to demand we will see during the pandemic, we are optimistic that the region's easing of business restrictions in May, combined with the continued increase in residential demand, will support improved retail sales as we head into the summer months. Although we realized that it may take a while to ramp up, it's encouraging to hear some of our large customers talk about their implementation plans and even when they include a gradual restart of operations. 
We are studying a range of possible outcomes, and we have plans to develop to remain well positioned in each scenario, supported by strong liquidity and several levers to pull on the O&M side, which would reduce the financial impact of a sales decline. 
Our flexibility and resiliency have allowed us to remain focused on all of our strategic priorities. 
Now to Slide 7. On the regulatory front, we haven't had to navigate any significant disruptions and don't envision this becoming an issue since we have no major dockets open and none of the near-term horizon with our next rate cases slated for 2022 and 2023. this has given us the opportunity to speak with the regulators in a time of repreve from rig increases or any other large request. The Kansas Corporation Commission put a stay on new dockets and shut down operations in mid-March, but then returned in early April and have been working remotely since. 
Missouri Public Service Commission has been working remotely since March 24 and  never officially halted operations. We were able to stay in constant contact with both commissions to update them on our latest pandemic response efforts and to discuss our concerns. As you can imagine, conversations were primarily focused on our customers' needs. 
In addition to our suspension of disconnects and waiving fees for our customers, we've also been discussing new options to allow businesses to pay back bills over a longer period and for residential customers to move to payment plans to avoid large growth in monthly payments over their norm. 
As we explained our efforts, to track pandemic expenses and potential loss revenue, conversations with our commissions expanded into discussions around alternatives for recovery of these impacts as well as ways to manage the impact of the expected increases and bad debt expenses. 
Yesterday, we filed for an accounting authority order in both Kansas and Missouri that will allow us to track certain expenses and lost revenue as well as any offset -- cost offsets for future consideration at our next cases. The Kansas Commission staff also filed yesterday its report and recommendation, recommending that all utilities be required to offer minimum customer protections of a 12-month payment plan for all delinquent account balances that arose as a result of the disconnect stay and a waiver of our late fees during the period of delinquency and repayment coupled with a recommendation that utilities be allowed to defer cost of bad debt expense and fee waiver as a result of the new customer protections. If adopted by the KCC, we see this as a true benefit to both customers and the company. 
The staff also stated any additional customer programs or deferral request should be addressed in a utility specific AAO request. Switching to a legislative update. In Kansas, the legislature recessed in mid-March, which is 2 weeks earlier than normal and are likely to go back in May to finish the budget. There are a couple of items that address utilities, including a bill we are strongly in favor of that allows us to offer special economic rates to grow business and jobs in Kansas, similar to what exists in Missouri. At this point, we don't know what the agenda will be or what, if anything, will get done yet this year. 
In Missouri, the legislature reached its annual spring break in March that came back last week, and there was only a couple of weeks left in session. Constitutionally, they must pass a budget by Friday. We don't believe much, if anything though, that impacts us will be considered this year. We are not actively pursuing legislation in Missouri this year. 
Finally, let me give you a quick update on our Board process before I turn things over to Tony. As many of you probably saw, our strategic review and operation committee's recommendation to the Board has been delayed about a couple of months. We're still meeting, albeit virtually and remain focused on our two-pronged mission, evaluating enhancements to our long-term stand-alone operating plan and exploring potential opportunities for strategic alternatives. 
While nothing has changed from the committee's perspective, the dynamics in the market warranted the delay in our time line. The committee now plans to deliver its findings to the board by July 30, and then the board plans to provide an update in August. 
Again, the market turmoil doesn't change the focus of our committee, but it did alter our original calendar as we wanted to give some time for things to stabilize as we work through our processes. 
And with that, I will turn the call over to Tony to cover first quarter results."

We reported first quarter 2020 GAAP earnings of $0.31 per share compared to $0.39 per share in the first quarter of 2019. The decrease in EPS is primarily due to warmer winter weather and lower COLI benefits, partially offset by lower operation and maintenance expense. We turned in a solid quarter, notwithstanding extremely warm winter weather that obviously hurt sales and no COLI income compared to over $6 million in the same period last year. 
Adjusted non-GAAP earnings were $0.41 per share compared to $0.44 per share in the same period a year ago. As shown in the chart on Slide 10, adjusted EPS was different lower primarily by unfavorable weather and lower other income and was partially offset by lower O&M and fewer shares outstanding. Importantly, our efforts towards cost management yielded a $37 million decline in O&M, 13% lower than the first quarter last year. This reduction is highlighted by a decrease in T&D expenses due to cost reduction initiatives and the impacts from the January 2019 winter storm, overall reduced headcount and associated benefit expense and lower plant expense from fewer outages at our generating units. 
As far as merger savings go, we continue to execute well. We exceeded our 2019 targets remain ahead of schedule through the first quarter this year and expect to beat the 2020 mark established by the original merger targets. When we first began discussing the accretion of Evergy, there are nearly 6,400 positions among our legacy companies and Wolf Creek, our shared nuclear facility. Today, we're down to about 5,400. We've created a more efficient company without sacrificing operating capabilities, and all of this has been accomplished while staying true to our commitment of no involuntary layoffs as a result of the merger. 
Instead, we've capitalized on a headcount reduction through normal attrition and voluntary separation programs. 
Turning to sales. We saw a decline in sales throughout the quarter, primarily from a change in year-over-year weather. Residential sales were down 10%, commercial declined 5% and industrial sales fell 0.6%, respectively. Compared to last year, heating degree days were 19% lower, and we estimate the impact to earnings was $0.12. Compared to normal, heating degree days were 9% lower. We estimate earnings were unfavorably impacted by about $0.06. 
On Slide 11, I'll give you some details on the sales impact from COVID-19. As we move through March and witnessed the closing of businesses, we started to see the impacts. As expected on a weather-normalized basis, commercial and industrial sales started to decline. As the shelter at home provisions kept folks in their homes, we saw a corresponding pickup in residential sales. 
As Terry mentioned earlier, from an earnings perspective, the higher margins in residential sales provided an offset at least partially to lower margin commercial and industrial sales. Given the timing of pandemic response actions in our jurisdictions, the resulting impacts became more apparent throughout the month of March. As we monitored sales through April, we saw further declining trends in commercial and industrial loads. Residential sales remained elevated but didn't keep pace with the degradation on the commercial and industrial side. Compared to last year, our estimated weather-normalized total retail sales were about 8% lower. 
Turning to the change in sales mix across customer classes, residential sales were up roughly 5%, while commercial and industrial sales declined 13% and 15%, respectively. Again, the higher residential sales will provide some offset, we expect trends at these levels to weigh on retail margin. 
If we adjust for 2 large oil refinery customers that had planned reduced usage outside of COVID-19 impacts, our April industrial sales decline would be around 10% compared to last year. As you can see in the graph on the slide, as those customers started ramping up, we saw the corresponding pickup in sales towards the end of April. 
Additionally, it's important to note that 2 industrial sectors that are prevalent in our territory are experiencing unusual events simultaneous to COVID-19. The airline industry is dealing with the 737 MAX issue and oil production refineries with the oil crisis. Both issues could still weigh on demand in future months irrespective of the recovery from COVID-19. 
Now we look to offset margin declines by balancing the preservation of long-term value creation and adjustments to O&M. Some of the levers we will pull include a hiring pause, reduced travel spend, reduced discretionary maintenance spending and potentially an additional voluntary early retirement program. While we have a ways to go in terms of opening up our economy, we may be turning a corner as many businesses in our territory, including a number of large manufacturing facilities that plans to reopen later this month after multi-week shutdowns. 
Moving on to Slide 10. Let me touch on our latest financing activities and liquidity. On April 2, Evergy Kansas Central issued $500 million of 30-year first mortgage bonds at 3.45%. Proceeds will be used to redeem $250 million of the 5.1% bonds that were set to mature in July and the remainder proceeds were used to reduce short-term debt. 
Also in April, we requested authority from the Missouri Public service Commission to issue up to $400 million at Evergy Metro to pay down short-term debt and further bolster our liquidity position. I'm happy to report the commission approved our request yesterday, and we expect to complete a transaction by midyear. We ended April with a total liquidity of $1.9 billion with $1.6 billion of that as capacity available on our master credit facility and over $300 million of cash on hand. We are confident in our liquidity position across the range of these scenarios that we've contemplated. 
Now wrapping up on Slide 13. As a reminder, we haven't issued 2020 EPS guidance, and we don't have plans to issue guidance during the pendency of the committee's work, but I can give you an update on some of the drivers for the year that have changed. Obviously, given the sales trends that we're seeing thus far, we now expect a weather-normalized sales decline this year. With ongoing uncertainty, it's too early to estimate the full year impact. 
With our cost reduction execution in the first quarter and the expected incremental reductions that we're targeting for the remainder of the year, we are now targeting a 6% to 9% reduction in adjusted O&M in 2020 compared to 2019 versus our previous target of 5% to 8% reduction. 
We remain optimistic as we're starting to see the nation and our service territories begin to open back up. We realize it's going to take some time for the economy and sales to pan back, where we're confident in our position and plan as we all unite together to put this behind us. We will continue to do our part and are staying focused on doing the right things for employees, customers, communities and shareholders. 
With that, I will turn the call back over to Terry."

So you gave some sensitivities earlier. You gave some thoughts on the sales trends in April. What -- when you think about an EPS shift, and I know you don't have guidance out there for '20, but how much of a reduction are we talking about in sales expectations relative to what seems like a modest reduction from 5% to 8% to 6% to 9% reduction on the O&M. So tell me if I'm missing something there, one versus the other. And then the follow-up to that would be, how do you think about '21 and onwards?

And so I think what we're seeing though is that even though we saw a downtick in April, as most folks would expect, we're happy to see that we -- it is manageable. And at least in the near term, we think we're able to offset a lot of that impact. Obviously, if those impacts lasted all year long, it get more difficult as the year went on.

Before I get started, I want to extend my deepest sympathies to those that have been directly impacted by the pandemic. I'd also like to extend my sincere appreciation to those professionals and critical functions who continue to work, especially first responders and frontline medical professionals who have been the real heroes through all of this. 
As I'm sure it's been for everyone, the last couple of months have been unique and challenging. I'm proud to work in the industry as a whole, and I'm proud of Evergy, specifically, what we've done to meet the needs of our customers, employees and shareholders. We remain laser-focused on doing our job to deliver safe and uninterrupted power, especially during a time when we all are relying on electricity more than ever to power our increasingly virtual lives. 
I want to thank our entire team for their continued focus on safety, customer service and execution during these trying times. This effort has been a reflection of Evergy's ""people first"" culture. 
Now turning to results. As you can imagine, we have a lot to cover this morning, so I'll cover the emerging issues and our response to those and turn it over to Tony. Tony to get into the details of our financial results, where despite the warmer-than-normal winter weather, we delivered GAAP earnings per share of $0.31 and non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share of $0.41. Also note, the Board displayed confidence and the flexibility and stability of our current plan by declaring a dividend in line with previous quarter. 
Now on Slide 5, I'll update you on the latest on our COVID-19 response plans. Being in the Midwest has been an advantage as we face this global pandemic. Not only does our service territory include rural areas that naturally provide for easier social distancing, but from a time perspective, we were a couple of weeks later than many other parts of the nation, which allowed us to take proactive measures towards the health and safety of our employees, customers and communities. 
Before confirmed cases started to arise in Kansas and Missouri, we implemented our pandemic response plan, as outlined in our crisis management plan, which resulted in our employees able to work from home, doing so and those in critical operational functions, taking preventative measures to ensure the continued delivery of safe and reliable power. This included practicing social distancing protocols among fellow employees as well as with customers and in the community. And we began implementing remote staging locations to reduce overall contact. Over 1,500 employees were trained to administer temperature testing, and we are administering over 7,000 temperature recordings per week. With over 2,000 employees working from home and with schools and businesses closed, including most childcare providers, we expanded our paid time-off policies to increase flexibility to accommodate employees as they deal with these unprecedented times. 
Our resolute focus on employee safety has strengthened by technology and innovation. Our team developed a mapping tool to actively monitor COVID-19 risk exposure to our people. By tracking these conditions geographically as they worsened, we were able to pinpoint developing hotspots. This up-to-date analysis allowed us to take tactical decisions regarding when and where to elevate pandemic response plans. With these proactive measures and our employees' vigilance, we've been able to thus far minimize the impact to our organization and its operations. 
We've had only one confirmed case of COVID-19, and I'm pleased to say that employee has made a full recovery and is back at work. We knew our employees weren't alone dealing with the uncertainty, so we made commitments to our customers to ease the burden caused by this pandemic. We were one of the first to implement the suspension of disconnections, and as conditions further deteriorated, we extended the original time line through June 1.  
Additionally, we're waiving late fees and adding new payment options for customers to help individuals and businesses manage the impacts of these hard-hitting times. I'm proud of our team's planning, innovation and focus that has significantly limited the impact to our business and the communities and customers we serve.  
Moving on to Slide 6. I'll expand on the operational impact we've seen. There is no doubt that this pandemic has impacted our business, but we believe that we remain well positioned. Our flexible capital plan is focused on critical projects that should increase reliability and drive down future operating costs. The majority of these projects are smaller in nature and diversified across our service territories. As a result, our plan has less risk when compared to a plan that includes large projects that not only have regulatory risk, but also carry increased supply chain and human capital risk. We currently don't see a need to reduce our capital program over the 5-year forecast period. We have, however, deferred certain projects due to our commitment to practicing social distancing. These projects have been postponed until later in the year or some have been pushed into 2021. This is a shift in timing and not a reduction in our 5-year infrastructure investment plan. Another benefit of our plan is that it does not require the issuance of additional capital or equity while eliminates market risk.  
Throughout March and April, we've closely monitored our supply chain for availability of labor and materials. Fortunately, we were well positioned with a diverse supplier mix and intentional redundancies in our major supplier categories. As a result, we haven't encountered significant issues and currently don't anticipate availability issues with our supply chain. We conducted regular communication with our Tier 1 and Tier 2 critical suppliers and participate in industry-wide collaboration efforts to stay ahead of potential issues. While we did see some short-term impacts on PPE, mask and sanitation products, we didn't see any significant delays or major inventory issues, and we were also able to leverage several local suppliers who rose to the occasion to fill the gaps.  
Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have remained in close contact with our large commercial and industrial customers in order to form a more complete picture of how this is likely to impact demand. As stay-at-home and business restrictions were put in place, we definitely saw commercial and industrial load decline as businesses throughout our service territory began to reduce production, furlough and layout workers, and send employees home to work remotely and even shut down.  
Tony will give you some additional details in a bit, but fortunately, as we saw commercial and industrial sales decline, residential load had a healthy uptick. As a result, increases in higher-margin residential sales served to offset much of the lower margins from commercial and industrial sales. However, since the sales impacts occurred late in the quarter, it was not a significant driver for margin overall, and we did not see a material impact in the quarter.  
In April, we continued to see commercial and industrial load decline, while residential demand continue to grow. As we evaluate retail sales from April, we see a more complete picture of the full month impact that COVID-19 has had on our sales. Although it's too early to say with certainty that April reflects the greatest impact to demand we will see during the pandemic, we are optimistic that the region's easing of business restrictions in May, combined with the continued increase in residential demand, will support improved retail sales as we head into the summer months. Although we realized that it may take a while to ramp up, it's encouraging to hear some of our large customers talk about their implementation plans and even when they include a gradual restart of operations. We are studying a range of possible outcomes, and we have plans to develop to remain well positioned in each scenario, supported by strong liquidity and several levers to pull on the O&M side, which would reduce the financial impact of a sales decline. Our flexibility and resiliency have allowed us to remain focused on all of our strategic priorities.  
Now to Slide 7. On the regulatory front, we haven't had to navigate any significant disruptions and don't envision this becoming an issue since we have no major dockets open and none of the near-term horizon with our next rate cases slated for 2022 and 2023. This has given us the opportunity to speak with the regulators in a time of reprieve from rate increases or any other large request. The Kansas Corporation Commission put a stay on new dockets and shut down operations in mid-March, but then returned in early April and have been working remotely since.  
Missouri Public Service Commission has been working remotely since March 24 and never officially halted operations. We were able to stay in constant contact with both commissions to update them on our latest pandemic response efforts and to discuss our concerns. As you can imagine, conversations were primarily focused on our customers' needs.  
In addition to our suspension of disconnects and waiving fees for our customers, we've also been discussing new options to allow businesses to pay back bills over a longer period and for residential customers to move to payment plans to avoid large growth in monthly payments over their norm.  
As we explained our efforts to track pandemic expenses and potential loss revenue, conversations with our commissions expanded into discussions around alternatives for recovery of these impacts as well as ways to manage the impact of the expected increases and bad debt expenses. Yesterday, we filed for an accounting authority order in both Kansas and Missouri that will allow us to track certain expenses and lost revenue as well as any offset -- cost offsets for future consideration at our next rate cases. The Kansas Commission staff also filed yesterday its report and recommendation, recommending that all utilities be required to offer minimum customer protections of a 12-month payment plan for all delinquent account balances that arose as a result of the disconnect stay and a waiver of our late fees during the period of delinquency and repayment, coupled with a recommendation that utilities be allowed to defer cost of bad debt expense and fee waiver as a result of the new customer protections. If adopted by the KCC, we see this as a true benefit to both customers and the company. The staff also stated any additional customer programs or deferral request should be addressed in a utility-specific AAO request. 
Switching to a legislative update. In Kansas, the legislature recessed in mid-March, which is 2 weeks earlier than normal, and are likely to come back in May to finish the budget. There are a couple of items that address utilities, including a bill we are strongly in favor of that allows us to offer special economic rates to grow business and jobs in Kansas, similar to what exists in Missouri. At this point, we don't know what the agenda will be or what, if anything, will get done yet this year.  
In Missouri, the legislature reached its annual spring break in March. They came back last week and there was only a couple of weeks left in session. Constitutionally, they must pass a budget by Friday. We don't believe much, if anything though, that impacts us will be considered this year. We are not actively pursuing legislation in Missouri this year.  
Finally, let me give you a quick update on our Board committee process before I turn things over to Tony. As many of you probably saw, our Strategic Review & Operation Committee's recommendation to the Board has been delayed by a couple of months. We're still meeting, albeit virtually, and remain focused on our two-pronged mission: evaluating enhancements to our long-term stand-alone operating plan and exploring potential opportunities for strategic alternatives. While nothing has changed from the committee's perspective, the dynamics in the market warranted the delay in our time line. The committee now plans to deliver its findings to the Board by July 30, and then the Board plans to provide an update in August. Again, the market turmoil doesn't change the focus of our committee, but it did alter our original calendar as we wanted to give some time for things to stabilize as we work through our processes.  
And with that, I will turn the call over to Tony to cover first quarter results."

I'll start with results on Slide 10 of the presentation. We reported first quarter 2020 GAAP earnings of $0.31 per share compared to $0.39 per share in the first quarter of 2019. The decrease in EPS is primari",1168,"Thank you, Terry, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with results on Slide 10 of the presentation. We reported first quarter 2020 GAAP earnings of $0.31 per share compared to $0.39 per share in the first quarter of 2019. The decrease in EPS is primarily due to warmer winter weather and lower COLI benefits, partially offset by lower operation and maintenance expense. We turned in a solid quarter, notwithstanding extremely warm winter weather that obviously hurt sales, and no COLI income compared to over $6 million in the same period last year.  
Adjusted non-GAAP earnings were $0.41 per share compared to $0.44 per share in the same period a year ago. As shown in the chart on Slide 10, adjusted EPS was driven lower primarily by unfavorable weather and lower other income and was partially offset by lower O&M and fewer shares outstanding. Importantly, our efforts towards cost management yielded a $37 million decline in O&M, 13% lower than the first quarter last year. This reduction is highlighted by a decrease in T&D expenses due to cost reduction initiatives and the impacts from the January 2019 winter storm, overall reduced headcount and associated benefit expense, and lower plant expense from fewer outages at our generating units.  
As far as merger savings go, we continue to execute well. We exceeded our 2019 targets, remained ahead of schedule through the first quarter this year, and expect to beat the 2020 mark established by the original merger targets. When we first began discussing the accretion of Evergy, there are nearly 6,400 positions among our legacy companies and Wolf Creek, our shared nuclear facility. Today, we're down to about 5,400. We've created a more efficient company without sacrificing operating capabilities, and all of this has been accomplished while staying true to our commitment of no involuntary layoffs as a result of the merger. Instead, we've capitalized on headcount reduction through normal attrition and voluntary separation programs.  
Turning to sales. We saw a decline in sales throughout the quarter, primarily from a change in year-over-year weather. Residential sales were down 10%, commercial declined 5% and industrial sales fell 0.6%, respectively. Compared to last year, heating degree days were 19% lower and we estimate the impact to earnings was $0.12, compared to normal heating degree days were 9% lower. We estimate earnings were unfavorably impacted by about $0.06.  
On Slide 11, I'll give you some details on the sales impact from COVID-19. As we move through March and witnessed the closing of businesses, we started to see the impacts. As expected on a weather-normalized basis, commercial and industrial sales started to decline. As the shelter-at-home provisions kept folks in their homes, we saw a corresponding pickup in residential sales. As Terry mentioned earlier, from an earnings perspective, the higher margins in residential sales provided an offset, at least partially, to lower margin commercial and industrial sales. Given the timing of pandemic response actions in our jurisdictions, the resulting impacts became more apparent throughout the month of March. As we monitored sales through April, we saw further declining trends in commercial and industrial loads. Residential sales remained elevated but didn't keep pace with the degradation on the commercial and industrial side. Compared to last year, our estimated weather-normalized total retail sales were about 8% lower.  
Turning to the change in sales mix across customer classes. Residential sales were up roughly 5%, while commercial and industrial sales declined 13% and 15%, respectively. Again, the higher residential sales will provide some offset. We expect trends at these levels to weigh on retail margin. 
If we adjust for 2 large oil refinery customers that had planned reduced usage outside of COVID-19 impacts, our April industrial sales decline would be around 10% compared to last year. As you can see in the graph on the slide, as those customers started ramping up, we saw the corresponding pickup in sales towards the end of April. Additionally, it's important to note that 2 industrial sectors that are prevalent in our territory are experiencing unusual events simultaneous to COVID-19. The airline industry is dealing with the 737 MAX issue and oil production refineries with the oil crisis. Both issues could still weigh on demand in future months irrespective of the recovery from COVID-19.  
Now we look to offset margin declines by balancing the preservation of long-term value creation and adjustments to O&M. Some of the levers we will pull include a hiring pause, reduced travel spend, reduced discretionary maintenance spending and potentially an additional voluntary early retirement program. While we have a ways to go in terms of opening up our economy, we may be turning a corner as many businesses in our territory, including a number of large manufacturing facilities, that plans to reopen later this month after multi-week shutdowns.  
Moving on to Slide 10. Let me touch on our latest financing activities and liquidity. On April 2, Evergy Kansas Central issued $500 million of 30-year first mortgage bonds at 3.45%. Proceeds will be used to redeem $250 million of the 5.1% bonds that were set to mature in July, and the remainder proceeds were used to reduce short-term debt. Also in April, we requested authority from the Missouri Public Service Commission to issue up to $400 million at Evergy Metro to pay down short-term debt and further bolster our liquidity position. I'm happy to report the commission approved our request yesterday, and we expect to complete a transaction by midyear. We ended April with a total liquidity of $1.9 billion with $1.6 billion of that as capacity available on our master credit facility and over $300 million of cash on hand. We are confident in our liquidity position across the range of these scenarios that we've contemplated.  
Now wrapping up on Slide 13. As a reminder, we haven't issued 2020 EPS guidance, and we don't have plans to issue guidance during the pendency of the committee's work, but I can give you an update on some of the drivers for the year that have changed. Obviously, given the sales trends that we're seeing thus far, we now expect a weather-normalized sales decline this year. With ongoing uncertainty, it's too early to estimate the full year impact. With our cost reduction execution in the first quarter and the expected incremental reductions that we're targeting for the remainder of the year, we are now targeting a 6% to 9% reduction in adjusted O&M in 2020 compared to 2019 versus our previous target of 5% to 8% reduction.  
We remain optimistic as we're starting to see the nation and our service territories begin to open back up. We realize it's going to take some time for the economy and sales to bounce back. We're confident in our position and plan as we all unite together to put this behind us. We will continue to do our part and are staying focused on doing the right things for employees, customers, communities and shareholders.  
With that, I will turn the call back over to Terry."

So tell me if I'm missing something there, one versus the other. And then the follow-up to that would be, how do you think about '21 and onwards?

And so I think what we're seeing though is that even though we saw a downtick in April, as most folks would expect, we're happy to see that we -- it is manageable.

Before I get started, I want to extend my deepest sympathies to those that have been directly impacted by the pandemic. I'd also like to extend my sincere appreciation to those professionals and critical functions who continue to work, especially first responders and frontline medical professionals who have been the real heroes through all of this. 
As I'm sure it's been for everyone, the last couple of months have been unique and challenging. I'm proud to work in the industry as a whole, and I'm proud of Evergy, specifically, what we've done to meet the needs of our customers, employees and shareholders. We remain laser-focused on doing our job to deliver safe and uninterrupted power, especially during a time when we all are relying on electricity more than ever to power our increasingly virtual lives. 
I want to thank our entire team for their continued focus on safety, customer service and execution during these trying times. This effort has been a reflection of Evergy's people first culture. 
Now turning to results. As you can imagine, we have a lot to cover this morning, so I'll cover the emerging issues and our response to those and turn it over to Tony to get into the details of our financial results, where despite the warmer-than-normal winter weather, we delivered GAAP earnings per share of $0.31 and non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share of $0.41. Also note, the Board displayed confidence in the flexibility and stability of our current plan by declaring a dividend in line with previous quarter. 
Now on Slide 5, I'll update you on the latest on our COVID-19 response plans. Being in the Midwest has been an advantage as we face this global pandemic. Not only does our service territory include rural areas that naturally provide for easier social distancing, but from a time perspective, we were a couple of weeks later than many other parts of the nation, which allowed us to take proactive measures towards the health and safety of our employees, customers and communities. 
Before confirmed cases started to arise in Kansas and Missouri, we implemented our pandemic response plan, as outlined in our crisis management plan, which resulted in our employees able to work from home doing so, and those in critical operational functions taking preventative measures to ensure the continued delivery of safe and reliable power. This included practicing social distancing protocols among fellow employees as well as with customers and in the community. And we began implementing remote staging locations to reduce overall contact. Over 1,500 employees were trained to administer temperature testing, and we are administering over 7,000 temperature recordings per week. With over 2,000 employees working from home and with schools and businesses closed, including most childcare providers, we expanded our paid time-off policies to increase flexibility to accommodate employees as they deal with these unprecedented times. 
Our resolute focus on employee safety is strengthened by technology and innovation. Our team developed a mapping tool to actively monitor COVID-19 risk exposure to our people. By tracking these conditions geographically as they worsened, we were able to pinpoint developing hotspots. This up-to-date analysis allowed us to take tactical decisions regarding when and where to elevate pandemic response plans. With these proactive measures and our employees' vigilance, we've been able to thus far minimize the impact to our organization and its operations. 
We've had only one confirmed case of COVID-19, and I'm pleased to say that employee has made a full recovery and is back at work. We knew our employees weren't alone dealing with the uncertainty, so we made commitments to our customers to ease the burden caused by this pandemic. We were one of the first to implement the suspension of disconnections, and as conditions further deteriorated, we extended the original time line through June 1. 
Additionally, we're waiving late fees and adding new payment options for customers to help individuals and businesses manage the impacts of these hard-hitting times. I'm proud of our team's planning, innovation and focus that has significantly limited the impact to our business and the communities and customers we serve. 
Moving on to Slide 6. I'll expand on the operational impact we've seen. There is no doubt that this pandemic has impacted our business, but we believe that we remain well positioned. Our flexible capital plan is focused on critical projects that should increase reliability and drive down future operating costs. The majority of these projects are smaller in nature and diversified across our service territories. As a result, our plan has less risk when compared to a plan that includes large projects that not only have regulatory risk, but also carry increased supply chain and human capital risk. We currently don't see a need to reduce our capital program over the 5-year forecast period. We have, however, deferred certain projects due to our commitment to practicing social distancing. These projects have been postponed until later in the year or some have been pushed into 2021. This is a shift in timing and not a reduction in our 5-year infrastructure investment plan. Another benefit of our plan is that it does not require the issuance of additional capital or equity while eliminates market risk. 
Throughout March and April, we've closely monitored our supply chain for availability of labor and materials. Fortunately, we were well positioned with a diverse supplier mix and intentional redundancies in our major supplier categories. As a result, we haven't encountered significant issues and currently don't anticipate availability issues with our supply chain. We conducted regular communication with our Tier 1 and Tier 2 critical suppliers and participate in industry-wide collaboration efforts to stay ahead of potential issues. While we did see some short-term impacts on PPE, mask and sanitation products, we didn't see any significant delays or major inventory issues, and we were also able to leverage several local suppliers who rose to the occasion to fill the gaps. 
Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have remained in close contact with our large commercial and industrial customers in order to form a more complete picture of how this is likely to impact demand. As stay-at-home orders and business restrictions were put in place, we definitely saw commercial and industrial load decline as businesses throughout our service territory began to reduce production, furlough and lay off workers, and send employees home to work remotely and even shut down. 
Tony will give you some additional details in a bit, but fortunately, as we saw commercial and industrial sales decline, residential load had a healthy uptick. As a result, increases in higher-margin residential sales served to offset much of the lower margins from commercial and industrial sales. However, since the sales impacts occurred late in the quarter, it was not a significant driver for margin overall, and we did not see a material impact in the quarter. 
In April, we continued to see commercial and industrial load decline, while residential demand continue to grow. As we evaluate retail sales from April, we see a more complete picture of the full month impact that COVID-19 has had on our sales. Although it's too early to say with certainty that April reflects the greatest impact to demand we will see during the pandemic, we are optimistic that the region's easing of business restrictions in May, combined with the continued increase in residential demand, will support improved retail sales as we head into the summer months. Although we realized that it may take a while to ramp up, it's encouraging to hear some of our large customers talk about their implementation plans and even when they include a gradual restart of operations. We are studying a range of possible outcomes, and we have plans developed to remain well positioned in each scenario, supported by strong liquidity and several levers to pull on the O&M side, which would reduce the financial impact of a sales decline. Our flexibility and resiliency have allowed us to remain focused on all of our strategic priorities. 
Now to Slide 7. On the regulatory front, we haven't had to navigate any significant disruptions and don't envision this becoming an issue since we have no major dockets open and none at the near-term horizon with our next rate cases slated for 2022 and 2023. This has given us the opportunity to speak with the regulators in a time of reprieve from rate increases or any other large request. The Kansas Corporation Commission put a stay on new dockets and shut down operations in mid-March, but then returned in early April and have been working remotely since. 
Missouri Public Service Commission has been working remotely since March 24 and never officially halted operations. We were able to stay in constant contact with both commissions to update them on our latest pandemic response efforts and to discuss our concerns. As you can imagine, conversations were primarily focused on our customers' needs. 
In addition to our suspension of disconnects and waiving fees for our customers, we've also been discussing new options to allow businesses to pay back bills over a longer period and for residential customers to move to payment plans to avoid large growth in monthly payments over their norm. 
As we explained our efforts to track pandemic expenses and potential loss revenue, conversations with our commissions expanded into discussions around alternatives for recovery of these impacts as well as ways to manage the impact of the expected increases in bad debt expenses. Yesterday, we filed for an accounting authority order in both Kansas and Missouri that will allow us to track certain expenses and lost revenue as well as any offset -- cost offsets for future consideration at our next rate cases. The Kansas Commission staff also filed yesterday its report and recommendation, recommending that all utilities be required to offer minimum customer protections of a 12-month payment plan for all delinquent account balances that arose as a result of the disconnect stay and a waiver of our late fees during the period of delinquency and repayment, coupled with a recommendation that utilities be allowed to defer cost of bad debt expense and fee waiver as a result of the new customer protections. If adopted by the KCC, we see this as a true benefit to both customers and the company. The staff also stated any additional customer programs or deferral request should be addressed in a utility-specific AAO request. 
Switching to a legislative update. In Kansas, the legislature recessed in mid-March, which is 2 weeks earlier than normal, and are likely to come back in May to finish the budget. There are a couple of items that address utilities, including a bill we are strongly in favor of that allows us to offer special economic rates to grow business and jobs in Kansas, similar to what exists in Missouri. At this point, we don't know what the agenda will be or what, if anything, will get done yet this year. 
In Missouri, the legislature reached its annual spring break in March. They came back last week and there was only a couple of weeks left in session. Constitutionally, they must pass a budget by Friday. We don't believe much, if anything though, that impacts us will be considered this year. We are not actively pursuing legislation in Missouri this year. 
Finally, let me give you a quick update on our Board committee process before I turn things over to Tony. As many of you probably saw, our Strategic Review & Operation Committee's recommendation to the Board has been delayed by a couple of months. We're still meeting, albeit virtually, and remain focused on our two-pronged mission: evaluating enhancements to our long-term stand-alone operating plan and exploring potential opportunities for strategic alternatives. While nothing has changed from the committee's perspective, the dynamics in the market warranted the delay in our time line. The committee now plans to deliver its findings to the Board by July 30, and then the Board plans to provide an update in August. Again, the market turmoil doesn't change the focus of our committee, but it did alter our original calendar as we wanted to give some time for things to stabilize as we work through our processes. 
And with that, I will turn the call over to Tony to cover first quarter results."

I'll start with results on Slide 10 of the presentation. We reported first quarter 2020 GAAP earnings of $0.31 per share compared to $0.39 per share in the first quarter of 2019.

We reported first quarter 2020 GAAP earnings of $0.31 per share compared to $0.39 per share in the first quarter of 2019. The decrease in EPS is primarily due to warmer winter weather and lower COLI benefits, partially offset by lower operation and maintenance expense. We turned in a solid quarter, notwithstanding extremely warm winter weather that obviously hurt sales, and no COLI income compared to over $6 million in the same period last year. 
Adjusted non-GAAP earnings were $0.41 per share compared to $0.44 per share in the same period a year ago. As shown in the chart on Slide 10, adjusted EPS was driven lower primarily by unfavorable weather and lower other income and was partially offset by lower O&M and fewer shares outstanding. Importantly, our efforts towards cost management yielded a $37 million decline in O&M, 13% lower than the first quarter last year. This reduction is highlighted by a decrease in T&D expenses due to cost reduction initiatives and the impacts from the January 2019 winter storm, overall reduced head count and associated benefit expense and lower plant expense from fewer outages at our generating units. 
As far as merger savings go, we continue to execute well. We exceeded our 2019 targets, remained ahead of schedule through the first quarter this year and expect to beat the 2020 mark established by the original merger targets. When we first began discussing the creation of Evergy, there are nearly 6,400 positions among our legacy companies and Wolf Creek, our shared nuclear facility. Today, we're down to about 5,400. We've created a more efficient company without sacrificing operating capabilities, and all of this has been accomplished while staying true to our commitment of no involuntary layoffs as a result of the merger. Instead, we've capitalized on head count reduction through normal attrition and voluntary separation programs. 
Turning to sales. We saw a decline in sales throughout the quarter, primarily from a change in year-over-year weather. Residential sales were down 10%, commercial declined 5% and industrial sales fell 0.6%, respectively. Compared to last year, heating degree days were 19% lower and we estimate the impact to earnings was $0.12. Compared to normal, heating degree days were 9% lower. We estimate earnings were unfavorably impacted by about $0.06. 
On Slide 11, I'll give you some details on the sales impact from COVID-19. As we move through March and witnessed the closing of businesses, we started to see the impacts. As expected on a weather-normalized basis, commercial and industrial sales started to decline. As the shelter-at-home provisions kept folks in their homes, we saw a corresponding pickup in residential sales. As Terry mentioned earlier, from an earnings perspective, the higher margins in residential sales provided an offset, at least partially, to lower margin commercial and industrial sales. Given the timing of pandemic response actions in our jurisdictions, the resulting impacts became more apparent throughout the month of March. As we monitored sales through April, we saw further declining trends in commercial and industrial loads. Residential sales remained elevated but didn't keep pace with the degradation on the commercial and industrial side. Compared to last year, our estimated weather-normalized total retail sales were about 8% lower. 
Turning to the change in sales mix across customer classes. Residential sales were up roughly 5%, while commercial and industrial sales declined 13% and 15%, respectively. Again, the higher residential sales will provide some offset. We expect trends at these levels to weigh on retail margin. 
If we adjust for 2 large oil refinery customers that had planned reduced usage outside of COVID-19 impacts, our April industrial sales decline would be around 10% compared to last year. As you can see in the graph on the slide, as those customers started ramping up, we saw the corresponding pickup in sales towards the end of April. Additionally, it's important to note that 2 industrial sectors that are prevalent in our territory are experiencing unusual events simultaneous to COVID-19. The airline industry is dealing with the 737 MAX issue and oil production refineries with the oil crisis. Both issues could still weigh on demand in future months irrespective of the recovery from COVID-19. 
Now we look to offset margin declines by balancing the preservation of long-term value creation and adjustments to O&M. Some of the levers we will pull include a hiring pause, reduced travel spend, reduced discretionary maintenance spending and potentially an additional voluntary early retirement program. While we have a ways to go in terms of opening up our economy, we may be turning a corner as many businesses in our territory, including a number of large manufacturing facilities, have plans to reopen later this month after multi-week shutdowns. 
Moving on to Slide 10. Let me touch on our latest financing activities and liquidity. On April 2, Evergy Kansas Central issued $500 million of 30-year first mortgage bonds at 3.45%. Proceeds will be used to redeem $250 million of the 5.1% bonds that were set to mature in July, and the remainder proceeds were used to reduce short-term debt. Also in April, we requested authority from the Missouri Public Service Commission to issue up to $400 million at Evergy Metro to pay down short-term debt and further bolster our liquidity position. I'm happy to report the commission approved our request yesterday, and we expect to complete a transaction by midyear. We ended April with a total liquidity of $1.9 billion with $1.6 billion of that as capacity available on our master credit facility and over $300 million of cash on hand. We are confident in our liquidity position across the range of these scenarios that we've contemplated. 
Now wrapping up on Slide 13. As a reminder, we haven't issued 2020 EPS guidance, and we don't have plans to issue guidance during the pendency of the committee's work, but I can give you an update on some of the drivers for the year that have changed. Obviously, given the sales trends that we're seeing thus far, we now expect a weather-normalized sales decline this year. With ongoing uncertainty, it's too early to estimate the full year impact. With our cost reduction execution in the first quarter and the expected incremental reductions that we're targeting for the remainder of the year, we are now targeting a 6% to 9% reduction in adjusted O&M in 2020 compared to 2019 versus our previous target of 5% to 8% reduction. 
We remain optimistic as we're starting to see the nation and our service territories begin to open back up. We realize it's going to take some time for the economy and sales to bounce back. We're confident in our position and plan as we all unite together to put this behind us. We will continue to do our part and are staying focused on doing the right things for employees, customers, communities and shareholders. 
With that, I will turn the call back over to Terry."

What -- when you think about an EPS shift, and I know you don't have guidance out there for '20, but how much of a reduction are we talking about in sales expectations relative to what seems like a modest reduction from 5% to 8% to 6% to 9% reduction on the O&M? So tell me if I'm missing something there, one versus the other. And then the follow-up to that would be, how do you think about '21 and onwards?

That's less directly connected, I guess, to what we're seeing from sales because, to your first question, it's really hard, again, as we said, to say April would necessarily be what we'd expect going forward. And so I think what we're seeing though is that even though we saw a downtick in April, as most folks would expect, we're happy to see that we -- it is manageable. And at least in the near term, we think we're able to offset a lot of that impact. Obviously, if those impacts lasted all year long, it get more difficult as the year went on.

Before I get started, I want to extend my deepest sympathies to those that have been directly impacted by the pandemic. I'd also like to extend my sincere appreciation to those professionals and critical functions who continue to work, especially first responders and frontline medical professionals who have been the real heroes through all of this. 
As I'm sure it's been for everyone, the last couple of months have been unique and challenging. I'm proud to work in the industry as a whole, and I'm proud of Evergy, specifically, what we've done to meet the needs of our customers, employees and shareholders. We remain laser-focused on doing our job to deliver safe and uninterrupted power, especially during a time when we all are relying on electricity more than ever to power our increasingly virtual lives. 
I want to thank our entire team for their continued focus on safety, customer service and execution during these trying times. This effort has been a reflection of Evergy's people first culture. 
Now turning to results. As you can imagine, we have a lot to cover this morning, so I'll cover the emerging issues and our response to those and turn it over to Tony to get into the details of our financial results, where despite the warmer-than-normal winter weather, we delivered GAAP earnings per share of $0.31 and non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share of $0.41. Also note, the Board displayed confidence in the flexibility and stability of our current plan by declaring a dividend in line with previous quarter. 
Now on Slide 5, I'll update you on the latest on our COVID-19 response plans. Being in the Midwest has been an advantage as we face this global pandemic. Not only does our service territory include rural areas that naturally provide for easier social distancing, but from a time perspective, we were a couple of weeks later than many other parts of the nation, which allowed us to take proactive measures towards the health and safety of our employees, customers and communities. 
Before confirmed cases started to arise in Kansas and Missouri, we implemented our pandemic response plan, as outlined in our crisis management plan, which resulted in our employees able to work from home doing so, and those in critical operational functions taking preventative measures to ensure the continued delivery of safe and reliable power. This included practicing social distancing protocols among fellow employees as well as with customers and in the community. And we began implementing remote staging locations to reduce overall contact. Over 1,500 employees were trained to administer temperature testing, and we are administering over 7,000 temperature recordings per week. With over 2,000 employees working from home and with schools and businesses closed, including most childcare providers, we expanded our paid time-off policies to increase flexibility to accommodate employees as they deal with these unprecedented times. 
Our resolute focus on employee safety is strengthened by technology and innovation. Our team developed a mapping tool to actively monitor COVID-19 risk exposure to our people. By tracking these conditions geographically as they worsened, we were able to pinpoint developing hotspots. This up-to-date analysis allowed us to take tactical decisions regarding when and where to elevate pandemic response plans. With these proactive measures and our employees' vigilance, we've been able to thus far minimize the impact to our organization and its operations. 
We've had only one confirmed case of COVID-19, and I'm pleased to say that employee has made a full recovery and is back at work. We knew our employees weren't alone dealing with the uncertainty, so we made commitments to our customers to ease the burden caused by this pandemic. We were one of the first to implement the suspension of disconnections, and as conditions further deteriorated, we extended the original time line through June 1. 
Additionally, we're waiving late fees and adding new payment options for customers to help individuals and businesses manage the impacts of these hard-hitting times. I'm proud of our team's planning, innovation and focus that has significantly limited the impact to our business and the communities and customers we serve. 
Moving on to Slide 6. I'll expand on the operational impact we've seen. There is no doubt that this pandemic has impacted our business, but we believe that we remain well positioned. Our flexible capital plan is focused on critical projects that should increase reliability and drive down future operating costs. The majority of these projects are smaller in nature and diversified across our service territories. As a result, our plan has less risk when compared to a plan that includes large projects that not only have regulatory risk, but also carry increased supply chain and human capital risk. We currently don't see a need to reduce our capital program over the 5-year forecast period. We have, however, deferred certain projects due to our commitment to practicing social distancing. These projects have been postponed until later in the year or some have been pushed into 2021. This is a shift in timing and not a reduction in our 5-year infrastructure investment plan. Another benefit of our plan is that it does not require the issuance of additional capital or equity while eliminates market risk. 
Throughout March and April, we've closely monitored our supply chain for availability of labor and materials. Fortunately, we were well positioned with a diverse supplier mix and intentional redundancies in our major supplier categories. As a result, we haven't encountered significant issues and currently don't anticipate availability issues with our supply chain. We conducted regular communication with our Tier 1 and Tier 2 critical suppliers and participate in industry-wide collaboration efforts to stay ahead of potential issues. While we did see some short-term impacts on PPE, mask and sanitation products, we didn't see any significant delays or major inventory issues, and we were also able to leverage several local suppliers who rose to the occasion to fill the gaps. 
Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have remained in close contact with our large commercial and industrial customers in order to form a more complete picture of how this is likely to impact demand. As stay-at-home orders and business restrictions were put in place, we definitely saw commercial and industrial load decline as businesses throughout our service territory began to reduce production, furlough and lay off workers, and send employees home to work remotely and even shut down. 
Tony will give you some additional details in a bit, but fortunately, as we saw commercial and industrial sales decline, residential load had a healthy uptick. As a result, increases in higher-margin residential sales served to offset much of the lower margins from commercial and industrial sales. However, since the sales impacts occurred late in the quarter, it was not a significant driver for margin overall, and we did not see a material impact in the quarter. 
In April, we continued to see commercial and industrial load decline, while residential demand continue to grow. As we evaluate retail sales from April, we see a more complete picture of the full month impact that COVID-19 has had on our sales. Although it's too early to say with certainty that April reflects the greatest impact to demand we will see during the pandemic, we are optimistic that the region's easing of business restrictions in May, combined with the continued increase in residential demand, will support improved retail sales as we head into the summer months. Although we realized that it may take a while to ramp up, it's encouraging to hear some of our large customers talk about their implementation plans and even when they include a gradual restart of operations. We are studying a range of possible outcomes, and we have plans developed to remain well positioned in each scenario, supported by strong liquidity and several levers to pull on the O&M side which would reduce the financial impact of a sales decline. Our flexibility and resiliency have allowed us to remain focused on all of our strategic priorities. 
Now to Slide 7. On the regulatory front, we haven't had to navigate any significant disruptions and don't envision this becoming an issue since we have no major dockets open and none at the near-term horizon with our next rate cases slated for 2022 and 2023. This has given us the opportunity to speak with the regulators in a time of reprieve from rate increases or any other large request. The Kansas Corporation Commission put a stay on new dockets and shut down operations in mid-March, but then returned in early April and have been working remotely since. 
Missouri Public Service Commission has been working remotely since March 24 and never officially halted operations. We were able to stay in constant contact with both commissions to update them on our latest pandemic response efforts and to discuss our concerns. As you can imagine, conversations were primarily focused on our customers' needs. 
In addition to our suspension of disconnects and waiving fees for our customers, we've also been discussing new options to allow businesses to pay back bills over a longer period and for residential customers to move to payment plans to avoid large growth in monthly payments over their norm. 
As we explained our efforts to track pandemic expenses and potential loss revenue, conversations with our commissions expanded into discussions around alternatives for recovery of these impacts as well as ways to manage the impact of the expected increases in bad debt expenses. Yesterday, we filed for an accounting authority order in both Kansas and Missouri that will allow us to track certain expenses and lost revenue as well as any offset -- cost offsets for future consideration at our next rate cases. The Kansas Commission staff also filed yesterday its report and recommendation, recommending that all utilities be required to offer minimum customer protections of a 12-month payment plan for all delinquent account balances that arose as a result of the disconnect stay and a waiver of our late fees during the period of delinquency and repayment, coupled with a recommendation that utilities be allowed to defer cost of bad debt expense and fee waiver as a result of the new customer protections. If adopted by the KCC, we see this as a true benefit to both customers and the company. The staff also stated any additional customer programs or deferral request should be addressed in a utility-specific AAO request. 
Switching to a legislative update. In Kansas, the legislature recessed in mid-March, which is 2 weeks earlier than normal, and are likely to come back in May to finish the budget. There are a couple of items that address utilities, including a bill we are strongly in favor of that allows us to offer special economic rates to grow business and jobs in Kansas, similar to what exists in Missouri. At this point, we don't know what the agenda will be or what, if anything, will get done yet this year. 
In Missouri, the legislature reached its annual spring break in March. They came back last week and there was only a couple of weeks left in session. Constitutionally, they must pass a budget by Friday. We don't believe much, if anything though, that impacts us will be considered this year. We are not actively pursuing legislation in Missouri this year. 
Finally, let me give you a quick update on our Board committee process before I turn things over to Tony. As many of you probably saw, our Strategic Review & Operation Committee's recommendation to the Board has been delayed by a couple of months. We're still meeting, albeit virtually, and remain focused on our two-pronged mission: evaluating enhancements to our long-term stand-alone operating plan and exploring potential opportunities for strategic alternatives. While nothing has changed from the committee's perspective, the dynamics in the market warranted the delay in our time line. The committee now plans to deliver its findings to the Board by July 30, and then the Board plans to provide an update in August. Again, the market turmoil doesn't change the focus of our committee, but it did alter our original calendar as we wanted to give some time for things to stabilize as we work through our processes. 
And with that, I will turn the call over to Tony to cover first quarter results."

I'll start with results on Slide 10 of the presentation. We reported first quarter 2020 GAAP earnings of $0.31 per share compared to $0.39 per share in the first quarter of 2019. The decrease in EPS is primari",1170,"Thank you, Terry, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with results on Slide 10 of the presentation. We reported first quarter 2020 GAAP earnings of $0.31 per share compared to $0.39 per share in the first quarter of 2019. The decrease in EPS is primarily due to warmer winter weather and lower COLI benefits, partially offset by lower operation and maintenance expense. We turned in a solid quarter, notwithstanding extremely warm winter weather that obviously hurt sales, and no COLI income compared to over $6 million in the same period last year. 
Adjusted non-GAAP earnings were $0.41 per share compared to $0.44 per share in the same period a year ago. As shown in the chart on Slide 10, adjusted EPS was driven lower primarily by unfavorable weather and lower other income and was partially offset by lower O&M and fewer shares outstanding. Importantly, our efforts towards cost management yielded a $37 million decline in O&M, 13% lower than the first quarter last year. This reduction is highlighted by a decrease in T&D expenses due to cost reduction initiatives and the impacts from the January 2019 winter storm, overall reduced head count and associated benefit expense and lower plant expense from fewer outages at our generating units. 
As far as merger savings go, we continue to execute well. We exceeded our 2019 targets, remained ahead of schedule through the first quarter this year and expect to beat the 2020 mark established by the original merger targets. When we first began discussing the creation of Evergy, there are nearly 6,400 positions among our legacy companies and Wolf Creek, our shared nuclear facility. Today, we're down to about 5,400. We've created a more efficient company without sacrificing operating capabilities, and all of this has been accomplished while staying true to our commitment of no involuntary layoffs as a result of the merger. Instead, we've capitalized on head count reduction through normal attrition and voluntary separation programs. 
Turning to sales. We saw a decline in sales throughout the quarter, primarily from a change in year-over-year weather. Residential sales were down 10%, commercial declined 5% and industrial sales fell 0.6%, respectively. Compared to last year, heating degree days were 19% lower and we estimate the impact to earnings was $0.12. Compared to normal, heating degree days were 9% lower. We estimate earnings were unfavorably impacted by about $0.06. 
On Slide 11, I'll give you some details on the sales impact from COVID-19. As we move through March and witnessed the closing of businesses, we started to see the impacts. As expected on a weather-normalized basis, commercial and industrial sales started to decline. As the shelter-at-home provisions kept folks in their homes, we saw a corresponding pickup in residential sales. As Terry mentioned earlier, from an earnings perspective, the higher margins in residential sales provided an offset, at least partially, to lower margin commercial and industrial sales. Given the timing of pandemic response actions in our jurisdictions, the resulting impacts became more apparent throughout the month of March. As we monitored sales through April, we saw further declining trends in commercial and industrial loads. Residential sales remained elevated but didn't keep pace with the degradation on the commercial and industrial side. Compared to last year, our estimated weather-normalized total retail sales were about 8% lower. 
Turning to the change in sales mix across customer classes. Residential sales were up roughly 5%, while commercial and industrial sales declined 13% and 15%, respectively. Again, the higher residential sales will provide some offset. We expect trends at these levels to weigh on retail margin. 
If we adjust for 2 large oil refinery customers that had planned reduced usage outside of COVID-19 impacts, our April industrial sales decline would be around 10% compared to last year. As you can see in the graph on the slide, as those customers started ramping up, we saw the corresponding pickup in sales towards the end of April. Additionally, it's important to note that 2 industrial sectors that are prevalent in our territory are experiencing unusual events simultaneous to COVID-19. The airline industry is dealing with the 737 MAX issue and oil production refineries with the oil crisis. Both issues could still weigh on demand in future months irrespective of the recovery from COVID-19. 
Now we look to offset margin declines by balancing the preservation of long-term value creation and adjustments to O&M. Some of the levers we will pull include a hiring pause, reduced travel spend, reduced discretionary maintenance spending and potentially an additional voluntary early retirement program. While we have a ways to go in terms of opening up our economy, we may be turning a corner as many businesses in our territory, including a number of large manufacturing facilities, have plans to reopen later this month after multi-week shutdowns. 
Moving on to Slide 10. Let me touch on our latest financing activities and liquidity. On April 2, Evergy Kansas Central issued $500 million of 30-year first mortgage bonds at 3.45%. Proceeds will be used to redeem $250 million of the 5.1% bonds that were set to mature in July, and the remainder proceeds were used to reduce short-term debt. Also in April, we requested authority from the Missouri Public Service Commission to issue up to $400 million at Evergy Metro to pay down short-term debt and further bolster our liquidity position. I'm happy to report the commission approved our request yesterday, and we expect to complete a transaction by midyear. We ended April with a total liquidity of $1.9 billion with $1.6 billion of that as capacity available on our master credit facility and over $300 million of cash on hand. We are confident in our liquidity position across the range of these scenarios that we've contemplated. 
Now wrapping up on Slide 13. As a reminder, we haven't issued 2020 EPS guidance, and we don't have plans to issue guidance during the pendency of the committee's work, but I can give you an update on some of the drivers for the year that have changed. Obviously, given the sales trends that we're seeing thus far, we now expect a weather-normalized sales decline this year. With ongoing uncertainty, it's too early to estimate the full year impact. With our cost reduction execution in the first quarter and the expected incremental reductions that we're targeting for the remainder of the year, we are now targeting a 6% to 9% reduction in adjusted O&M in 2020 compared to 2019 versus our previous target of 5% to 8% reduction. 
We remain optimistic as we're starting to see the nation and our service territories begin to open back up. We realize it's going to take some time for the economy and sales to bounce back. We're confident in our position and plan as we all unite together to put this behind us. We will continue to do our part and are staying focused on doing the right things for employees, customers, communities and shareholders. 
With that, I will turn the call back over to Terry."

What -- when you think about an EPS shift, and I know you don't have guidance out there for '20, but how much of a reduction are we talking about in sales expectations relative to what seems like a modest reduction from 5% to 8% to 6% to 9% reduction on the O&M? So tell me if I'm missing something there, one versus the other. And then the follow-up to that would be, how do you think about '21 and onwards?

That's less directly connected, I guess, to what we're seeing from sales because, to your first question, it's really hard, again, as we said, to say April would necessarily be what we'd expect going forward. And so I think what we're seeing though is that even though we saw a downtick in April, as most folks would expect, we're happy to see that we -- it is manageable. And at least in the near term, we think we're able to offset a lot of that impact. Obviously, if those impacts lasted all year long, it get more difficult as the year went on.

On the call today, we have Terry Bassham, Evergy's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tony Somma, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Other members of management are with us and will be available during the question-and-answer portion of the call. 
I will now turn the call over to Terry."

We've got a lot of positive news to discuss today, including our new sustainability transformation plan and solid second quarter results. So our new plan sets the stage for significant value creation and a strong future for Evergy and our stakeholders. We'll begin today's call with a deeper dive into the STP and its benefits, then move to the quarter and your questions. 
Turning first to Slide 4. As you know, earlier this year, the Board established a new strategic review and operations committee to evaluate and recommend ways to enhance value for our shareholders and all the company's stakeholders. Among the options considered were a potential strategic combination and a modified improved stand-alone operating plan and strategy. Both the committee and the Board, as a whole, were well advised in these efforts with each retaining independent financial advisers and consultants to assist in the review. The work over the past 4 months has been extensive. The committee and our financial advisers engaged with a number of third parties who may have been interested in a combination. We also took a fresh look at each element of our operating plan, including our investment priorities, our opportunities for cost savings and operating efficiencies and how and where we allocate capital. Throughout the review, we were focused on 3 core objectives: maximizing long-term value for our shareholders, serving the best interest of all Evergy's stakeholders, including our customers, employees and communities, and continuing to advance our work to successfully create a forward-thinking, sustainable energy company. The plan we are announcing today delivers on all of these objectives. Accordingly, the committee unanimously recommended and the Board unanimously approved, pursuing our sustainability transformation plan that we are excited to announce today. 
Turning to Slide 5. Our plan creates a compelling value proposition for shareholders. Under our plan, we will meaningfully increase our earnings growth of 6% to 8% through 2024 compared to our previous guidance of 5% to 7%. And this increased growth rate places Evergy in the top quartile of all U.S. selected companies. Together with our growing dividend, Evergy will have a compelling shareholder return profile. This growth will be enabled by increased capital investment as well as continued operational cost efficiencies to minimize the impact on customer rates. Under our new plan, we expect approximately $8.9 billion of capital investments through 2024 in infrastructure upgrades, grid modernization technology and clean energy initiatives across Kansas and Missouri. The incremental $1.4 billion in capital investments compared to our prior plan, which we announced in March of this year, is expected to support an estimated 5% to 6% compound annual rate base growth through 2024. I want to point out that there are additional opportunities related to decarbonization and renewables deployment that are not included in our STP, which could support further investment depending on outcomes from our stakeholder engagement process. This process is underway as we update our long-term energy plan. We believe these potential incremental investment opportunities are realistic and achievable, given the support for clean energy at the state local level in Kansas and Missouri and from our customers. As you know, through the realization of the benefits associated with our prior merger, we have enhanced our planning processes that support system investment. We've also demonstrated our ability to execute on our identified cost management initiatives, with the quantity and timing of merger savings well ahead of our initial targets. This execution drives our confidence in achieving continued cost reductions and the growth outlined here under a range of scenarios. 
Slide 6 highlights the growth opportunity and our earnings and rate base that I just discussed and showed a 25% reduction in O&M expenses we expect to achieve through 2024. 
Let me discuss each of these in greater detail, starting on Slide 7. Since completing our merger, we have regularly reviewed our capital investment plans to ensure that we are investing at levels and in areas that drive the greatest benefits for our customers and the greatest value for our shareholders. Over time, we have adjusted our investment planning accordingly. The work conducted by the strategic review and operations committee helped identify additional investment opportunities across our transmission, distribution and generation infrastructure as well as our customer-focused investments. The STP's incremental $1.4 billion of CapEx to bring the 5-year total to approximately $8.9 billion, results in an estimated 5% to 6% annual rate base growth. 
Looking to Slide 8. Our capital plan is focused on additional investments to accelerate decarbonization and grid modernization, while continuing to be cost-conscious, financially strong and people-first culture fundamentals that are core to Evergy's foundation. The result is greener, more reliable, affordable energy for our customers and line of sight to continued earnings growth and value creation for Evergy's shareholders. 
Over the next 5 years, we expect to invest $4.8 billion in upgrades to transmission and distribution infrastructure and customer-facing platforms to improve reliability, provide further access to renewable energy and enhance the customer experience. Our new plan also contemplates approximately $500 million of asset hardening, grid automation and technology investments through 2024 to create the grid of the future. This includes expediting the evolution to a smarter, more reliable and more efficient grid. Increasing our renewable footprint is a priority that we have discussed and that we had acted on. Since 2005, Evergy has retired more than 2,400 megawatts of fossil generation and added or contracted for over 4,600 megawatts of renewables, making Kansas #2 in the nation for wind generation as a percentage of total generation. Our new plan has the potential to expedite CO2 emission reductions, by pursuing constructive, regulatory mechanisms, economically retire coal-fired generation and expand Evergy's wind and solar footprint. Through these actions, we can drive lower fuel and purchase power costs as well as O&M savings, which help keep our customers' bills competitive in the region. While we're still targeting 80% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2050 compared to 2005 levels, under this plan, we have the potential to reduce CO2 emissions as much as 85% by 2030, a material improvement in our CO2 footprint over the next 10 years. The pace of this reduction will ultimately be defined in collaboration with stakeholders as we seek to find the most beneficial economic path forward for our customers. We are excited about the opportunities ahead, and we are already well on our way to meet our goals. Nearly half the power to homes and businesses we serve comes from emission-free resources. And our clean charge network includes over 1,000 EV charging station and continues to expand. 
Slide 9. Maintaining a solid financial foundation has always been front and center for us. As reviewed on Slide 9, our plan requires no equity issuances, and Evergy will continue to have a strong credit profile. Tony will review our liquidity and financial activities in greater detail in his remarks. 
When we announced our review, we affirmed our commitment to serving the best interest of all Evergy's stakeholders, including Evergy's employees, customers and communities. This commitment is unwavering, and our plan delivers on it. 
Slide 11 reviews our new growth plan as contrasted against our prior expectations, including growth in our capital investments, rate base and earnings as well as continued growth and overdue dividend. The result is an attractive investment outlook and meaningful shareholder value creation. 
To sum up on Slide 12, we are confident in this plan and the opportunities it creates to drive significant value for our shareholders and stakeholders alike. It allows us to target top quartile shareholder returns, deliver regulatory and merger commitments, invest in critical infrastructure and accelerate our transition to providing more affordable and cleaner energy and project jobs while enhancing economic development opportunities. 
Look forward to continuing to engage with our regulators as we execute on this plan. 
Now let's turn to the quarter, where we delivered solid results and our outlook for the year. We reported second quarter GAAP earnings of $0.59 per share compared to $0.57 a share earned in the second quarter of 2019. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.68 in the second quarter of 2020 compared to adjusted $0.58 per share in the same period a year ago. On a period-over-period basis, these results were driven by favorable weather, cost reduction efforts and lower shares outstanding, partially offset by the negative sales impact of COVID-19, a noncash income tax adjustment due to a new Kansas law that will eliminate state income taxes for electric utilities. Also, we initiated our 2020 EPS guidance which on a GAAP basis is $2.66 to $2.86. And on an adjusted non-GAAP basis, $2.90 to $3.10. 
I'll let Tony give you more details on the outlook and drivers of this guidance. I am very proud of how our team has executed during these trying times. Delivering solid results during extenuating circumstances underscores our team's continued focus on safety, customer service and operational performance. As a response to the pandemic has evolved, we are seeing the economy starting to open up back over time. While some of our larger manufacturing companies may be working at slightly reduced outputter shifts by and large, they're operating at a much higher level than in April and May. Our electric sales are down year-on-year, but we saw an increase in demand towards the end of the quarter. I'll let Tony give you more specifics on sales. While pandemic precautions altered the legislative sessions in our states, there are 2 components of the recently passed Kansas House Bill [ 2585 ] relevant to [indiscernible]. The first provides for special economic development rates in Kansas, similar to what is allowed in Missouri. The provision gives the KCC authority to approve rate contracts outside of the general proceeding that are based on a utility's incremental cost of service for customers that meet certain criteria. It allows for rate incentives that could attract businesses to Kansas or encourage expansion of existing customers that otherwise may not be possible. The same portion of the bill eliminates the Kansas state income tax or public electric utilities. This becomes effective on January 1, 2021, both of these are very positive for customers and our communities. In July, and in line with expectations, Part 2 of the Kansas rate study was filed. Like Part 1, which was filed in January, the study provided thoughtful analysis of multiple issues impacting Kansas electric rates and how they compare to regional states. Much of the focus on the second Kansas rate study is on the competitiveness of rates which is very much in line with the thesis underpinning our merger. The study demonstrates our strategy is working. And since closing the merger in 2018, our rates have declined at a faster pace than our neighboring states. Additionally, the study supports our investment in modernizing and expanding the transmission grid that serves Kansas, which improves electric liability, increases access to electricity generated from Kansas wind farms. 
And moving to the regulatory front, we've continued to work closely and collaboratively with our regulators to ensure we are representing all stakeholders as we adapt to dealing with the impacts of COVID-19. We suspended disconnects through mid-July, and will continue to waive late fees for our customers in both Kansas and Missouri. Additionally, with commission approval, we have introduced additional payment plans to allow businesses additional payment flexibility and to provide residential customers with extended payment plan options. Kansas Corporation Commission approved our request for an accounting authority order that allows us to track expenses, lost revenue and any cost offsets associated with COVID-19 to be considered for recovery in our next rate cases. We have a similar request for an accounting authority order pending in Missouri. The MPSC has set a procedural schedule, and we expect a ruling by the end of the year. In June, the KCC approved an order to review our strategic review and operations committee. They also approved a joint motion filing by the company, along with the KCC staff, which aims to provide detail around certain timing and confidentiality concerns. Now that our Board has made a final determination in our process, we're working to submit a report back to the KCC in line with the requirements of the order. 
I will now turn the call over to Tony."

We reported second quarter 2020 GAAP earnings of [ $0.15 ] per share compared to $0.57 per share in the second quarter of 2019. The increase in EPS is primarily due to warmer weather, lower operation and maintenance expense and fewer shares outstanding, partially offset by the negative impacts of COVID-19 and the income tax legislation in Kansas. As Terry mentioned, effective January 1, 2021, public electric utilities in Kansas will become income tax exempt. As a result, in June, we booked $13.8 million of income tax expense from the impact of revaluation of deferred income tax assets and liabilities not recovered in rates from nonregulated operations and from the difference in the statutory tax rates recovered through rates and the consolidated income tax rate. While we plan to file for a change in income tax expense reflecting the rates effective January 1, 2021, the new law allows for Kansas Utilities to recover in a regulatory account, any over or under collection of income tax expense as a result of a change in state or federal law. 
Moving on to adjusted non-GAAP earnings, which were $0.68 per share compared to $0.58 per share in the same period a year ago. As shown in the chart on Slide 16, adjusted EPS was driven higher primarily due to favorable weather, lower O&M and fewer shares outstanding and was partially offset by lower weather-normalized sales primarily due to COVID-19, which we estimate cost us about $0.08. 
Turning to weather. Compared to last year, we estimate that favorably impacted earnings by $0.10 in the quarter. And compared to normal, we estimate earnings were helped by about $0.06. 
Moving on to Slide 18, I'll touch on year-to-date results. Year-to-date GAAP earnings were $202 million or $0.89 per share compared to $239 million or $0.96 per share in the same period last year. Adjusted earnings were $248 million or [ $1.09 ] per share compared to year-to-date 2019 adjusted earnings of $251 million or $1.01 per share. Primary drivers compared to last year include lower sales primarily due to COVID-19, which we estimate cost us about $0.09, higher depreciation expense and increase in interest expense, partially offset by lower O&M expense and fewer shares outstanding. Our team continues its focus on operational efficiency to lower operating costs and exceed our savings targets. In the second quarter, we reduced our adjusted O&M by $25 million through the first half of the year by $62 million. That equates to more than a 10% reduction in adjusted operating costs for the first 6 months of operations in 2020 as compared to last year. As far as merger savings go, we remained ahead of schedule and expect to exceed our initial 2020 merger savings target. These savings were gained without [indiscernible], operating capabilities, and we recently announced another voluntary exit program for our employees. As for weather compared to last year, we estimate weather was $0.02 unfavorable year-to-date and compared to normal, we estimate earnings were flat. 
On Slide 19, I'll give you some details on the sales impact from COVID-19. Commercial industrial sales declined, reached a trough in April and started to improve in May and June, all the while being partially offset by increased residential usage driven by folks staying at home. These trends are consistent with what we observed as businesses started to reopen throughout the quarter. For the second quarter and compared to same period last year, our estimated weather-normalized total retail sales were about 7% lower, residential sales were up about 5%, while commercial and industrial sales declined 13% and 12%, respectively. We remain optimistic in terms of our local economy suddenly reopening, however, it's hard for us to predict if the situation will continue to improve or take a step back, depending on the future impacts of the virus. 
Moving on to Slide 20 in our latest financial activities and liquidity. As you may recall, we announced on April 2 that Evergy Kansas Central issued $500 million of 30-year first mortgage bonds at 3.54%. Proceeds were used to redeem $250 million of [ 5.1% ] of bonds that matured midyear. In May, average metro issued $400 million of 10-year mortgage bonds at 2.25%. This financing activity allowed us to pay down short-term debt at very attractive [indiscernible] term rates and further bolster our liquidity position. We -- in June with total liquidity of approximately $2 billion and do not expect new issuances or refinancing activity throughout the remainder of the year. As Terry discussed, we were able to fund our new plan without any new equity issuances and maintaining a solid investment-grade profile. 
Now wrapping up on Slide 21. For reasons we stated on our year-end call, we did not issue any earning guidance for 2020. Accordingly, now, we're issuing 2020 GAAP EPS guidance of $2.66 to $2.86 and adjusted EPS guidance of $2.90 to $3.10. While we are still expecting a decline in year-over-year weather-normalized sales, our outlook assumes a slow and steady recovery throughout the third and fourth quarter. Some of the additional drivers would include a reduction of 8% to 11% adjusted O&M expense compared to 2019, depreciation expense around $20 million to $30 million higher than last year, COLI proceeds of $20 million, and we received roughly about $4 million through the end of June and an effective tax rate of 13% to 15%. 
I'll now turn the call back to Terry."

Has there even been any partial vetting with Missouri and Kansas? Have you had any sort of conversations with the commissions? Obviously, you have a 5-year base rate freeze in Kansas and conversations we've had with both commissions in the past seems to center on them wanting a fully vetted regulatory process in place before enacting plans like this.

And if you recall, we actually supported confidential sharing of information with the staff only, but we have been talking to them along with this kind of dialogue for several weeks. And in fact, they've made it clear that they don't have a preference for a strategic versus stand-alone plan. They will evaluate both in general and going through the materials that have obviously been worked on by the SRLC and the Board. They've made it clear that their filing was addressing the original filing was addressing the concerns over the public information that was in the Elliott letter and outlined their concerns there. We are very confident that the STP was repaired with those points in mind and that we will have them involved in what's expected to be a very good stakeholder process to discuss all these issues. We think the STP will meet each of their concerns going forward. What does the process look like? We've talked about a stakeholder process that would involve the kind of things you mentioned the regulators might want, which is long-term energy plan as a base for that conversation. But now obviously, we have the STP as well to discuss. We're excited about the opportunity that it provides us for not only additional O&M activity to drive cost, but also investment in things that will drive better reliability and more certainty for customers. And also provide us with the ability to move forward with our decarbonization efforts, and that stakeholder process will provide us with a lot of support when we go to work on regulatory and legislative support for that. Finally, I think your last question was bill impact. I think we -- we believe that the bill impact will be will be very low. And in fact, in Kansas, in particular, less than inflation, could be slightly higher in Missouri simply because of the piece of it. But it would be, again, lesser as well."

We've got a lot of positive news to discuss today, including our new sustainability transformation plan and solid second quarter results. So our new plan sets the stage for significant value creation and a strong future for Evergy and our stakeholders. We'll begin today's call with a deeper dive into the STP and its benefits, then move to the quarter and your questions.  
Turning first to Slide 4. As you know, earlier this year, the Board established a new Strategic Review & Operations Committee to evaluate and recommend ways to enhance value for our shareholders and all of the company's stakeholders. Among the options considered were a potential strategic combination and a modified improved stand-alone operating plan and strategy. Both the committee and the Board, as a whole, were well advised in these efforts with each retaining independent financial advisers and consultants to assist in the review. 
The work over the past 4 months has been extensive. The committee and our financial advisers engaged with a number of third parties who may have been interested in a combination. We also took a fresh look at each element of our operating plan, including our investment priorities, our opportunities for cost savings and operating efficiencies and how and where we allocate capital. Throughout the review, we were focused on 3 core objectives: maximizing long-term value for our shareholders; serving the best interest of all Evergy's stakeholders, including our customers, employees and communities; and continuing to advance our work to successfully create a forward-thinking, sustainable energy company.
The plan we are announcing today delivers on all of these objectives. Accordingly, the committee unanimously recommended and the Board unanimously approved, pursuing our sustainability transformation plan that we are excited to announce today.  
Turning to Slide 5. Our plan creates a compelling value proposition for shareholders. Under our plan, we will meaningfully increase our earnings growth to 6% to 8% through 2024 compared to our previous guidance of 5% to 7%. And this increased growth rate places Evergy in the top quartile of all U.S. electric companies. Together with our growing dividend, Evergy will have a compelling shareholder return profile. This growth will be enabled by increased capital investment as well as continued operational cost efficiencies to minimize the impact on customer rates. Under our new plan, we expect approximately $8.9 billion of capital investments through 2024 in infrastructure upgrades, grid modernization technology and clean energy initiatives across Kansas and Missouri. The incremental $1.4 billion in capital investments compared to our prior plan, which we announced in March of this year, is expected to support an estimated 5% to 6% compound annual rate base growth through 2024. 
I want to point out that there are additional opportunities related to decarbonization and renewables deployment that are not included in our STP, which could support further investment depending on outcomes from our stakeholder engagement process. This process is underway as we update our long-term energy plan. We believe these potential incremental investment opportunities are realistic and achievable, given the support for clean energy at the state local level in Kansas and Missouri and from our customers. As you know, through the realization of the benefits associated with our prior merger, we have enhanced our planning processes that support system investment. We've also demonstrated our ability to execute on our identified cost management initiatives, with the quantity and timing of merger savings well ahead of our initial targets. This execution drives our confidence in achieving continued cost reductions and the growth outlined here under a range of scenarios.  
Slide 6 highlights the growth opportunity and our earnings and rate base that I just discussed and shows a 25% reduction in O&M expenses we expect to achieve through 2024.  
Let me discuss each of these in greater detail, starting on Slide 7. Since completing our merger, we have regularly reviewed our capital investment plans to ensure that we are investing at levels and in areas that drive the greatest benefits for our customers and the greatest value for our shareholders. Over time, we have adjusted our investment plan accordingly. The work conducted by the Strategic Review & Operations Committee helped identify additional investment opportunities across our transmission, distribution and generation infrastructure, as well as our customer-focused investments. The STP's incremental $1.4 billion of CapEx to bring the 5-year total to approximately $8.9 billion results in an estimated 5% to 6% annual rate base growth.  
Looking to Slide 8. Our capital plan is focused on additional investments to accelerate decarbonization and grid modernization, while continuing to be cost conscious, financially strong and people-first culture fundamentals that are core to Evergy's foundation. The result is greener, more reliable, affordable energy for our customers and line of sight to continued earnings growth and value creation for Evergy's shareholders.  
Over the next 5 years, we expect to invest $4.8 billion in upgrades to transmission and distribution infrastructure and customer-facing platforms to improve reliability, provide further access to renewable energy and enhance the customer experience. Our new plan also contemplates approximately $500 million of asset hardening, grid automation and technology investments through 2024 to create the grid of the future. This includes expediting the evolution to a smarter, more reliable and more efficient grid. 
Increasing our renewable footprint is a priority that we have discussed and that we had acted on. Since 2005, Evergy has retired more than 2,400 megawatts of fossil generation and added or contracted for over 4,600 megawatts of renewables, making Kansas #2 in the nation for wind generation as a percentage of total generation. Our new plan has the potential to expedite CO2 emission reductions, by pursuing constructive, regulatory mechanisms, economically retire coal-fired generation and expand Evergy's wind and solar footprint. Through these actions, we can drive lower fuel and purchase power costs as well as O&M savings, which help keep our customers' bills competitive in the region. While we're still targeting 80% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2050 compared to 2005 levels, under this plan, we have the potential to reduce CO2 emissions as much as 85% by 2030, a material improvement in our CO2 footprint over the next 10 years. The pace of this reduction will ultimately be defined in collaboration with stakeholders as we seek to find the most beneficial economic path forward for our customers. 
We are excited about the opportunities ahead, and we are already well on our way to meet our goals. Nearly half the power to homes and businesses we serve comes from emission-free resources. And our clean charge network includes over 1,000 EV charging station and continues to expand.  
Slide 9. Maintaining a solid financial foundation has always been front and center for us. As reviewed on Slide 9, our plan requires no equity issuances, and Evergy will continue to have a strong credit profile. Tony will review our liquidity and financial activities in greater detail in his remarks.  
When we announced our review, we affirmed our commitment to serving the best interest of all Evergy's stakeholders, including Evergy's employees, customers and communities. This commitment is unwavering, and our plan delivers on it.  
Slide 11 reviews our new growth plan as contrasted against our prior expectations, including growth in our capital investments, rate base and earnings as well as continued growth in Evergy's dividend. The result is an attractive investment outlook and meaningful shareholder value creation.  
To sum up on Slide 12, we are confident in this plan and the opportunities it creates to drive significant value for our shareholders and stakeholders alike. It allows us to target top quartile shareholder returns, deliver on regulatory and merger commitments, invest in critical infrastructure and accelerate our transition to providing more affordable and cleaner energy and project jobs while enhancing economic development opportunities.  We look forward to continuing to engage with our regulators as we execute on this plan.  
Now let's turn to the quarter, where we delivered solid results and our outlook for the year. We reported second quarter GAAP earnings of $0.59 per share compared to $0.57 a share earned in the second quarter of 2019. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.68 in the second quarter of 2020 compared to adjusted $0.58 per share in the same period a year ago. On a period-over-period basis, these results were driven by favorable weather, cost reduction efforts and lower shares outstanding, partially offset by the negative sales impact of COVID-19 and a noncash income tax adjustment due to a new Kansas law that will eliminate state income taxes for electric utilities. Also, we initiated our 2020 EPS guidance which on a GAAP basis is $2.66 to $2.86. And on an adjusted non-GAAP basis, $2.90 to $3.10.  
I'll let Tony give you more details on the outlook and drivers of this guidance. I am very proud of how our team has executed during these trying times. Delivering solid results during extenuating circumstances underscores our team's continued focus on safety, customer service and operational performance. As a response to the pandemic has evolved, we are seeing the economy starting to open up back over time, while some of our larger manufacturing companies may be working at slightly reduced operator shifts by and large they're operating at a much higher level than in April and May. Our electric sales are down year-on-year, but we saw an increase in demand towards the end of the quarter. And I'll let Tony give you more specifics on sales. 
While pandemic precautions altered the legislative sessions in our states, there are 2 components of the recently passed Kansas House Bill 2585 relevant to Evergy. The first provides for special economic development rates in Kansas, similar to what is allowed in Missouri. The provision gives the KCC authority to approve rate contracts outside of the general proceeding that are based on a utility's incremental cost of service for customers that meet certain criteria. 
It allows for rate incentives that could attract businesses to Kansas or encourage expansion of existing customers that otherwise may not be possible. 
Second portion of the bill eliminates the Kansas state income tax for public electric utilities. This becomes effective on January 1, 2021. Both of these are very positive for customers and our communities. In July, and in line with expectations, part 2 of the Kansas Rate study was filed. Like Part 1, which was filed in January, the study provided thoughtful analysis of multiple issues impacting Kansas electric rates and how they compare to regional states. Much of the focus on the second Kansas rate study is on the competitiveness of rates, which is very much in line with the thesis underpinning our merger. The study demonstrates our strategy is working. And since closing the merger in 2018, our rates have declined at a faster pace than our neighboring states. Additionally, the study supports our investment in modernizing and expanding the transmission grid that serves Kansas, which improves electric liability, increases access to electricity generated from Kansas wind farms.  
And moving to the regulatory front, we've continued to work closely and collaboratively with our regulators to ensure we are representing all stakeholders as we adapt to dealing with the impacts of COVID-19. We suspended disconnects through mid-July, and will continue to waive late fees for our customers in both Kansas and Missouri. Additionally, with commission approval, we have introduced additional payment plans to allow businesses additional payment flexibility and to provide residential customers with extended payment plan options. Kansas Corporation Commission approved our request for an accounting authority order that allows us to track expenses, lost revenue and any cost offsets associated with COVID-19 to be considered for recovery in our next rate cases. We have a similar request for an accounting authority order pending in Missouri. The MPSC has set a procedural schedule, and we expect a ruling by the end of the year. In June, the KCC approved an order to review our Strategic Review & Operations Committee.  They also approved a joint motion filing by the company, along with the KCC staff, which aims to provide detail around certain timing and confidentiality concerns. Now that our Board has made a final determination in our process, we're working to submit a report back to the KCC in line with the requirements of the order.  
I will now turn the call over to Tony."

We reported second quarter 2020 GAAP earnings of $0.59 per share compared to $0.57 per share in the second quarter of 2019. The increase in EPS is primarily due to warmer weather, lower operation and maintenance expense and fewer shares outstanding, partially offset by the negative impacts of COVID-19 and the income tax legislation in Kansas. As Terry mentioned, effective January 1, 2021, public electric utilities in Kansas will become income tax exempt. As a result, in June, we booked $13.8 million of income tax expense from the impact of revaluation of deferred income tax assets and liabilities not recovered in rates from nonregulated operations and from the difference in the statutory tax rates recovered through rates and the consolidated income tax rate. 
While we plan to file for a change in income tax expense reflecting the rates effective January 1, 2021, the new law allows for Kansas Utilities to recover in a regulatory account, any over or under collection of income tax expense as a result of a change in state or federal law.  
Moving on to adjusted non-GAAP earnings, which were $0.68 per share compared to $0.58 per share in the same period a year ago. As shown in the chart on Slide 16, adjusted EPS was driven higher primarily due to favorable weather, lower O&M and fewer shares outstanding and was partially offset by lower weather-normalized sales primarily due to COVID-19, which we estimate cost us about $0.08.  
Turning to weather. Compared to last year, we estimate weather favorably impacted earnings by $0.10 in the quarter. And compared to normal, we estimate earnings were helped by about $0.06.  
Moving on to Slide 18, I'll touch on year-to-date results. Year-to-date GAAP earnings were $202 million or $0.89 per share compared to $239 million or $0.96 per share in the same period last year. Adjusted earnings were $248 million or $1.09 per share compared to year-to-date 2019 adjusted earnings of $251 million or $1.01 per share. Primary drivers compared to last year include lower sales primarily due to COVID-19, which we estimate cost us about $0.09, higher depreciation expense and increase in interest expense, partially offset by lower O&M expense and fewer shares outstanding. 
Our team continues its focus on operational efficiency to lower operating costs and exceed our savings targets. In the second quarter, we reduced our adjusted O&M by $25 million and through the first half of the year by $62 million. That equates to more than a 10% reduction in adjusted operating costs for the first 6 months of operations in 2020 as compared to last year. As far as merger savings go, we remained ahead of schedule and expect to exceed our initial 2020 merger savings target. These savings were gained without sacrificing operating capabilities, and we recently announced another voluntary exit program for our employees. As for weather compared to last year, we estimate weather was $0.02 unfavorable year-to-date and compared to normal, we estimate earnings were flat.  
On Slide 19, I'll give you some details on the sales impact from COVID-19. Commercial industrial sales declined, reached a trough in April and started to improve in May and June, all the while being partially offset by increased residential usage driven by folks staying at home. These trends are consistent with what we observed as businesses started to reopen throughout the quarter. For the second quarter and compared to the same period last year, our estimated weather-normalized total retail sales were about 7% lower, residential sales were up about 5%, while commercial and industrial sales declined 13% and 12%, respectively. We remain optimistic in terms of our local economy suddenly reopening, however, it's hard for us to predict if the situation will continue to improve or take a step back depending on the future impacts of the virus.  
Moving on to Slide 20 in our latest financial activities and liquidity. As you may recall, we announced on April 2 that Evergy Kansas Central issued $500 million of 30-year first mortgage bonds at 3.54%. Proceeds were used to redeem $250 million of 5.1% of bonds that matured midyear. 
In May, Evergy Metro issued $400 million of 10-year mortgage bonds at 2.25%. This financing activity allowed us to pay down short-term debt at very attractive longer-term rates and further bolster our liquidity position, bringing June with total liquidity of approximately $2 billion and do not expect new issuances or refinancing activity throughout the remainder of the year. As Terry discussed, we were able to fund our new plan without any new equity issuances and maintaining a solid investment-grade profile.  
Now wrapping up on Slide 21. For reasons we stated on our year-end call, we did not issue any earning guidance for 2020. And accordingly, now, we're issuing 2020 GAAP EPS guidance of $2.66 to $2.86 and adjusted EPS guidance of $2.90 to $3.10. We are still expecting a decline in year-over-year weather-normalized sales, our outlook assumes a slow and steady recovery throughout the third and fourth quarter. Some of the additional drivers would include a reduction of 8% to 11% adjusted O&M expense compared to 2019, depreciation expense around $20 million to $30 million higher than last year, COLI proceeds of $20 million, and we've received roughly about $4 million through the end of June and an effective tax rate of 13% to 15%.  
I'll now turn the call back to Terry."

And if you recall, we actually supported confidential sharing of information with the staff only, but we have been talking to them along with this kind of dialogue for several weeks. And in fact, they've made it clear that they don't have a preference for a strategic versus stand-alone plan. They will evaluate both and in general and going through the materials that have obviously been worked on by the SRLC and the Board. They've made it clear that their filing was addressing -- the original filing was addressing the concerns over the public information that was in the Elliott letter and outlined their concerns there. We are very confident that the STP was prepared with those points in mind and that we will have them involved in what's expected to be a very good stakeholder process to discuss all these issues. We think the STP will meet each of their concerns going forward. What does the process look like? We've talked about a stakeholder process that would involve the kind of things you mentioned the regulators might want, which is long-term energy plan as a base for that conversation. But now obviously, we have the STP as well to discuss. We're excited about the opportunity that it provides us for not only additional O&M activity to drive cost, but also investment in things that will drive better reliability and more certainty for customers. And also provide us with the ability to move forward with our decarbonization efforts, and that stakeholder process will provide us with a lot of support when we go to work on regulatory and legislative support for that. 
Finally, I think your last question was bill impact. I think we believe that the bill impact will be will be very low. And in fact, in Kansas, in particular, less than inflation, could be slightly higher in Missouri simply because of the piece of it. But it would be, again, lesser as well."

We've got a lot of positive news to discuss today, including our new sustainability transformation plan and solid second quarter results. So our new plan sets the stage for significant value creation and a strong future for Evergy and our stakeholders. We'll begin today's call with a deeper dive into the STP and its benefits, then move to the quarter and your questions.  
Turning first to Slide 4. As you know, earlier this year, the Board established a new Strategic Review & Operations Committee to evaluate and recommend ways to enhance value for our shareholders and all of the company's stakeholders. Among the options considered were a potential strategic combination and a modified improved stand-alone operating plan and strategy. Both the committee and the Board, as a whole, were well advised in these efforts with each retaining independent financial advisers and consultants to assist in the review. 
The work over the past 4 months has been extensive. The committee and our financial advisers engaged with a number of third parties who may have been interested in a combination. We also took a fresh look at each element of our operating plan, including our investment priorities, our opportunities for cost savings and operating efficiencies and how and where we allocate capital. Throughout the review, we were focused on 3 core objectives: maximizing long-term value for our shareholders; serving the best interest of all Evergy's stakeholders, including our customers, employees and communities; and continuing to advance our work to successfully create a forward-thinking, sustainable energy company.
The plan we are announcing today delivers on all of these objectives. Accordingly, the committee unanimously recommended and the Board unanimously approved pursuing our sustainability transformation plan that we are excited to announce today.  
Turning to Slide 5. Our plan creates a compelling value proposition for shareholders. Under our plan, we will meaningfully increase our earnings growth to 6% to 8% through 2024 compared to our previous guidance of 5% to 7%. This increased growth rate places Evergy in the top quartile of all U.S. electric companies. Together with our growing dividend, Evergy will have a compelling shareholder return profile. This growth will be enabled by increased capital investment as well as continued operational cost efficiencies to minimize the impact on customer rates. Under our new plan, we expect approximately $8.9 billion of capital investments through 2024 in infrastructure upgrades, grid modernization technology and clean energy initiatives across Kansas and Missouri. The incremental $1.4 billion in capital investments compared to our prior plan, which we announced in March of this year, is expected to support an estimated 5% to 6% compound annual rate base growth through 2024. 
I want to point out that there are additional opportunities related to decarbonization and renewables deployment that are not included in our STP, which could support further investment depending on outcomes from our stakeholder engagement process. This process is underway as we update our long-term energy plan. We believe these potential incremental investment opportunities are realistic and achievable, given the support for clean energy at the state and local level in Kansas and Missouri and from our customers. As you know, through the realization of the benefits associated with our prior merger, we have enhanced our planning processes that support system investment. We've also demonstrated our ability to execute on our identified cost management initiatives, with the quantity and timing of merger savings well ahead of our initial targets. This execution drives our confidence in achieving continued cost reductions and the growth outlined here under a range of scenarios.  
Slide 6 highlights the growth opportunity and our earnings and rate base that I just discussed and shows the 25% reduction in O&M expenses we expect to achieve through 2024.  
Let me discuss each of these in greater detail, starting on Slide 7. Since completing our merger, we have regularly reviewed our capital investment plans to ensure that we are investing at levels and in areas that drive the greatest benefits for our customers and the greatest value for our shareholders. Over time, we have adjusted our investment plan accordingly. The work conducted by the Strategic Review & Operations Committee helped identify additional investment opportunities across our transmission, distribution and generation infrastructure, as well as our customer-focused investments. The STP's incremental $1.4 billion of CapEx to bring the 5-year total to approximately $8.9 billion results in an estimated 5% to 6% annual rate base growth.  
Looking to Slide 8. Our capital plan is focused on additional investments to accelerate decarbonization and grid modernization, while continuing to be cost conscious, financially strong and people-first culture fundamentals that are core to Evergy's foundation. The result is greener, more reliable, affordable energy for our customers and line of sight to continued earnings growth and value creation for Evergy's shareholders.  
Over the next 5 years, we expect to invest $4.8 billion in upgrades to transmission and distribution infrastructure and customer-facing platforms to improve reliability, provide further access to renewable energy and enhance the customer experience. Our new plan also contemplates approximately $500 million of asset hardening, grid automation and technology investments through 2024 to create the grid of the future. This includes expediting the evolution to a smarter, more reliable and more efficient grid. 
Increasing our renewable footprint is a priority that we have discussed and that we had acted on. Since 2005, Evergy has retired more than 2,400 megawatts of fossil generation and added or contracted for over 4,600 megawatts of renewables, making Kansas #2 in the nation for wind generation as a percentage of total generation. Our new plan has the potential to expedite CO2 emission reductions by pursuing constructive regulatory mechanisms, economically retire coal-fired generation and expand Evergy's wind and solar footprint. Through these actions, we can drive lower fuel and purchase power costs as well as O&M savings, which help keep our customers' bills competitive in the region. While we're still targeting 80% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2050 compared to 2005 levels, under this plan, we have the potential to reduce CO2 emissions as much as 85% by 2030, a material improvement in our CO2 footprint over the next 10 years. The pace of this reduction will ultimately be defined in collaboration with stakeholders as we seek to find the most beneficial economic path forward for our customers. 
We are excited about the opportunities ahead, and we are already well on our way to meet our goals. Nearly half the power to homes and businesses we serve comes from emission-free resources. And our clean charge network includes over 1,000 EV charging station and continues to expand.  
Slide 9. Maintaining a solid financial foundation has always been front and center for us. As reviewed on Slide 9, our plan requires no equity issuances, and Evergy will continue to have a strong credit profile. Tony will review our liquidity and financial activities in greater detail in his remarks.  
When we announced our review, we affirmed our commitment to serving the best interest of all Evergy stakeholders, including Evergy's employees, customers and communities. This commitment is unwavering, and our plan delivers on it.  
Slide 11 reviews our new growth plan as contrasted against our prior expectations, including growth in our capital investments, rate base and earnings as well as continued growth in Evergy's dividend. The result is an attractive investment outlook and meaningful shareholder value creation.  
To sum up on Slide 12, we are confident in this plan and the opportunities it creates to drive significant value for our shareholders and stakeholders alike. It allows us to target top quartile shareholder returns, deliver on regulatory and merger commitments, invest in critical infrastructure and accelerate our transition to providing more affordable and cleaner energy and protect jobs while enhancing economic development opportunities. We look forward to continuing to engage with our regulators as we execute on this plan.  
Now let's turn to the quarter, where we delivered solid results, and our outlook for the year. We reported second quarter GAAP earnings of $0.59 per share compared to $0.57 a share earned in the second quarter of 2019. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.68 in the second quarter of 2020 compared to adjusted $0.58 per share in the same period a year ago. On a period-over-period basis, these results were driven by favorable weather, cost reduction efforts and lower shares outstanding, partially offset by the negative sales impact of COVID-19 and a noncash income tax adjustment due to a new Kansas law that will eliminate state income taxes for electric utilities. Also, we initiated our 2020 EPS guidance which on a GAAP basis is $2.66 to $2.86. And on an adjusted non-GAAP basis, $2.90 to $3.10.  
I'll let Tony give you more details on the outlook and drivers of this guidance. I am very proud of how our team has executed during these trying times. Delivering solid results during extenuating circumstances underscores our team's continued focus on safety, customer service and operational performance. As a response to the pandemic has evolved, we are seeing the economy starting to open up back over time. While some of our larger manufacturing companies may be working at slightly reduced output or shifts, by and large they're operating at a much higher level than in April and May. Our electric sales are down year-over-year, but we saw an increase in demand towards the end of the quarter. And I'll let Tony give you more specifics on sales. 
 
While pandemic precautions altered the legislative sessions in our states, there are 2 components of the recently passed Kansas House Bill 2585 relevant to Evergy. The first provides for special economic development rates in Kansas, similar to what is allowed in Missouri. The provision gives the KCC authority to approve rate contracts outside of the general proceeding that are based on a utility's incremental cost of service for customers that meet certain criteria. It allows for rate incentives that could attract businesses to Kansas or encourage expansion of existing customers that otherwise may not be possible. 
Second portion of the bill eliminates the Kansas state income tax for public electric utilities. This becomes effective on January 1, 2021. Both of these are very positive for our customers and our communities. In July, and in line with expectations, part 2 of the Kansas rate study was filed. Like Part 1, which was filed in January, the study provided thoughtful analysis of multiple issues impacting Kansas electric rates and how they compare to regional states. Much of the focus on the second Kansas rate study is on the competitiveness of rates, which is very much in line with the thesis underpinning our merger. The study demonstrates our strategy is working. And since closing the merger in 2018, our rates have declined at a faster pace than our neighboring states. Additionally, the study supports our investment in modernizing and expanding the transmission grid that serves Kansas, which improves electric liability, increases access to electricity generated from Kansas wind farms.  
And moving to the regulatory front, we've continued to work closely and collaboratively with our regulators to ensure we are representing all stakeholders as we adapt to dealing with the impacts of COVID-19. We suspended disconnects through mid-July, and will continue to waive late fees for our customers in both Kansas and Missouri. Additionally, with commission approval, we have introduced additional payment plans to allow businesses additional payment flexibility and to provide residential customers with extended payment plan options. Kansas Corporation Commission approved our request for an accounting authority order that allows us to track expenses, lost revenue and any cost offsets associated with COVID-19 to be considered for recovery in our next rate cases. We have a similar request for an accounting authority order pending in Missouri. The MPSC has set a procedural schedule, and we expect a ruling by the end of the year. In June, the KCC approved an order to review our Strategic Review & Operations Committee. They also approved a joint motion filing by the company, along with the KCC staff, which aims to provide detail around certain timing and confidentiality concerns. Now that our Board has made a final determination in our process, we're working to submit a report back to the KCC in line with the requirements of the order.  
I will now turn the call over to Tony."

We reported second quarter 2020 GAAP earnings of $0.59 per share compared to $0.57 per share in the second quarter of 2019. The increase in EPS is primarily due to warmer weather, lower operation and maintenance expense and fewer shares outstanding, partially offset by the negative impacts of COVID-19 and the income tax legislation in Kansas. As Terry mentioned, effective January 1, 2021, public electric utilities in Kansas will become income tax exempt. As a result, in June, we booked $13.8 million of income tax expense from the impact of revaluation of deferred income tax assets and liabilities not recovered in rates from nonregulated operations and from the difference in the statutory tax rates recovered through rates and the consolidated income tax rate. 
While we plan to file for a change in income tax expense reflecting the rates effective January 1, 2021, the new law allows for Kansas utilities to recover in a regulatory account, any over or under collection of income tax expense as a result of a change in state or federal law.  
Moving on to adjusted non-GAAP earnings, which were $0.68 per share compared to $0.58 per share in the same period a year ago. As shown in the chart on Slide 16, adjusted EPS was driven higher, primarily due to favorable weather, lower O&M and fewer shares outstanding and was partially offset by lower weather-normalized sales, primarily due to COVID-19, which we estimate cost us about $0.08.  
Turning to weather. Compared to last year, we estimate weather favorably impacted earnings by $0.10 in the quarter. And compared to normal, we estimate earnings were helped by about $0.06.  
Moving on to Slide 18, I'll touch on year-to-date results. Year-to-date GAAP earnings were $202 million or $0.89 per share compared to $239 million or $0.96 per share in the same period last year. Adjusted earnings were $248 million or $1.09 per share compared to year-to-date 2019 adjusted earnings of $251 million or $1.01 per share. Primary drivers compared to last year include lower sales primarily due to COVID-19, which we estimate cost us about $0.09, higher depreciation expense and increase in interest expense, partially offset by lower O&M expense and fewer shares outstanding. 
Our team continues its focus on operational efficiency to lower operating costs and exceed our savings targets. In the second quarter, we reduced our adjusted O&M by $25 million and through the first half of the year by $62 million. That equates to more than a 10% reduction in adjusted operating costs for the first 6 months of operations in 2020 as compared to last year. As far as merger savings go, we remained ahead of schedule and expect to exceed our initial 2020 merger savings target. These savings were gained without sacrificing operating capabilities, and we recently announced another voluntary exit program for our employees. As for weather, compared to last year, we estimate weather was $0.02 unfavorable year-to-date and compared to normal, we estimate earnings were flat.  
On Slide 19, I'll give you some details on the sales impact from COVID-19. Commercial industrial sales declined, reached a trough in April and started to improve in May and June, all the while being partially offset by increased residential usage driven by folks staying at home. These trends are consistent with what we observed as businesses started to reopen throughout the quarter. For the second quarter and compared to the same period last year, our estimated weather-normalized total retail sales were about 7% lower, residential sales were up about 5%, while commercial and industrial sales declined 13% and 12%, respectively. We remain optimistic in terms of our local economy slowly reopening, however, it's hard for us to predict if the situation will continue to improve or take a step back depending on the future impacts of the virus.  
Moving on to Slide 20 and our latest financing activities and liquidity. As you may recall, we announced on April 2 that Evergy Kansas Central issued $500 million of 30-year first mortgage bonds at 3.54% (sic) [ 3.45% ]. Proceeds were used to redeem $250 million of 5.1% bonds that matured midyear. 
In May, Evergy Metro issued $400 million of 10-year mortgage bonds at 2.25%. This financing activity allowed us to pay down short-term debt at very attractive longer-term rates and further bolster our liquidity position. We ended June with total liquidity of approximately $2 billion and do not expect new issuances or refinancing activity throughout the remainder of the year. As Terry discussed, we were able to fund our new plan without any new equity issuances and maintaining a solid investment-grade profile.  
Now wrapping up on Slide 21. For reasons we stated on our year-end call, we did not issue any earning guidance for 2020. Accordingly, now, we're issuing 2020 GAAP EPS guidance of $2.66 to $2.86 and adjusted EPS guidance of $2.90 to $3.10. We are still expecting a decline in year-over-year weather-normalized sales, our outlook assumes a slow and steady recovery throughout the third and fourth quarter. Some of the additional drivers would include a reduction of 8% to 11% adjusted O&M expense compared to 2019, depreciation expense around $20 million to $30 million higher than last year, COLI proceeds of $20 million, and we've received roughly about $4 million through the end of June and an effective tax rate of 13% to 15%. 
I'll now turn the call back to Terry."

And if you recall, we actually supported confidential sharing of information with the staff only, but we have been talking to them along with this kind of dialogue for several weeks. And in fact, they've made it clear that they don't have a preference for a strategic versus stand-alone plan. They will evaluate both. And in general and going through the materials that have obviously been worked on by the SROC and the Board, they've made it clear that their filing was addressing -- the original filing was addressing the concerns over the public information that was in the Elliott letter and outlined their concerns there. 
We are very confident that the STP was prepared with those points in mind and that we will have them involved in what's expected to be a very good stakeholder process to discuss all these issues. We think the STP will meet each of their concerns going forward. What does the process look like? We've talked about a stakeholder process that would involve the kind of things you mentioned the regulators might want, which is long-term energy plan as a base for that conversation. But now obviously, we have the STP as well to discuss. We're excited about the opportunity that it provides us for not only additional O&M activity to drive cost, but also investment in things that will drive better reliability and more certainty for customers. And also provide us with the ability to move forward with our decarbonization efforts, and that stakeholder process will provide us with a lot of support when we go to work on regulatory and legislative support for that. 
Finally, I think your last question was bill impact. I think we believe that the bill impact will be very low. And in fact, in Kansas, in particular, less than inflation, could be slightly higher in Missouri simply because of the PISA piece of it. But it would be, again, lesser as well."

We've got a lot of positive news to discuss today, including our new sustainability transformation plan and solid second quarter results. So our new plan sets the stage for significant value creation and a strong future for Evergy and our stakeholders. We'll begin today's call with a deeper dive into the STP and its benefits, then move to the quarter and your questions. 
Turning first to Slide 4. As you know, earlier this year, the Board established a new Strategic Review & Operations Committee to evaluate and recommend ways to enhance value for our shareholders and all of the company's stakeholders. Among the options considered were a potential strategic combination and a modified improved stand-alone operating plan and strategy. Both the committee and the Board, as a whole, were well advised in these efforts with each retaining independent financial advisers and consultants to assist in the review. 
The work over the past 4 months has been extensive. The committee and our financial advisers engaged with a number of third parties who may have been interested in a combination. We also took a fresh look at each element of our operating plan, including our investment priorities, our opportunities for cost savings and operating efficiencies and how and where we allocate capital. Throughout the review, we were focused on 3 core objectives: maximizing long-term value for our shareholders; serving the best interest of all Evergy's stakeholders, including our customers, employees and communities; and continuing to advance our work to successfully create a forward-thinking, sustainable energy company.
The plan we are announcing today delivers on all of these objectives. Accordingly, the committee unanimously recommended and the Board unanimously approved pursuing our sustainability transformation plan that we are excited to announce today. 
Turning to Slide 5. Our plan creates a compelling value proposition for shareholders. Under our plan, we will meaningfully increase our earnings growth to 6% to 8% through 2024 compared to our previous guidance of 5% to 7%. This increased growth rate places Evergy in the top quartile of all U.S. electric companies. Together with our growing dividend, Evergy will have a compelling shareholder return profile. This growth will be enabled by increased capital investment as well as continued operational cost efficiencies to minimize the impact on customer rates. Under our new plan, we expect approximately $8.9 billion of capital investments through 2024 in infrastructure upgrades, grid modernization technology and clean energy initiatives across Kansas and Missouri. The incremental $1.4 billion in capital investments compared to our prior plan, which we announced in March of this year, is expected to support an estimated 5% to 6% compound annual rate base growth through 2024. 
I want to point out that there are additional opportunities related to decarbonization and renewables deployment that are not included in our STP, which could support further investment depending on outcomes from our stakeholder engagement process. This process is underway as we update our long-term energy plan. We believe these potential incremental investment opportunities are realistic and achievable, given the support for clean energy at the state and local level in Kansas and Missouri and from our customers. As you know, through the realization of the benefits associated with our prior merger, we have enhanced our planning processes that support system investment. We've also demonstrated our ability to execute on our identified cost management initiatives, with the quantity and timing of merger savings well ahead of our initial targets. This execution drives our confidence in achieving continued cost reductions and the growth outlined here under a range of scenarios. 
Slide 6 highlights the growth opportunity and our earnings and rate base that I just discussed and shows the 25% reduction in O&M expenses we expect to achieve through 2024. 
Let me discuss each of these in greater detail, starting on Slide 7. Since completing our merger, we have regularly reviewed our capital investment plans to ensure that we are investing at levels and in areas that drive the greatest benefits for our customers and the greatest value for our shareholders. Over time, we have adjusted our investment plan accordingly. The work conducted by the Strategic Review & Operations Committee helped identify additional investment opportunities across our transmission, distribution and generation infrastructure, as well as our customer-focused investments. The STP's incremental $1.4 billion of CapEx to bring the 5-year total to approximately $8.9 billion results in an estimated 5% to 6% annual rate base growth. 
Looking to Slide 8. Our capital plan is focused on additional investments to accelerate decarbonization and grid modernization, while continuing to be cost conscious, financially strong and people-first culture fundamentals that are core to Evergy's foundation. The result is greener, more reliable, affordable energy for our customers and line of sight to continued earnings growth and value creation for Evergy's shareholders. 
Over the next 5 years, we expect to invest $4.8 billion in upgrades to transmission and distribution infrastructure and customer-facing platforms to improve reliability, provide further access to renewable energy and enhance the customer experience. Our new plan also contemplates approximately $500 million of asset hardening, grid automation and technology investments through 2024 to create the grid of the future. This includes expediting the evolution to a smarter, more reliable and more efficient grid. 
Increasing our renewable footprint is a priority that we have discussed and that we had acted on. Since 2005, Evergy has retired more than 2,400 megawatts of fossil generation and added or contracted for over 4,600 megawatts of renewables, making Kansas #2 in the nation for wind generation as a percentage of total generation. Our new plan has the potential to expedite CO2 emission reductions by pursuing constructive regulatory mechanisms, economically retire coal-fired generation and expand Evergy's wind and solar footprint. Through these actions, we can drive lower fuel and purchase power costs as well as O&M savings, which help keep our customers' bills competitive in the region. While we're still targeting 80% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2050 compared to 2005 levels, under this plan, we have the potential to reduce CO2 emissions as much as 85% by 2030, a material improvement in our CO2 footprint over the next 10 years. The pace of this reduction will ultimately be defined in collaboration with stakeholders as we seek to find the most beneficial economic path forward for our customers. 
We are excited about the opportunities ahead, and we are already well on our way to meet our goals. Nearly half the power to homes and businesses we serve comes from emission-free resources. And our clean charge network includes over 1,000 EV charging station and continues to expand. 
Slide 9. Maintaining a solid financial foundation has always been front and center for us. As reviewed on Slide 9, our plan requires no equity issuances, and Evergy will continue to have a strong credit profile. Tony will review our liquidity and financial activities in greater detail in his remarks. 
When we announced our review, we affirmed our commitment to serving the best interest of all Evergy stakeholders, including Evergy's employees, customers and communities. This commitment is unwavering, and our plan delivers on it. 
Slide 11 reviews our new growth plan as contrasted against our prior expectations, including growth in our capital investments, rate base and earnings as well as continued growth in Evergy's dividend. The result is an attractive investment outlook and meaningful shareholder value creation. 
To sum up on Slide 12, we are confident in this plan and the opportunities it creates to drive significant value for our shareholders and stakeholders alike. It allows us to target top quartile shareholder returns, deliver on regulatory and merger commitments, invest in critical infrastructure and accelerate our transition to providing more affordable and cleaner energy and protect jobs while enhancing economic development opportunities. We look forward to continuing to engage with our regulators as we execute on this plan. 
Now let's turn to the quarter, where we delivered solid results, and our outlook for the year. We reported second quarter GAAP earnings of $0.59 per share compared to $0.57 a share earned in the second quarter of 2019. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.68 in the second quarter of 2020 compared to adjusted $0.58 per share in the same period a year ago. On a period-over-period basis, these results were driven by favorable weather, cost reduction efforts and lower shares outstanding, partially offset by the negative sales impact of COVID-19 and a noncash income tax adjustment due to a new Kansas law that will eliminate state income taxes for electric utilities. Also, we initiated our 2020 EPS guidance which on a GAAP basis is $2.66 to $2.86. And on an adjusted non-GAAP basis, $2.90 to $3.10. 
I'll let Tony give you more details on the outlook and drivers of this guidance. I am very proud of how our team has executed during these trying times. Delivering solid results during extenuating circumstances underscores our team's continued focus on safety, customer service and operational performance. As a response to the pandemic has evolved, we are seeing the economy starting to open up back over time. While some of our larger manufacturing companies may be working at slightly reduced output or shifts, by and large they're operating at a much higher level than in April and May. Our electric sales are down year-over-year, but we saw an increase in demand towards the end of the quarter. And I'll let Tony give you more specifics on sales. 
 
While pandemic precautions altered the legislative sessions in our states, there are 2 components of the recently passed Kansas House Bill 2585 relevant to Evergy. The first provides for special economic development rates in Kansas, similar to what is allowed in Missouri. The provision gives the KCC authority to approve rate contracts outside of the general proceeding that are based on a utility's incremental cost of service for customers that meet certain criteria. It allows for rate incentives that could attract businesses to Kansas or encourage expansion of existing customers that otherwise may not be possible. 
Second portion of the bill eliminates the Kansas state income tax for public electric utilities. This becomes effective on January 1, 2021. Both of these are very positive for our customers and our communities. In July, and in line with expectations, part 2 of the Kansas rate study was filed. Like Part 1, which was filed in January, the study provided thoughtful analysis of multiple issues impacting Kansas electric rates and how they compare to regional states. Much of the focus on the second Kansas rate study is on the competitiveness of rates, which is very much in line with the thesis underpinning our merger. The study demonstrates our strategy is working. And since closing the merger in 2018, our rates have declined at a faster pace than our neighboring states. Additionally, the study supports our investment in modernizing and expanding the transmission grid that serves Kansas, which improves electric liability, increases access to electricity generated from Kansas wind farms. 
And moving to the regulatory front, we've continued to work closely and collaboratively with our regulators to ensure we are representing all stakeholders as we adapt to dealing with the impacts of COVID-19. We suspended disconnects through mid-July, and will continue to waive late fees for our customers in both Kansas and Missouri. Additionally, with commission approval, we have introduced additional payment plans to allow businesses additional payment flexibility and to provide residential customers with extended payment plan options. Kansas Corporation Commission approved our request for an accounting authority order that allows us to track expenses, lost revenue and any cost offsets associated with COVID-19 to be considered for recovery in our next rate cases. 
We have a similar request for an accounting authority order pending in Missouri. The MPSC has set a procedural schedule, and we expect a ruling by the end of the year. In June, the KCC approved an order to review our Strategic Review & Operations Committee. They also approved a joint motion filing by the company, along with the KCC staff, which aims to provide detail around certain timing and confidentiality concerns. Now that our Board has made a final determination in our process, we're working to submit a report back to the KCC in line with the requirements of the order. 
I will now turn the call over to Tony."

We reported second quarter 2020 GAAP earnings of $0.59 per share compared to $0.57 per share in the second quarter of 2019. The increase in EPS is primarily due to warmer weather, lower operation and maintenance expense and fewer shares outstanding, partially offset by the negative impacts of COVID-19 and the income tax legislation in Kansas. As Terry mentioned, effective January 1, 2021, public electric utilities in Kansas will become income tax exempt. As a result, in June, we booked $13.8 million of income tax expense from the impact of revaluation of deferred income tax assets and liabilities not recovered in rates from nonregulated operations and from the difference in the statutory tax rates recovered through rates and the consolidated income tax rate. 
While we plan to file for a change in income tax expense reflecting the rates effective January 1, 2021, the new law allows for Kansas utilities to recover in a regulatory account, any over or under collection of income tax expense as a result of a change in state or federal law. 
Moving on to adjusted non-GAAP earnings, which were $0.68 per share compared to $0.58 per share in the same period a year ago. As shown in the chart on Slide 16, adjusted EPS was driven higher, primarily due to favorable weather, lower O&M and fewer shares outstanding and was partially offset by lower weather-normalized sales, primarily due to COVID-19, which we estimate cost us about $0.08. 
Turning to weather. Compared to last year, we estimate weather favorably impacted earnings by $0.10 in the quarter. And compared to normal, we estimate earnings were helped by about $0.06. 
Moving on to Slide 18, I'll touch on year-to-date results. Year-to-date GAAP earnings were $202 million or $0.89 per share compared to $239 million or $0.96 per share in the same period last year. Adjusted earnings were $248 million or $1.09 per share compared to year-to-date 2019 adjusted earnings of $251 million or $1.01 per share. Primary drivers compared to last year include lower sales primarily due to COVID-19, which we estimate cost us about $0.09, higher depreciation expense and increase in interest expense, partially offset by lower O&M expense and fewer shares outstanding. 
Our team continues its focus on operational efficiency to lower operating costs and exceed our savings targets. In the second quarter, we reduced our adjusted O&M by $25 million and through the first half of the year by $62 million. That equates to more than a 10% reduction in adjusted operating costs for the first 6 months of operations in 2020 as compared to last year. As far as merger savings go, we remained ahead of schedule and expect to exceed our initial 2020 merger savings target. These savings were gained without sacrificing operating capabilities, and we recently announced another voluntary exit program for our employees. As for weather, compared to last year, we estimate weather was $0.02 unfavorable year-to-date and compared to normal, we estimate earnings were flat. 
On Slide 19, I'll give you some details on the sales impact from COVID-19. Commercial industrial sales declined, reached a trough in April and started to improve in May and June, all the while being partially offset by increased residential usage driven by folks staying at home. These trends are consistent with what we observed as businesses started to reopen throughout the quarter. For the second quarter and compared to the same period last year, our estimated weather-normalized total retail sales were about 7% lower, residential sales were up about 5%, while commercial and industrial sales declined 13% and 12%, respectively. We remain optimistic in terms of our local economy slowly reopening, however, it's hard for us to predict if the situation will continue to improve or take a step back depending on the future impacts of the virus. 
Moving on to Slide 20 and our latest financing activities and liquidity. As you may recall, we announced on April 2 that Evergy Kansas Central issued $500 million of 30-year first mortgage bonds at 3.54% (sic) [ 3.45% ]. Proceeds were used to redeem $250 million of 5.1% bonds that matured midyear. 
In May, Evergy Metro issued $400 million of 10-year mortgage bonds at 2.25%. This financing activity allowed us to pay down short-term debt at very attractive longer-term rates and further bolster our liquidity position. We ended June with total liquidity of approximately $2 billion and do not expect new issuances or refinancing activity throughout the remainder of the year. As Terry discussed, we were able to fund our new plan without any new equity issuances and maintaining a solid investment-grade profile. 
Now wrapping up on Slide 21. For reasons we stated on our year-end call, we did not issue any earning guidance for 2020. Accordingly, now, we're issuing 2020 GAAP EPS guidance of $2.66 to $2.86 and adjusted EPS guidance of $2.90 to $3.10. We are still expecting a decline in year-over-year weather-normalized sales, our outlook assumes a slow and steady recovery throughout the third and fourth quarter. Some of the additional drivers would include a reduction of 8% to 11% adjusted O&M expense compared to 2019, depreciation expense around $20 million to $30 million higher than last year, COLI proceeds of $20 million, and we've received roughly about $4 million through the end of June and an effective tax rate of 13% to 15%. 
I'll now turn the call back to Terry."

And if you recall, we actually supported confidential sharing of information with the staff only, but we have been talking to them along with this kind of dialogue for several weeks. And in fact, they've made it clear that they don't have a preference for a strategic versus stand-alone plan. They will evaluate both. And in general and going through the materials that have obviously been worked on by the SROC and the Board, they've made it clear that their filing was addressing -- the original filing was addressing the concerns over the public information that was in the Elliott letter and outlined their concerns there. 
We are very confident that the STP was prepared with those points in mind and that we will have them involved in what's expected to be a very good stakeholder process to discuss all these issues. We think the STP will meet each of their concerns going forward. What does the process look like? We've talked about a stakeholder process that would involve the kind of things you mentioned the regulators might want, which is long-term energy plan as a base for that conversation. But now obviously, we have the STP as well to discuss. We're excited about the opportunity that it provides us for not only additional O&M activity to drive cost, but also investment in things that will drive better reliability and more certainty for customers. And also provide us with the ability to move forward with our decarbonization efforts, and that stakeholder process will provide us with a lot of support when we go to work on regulatory and legislative support for that. 
Finally, I think your last question was bill impact. I think we believe that the bill impact will be very low. And in fact, in Kansas, in particular, less than inflation, could be slightly higher in Missouri simply because of the PISA piece of it. But it would be, again, lesser as well."

So I know I've given you more than a several, but they all had to fit together. And I think that's what the key, is that the work was, how do we bring those together and do it in a fashion which improves upon our ability to invest our growth rate but yet doesn't raise rates for customers, as I said, above inflation in Kansas, takes advantage of PISA, which was there as an avenue that Missouri supports and then when you put all that together, to be able to see how that might compare to other options. And we were very confident that this STP is absolutely the better option in front of us today for long-term shareholder value."

I'll begin my comments on Slide 5. So today, we reported third quarter GAAP earnings of $1.60 per share compared to $1.56 per share earned in the third quarter of 2019. Adjusted earnings per share were $1.73 in t",1588,"Thanks, Lori, and good morning, everybody. I'll begin my comments on Slide 5. So today, we reported third quarter GAAP earnings of $1.60 per share compared to $1.56 per share earned in the third quarter of 2019. Adjusted earnings per share were $1.73 in the third quarter 2020 compared to $1.57 in the same period a year ago. 
Third quarter results were driven by significant cost reductions an increase in weather-normalized demand and fewer shares outstanding, partially offset by unfavorable weather. Year-to-date, GAAP earnings per share were $2.49 and in line with $2.49 in the same period last year. Adjusted EPS were $2.82 this year compared to $2.55 a year ago. Throughout the year, we've managed cost to withstand a number of headwinds, including the impact of the global pandemic, unfavorable weather and less than planned COLI proceeds. Our solid execution has resulted in our ability to deliver a great quarter and gives us confidence in the outlook for the year. Reflecting our strong performance, we are narrowing our 2020 adjusted EPS guidance range to $2.95 to $3.1 by raising the low end. 
Additionally, dividends are an important part of our total return story. You can see from our press release, the Board increased the dividend 6%, which underscores their confidence in our execution of the sustainability transformation plan or what we refer to as STP. Again, this is a great quarter, and I commend our team for the outstanding execution in these tough times. 
In addition to the over 3,000 dedicated employees in our frontline operations, power plants and other areas, we continue to have over 2,000 employees working remotely and will continue to do so into 2021. I'm proud of the resiliency and adaptability our team has displayed in dealing with the challenges brought forth by this pandemic. 
Before I update you on our STP process, let me touch on the CEO search process. After announcing my retirement in August, our Board formed a CEO search committee to find the right leader to execute our STP. The search committee is currently interviewing quality internal and external candidates and just know that the process is ongoing, and we still expect to have someone named by the end of the year. 
Now turning to Slide 6. As we have discussed before, the strategic review and operations committee and our entire Board evaluated our new high-performance STP against other strategic alternatives available. The results were unequivocally and unanimously clear that our higher performance STP was the most valuable plan. It enhances value through infrastructure investment, cost reductions, while balancing the interest of customers, shareholders and communities. Our STP is focused on 3 core objectives: maximizing long-term value for our shareholders, serving the best interest of our customers, employees and communities; and continuing to advance our progress as a forward-thinking, sustainable energy company. Consistent with these objectives, our team has already began execution on these priorities set out in the STP. 
Our operations planning team has a clear line of sight into our incremental 2021 grid modernization plans, which include new projects that will develop a more flexible grid to enhance customer reliability. Our increased focus on substation and grid communication upgrades will overhaul aged equipment with modern technology and controls that will benefit our customers and communities for years to come. 
We've also invested considerable time and effort into robust stakeholder engagement to ensure our constituents fully understand the STP. Some of this engagement has taken place within the structured IRP process. We've also been working with stakeholders outside of the IRP framework by developing a schedule for STP workshops to educate and gather feedback from our regulatory commissioners and our important stakeholders. 
Additionally, we have been identifying metrics that we plan to use to track our success executing the STP. There are relevant indicators around cost reductions, including both nonfuel and fuel as well as tracking infrastructure investments of our category that we will periodically update you on throughout the year. We will use these and potentially other metrics as we pursue highly strategic, value-focused approach to display a transparent track record of execution, accountability and results. 
Now looking at Slide 7. Part of the vision within the STP is advocating for enabling energy policies that promote reliable and clean energy within our states. While the legislative sessions won't kick off until after the first of the year, that hasn't slowed us down from engaging with interested parties on potential legislation. Through this dialogue, our confidence has grown in the clear desire across a diverse stakeholder base to enact long-term energy policies that will move Kansas and Missouri forward. Or there are many solutions to deal with, remaining net investment in fossil plants being considered for retirement, securitization is one that can be more economical for customers. As a result, securitization is a topic that has come up in both states, and we will be discussed in the 2021 sessions. 
Robust stakeholder engagement process around our upcoming IRPs is also well underway. While these discussions are not public, the feedback we've been receiving has been constructive. We'll continue to meet with the parties in these dockets over the coming months to discuss modeling scenarios and get feedback on preferred plans. We will file the Missouri RFP by April 1 next year. And the Kansas or by July 1 next year. 
I'll now move to the regulatory front, beginning with an update on the KCC docket related to concerns about our agreement with Elliott management. The commission ordered this docket be closed, affirming that we had met all of our obligations in that docket, and any remaining issues be handled in the KCC's STP docket. Kansas STP review docket parties met throughout October to discuss scheduled proposals, and we expect a filing soon to propose a jointly developed procedural schedule to the commission. It's likely the docket will extend into the middle of next year to allow for full stakeholder feedback. 
Turning to Missouri. In October, the MPSC staff requested commission and the commission granted an extension for their STP report to January 29, 2021. This allows staff more time to study our plan and receive any updates or further develop details that could be meaningful to the report. As a reminder, we don't expect the commission to take specific action regarding the STP in either of those dockets. Main purpose is to gather information on and review our STP and ensure our continued resolve in meeting previous merger commitments while providing a forum and repository for stakeholder feedback. 
Lastly, let me touch on our COVID-19 accounting authority order request. In Kansas, the commission approved our request to track expenses and lost revenue associated with COVID 19. In Missouri, we reached a nonunanimous settlement with the MPSC staff and many other intervenors last month, which requests the commission issue an order that authorizes us to track and defer incremental costs caused by the pandemic. Hearings on the matter are scheduled for mid-November, and we expect a commission order in January. 
We realize this has been a hard time for our customers and communities. Last month, we wrapped up our hometown economic recovery program, which awarded grants totaling $800,000 to nonprofit agencies. The goal of this program is to help our communities build back their local economies by retaining and attracting new business, developing workforces and supporting small businesses. This was all part of our largest to-date focused charity investment, which we announced in May and committed $2.2 million from our foundation to help agencies, customers and communities respond to and recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Let me wrap up on Slide 8 before handing it over to Tony. RSPP creates a compelling value proposition for shareholders and is predicated upon a proven track record of achieving cost reductions and executing on infrastructure investment, both of which provide tremendous value to customers while keeping rates affordable. Our capital plan is traditional, straightforward infrastructure investment strategy that is diverse across our service territories without large project risk. Combination of our competitive targeted 6% to 8% EPS CAGR through 2024 and an attractive dividend growth profile offers a compelling value proposition. The STP focuses on not only grid modernization, but also accelerating the transition of our generation portfolio, resulting in greener, more reliable, affordable energy for our customers and line of sight to continued earnings growth and value creation for Evergy's shareholders. While we already provide carbon-free energy equivalent to around 50% of our retail energy demand, our remaining coal fleet provides a significant opportunity to further decarbonize and enhance our environmental profile. The policy enablers we're pushing -- pursuing would allow us to leverage the remaining plant value of our coal fleet to reduce capital costs and upon retirement, eliminate fuel and maintenance expense. This will allow us to add modern generation capacity with renewable investment over time. These circumstances, when paired with our prime geographic location, where attractive wind and solar potential make us uniquely positioned to execute a decarbonization strategy that would create significant cost savings for customers. We have an exciting opportunity in front of us. And that is a true win-win scenario to keep rates competitive while growing sustainable rate base that will be value-enhancing for our customers, communities and shareholders. 
Our execution has produced another strong quarter and great results year to date. We're very excited about the momentum of our plan and the long-term prospects to deliver significant value to customers and attractive returns for our shareholders. 
I'll now turn the call over to Tony."

I'll start with Slide 10. We reported third quarter 2020 GAAP earnings of $1.60 per share compared to $1.56 per share in the third quarter of 2019. Adjusted non-GAAP earnings increased $0.16 to $1.73 per share co",1358,"Thanks, Terry, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with Slide 10. We reported third quarter 2020 GAAP earnings of $1.60 per share compared to $1.56 per share in the third quarter of 2019. Adjusted non-GAAP earnings increased $0.16 to $1.73 per share compared to $1.57 per share in the same period a year ago. As shown in the chart on Slide 10, EPS was driven higher primarily due to lower O&M expense and fewer shares outstanding, partially offset by lower gross margin, driven by unfavorable weather. For the $0.10 of other margin, we estimate about half of that is due to increase in weather-normalized demand with positive residential demand being partially offset by lower commercial and industrial demand. Additionally, there's another $0.02 from our energy efficiency programs. The $0.04 of other for the quarter is primarily due to the timing of when income tax benefits for tax credits and other tax items are recognized. Turning to weather. Compared to last year normal, we estimate weather-reduced earnings by $0.17 and $0.08, respectively. 
Now on Slide 11, I'll touch on year-to-date results. Year-to-date net earnings were $567 million or $2.49 per share compared to $606 million or $2.49 per share for the same period last year. Adjusted earnings were $642 million or $2.82 per share compared to year-to-date 2019 adjusted earnings of $621 million or $2.55 per share. Primary drivers compared to last year include our significant cost reduction efforts and fewer shares outstanding, partially offset by lower sales primarily due to unfavorable weather, higher depreciation expense and an increase in interest expense. 
In the third quarter, we reduced our adjusted O&M by $41 million and year-to-date by $103 million. Some of the cost savings we experienced year-to-date relate to the prudent deferral of planned outages from early in the year to the fourth quarter as we monitor the impacts of the pandemic. Additionally, we sent some of our employees and contractors to help other utilities deal with storms, which has resulted in being a little behind in our tree trimming and line maintenance versus our plan. We will do some catch-up work on these items in the fourth quarter. And as a result, while we plan to hit our 2020 O&M target spend levels, we also expect less favorability in O&M in the fourth quarter compared to last year. We continue to see the industrial logic of our merger coming to fruition and by the end of this year, we expect to surpass $300 million of cumulative net merger savings. The efficiencies are being realized across the business units through attrition, voluntary exit programs, leveraging the size and scale of our business and implementing technology solutions. Turning to weather. We estimate weather year-to-date through the third quarter has been $0.18 unfavorable compared to last year and around $0.08 unfavorable when compared to normal. 
On Slide 12, let me update you on trends we're seeing with COVID-19 sales impacts. As we stated on our second quarter call, commercial and industrial sales declined significantly during April when businesses were shut down and improved in May and June as the economy opened. At the time, we were expecting a slow and steady recovery through the remainder of the year. And fortunately, that's exactly what we've experienced throughout the summer. We're still seeing commercial and industrial sales -- we're still seeing lower commercial industrial sales, but there was an encouraging trend throughout the quarter as we continue to experience elevated residential sales that mostly offset C&I degradation. It's hard to see how this trend will play out for the remainder of the year, but many schools implementing a hybrid approach and folks continuing to work from home absent a wide spread shutdown of businesses, we could continue to see residential sales help offset the lower C&I sales. Even though we've seen waves of the virus, our state and local economies have been fairly resilient thus far. 
For the third quarter, our estimated weather-normalized total retail sales were up about 1% compared to the same period last year. Residential sales were up roughly 7%, while commercial and industrial sales both declined about 3%. We remain optimistic -- realize there are still many unknowns with the coronavirus, particularly whether there will be further impact during the overlap of the flu season, wrapping up with an outlook for the remainder of this year and into next year. 
As you can see on Slide 13, we've updated some of our earnings drivers in addition to narrowing our EPS guidance range by raising the low end. Absent a large setback with COVID-19, we're expecting to continue to see a slow and steady recovery through the end of the year. As I mentioned previously, we expect to incur some of the costs that were deferred from earlier this year. And with that in mind, we expect cost savings to be less of a driver for the fourth quarter and we've narrowed our annual adjusted O&M target to 8% to 10% lower than 2019. 
Our guidance includes $20 million of COLI proceeds, and it's worth pointing out that we had only received $4 million through the end of October. Our forecasted annual effective tax rate remains at 13% to 15%. I will note that our effective tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2019 was extremely low due to the amortization of excess deferred income taxes and a return to a rate closer to our 2020 guidance range is something to consider for this year. 
Moving to Slide 14, with 2021 considerations and preliminary drivers. Absent resurgence of COVID '19, we expect weather-normalized sales growth in 2021 compared to 2020. And we'll continue to monitor the lingering impacts of COVID-19 to the winter months to form more specific annual guidance for 2021. And we have significantly reduced non-fuel O&M over the last 2 years, and we expect to maintain momentum as we begin implementing the STP-identified savings. Our original merger savings plans were outlined through 2022, and as we layered on incremental savings opportunities through our STP work, we then find extended these efforts through 2024. As part of the STP, our team has created charters to detail these savings opportunities, and we are viewing 2021 as a year to implement newly identified STP savings initiatives. We are confident in our ability to remain on plan for cost reductions in 2021 to reaffirm our long-term target of reducing nonfuel O&M by $210 million from 2019 through 2024. 
We expect capital deployment increases by around $150 million with all the year-over-year growth coming from transmission and distribution segment. We plan to spend over $400 million more in T&D, while our investment in the generation, general and other segments will be reduced by around $280 million. The identified additional FERC investment will be reflected in our 2021 formula rate update, which we currently estimate will increase transmission revenue requirement by around $30 million. Obviously, as expected with a larger capital plan in 2021, we expect to see higher depreciation expense of around $30 million to $35 million, even when considering the favorable depreciation treatment for PISA qualified projects in Missouri. Now college programs are difficult to predict. We expect to include a place hold over 2021 and is aligned with our current 2020 guidance. 
Lastly, we're forecasting an effective tax rate in 11% to 13% range. The effective tax rate will be driven from the lower state income tax exemption for electric utilities in Kansas, starting in 2021, which will be offset with lower retail revenues as the savings is passed through to customers. We remain confident in our target of long-term 6% to 8% EPS CAGR. And as we've mentioned previously, in the early years, including 2021, earnings are expected to be towards the bottom end of our range. We are very confident in our ability to deploy capital, finance that capital and stay on track for the long-term cost reduction targets. The pandemic does create some lingering uncertainty with sales. So we continue to monitor trends and plan to issue formal EPS guidance and updated drivers on our year-end call in February. 
I'll now turn the call back to Terry."

I'll begin my comments on Slide 5. So today, we reported third quarter GAAP earnings of $1.60 per share compared to $1.56 per share earned in the third quarter of 2019. Adjustes earnings per share were $1.73 in t",1595,"Thanks, Lori, and good morning, everybody. I'll begin my comments on Slide 5. So today, we reported third quarter GAAP earnings of $1.60 per share compared to $1.56 per share earned in the third quarter of 2019. Adjustes earnings per share were $1.73 in the third quarter of 2020 compared 
to a $1.57 in the same period a year ago.
Third quarter results were driven by significant cost reductions, an increase in weather normalize demand and fewer shares outstanding, partially offset by unfavorable weather. Year-to-date, GAAP earnings per share were $2.49 and in line with $2.49 in the same period last year. 
Adjusted EPS were $2.82 this year compared to $2.55 a year ago. Throughout the year, we've managed cost to withstand a number of headwinds, including the impact of the global pandemic, unfavorable weather and less than planned COLI proceeds. Our solid execution has resulted in our ability to deliver a great quarter and gives us confidence in the outlook for the year. Reflecting our strong performance, we are narrowing our 2020 adjusted EPS guidance range to $2.95 to $3.10 by raising the low end. 
Additionally, dividends are an important part of our total return story. You can see from our press release, the Board increased the dividend 6%, which underscores their confidence and our execution of the sustainability transformation plan or what we refer to as STP. Again, this is a great quarter, and I commend our team for the outstanding execution in these tough times. In addition to the over 3,000 dedicated employees and our frontline operations, power plants and other areas, we continue to have over 2,000 employees working remotely and will continue to do so into 2021. I'm proud of the resiliency and adaptability our team has displayed in dealing with the challenges brought forth by this pandemic. 
Before I update you on our STP process, let me touch on the CEO search process. After announcing my retirement in August, our Board formed a CEO search committee to find the right leader to execute our STP. The Search committee is currently interviewing quality internal and external candidates and just know that the process is ongoing, and we still expect to have someone named by the end of the year. 
Now turning to Slide 6. As we have discussed before, the strategic review and operations committee and our entire Board evaluated our new higher performance STP against other strategic alternatives available. The results were unequivocally and unanimously clear that our high-performance STP was the most valuable plan. It enhances value through infrastructure investment, cost reductions, while balancing the interest of customers, shareholders and communities. Our STP is focused on 3 core objectives: maximizing long-term value for our shareholders; serving the best interest of our customers, employees and communities; and continuing to advance our progress as a forward-thinking, sustainable energy company. Consistent with these objectives, our team has already began execution on these priorities set out in the STP.
Our operations planning team is a clear line of sight into our incremental 2021 grid modernization plans, which include new projects that will develop a more flexible grid to enhance customer reliability. Our increased focus on substation and grid communication upgrades will overhaul aged equipment with modern technology and controls that will benefit our customers and communities for years to come. We've also invested considerable time and effort into robust stakeholder engagement to ensure our constituents fully understand the STP. Some of this engagement has taken place within the structured IRP process. We've also been working with stakeholders outside of the IRP framework by developing a schedule for STP workshops to educate and gather feedback from our regulatory commissioners and our important stakeholders. 
Additionally, we have been identifying metrics that we plan to use to track our success executing the STP. There are relevant indicators around cost reductions, including both nonfuel and fuel as well as tracking infrastructure investments by category that we will periodically update you on throughout the year. We will use these potentially other metrics as we pursue highly strategic, value-focused approach to display a transparent track record of execution, accountability and results.
Now looking at Slide 7. Part of the vision within the STP is advocating for enabling energy policies that promote reliable and clean energy within our states. While the legislative sessions won't kick off until after the first of the year, that hasn't slowed us down from engaging with interested parties on potential legislation. Through this dialogue, our confidence has grown in the clear desire across a diverse stakeholder base to enact long-term energy policies that will move Kansas and Missouri forward. While there are many solutions to deal with, remaining net investment in fossil plants being considered for retirement, securitization is one that can be more economical for customers. As a result, securitization is a topic that has come up in both states, and will be discussed in the 2021 one sessions. Robust stakeholder engagement process around our upcoming IRPs is also well underway. While these discussions are not public, the feedback we've been receiving has been constructed. We'll continue to meet with the parties in these dockets over the coming months to discuss modeling scenarios and get feedback on preferred plans. We will file the Missouri IRP by April 1 of next year. And the Kansas IRP by July 1 of next year. 
I'll now move to the regulatory front, beginning with an update on the KCC docket related to concerns about our agreement with Elliott Management. The commission ordered this docket be closed, affirming that we had met all of our obligations in that docket, and any remaining issues be handled in the KCC's STP docket. Kansa's STP review docket parties met throughout October to discuss schedule proposals, and we expect the filing soon to propose a jointly developed procedural schedule to the commission. It's likely the docket will extend into the middle of next year to allow how for full stakeholder feedback. 
Turning to Missouri. In October, the MPSC staff requested commission and the commission granted, an extension for their STP report to January 29, 2021. This allows staff more time to study our plan and receive any updates or further develop details that could be meaningful to the report. As a reminder, we don't expect the commission to take specific action regarding STP in either of those dockets. Main purpose is to gather other information on and review our STP and ensure our continued resolve in meeting previous merger commitments while providing a forum and repository for stakeholder feedback. 
Lastly, let me touch on our COVID-19 accounting authority order request. In Kansas, the commission approved our request to track expenses and lost revenue associated with COVID 19. In Missouri, we reached a nonunanimous settlement with the MPSC staff and many other intervenors last month, which request the commission issue an order that authorizes us to track and defer incremental costs caused by the pandemic. Hearings on the matter are scheduled for mid-November, and we expect the commission order in January. We realize this has been a hard time for our customers and communities. Last month, we wrapped up our hometown economic recovery program, which awarded grants totaling $800,000 to nonprofit agencies. The goal of this program is to help our communities build back their local economies by retaining and attracting new business, developing workforces and supporting small businesses. This was all part of our largest to date focused charity investment which we announced in May and committed $2.2 million from our foundation to help agencies, customers and communities respond to and recover from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Let me wrap up on Slide 8 before handing it over to Tony. Our STP creates a compelling value proposition for shareholders and is predicated upon a proven track record of achieving cost reductions and executing on infrastructure investment, both of which provide tremendous value to customers while keeping rates affordable. Our capital plan is traditional, straightforward infrastructure investment strategy that is diverse across our service territories without large project risk. Combination of our competitive targeted 6% to 8% EPS CAGR through 2024, and an attractive dividend growth profile offers a compelling value proposition. The STP focuses on not only grid modernization, but also accelerating the transition of our generation portfolio. Resulting in greener, more reliable, affordable energy for our customers and line of sight to continued earnings mix growth and value creation for Evergy's shareholders. 
While we already provide carbon-free energy equivalent to around 50% of our retail energy demand, our remaining coal fleet provides a significant opportunity to further decarbonize and enhance our environmental profile. The policy enablers we're pushing -- pursuing would allow us to leverage the remaining plant value of our coal fleet to reduce capital cost and upon retirement, eliminate fuel and maintenance expense. This will allows us to add modern generation capacity with renewable investment over time. These circumstances, when paired with our prime geographic location, your attractive wind and solar potential make us uniquely positioned to execute a decarbonization strategy that would create significant cost savings for customers. We have an exciting opportunity in front of us. And that is a true win-win scenario to keep rates competitive while growing sustainable rate base that will be value-enhancing for our customers, communities and shareholders. 
Our execution has produced another strong quarter and great results year to date. We're very excited about the momentum of our plan and the long-term prospects to deliver significant value to customers and attractive returns for our shareholders. I'll now turn the call over to Tony."
283024,691996896,2130495,"Evergy, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Nov 05, 2020",2020-11-05,"Earnings Calls","Evergy, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Terry, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with Slide 10. We reported third quarter 2020 GAAP earnings of $1.60 per share compared to $1.56 per share in the third quarter of 2019. Adjusted non-GAAP earnings increased $0.16 to $1.73 per share co",1359,"Thanks, Terry, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with Slide 10. We reported third quarter 2020 GAAP earnings of $1.60 per share compared to $1.56 per share in the third quarter of 2019. Adjusted non-GAAP earnings increased $0.16 to $1.73 per share compared to $1.57 per share in the same period a year ago. As shown in the chart on Slide 10, EPS was driven higher, primarily due to lower O&M expense and fewer shares outstanding, partially offset by lower gross margin, driven by unfavorable weather. For the $0.10 of other margin, we estimate about half of that is due to increase in weather-normalized demand with positive residential demand being partially offset by lower commercial and industrial demand. Additionally, there's another $0.02 from our energy efficiency programs. The $0.04 of other for the quarter is primarily due to the timing of when income tax benefits for tax credits and other tax items are recognized. Turning to weather, compared to last year normal, we estimate weather-reduced earnings by $0.17 and $0.08, respectively. 
Now on Slide 11, I'll touch on year-to-date results. Year-to-date GAAP earnings were $567 million or $2.49 per share compared to $606 million or $2.49 per share for the same period last year. Adjusted earnings were $642 million or $2.82 per share compared to year-to-date 2019 adjusted earnings of $621 million or $2.55 per share. Primary drivers compared to last year include our significant cost reduction efforts and fewer shares outstanding, partially offset by lower sales, primarily due to unfavorable weather, higher depreciation expense and an increase in interest expense. In the third quarter, we reduced our adjusted O&M by $41 million and year-to-date by $103 million. Some of the cost savings we experienced year-to-date relate to the prudent deferral of planned outages from early in the year to the fourth quarter as we monitor the impacts of the pandemic. Additionally, we sent some of our employees and contractors to help other utilities to deal with storms, which has resulted in being a little behind in our tree trimming and line maintenance versus our plan. We will do some catch-up work on these items in the fourth quarter. And as a result, while we plan to hit our 2020 O&M target spend levels, we also expect less favorability in O&M in the fourth quarter compared to last year. We continue to see the industrial logic of our merger coming to fruition and by the end of this year, we expect to surpass $300 million of cumulative net merger savings. Efficiencies are being realized across the business units through attrition, voluntary exit programs, leveraging the size and scale of our business and implementing technology solutions. Turning to weather. We estimate weather year-to-date through the third quarter has been $0.18 unfavorable compared to last year and around $0.08 unfavorable when compared to normal.
 On Slide 12, let me update you on trends we're seeing with COVID-19 sales impacts. As we stated in our second quarter call, commercial and industrial sales declined significantly during April when businesses were shut down and improved in May and June as the economy opened. At the time, we were expecting a slow and steady recovery through the remainder of the year. And fortunately, that's exactly what we've experienced throughout the summer. We're still seeing commercial and industrial sales -- we're still seeing lower commercial industrial sales, but there was an encouraging trend throughout the quarter as we continue to experience elevated residential sales that modestly offset C&I degradation. It's hard to see how this trend will play out for the remainder of the year. With many schools implementing a hybrid approach and folks continue to work from home, absent a wide spread shutdown of businesses, we could continue to see residential sales help offset the lower C&I sales. Even though we've seen waves of the virus, our state and local economies have been fairly resilient thus far. 
For the third quarter, our estimated weather-normalized total retail sales were up about 1% compared to the same period last year. Residential sales were up roughly 7%, while commercial and industrial sales both declined about 3%. We remain optimistic to realize there are still many unknowns with the coronavirus, particularly whether there will be further impact during the overlap of the flu season. 
Wrapping up with an outlook for the remainder of this year and into next year. As you can see on Slide 13, we've updated some of our earnings drivers in addition to narrowing our EPS guidance range by raising the low end. Absent large setback of COVID-19, we're expecting to continue to see a slow and steady recovery through the end of the year. As I mentioned previously, we expect to incur some of the costs that were deferred from earlier this year and with that in mind, we expect cost savings to be less of a driver for the fourth quarter, and we've narrowed our annual adjusted O&M target to 8% to 10% lower than 2019. Our guidance includes $20 million of COLI proceeds. And it's worth pointing out that we had only received $4 million through the end of October. Our forecasted annual effective tax rate remains at 13% to 15%. I will note that our effective tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2019 was extremely low due to the amortization of excess deferred income taxes and a return to a rate closer to our 2020 guidance range is something to consider for this year. 
Moving to Slide 14 with 2021 considerations and preliminary drivers. After resurgence of COVID-19, we expect weather-normalized sales growth in 2021 compared to 2020. And we'll continue to monitor the lingering impacts of COVID-19 through the winter months and form more specific annual guidance for 2021.
We have significantly reduced nonfuel O&M over the last 2 years, and we expect to maintain momentum as we begin implementing the STP-identified savings. Our original merger savings plans were outlined through 2022 as we layered on incremental savings opportunities through our STP work, we identified and extended these efforts through 2024. As part of the STP, our team has created charters to detail these savings opportunities, and we are viewing 2021 as a year to implement newly identified STP savings initiatives. We are confident in our ability to remain on plan for cost reductions in 2021 to reaffirm our long-term target of reducing nonfuel O&M by $210 million from 2019 through 2024. 
We expect capital deployment increases by around $150 million with all the year-over-year growth coming from transmission and distribution segment. We plan to spend over $400 million more in T&D, while our investment in the generation, general and other segments will be reduced by around $280 million. The identified additional FERC investment will be reflected in our 2021 formula rate update which we currently estimate will increase transmission revenue requirement by around $30 million. Obviously, as expected with a larger capital plan in 2021, we expect to see higher depreciation expense of around $30 million to $35 million, even when considering the favorable depreciation treatment for PISA qualified projects in Missouri. Now COLI programs are difficult to predict. We expect to include a place hold over 2021 that is in line with our current 2020 guidance. 
Lastly, we're forecasting an effective tax rate in 11% to 13% range. The effective tax rate will be driven from lower -- from the lower state income tax exemption for electric utilities in Kansas starting in 2021, which will be offset with lower retail revenues as the savings is passed through to customers. We remain confident in our target of long-term 6% to 8% EPS CAGR. And as we've mentioned previously, in the early years, including 2021, earnings are expected to be towards the bottom end of our range. We are very confident in our ability to deploy capital, finance that capital and stay on track with for the long-term cost reduction targets. The pandemic does create some lingering uncertainty with sales. So we continue to monitor trends and plan to issue formal EPS guidance and updated drivers on our year-end call in February. 
I'll now turn the call back to Terry."

We didn't have a process, and our announcement didn't require approvals. That's no different here. But obviously, as a result of all that, we sit in a process where we have the ability, both through the IRP and the STP, to get inputs and then IRP requires a filing. To your point, there won't be a prudency [indiscernible] or a prudency finding in the STP. We don't have any large projects that would require that kind of pre-approval. What we do think, though, to your point is that we will be able to see people's views of the plan as a whole and kind of how that works in the context, again, of cost to our customers. And we think that's a benefit. But we wouldn't see -- we don't believe any kind of pre-approval or prudency determination on the plan given the way it's structured."
